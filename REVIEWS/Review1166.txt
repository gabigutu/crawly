		<shortDescription>A Big Scare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that I consider myself to be a lover of horror, but much too often, sex and gore is subsituted for real horror and you don't get that feeling of genuine fear in the pit of your stomach. Not so with "The Ring". Never have I seen a film that has affected me so. The images seem to tug at your subconscious, at the dark things we keep inside. I haven't been able to close my eyes without replaying bits of the film behind my eyelids. I have slept with the light on since I've seen it, and we can't stop talking about it. Hands down, it was the best, the scariest, the creepiest, and the most intense horror film ever. The audience in the theater all gripped their armrests, breathed heavily and felt everything the characters were experiencing. It was excellent! But beware.... don't expect to leave "The Ring" in the movie theater, it will certainly be with you for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie makes you realize why so many other movies fail to be scary...not enough psychological elements. What this movie does right is that it skips the gore, and blood, and over-the-top overacting crazed lunatics that seem the norm in horror movies.I saw this with a friend in the theater and 10 minutes in we were sinking into our chairs with fear. Not even the annoying teens making their phones ring to scare their friends (when you see the movie you will understand why) were a powerful enough distraction to undo the terror we felt.Definitely see it, make sure you have as big a TV as you can get your hands on when you rent it, and that you watch it at night in the dark...if you want the full effect. Also, make sure you rent it on DVD and NOT cassette...you know, just to be safe ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ring it on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know there will be some misguided souls who stumble into a showing of THE RING believing that it's either a film of Richard Wagner's famous operatic cycle, or has something to do with Hobbits. Needless to say, they will be in for a surprise.Gore Verbinski's THE RING, based on an extremely popular Japanese film and novel, is a creepy and disturbing thriller that may do for VCRs what JAWS did for the ocean. After watching a recent sneak preview, I couldn't help but imagine people all across the nation going home and throwing out their videocassettes and players, in fear that they might accidentally watch the tape that's at the center of this movie.The fast-paced suspense film begins in Seattle with an urban legend-type set up: two high school girls - Katie and Becca - are alone in Katie's home at night. Conversation turns to a videotape that has a horrifying effect. Moments after you watch it, the phone rings, and a voice tells you, "Seven days." And exactly a week later, you die. Katie reveals to her friend that she watched that tape at a cabin in the woods, seven days before. In a brilliantly edited sequence that is sure to make you drop your popcorn, Katie meets her fate, and we learn that the tale of the tape is no mere kids' story.Katie's aunt, a newspaper reporter named Rachel (Naomi Watts), is asked by her sister Ruth (Lindsay Frost) to investigate the death, and she soon finds herself drawn into a world that's as dark and claustrophobic as the grave. Pulled in with her are former boyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson), and their son Aidan (David Dorfman).We see the tape in question early on, and at first it appears to be just a random series of weird images - a ring of light that looks like a solar eclipse, dead horses floating in water, a woman leaping from a cliff, a fly buzzing, a stone wall that encloses a well - playing out like a home movie made by David Lynch and Luis Bu?uel. As the film progresses, however, we learn that the eerie black-and-white vignettes are clues to who made the tape and why. I'd hate to give away too much, so I'll just say that the answer takes Noah and Rachel to an island where a horse breeder (marvelously played by Brian Cox, the original and best Hannibal Lecter) seems to be hiding a secret that's by turns sad, and horrifying.The acting in THE RING is fabulous throughout, with the actors stretching well beyond the caricatures all-too-often found in horror films and creating realistic, intriguing people. I've met and interviewed Naomi, and yes, she really is that beautiful and charming in person, and here she proves once again that she's an outstanding actress. Martin Henderson, another actor from Down Under, is perfect as a videographer turned reluctant action hero, and young David Dorfman and Daveigh Chase are scary-good. Amber Tamblyn (daughter of multitalented actor/singer/dancer Russ Tamblyn) and the engaging Rachael Bella do a wonderful job of starting the movie off with a scream, Lindsay Frost shines in a small but important role, and Jane Alexander (an actor's actor) is fun to watch as a doctor who knows more than she wants to. The direction is crisp, stylish, and sure-handed (hard to believe that this is the same guy who helmed MOUSE TRAP and THE MEXICAN). Even the lighting and sound are beautifully worked out; those elements make a sequence with a horse on a ferry especially chilling. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack hits all the right notes, and the screenplay is smart, original, and pulls no punches. It's worth noting that unlike most modern horror films, you won't see people terrorized with knives or other conventional weapons, and there's very little actual gore. What you do see, however, as well as what's implied, may give you the worst case of the creeps you've ever had. I'm sure that some purists who've seen the original Japanese film (which spawned sequels and a TV series) will pick apart this version, but, for my money, this is one case where the remake of a foreign film can stand on its own merits.If you love being scared, grab a hold of Verbinski's THE RING and hang on for the ride of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as the original, and better than most</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm just as much a fan of gory, splatterhouse exploitation films as the next sicko, but when it comes to generating a chill down the spine, there is something to be said for being as terse as possible with onscreen imagery. This is one of the chief reasons why The Ring--a film with a PG-13 rating--is so successful in its ability to leave an audience with goosebumps and nightmares.The film is a remake of the 1998 Japanese film Ringu, itself widely considered a terrifying piece of cinema, and aside from a subplot about horses, the American version is very faithful to the original.Now, being that The Ring is a remake, one may be tempted to dismiss the power of the story and script as unoriginal. But as other films have demonstrated time and time again, a remake, no matter how good the source material, can just as easily fall flat on its face ("The Haunting", "Psycho", etc.). So it's a joy to see that this remake stands out as one of the better films of the year despite emerging from the shadow of a great and recent original.The Ring follows journalist Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the mysterious death of her niece (revealed in the gripping opening sequence). At the wake for her niece, she overhears some friends discussing the videotape that the niece and her boyfriend watched the week before their death. Given their cryptic description of the tape and the fact that the boyfriend died across town at the same time as the niece, Keller decides to track down the tape for herself and watch it for clues.She then begins to experience a number of strange coincidences, as she sees objects from the video appear in her every day life. When her friend and son watch the video as well and begin to see similar objects, she begins to realize that the stories about the tape may be real. She is then led to a small island off the coast to search for an answer on where the tape came from and why it has the effect that it does.Whomever it was that composed the actual videotape for this film (and the audience does get to see the whole thing) clearly did a great deal of research on disturbing imagery. It's grainy, monochromatic and at times bordering on silly, but by the time it is shown you have become immersed in the story and it works; the images truly get under your skin.For fans of subtle, atmospheric and extremely creepy movies, especially around this time of year, The Ring is a dead-on success. The brilliantly understated story moves swiftly, is told beautifully, and enough questions are left unanswered to maximize the mystery of it all, yet not so many that the plot is left full of holes. The music is sparse and atmospheric, and the images are beautifully shot and edited, with great use of filters and composites to give the appropriate washed out looks where necessary. The effects, used minimally, are flawless and very creepy without seeming garish or overbearing.As with classics like The Changeling and 1963's The Haunting, The Ring is a perfect example of how you can still muster a scare from a jaded populace without resorting to cheap jolts and gore. More Blair Witch Project than Sleepaway Camp, and thus far more impressive than most recent attempts at terror. Now if I could just stop hiding from my television...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror with Depth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw The Ring, I used to think of horror movies as something about a supernatural (sometimes not supernatural) force that gobbles up people in bizarre series of deaths usually accompanied by blood and gore. Maybe I ought to blame it on my own selection of movies. But I realized that horror movies can have a deep and a decent story line after seeing The Ring.The Ring is an adaptation of the Japanese movie Ringu. Ringu is a well respected horror movie. Rather than call The Ring as an adaptation I would prefer calling it as an improvisation of Ringu. For I have seen both movies and in my personal opinion the producers of The Ring have made the story a bit deeper and of course with the music and special effects scarier.A particular thing worth mentioning is the work done by the child actor David Dorfman (playing the role of Aidan). My personal opinion is that he has done a very good job. And Ehren Kruger, in his script for the movie has given a major role to Aidan as opposed to lesser important role given to Aidan's Japanese counterpart.Full credit to the Ring's makers for a very fine adaptation of the original Ringu. And yes, a small word of advice for those who have not seen the real Daveigh Chase (playing Samara). After seeing this movie, do look up on the net for a picture of hers and make the comparison! And do try and watch Ringu as well. A very respectable movie indeed.A good story, nice scares, decent acting and smooth direction! Enjoy the movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disturbing, unsettling and downright creepy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this movie with a couple of friends. To be honest, I was expecting a teenage, slasher flick, I was proved wrong.The film circles around a cursed videotape that causes it's viewers to die in seven days. Investigative journalist, Rachel Keller, begins to uncover the secrets of the videotape, and must race against the clock to save herself.The movie was very unsettling and disturbing, which worked more effectively than some teens getting slashed with axes. The videotape was nightmarish and disturbing, and the images will stay with you long after the movie. The setting was gloomy and atmospheric, which enhanced the mood. Naomi Watts portrayed Rachel perfectly, her emotions are believable and haunting. So if you are looking for a horror flick to watch on Friday night, be sure to watch The Ring, just make sure to watch it at night with the lights off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior, Atmospheric, Twisted Little Creepfest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring did three things no film of late has done. It took the genre of Horror seriously without going over the top. It is derived from a superior story and translated to American film superbly, regardless of what the naysayers say. And, while it starts off typically, it ascends into a beautiful, darkling, twisted, genuinely creepy story, which holds you through to the end.Gore Verbinski's style is unmistakable. He has left this work well marked with his stylistic shots, and suspenseful progression.Actually, I found this far superior to most horrors done in the last thirty years or so. A lot has been said about Ringu, the work from which this was adapted for American cinema, and inevitable subsequent comparisons made, however, that is certainly NOT the case. That argument is moot, as this work was based on the novel, "The Ring" by Koji Suzuki, so if you want something to which an honest comparison may be made, I would suggest you read the book, and leave Ringu where it belongs. Personally, I found the American adaptation much more to my liking than Ringu.This is one twisted little creep-fest! It rates an 8.7/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly terrifying stuff!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My husband took me to see this film and when he said it was a horror I was expecting to sit through another of his kind of horror films i.e.stupid teenagers with lots of gratuitous blood, guts and violence thrown in. I was fortunately very mistaken! I have not seen the original "Ringu", which everyone keeps harping on about, but I am glad I saw this first as it is good not to have anything to compare it to. Taken by itself, I think it is a fantastic film. It's not everyone's cup of tea and the usual horror fans may think it slow, incomprehensible or just plain unscary. However, I loved the mystery and weirdness of it.It begins a bit like your typical American nonsense with two teenage girls chatting and the conversation coming around to a videotape that is supposed to kill people that watch it. My first thought was: how "urban legend"ish and ridiculous!! However, as the film went on, it clearly had a darker, more powerful and very much more thought provoking aspect. The images on the videotape itself are so "nightmarish", in that disjointed and freaky way that real nightmares can be. They really got under my skin anyway and I actually came to believe in the power the tape had to kill. You wonder how on earth Rachel is going to escape the same fate as the others and I felt real horror and despair on her discovery that Aidan has also watched the tape.One thing that I think really robs horror films of their ultimate "horror" value is when you come to the explanation/discovery of what's behind it all at the end. I thought the film had let itself down with a typical, rationalised ending. I was very pleasantly surprised with the horrifying twist that developed and I loved the eerie "non-ending" ending - it left me really freaked out and actually believing that the whole thing might be real after all. It is wonderful, psychologically terrifying stuff and I defy anyone to watch it and forget it - I am still thinking about it and giving myself the shivers months later! I won't give any film 10/10, as this is the ultimate and I am always challenging for there to be an even better film out there (this film does exist and is Ringu if everyone else's comments are anything to go by). I give it a superior "must see" 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>scary, thoughtful and satisfying which is fine with me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These last years, apart from the rendering of popular comic strips and the adaptation of TV series for the big screen, American cinema feels a vivacious interest for Oriental culture, especially the Japanese one. Quentin Tarantino's violent and hollow "Kill Bill" (2003/2004) was supposed to be an homage to the samurai movie (but I'm not a Tarantino buff by a long shot). In the derivative "the Last Samurai" (2003), Tom Cruise discovered the secrets and treasures of Japanese civilization while Sofia Coppola used the city of Tokyo as the backdrop for her triumphant "Lost in Translation" (2003). Gore Verbinski chose a more direct and easy way to get interested in Japanese culture: to make a remake of a Japanese movie which became a sleeper: "Ringu" (1998). Against all odds, he made a killing with it although he's an uneven director. "Mousehunt" (1997) was a formulaic but enjoyable comedy but "the Mexican" (2001) was a lame movie. Some friends had told me: "don't watch "the Ring", it's a hokey movie". I think they misjudged it and I found this supernatural thriller quite intriguing and gripping. It has enough commendable stuff in store to grab the audience. I haven't seen the original movie and so I will avoid any comparison.The starting point promises great things and Verbinski will deliver them throughout his flick. The main character, Rachel wants to investigate about a mysterious and cursed videotape which causes the death of the viewer seven days after the latter watched it. What do these outlandish and eerie images mean? What lies beneath them? At her own risk, she and her son watch the video. She has one week to find out the meaning and the omen of the video. "The Ring" could well illustrate this famous premise: "to understand evil, we've got to go back to the sources...".What distinguishes "the Ring" from other horror stuff of these last years is that there's a solid scenario which holds water until the very last minutes of Rachel's adventure and shelves quite an important number of formulaic ingredients. Special effects which have seemed to become the backbone for many horror flicks are used only when necessary and without flashy effects. Still better, Verbinski shows respect for the audience by clarifying as much as possible obscure points of the story. On an unhurried pace, Verbinski takes all his time to film Rachel's investigation. His directing is also worth the price of admission. It is well-crafted and set with clockwork precision for the schedule of spooky moments. Besides, what is notable in "the Ring" is that Verbinski delays as much as possible chilling sequences to better play with the viewer's nerves. This entails an unsettling aura which helps to convey a latent tension. Lighting and makeup shouldn't also be forgotten.The thrust of "the Ring" isn't only to entertain and to make shiver. It is also doubled by a reflexion on the power of the image. One of the images of the film depicts a woman in front of a mirror looking at the camera. So, she's also looking at the viewer. This is unhealthy voyeurism that the movie denounces like the insensible media which expose to the mainstream, woes and sorrows of the victims and so manipulate the viewers' fears. The sequence during which Ann Morgan's husband is incensed by Rachel's will to learn more about Samara rings thoroughly true. Moreover, these seemingly maladjusted images embody symbols: the chair and the lighthouse illustrate loneliness, the figure at the window (a hint at "Psycho"?, 1960) might symbolize parental severity.That said, Verbinski's genteel piece of work isn't exempted of drawbacks. Rachel's little boy is a cardboard character, a vague cousin of Haley Joel Osment in "the Sixth Sense" (1999). When Samara gets out of the well and the screen to kill Rachel's companion, it's nearly Punch and Judy and the first sequence with the two female students in their twenties something, all alone in a house in which strange phenomena and false alarms occur... well, you get the picture. But they're minor quibble and don't overflow too much on the thrill of the vision.I repeat it: I haven't seen the Japanese ambassador but when a remake is able both to scare with reserve, without flashy special effects and to make the viewer think about what he watches, it can be gratifying. And in the case of "the Ring", rightly so...A sequel "the Ring 2" opened last year. Is it worthwhile?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A return to true horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A one line review of this film would simple be `The Ring does what most scary films promise, but never deliver'. That should be enough for any scare enthusiast to justify the price of the ticket, and for the most part no one will be disappointed. I say `for the most part' because it is tough to define what is scary for everyone, and I don't deny that this film may not scare many people as easily as others. It must be said however that this film is probably one of the more successful scare flicks, in the spirit of movies like ?The Exorcist'. Well crafted, extremely well developed and perfectly executed this remake of the 1998 Japanese Horror film ?Ringu' is one movie to fit into your top 10 scare flicks. Disturbing from start to end the film quite effectively leaves you writhing in your seat, grasping a loved one until its gripping conclusion without a single piece of gore at all. An art often lost on modern films and obviously inspired by the original (I have not seen the original), the subtle approach to making these kinds of films is delivered to the screen close to an eerie perfection. The Ring is about a tape, a tape that features some rather disturbing yet very `student film' like snapshots of what can only be described as someone's nightmare. The problem is when the tape concludes, the phone rings and a voice tells you that you will die in exactly seven days. When four teenagers die, simultaneously at 10pm exactly seven days after secretly staying at a secluded cabin a reporter named Rachel, who was the mother of a boy named Aidan, who was a cousin to one of the girls decides to investigate. Partially motivated by the will of the dead girls parents to find an answer as to how their daughter's heart simply stopped, Rachel successfully finds the tape the group watched. Unfortunately for her, she watches it and to her horror she receives a phone call, she now has seven days to solve the puzzle or end up like the others. What follows is an exposition mystery about the chilling origins of the tape, and the power behind the sudden death of each viewer.Notably, there is nothing terribly exceptional about the acting in this film, it is by no means truly award worthy. It is however extremely well suited to the film and very well executed. Naomi Watts as Rachel holds up very well as the centrepiece of the film and remains a constant link to the audience making the drama more real. Martin Hendersen as the X-Husband Noah was quite well played and David Dorfman as Aidan was not only well cast, but will most likely go on to be apart of many more films that involve a child like this (very much like the Sixth Sense). The most notable part of this film is its visual and auditory construction, which is responsible for creating most of the tension and scares in the film. There is a great deal in the sound design that will go unnoticed by the average movie-goer, but it features some very subtle sound ranging from scratching to moans and groans and a few other twisted noises. These are woven into the films music to create a deep sense of abnormality during the films more freaky moments and mood sequences. The visual aspects of the film are close to perfect, a delightful blend of colour that looks digitally graded as opposed to filtered. A strong cold blue dominated throughout the entire film, very rarely mixed with any warmth at all, with the exception of a few scenes. The autumn colours are used quite sharply in contrast to the cold to create another level of abnormality that accompanies the sound design and makes certain aspects of the film standout quite deliberately. From there the camera captures the direction on screen perfectly and with some very well paced editing you end up with a visual treat as much as a formidable film. Much of the story is told with the camera and most of the stories best moments come from effective use of visuals.I am afraid now that I can't go on without spoiling the film, except to say that the climax is one of the more simplistic yet terrifying moments I have had in a cinema. To watch the packed audience all twist in their seats, gasp and groan in a sort of painful anxiety while the events unfolded on screen was just as much of a treat as the film. This film should scare or at least in the best part disturb you, but I am not promising anything as there have been the odd one or two who claim they found nothing frightening in it at all. Still, scary or not, it is one of the better made Hollywood horror films and more importantly it does not stick to the Hollywood formula not does it give us a Hollywood ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First class suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring, an American remake of the Japanese film "Ringu", is in my honest opinion a spectacular and enthralling film. The writing, directing, performances and replay value are amazing in and of themselves. I especially love the premise, and I will review this movie as it's own film, not a remake. What really makes it wonderful is the incredible performances and suspense. I really love all the actors' and actresses' dedication and believability, there being very memorable deliverances of lines and scenes after the film is over. The suspense is top-notch, because of how well the movie is played out and how creepy and fun the material is, that I was both eyes on the screen every second. Naomi Watts is radiant and brilliant; the scenes where she slowly puts the pieces of the puzzle together, or uncovers something dark and haunting are haunting themself because of how marvelous she makes this material.Do not get me wrong, the material itself is great, but it would have been nothing were it not for the cast. The characters are all interesting, and the main story is quite saddening and effective when it is slowly revealed through many different aspects. While it seems as though the main threat, a "killer videotape", would be a ridiculous and stupid threat, hard to make convincing, it undoubtedly works to the fullest here and is entirely convincing, the videotape's images and the events themselves all being very interesting and entertaining. While the movie is not a masterpiece, it is not too short from it, having a great replay value and being one of the top 20 most effective horrors of the 00s, in my opinion. I am glad it receives a lot of positive reception, for it deserves every bit of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually intense creepfest--different purpose than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the American take on the Japanese original and while it absorbs its source material intact, it twists around its formula a bit in order to make it fit its new surroundings. The story is the same: a journalist, after losing her niece to a mysterious circumstance, investigates and discovers a cursed videotape, which gives a viewer only seven days to live.Like its predecessors, the film doesn't spend that much time on the supernatural elements, but focuses more on the mystery. However, The Ring features a lot more supernatural elements immediately and throughout the film than either previous version, perhaps to make more obvious and visceral the impending doom that faces our protagonist. Visually, The Ring has been injected with a shot of adrenaline, being less the brooding mystery of the original and more immediate and menacing. The color palette is colder than Ringu and the story is also more detached and focused on the ghostly mechanics than the human story, which leads the film to be more recognizably intimidating.The story itself is a little more mysterious in that the backstory of our villain is rather thin and unexplained. Furthermore, the villain is clearly portrayed as senselessly malevolent; this weakens at least two significant scenes. The ending, I think, is more clever than the previous versions. I like that there is something to the relationship between the protagonist, Rachel, and her ally, Noah, but it still seems a little weak when compared to Ringu--where one line can effortlessly show the development in the relationship.As far as a horror movie goes, The Ring is a blunt, but nonetheless creepy example. Losing some of the trappings of its predecessors helps simplify the story for faster flow and to create room for more visual creepiness, but also loses some of the complexity that helped the story have more depth. It's more of impressive frightfest than Ringu, but is a little weaker in story resonance. In the end, that makes The Ring just as effective overall: if you want more chills, catch this version. If you want more meat, catch Ringu. Decent entertainment. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better horror movies out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My girlfriend and I saw the original in Japanese, and we both agree that the US version is much more suspenseful and scarier than the Japanese one, with the exception of some extraordinarily creepy sequences in the Japanese version. One of the small but significant changes from the original was that the Japanese version had the girl's face mostly hidden by her hair and she never makes eye contact, which I found more effective than Verbinski's treatment. The original also had one scene that I thought was a bit creepier than the remake, when the girl comes to attack the man. Other than that, the changes made were mostly positive.Japanese plots tend to be short on causality and detail, so the story changes, which add about a half hour to the original story line, serve to make the plot coherent to Westerners. The production values in Japan make the fairly high-budget original with A-list actors look like a B-movie to people accustomed to Hollywood films. The ending shows the difference between cultures, since in the original Japanese, the woman appeals to her father for help.There are holes in the plot, as many people have pointed out in reviews. Those that remain are either intentional, like those relating to the essentially unsolved mystery of the tapes and the girl, or were left over from the original Japanese.The lighting and deliberately limited spectrum enhance the mood of the film greatly. The attack on the ex-boyfriend occurring during daylight hours is surprisingly effective even though it flouts the normal rules of horror films. One of the things I liked most about this movie is that it is a bit unconventional, through a combination of good director choices and some fresh ideas borrowed from Japan. People who were expecting to see a kill-em-all slasher flick were probably disappointed by the relatively slow pace in the building of the story and suspense.Overall, I found the film to be a very good treatment of the original story and a fairly creepy horror movie too. It doesn't try to startle you into being frightened, it doesn't offer lots of gore and shocking violence, and it doesn't play down to the audience. The result is a slightly cerebral and haunting movie. There are some images and scenes that will stay with you and still give you the creeps for quite some time after you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finely crafted, superior film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After her niece and three of her niece's friends mysteriously die on the same night, at the same time, but in different circumstances, reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), hears the rumors of a video that when seen, "curses" the viewer so that they die in 7 days. She investigates the phenomenon with the aid of her ex, Noah Clay (Martin Henderson). They end up seeing the video. Can they figure out a solution in time?For my money, although the Japanese "original" upon which this film is based, Ringu (1998), is worth watching, this Gore Verbinski-directed U.S. version is superior in many ways, having none of the flaws but all of the assets and then some.I'm going to do something unusual and examine the differences between the two films by detailing just a portion of one scene present in both. I think the examination reveals why the U.S. film is superior. The scene is the tail end of the opening, which results in a death. Here's how it goes in Ringu: Tomoko Oishi's (Yuko Takeuchi) television mysteriously turns on to a baseball game as she's looking inside the refrigerator. She looks up, above the door, surprised. We get a reverse shot. We can see the television through frosted glass in the next room. A steadicam follows her from behind, peeking around the corner with her. We cut back to her face, which is relatively expressionless. We go back to a rear shot and see her walk to the remote and shut off the television. She turns around and walks back to the kitchen, pouring herself a drink. We cut to a lower-angled closer shot. We hear a noise. A subtle fear crosses her face. She trembles. Cut to a close shot from over her shoulder. Suddenly, she turns around, frightened. The frame freezes and quickly turns a blue/gray-tinted "negative" color. Here's how it goes in The Ring: Katie Embry (Amber Tamblyn) is in the kitchen, just about to drink, when the television turns on by itself to static. She stops dead in her tracks, her glass just barely touching her lips. Cut to a close up of her slowly turning her head and looking at the television, horrified. Almost achingly slowly, the camera creeps around the corner to show us the television. We see Katie look for any sign of an intruder. She sees the remote on the chair, but no one is around. She hurriedly shuts off the television, then walks away, trying to rationalize the event. Before she can get out of the room, the television turns on again. She stops again and turns even slower. The camera slowly creeps into a medium shot of Katie, with the television and its static reflected in a pane of glass. She runs over and puts her face right next to the television. We see this from a fantastically skewed angle, which distorts the television screen, sticking one end right in our face. We get an insert of Katie yanking the plug. Sparks shoot out. Back to the skewed angle, but now the screen is blank. We circle around slightly. Suddenly there's a noise from the kitchen. Katie gasps and turns around. Slowly, she peeks into the kitchen, just in time to see the refrigerator door open by itself. She runs to shut it, now breathing heavily. She mutters to herself and begins looking around with a very subtle panic on her face. As she quickly turns towards the hallway, the camera rapidly changes focus. We cut to an interesting overhead angle on the stairway. Katie appears, peeking around the corner. She calls for her friend Becca. She trots up the stairs. We cut to a beautiful, extremely low angle of the upstairs hallway, which exaggerates the perspective. As we see Katie reach the top of the stairs, we also see water slowly flowing into the hall from beneath a door. The camera stays at the low angle until Katie reaches the water. We cut to a close up. She's scared and bewildered, then trembling. We get an extreme close up of the door handle as her hand comes gradually into the focal range. She grabs the handle. Another close-up of her face. Cut to the interior of the room--her bedroom. Katie flings open the door, horrified. With a series of extremely fast cuts, we see a snippet of the Ring video on the television set in her bedroom. Cut back to Katie. A super fast zoom to her distorted, horrific face. Then back to the Ring video in a series of quick cuts, before the entire screen goes to static.The point here isn't that the U.S. version is longer. Rather, it's to exemplify the attention to craft, from technical to emotional aspects. Verbinski's pacing is much more deliberate and varied, creating intense suspense. Bojan Bazelli's cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful. There is an obsession with details, from those that integrate and propel the story to those that are artistically striking. The construction is much more complex, but every shot is analyzed for relevance. Every angle exists for a reason. The ornate aesthetics amp up the effect of the story. This approach isn't unique to the opening scene, but occurs throughout the film, including the famed "Ring video" itself. The music is also better here, and is better integrated into the film. The performances are excellent, with Aidan Keller (David Dorfman) just as creepy and disturbing as the antagonist, Samara Morgan (Daveigh Chase). As would be expected for U.S. audiences, Verbinski includes a lot more exposition in his film, working in explanatory material from Ringu 2 as well as new material exploring Samara's history. It works well here, as the story is much tighter. Everything eventually fits together like pieces of a puzzle, and it gives the Ring video and the varied settings of the film more relevance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Most Horrifying Movies In My Early Teens...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was only 13 and I didn't switch on the TV for 2 weeks after I saw this movie. I cursed my parents for taking me to watch it in the theatres, I was so afraid. After I actually lived for more than 2 weeks, I was feeling better and have watched it and The Ring 2 many times since then. The Ring 2 didn't match expectations. But that is my next review, I will explain in that. The Ring and The Sixth Sense were the movies which played a huge part in making me a fan of the horror genre. Gore Verbinski directs this movie which is a Japanese movie remake. This film and The Grudge spawned all those bad Asian remakes in the coming years.Anyway, coming to the story, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is a journalist in Seattle city. Her sister's daughter died under mysterious circumstances and when she investigates, she finds out about an urban myth according to which a person after seeing a video dies exactly after a week. Her son had predicted his cousin's death before it had actually happened. She also watches the tape and knows that she is going to die within the week. Along with her boyfriend, she tries to find the reason behind the killer video and finds a strange and creepy story behind it. Can she save her son from Samara Morgan (Daveigh Chase), the girl in the video? Will Samara rest in peace? The beautiful and talented Naomi Watts captures Rachel's motherly instincts perfectly. Rachel is the only person to uncover anything about the video. So far, all the others simply died without knowing anything about Samara and her adopted parents. The son Aidan Keller (David Dorfman) is actually very creepy because his tone is very adult-like. He is no Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense, Artificial Intelligence), but he really made me nervous. The film worked on many levels, mainly because the director does not go over the top with cheesy special effects. The backstory is really coherent and the film is completely sure of itself and that is a major plus of the film. It doesn't have long pauses in the story just to push the running time, as in many horror movies. For adults, the film may not be that scary, but it works as a thriller as well. Brian Cox as Richard Morgan is also very good. The story about the horses is something I had never seen before and it was amazing. When the plot unfolds and we know Samara's story, it is not too difficult to sympathize with her fate. A very satisfying horror movie which will be classic in the future.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good scary film ? but please watch Ringu to see how good it SHOULD be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rumour is going around about a video tape that may have some sort of killer virus on it. Anyone who watches it dies mysteriously seven days later. Naturally disbelieving the whole nonsense, journalist Rachel Keller decides to investigate further when a relative of hers supposedly views the tape and dies seven days later. She finds the tape and watches it, enlisting the help of video expert Noah to help her uncover where the tape was made. Can she solve the tape's secrets before 7 days are up?OK. It's important to know where a reviewers bench mark is before you judge where they are coming from. So let me say that I saw Ringu a year back and it really freaked me out. So as you can imagine I came to this half expecting it to be a rubbish remake of a film that I didn't see any need to remake. However it was better than I had feared and probably will stand out as one of the best horror movies of 2003 (when it is released in the UK). The plot has changed slightly from the original but not really to the detriment of the film ? it actually helps it be more modern and more believable now that it's in America.The film's main problem for me was the fact that it went for the `jump scares' rather than `creepy scares' which Ringu had. Here we have more sudden movements where Ringu moved slowly and deliberately. Ring does this well at points too, but for most it will always go for the jump rather than the unnerving creep. However I defy anyone not to get a little creeped out by the remake as well. If I hadn't seen Ringu I know I would have enjoyed this more ? but I only kept remembering how well it was done in the first place. For example THAT scene (viewers will know what I mean) is too quick and too jumpy in Ring whereas in Ringu it was slow, deliberate and terrifying in it's sheer unnerving horror. Likewise in ring we see the child'' face a lot more which detracts from the fear of the unknown ? in Ringu it was more of the long hair.The performances are not as good as Ringu in some respects. Watts is very good and is believably scared. Henderson is OK but I wanted a more mature man rather than a surfer-dude type. The support cast were all good, with Brian Cox thrown into the mix. My only pause for concern was Dorfman ? why was he allowed to change the character of the boy? In Ringu he was a normal kid, here he comes across like a poor man's Haley Joel Osmond in 6th Sense? His routine took away from the emotional involvement that should have come with the danger he was in ? instead he just comes across as difficult. The performance is OK but 1, the change to the character is strange and unnecessary and 2, it just felt a little too like the 6th Sense!Overall I enjoyed the film and was scared at some points. However too often it went for the jump rather than just being consistently unnerving as Ringu was. Fans of Ringu may dislike this but I think those who haven't seen the original will enjoy this. Word of advice though ? go out and find a copy of the original and watch it first, you'll enjoy it a lot more and it'll show you why Hollywood fell over themselves to try and copy it in a more commercial way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>R.I.N.G. -- Remade Into Nauseating Garbage. Another perfect example of how to Americanize (aka ruin) flawless Japanese cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of the original RINGU series, I was eagerly awaiting this American remake for several months. Don't get me wrong, I was wary at first, but as the release date grew nearer and the trailers and positive reviews started pouring in, I became more and more anxious to see it. I walked into my local bug-infested, foul-smelling cinema with high hopes. Plopping myself into a sticky, soda-encrusted seat, I began feeling a sense of overbearing excitement as I impatiently waited for the godawful previews to end and the lights to dim. However, ten minutes into the movie, I knew exactly what I was in for: a dull, formulated, vastly overhyped letdown. As the film trudged to an overlong, disappointing conclusion I was constantly reminded of a little promise I had made myself after seeing NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1990), PSYCHO (1998), and OCEAN'S ELEVEN (2001): under no circumstances will I ever watch another remake again, especially those remakes whose originals are completely faultless in and of themselves, and couldn't possibly be effectively updated and/or improved in any way without detracting from the superiority of the original. How I wish I could keep my own promises!In the 1998 masterpiece, a distinct feeling of dread and uneasiness was constantly present, slowly but tensely building into an unexpected and downright terrifying climax. The mood it created was absolutely haunting and so carefully executed that it stuck with you long after the credits rolled. It didn't need to rely on big-budget special effects and continuous loud, cheaply startling jump-cuts. Unfortunately, that's all THE RING has going for it. It doesn't even try to tap into the nail-biting atmosphere of the original. Sadly, with the permeation of trashy stalk-'n-slash gorefests during the 80s and trendy, pop-horror SCREAM clones during the 90s, it's safe to say that modern American horror has dug itself into an inescapable rut of thoughtlessness, unoriginality, and an embarrassing dependency on attractive characters (who, might I add, are usually half-dressed or nude at some point, if not most, of the movie) and gross visuals. THE RING is no different. It is typical, contrived, and pretentious to the nth degree.The lackluster remake also strips RINGU bare of its enigmatic nature, spending way too much time trying to explain everything. There is nothing left to the imagination. Everything is spelled out for us, right up to the trite, tacked-on ending. In RINGU, the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions, but not here. Everything is wrapped up nice and neatly. God forbid we have to think!THE RING just couldn't seem to get anything right, not even the movie within the movie. The videotape in RINGU contained about 30 seconds of grainy, abstract, and unsettling images. After it is played for the viewer, you feel as if you are now part of the curse. In THE RING, it is stretched out into a lengthy, laughable mishmash of arbitrary nonsense. RINGU's tape worked because it was brief and of extremely low quality, making appear as if VHS is far too new a medium for its content. This also succeeds in adding a great deal of ambiguity to the tape's origin. Upon seeing the video playback in THE RING, you'll find that it's just the opposite: long and overproduced, complete with sharp color, fluid motion, needless gross-outs, and even computer-generated images. Give me a break! Noah's braindead character chalked it up accurately when he mumbled "it's very student film", except for the fact that many student films are actually way more interesting.Although I was deeply disappointed in this movie, I realize now that I shouldn't have been so eager to believe that it had even a smidgen of potential. After all, what on earth could I have been expecting from the writer and the director of such insipid, braindead pictures like "Scream 3" and "Mouse Hunt"? Shame on me.Next time you're standing at the box office, contemplating which overpriced movie ticket to spend your hard-earned cash on, take my word and pass on THE RING. At least wait about two or three weeks when the general public realizes it sucks and it ends up at the $1 theater. Or better yet, order yourself a copy of RINGU instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I absolutely love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring remains to this day one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen. It is not particularly violent, like all those cruddy (and the occasionally decent) slasher film. But honestly, is there anyone who doesn't get a chill running down their spines when they show those dead bodies with the gray skin and hollowed out eyes staring out at nothing. This movie honestly gave me a nightmare the night after I watched it.And that videotape. With its odd, seemingly random images flashing across the screen. I remember distinctly the falling chair, a ladder leaning against a wall, a tree standing isolated in the middle of an empty feel. These images by themselves wouldn't be able to generate anything remotely resembling fear, but it's not the images. It's the relative calm and oddity of these pictures that leads to a feeling of unrest, a feeling that something more sinister is lurking just out of sight.This is Gore Verbinski's best movie. Period. I liked all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies a lot, too, but none of them come remotely close to achieving the upper echelons of their respective genres, as the Ring did, at least in my opinion. And honestly,perhaps most terrifying of all...is just seeing-her. With the long dark hair hanging ominously over her face, so no expression is visible.This movie is relentless. Something is always waiting in the dark, around the next turn. And then just when you think it's over...the movie hits full throttle. The pacing starts off quickly, and just continues to pick up speed. The Ring is the definition of the phrase "Never a dull moment."This is another movie to watch alone, in the dark, just like Alien. The difference-once Alien is over, you can say the terror was long in the future, on an isolated spaceship. The Ring is here and now. And with nothing stopping her, that cold-hearted terror, it seems just within the realm of possibility that she is coming up behind you now, as you read this, about to strike...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as memorable (or disturbing) as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slightly disappointing remake of the 1998 classic Ringu Japanese horror film. Although the film made a good effort at 'Westernising' the original concept behind the Ring, it failed in creating the mysticism behind the originals urban legend story.POSSIBLE SPOILERSThe removal of the psychic abilities from mother to daughter from the original story means we have no background on Samara, prior to her apparent 'adoption'. Also, the inclusion of actually seeing Samara, in a mental hospital, speaking e.t.c., completely ruins the mythos surrounding the 'evil' little girl. The necessity to over-explain plot points through banal dialogue and the inclusion of more disturbing imagery and shocks during the film, only helped to detract from the horror of the final act (especially the overly artsy video).The acting, however, was not bad from Naomi Watts and Brian Cox, but the little boy, Aiden, I found to be irratating and somewhat resemblant to a potato.If you can get hold of the original Ringu, watch that instead. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has to be understood as an offense to any savvy viewer who caught the Japanese version of the movie, 'Ringu'.I am aware of the fact that US crowds do not go for movies that do not cast large-breasted blonde psychotic women, but this is a little far-fetched for this story. The movie is meant to be solely based on psychology thrills and brain scare. The American version of the movie does not help in this at all, as all goes into the image and the special effects. Event he plot has to be altered and worsened: the little boy becomes a depressed child with a 6th sense who calls his mom by her first name.Anyhow, you may go for the American remake if you are the kind to be scared by movies with subtitles. However, if you were delivered with a brain and some artistic sense, you'll go for 'Ringu'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this film left me depressed, not because it was creepy, but because it was so stupid and at the same time so cynical. I may say that there is not a single thing in this picture which makes any sense or has any genuine humanity in it. The monster is an evil little girl, but there is never the slightest indication to suggest why the girl is so evil or so powerful - indeed, precisely the sort of silence which is a certain giveaway that the picture has been made by people with adolescent mentalities, for adolescents. You posit some sort of monstrosity, and that's all there is to it, nothing more need be said. "Okay, like, there's this evil little girl with incredible powers...?" To give but two instances of the astonishing illogic which characterizes the film. For one, the mysterious video which is killing people is said to have been imprinted from the evil girl's memories. But the video is full of images of things that the girl could not possibly have seen. For another, the characters are horrified to realize that it is a terrible calamity that her skeleton has been taken from the well, because somehow this means that now she is free to wreak her evil upon the world and kill people. But she has been wreaking her evil upon the world and killing people even with her skeleton at the bottom of the well! Oh, I'm sorry, apparently she can now actually drag her ugly carcass out of the television set and kill people instead of killing them from inside the television set. But perhaps her identically melted-face victims would not consider this such an important distinction. Then there is the clerk who manages the cabins and upon whose shelf the evil video is found - the curious fellow who plays him is given a nice little character-actor turn, interacting with the blonde lady who is the star, trying to perform card tricks, and so forth - and then we never see him again! What the heck was &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; about? What was his part in the sinister events, what was the video doing on his shelf? We never learn! We never see him again! You see, it is as if the screenplay for this film was written, scene by scene, without any reference to anything that had been written before, certainly not with any intention to exercise the slightest logic or continuity, but merely to work certain changes upon the psyche of the filmgoer, who is presumed to be a teen-ager, I suppose, and who is certainly held in utter contempt. And here is the real horror, that the film wants nothing from you but your money, and has no meaning other than to trick you into pushing some bills through the slot at the box office.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had such high expectations for this movie. I guess the moviemakers did not share my expectations. Don't get me wrong, the music, photography, directing and some of the acting (the heroine's) are good. I just don't get why they didn't do more with the story. Now of course it is a remake, but the original must have been better than this! Let me be more to the point. The story is absolutely awful. It makes you think that all these clues are going to add up to something. It could have been really clever. But about 15 minutes into the movie the clues have become so absurd that there is no chance for the villain to be anything else than a ghost. How original. Now here's the really dissatisfying part. All those clues you were paying close attention to? They don't mean diddly squat! They really don't lead to anything. You could have taken all the clues, changed them completely into some other clues, tacked on the ending, and it would have been just as good a fit. The simple truth is that it's just some mean monster terrorizing and killing people. And all those clues that could have at least revealed a tragic motivation for this disgruntled ghost's vengeance end up being utterly vain: the monster is just evil. That's all there is to it. It came up from who knows where, always has wanted to hurt people, and always will. That's why none of what I said is really a spoiler. If the clues meant something, then telling you about them would reveal the ending. But this ending might as well have been put at the beginning, because all going through the middle is just a waste of time. The movie is a scare machine. It is mechanical, cold, and shallow, filled with mere fluff. A string of one cheap thrill after another. If you like this kind of movie, it would be cheaper and just as satisfying to go have yourself electrocuted (gently, of course -- as the movie shows, you can die from electric shock).</fullReview>

The Ring is a well made remake and follows the original quite closely, even in atmosphere. It's close enough to say that if you hate this movie, you probably won't like the original either. Some sequences are even shot-by-shot the same. Acting is adequate, cinematography is excellent, the pace is good. Unfortunately, there are some issues with this remake imho.- They replaced some important storylines of the original with that really lame horse nonsense.- The 'scary' make up effects are overdone and not scary at all.- The 'samara' character is too flat and too young. She's just plain evil in this flick where in the original she's a 18ish teenager with a more complex and sad background (see Ring 0: Birthday) which makes it more thought provoking and believable that she became what she is.- The ending is not as satisfying as the original.- While pacing is good (I'm glad it still has the quiet pace of the original), it's not as good as in the original where its momentum gradually builds up until it's firmly stuck under you skin.Now I still think it's quite good, but it doesn't add anything over the original to make it really worthwhile. If you don't mind watching a subtitled japanese movie, definitely go for the original Ring (aka Ringu).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Videos Are Hazardous to your Health.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a quote from the trailer for 1963 film version of THE HAUNTING: "What does it take to prove to you that the dead don't always rest in peace?" Well, the question is about to be answered in Gore Verbinski's clever and very frightening adaptation of the Japanese movie RINGU.It tells the urban legend-like story of a "cursed" video that, when viewed, will bring death unto the viewer within seven days -- no less, no more. As a matter of fact, the tongue-in-cheek beginning in which two teenage girls are chattering about this video sets the stage which inexorably details the unspeakable fate which is about to befall to one of the girls, Katie (played by "JOAN OF ARCADIA" star Amber Tamblyn), the first of four victims to die in an inexplicable fashion.Enter Katie's aunt Rachel (Naomi Harris), a reporter called on by her sister to find out about what lead to her death. Rachel learns that Karie and three other friends died at exactly 10 o'clock at the same time and notices that pictures taken at a trip to a remote lodge reveal blurry, almost monstrous faces... as if their very images had been completely corrupted. She heads out to this lodge, picks up the video by chance, rents a room, views the tape -- which is a collection of disturbing, "art-movie" images... and gets a call in which she has seven days to live.And as simple as that, the story of THE RING takes off into uncharted territory as Verbinski develops the events stemming off from the act of viewing this tape while simultaneously trying to find out about its nature: where it comes from, who made it, why does it even exist. Because Rachel only has seven days to solve this mystery, as does her ex-husband Noah who has seen the tape, and because their own son's life is also in danger, the tension is greatly heightened. Matters must be settled, because it's becoming progressively clear that this is no ordinary tape, and because things are getting more and more complicated, and the noose is tightening.Verbinski brings forth the back-story surrounding this tape expertly, a little at a time, almost casually. One is led to believe the woman in the video -- Anna Morgan -- is the person to focus on, but this is far from the truth, as are several other details surrounding the ill-fated Morgan family. This is a trick that Hitchcock used fairly regularly in all of his suspense films and Verbinski clearly knows his suspense: in not revealing too much too soon and misleading his viewers, he fools them. Adding surreal elements of imminent danger about to manifest itself at every turn only amps up the terror, and one sequence is a definite standout. While heading to a secluded island on a ferry, a horse, sensing something other than Rachel's presence (or reacting to her taint, since she has seen this cursed tape and is marked by its black energy), breaks free from where it's being kept and threatens to cause some grievous bodily harm to someone, anyone, on the ferry. What happens to that horse is as horrifying as anything committed on screen, even more so than the film's denouement, and forces us to realize we are entering into a world of true, absolute evil.The thing is, to fall right into the heart of a mystery can be one of the most awful things anyone can experience, and Rachel, here being the Final Girl, does just that. More than a reporter she is the person who penetrates the inner circle that lies within the images of the video, but also, in doing so, she is also the one who releases its will upon the world and perpetuates its existence. Like the ring from LORD OF THE RINGS, like many of Stephen King's monsters and skeletons from his own books, Bad Things Want To Be Found because pain and terror are the things in which they feed on.Relentlessly disturbing, THE RING is proof that one doesn't need to spell it out to be terrifying. The mundane has become chaos, the third wall has been broken, and the author of this hellish nightmare has come to vampirize on our very souls. An excellent horror film, made better because of its deft direction, precise acting, rich atmosphere, and the law that having no explanation for the whys is the best approach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undeclared Horror Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring usually gets a bad rep for being "too slow" and some people even say that "nothing happens" in the movie. Unless you have ADD or something, you have to at least appreciate what Gore Verbinski achieved in 2002. What he did was he basically took the premise of Ringu, a good suspenseful Japanese horror flick and made it more suspenseful and filled with creepy visuals.I am a huge horror fan, and this is one of the movies that unsettles me the most. The suspenseful pace, the incredible, beautiful but haunting visuals make this a unique experience. I love gory films, but this one relies a lot more on psychological horror and imagery to create scares. No jump scares, just good story telling.The movie may not answer all the questions it creates, but the viewer, if he pays attention accordingly, will be able to figure them out for himself. Unsettling to the bone, The Ring is one of my favorite horror films of all time. Truly underrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brief review of "The Ring"'s plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin, I have neither read the book or seen the Japanese movie, so my review is about this version only. "The Ring" was artfully filmed, with good color choices and lots of tiny features that were fun to find. Visually, I loved this movie. But I watch for the plot, and there wasn't much of it here. "The Ring" is the detailed story of a chain letter. It is one of the "pass it on or die" stories that I'm sure we've all seen at one time or another. Yes, this is much better written than a usual e-mail, but it's still, in my opinion, an overused and cheap plot. I laughed at the first few scenes of the movie, but from there it went downhill. There were clichd characters (the skeptical detective, the all-knowing young child, the creepy little girl) and unoriginal exposition techniques. As the story progressed, I began to enjoy "The Ring" a bit more, but it left many unanswered questions and loose ends that I feel should have been tied up. Many interesting characters are introduced, and their histories are extremely important to the plot, but we only receive the very minimum information. So many ideas are introduced and never properly explored. I was left wondering at the end of the movie--not thoughtful, more exasperated that they hadn't included more information. Throughout the movie, I never related to any of the characters and never felt like we got a grip on who they were. Each character has a role in the movie, but their stories feel not fully developed and I think this could have been improved upon. If you are looking for a beautiful film with good colors, interesting shots, and carefully placed details, "The Ring" isn't a bad movie to watch. But if, like me, you care more about the plot than anything else, I wouldn't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a lot going on in the Ring, but none of it actually amounts to the horror film that critics are calling it. This film is hardly anything more or less than a weird, and often ridiculous charade of a ghost story, which is occasionally evocative but less so than it is dreary. sometimes it is on the right track, but usually it is not.After the bizarre death of her niece, Rachel Keller, a young journalist is asked by the departed's mother to investigate. Her search leads her to a motel cabin where she finds an unlabeled video cassette. She players it once, it contains about twenty seconds of grainy miscellaneous shots including a dead horse, a girl coming out of a well, and bizarre ring of light. Moments later the phone rings and informs Racheal that she has a week to live. Can she uncover the truth before it kills her and subsequently puts her own son in danger.The story is kinda spooky, but it falls apart. In the end, the Ring is a failure simply because it makes no sense. True horror fans will watch the Ring and probably dedicate the rest of the day to figuring out what it all meant. As a horror fan myself, when I see a movie, I want to be scared and intrigued as I watch, not hours AFTER I've finished watching.As a protagonist, I kinda liked Naomi Watts. She doesn't have a lot to do but she does it well. A lot of her acting is done not with her words but with her eyes, in the same way Jeff Bridges acted with his body in Starman. I guess she is the only thing memorable about this otherwise mediocre motion picture. The Ring is dull, sloppy and doesn't do much for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant and shocking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE RING is my favorite horror movie of all time for many reasons. It is a remake of an excellent Japanese horror film named RINGU. I love both films and own both DVDs. Now since there are so many reasons why I love THE RING, I'll organize all the things I love and the very few things I would change about this brilliant and creepy film. But first let me give you a short version of the plot: after the death of her niece, investigative journalist, Rachael Keller finds a strange tape that her niece apparently watched one week before her death. The rumor behind the tape is that if you watch it, you will die seven days later.THE INTRO: The introduction to this film is very smart. At first it seems like a cheesy teenage slasher flick. But that my friends is a trick. After about 3 minuets into the film you realize just how mature and suspenseful of a film this really is.THE CHARACTERS: The characters of THE RING are great. Rachael Keller is the perfect journalist. She's very inquisitive and smart; she certainly does allot in this movie and keeps the plot going. Also Rachael Keller is a great mother; she puts her own life in danger so she may save her son. Noah Clay is sort of a comic relief, he's sarcastic and stubborn but is also very smart. Noah helps Rachael solve the mystery of the cursed tape. Aidan Keller is the son or Rachael Keller, Aidan is quiet and wise beyond his years, he was very close with his cousin before she died a mysterious and horrible death. The character list goes on so I'll skip ahead to the villain. Samara Morgan is the antagonist in this film, and boy what a villain. The secret to Samara's past is a sad and brutal one, which would explain the things she does through out the film.THE STYLE OF HORROR: I love horror films like THE RING. THE RING is very unique in it's style, it is filmed like an Asian horror film; full of flash backs, creepy imagery, nightmares, mysteries, and hallucinations. It's very bizarre and surreal at times, which isn't very out of place since this is a supernatural horror/thriller. If you ask anyone who has scene THE RING "which scene do you remember the most?" they'll probably tell you "the closet scene!". This is referring to the 2 seconds of footage of Katie, dead in the closet. This scene is the biggest jump scene in the film. There are a lot of different types of scares in this film; jump scares, suspense, shocks, chills, and intense terror! WHAT I WOULD CHANGE: There is very little I would actually change about this brilliant horror film. In fact, there is only one scene, the climax. I guess I would like one that's a bit longer. The climax in this film is still satisfying but I definitely wouldn't mind a longer one.THE ATMOSPHERE: Atmosphere is something I highly prize in any film, but especially in horror films. It's industrial in some places and fantasy-like in others but it's always tinted green or blue. It's almost always raining and the settings are all very nice. The settings go from Seattle to the forests of Washington to a fictional island and beyond.In conclusion I would like to once again say that this is my personal favorite horror film of all time. I highly recommend this movie to any one with intelligence and an imagination. THE RING is an amazing horror movie, a cult favorite now and a cult classic in the future, a blockbuster, and so much more. The critics loved it and so will you, trust me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tepid remake of Japanese horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely underwhelming, due apparently to post-production cuts that sanitized and gelded an otherwise worthy effort. Apparently test audiences were disturbed by original footage, so much of the horror of the movie was removed from fear of offending milquetoast viewers. Disturbing sequences were watered down to movie of the week quality. What's left is a muddy, aimless, sometimes startling derivative of a first-rate Japanese production. Try "Mothman Prophesies" or the original "Ring" for a better ride. Note to producers: stay in the offices down the hall from the accountants and let moviemakers do what they do best. If the director/editor has created something that disturbs test audiences, don't panic and water down the flick. Scaring audiences is what horror movies are SUPPOSED to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different, exciting, disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I did not watch the original Japanese version - Ringu - before watching this remake.I thought this movie was just crappy. I didn't think it was even scary - I laughed at the audience who was screaming and closing their eyes around me at the cheesy parts. I had high expectations for this movie, reading some good reviews first and convincing my friend that it would be worth the money to go. I had to apologize afterwards for dragging her along to such a piece of crap.Now, it is refreshingly different from a typical Hollywood horror movie. For that, I can see why so many people might like it. However, I attributed that to the fact that it was based on a Japanese original and to me, having seen many Japanese horror movies before, it seemed like just a poor attempt to translate a Japanese-style horror into something acceptable for an American audience with very low expectations of what we are capable of appreciating in a film. Perhaps they were right in remaking it this way since so many here seem to like it.**** Warning - possibly some minor spoilers *****There were a few refreshing scenes such as the scene near the beginning where they flashed what the woman saw midway in her speech - a very abrupt and jarring effect which had a pleasant way of ironing out the wrinkles of the cheesy beginning which made me wince at its terrible dialogue and corny attempt to instill fear into the audience. Unfortunately, however, that was about the only time in the movie where I thought they had something really scary going. The rest of the movie seemed like a relaxing walk through the park.The directing was very nice, though sometimes I thought it tried to be a little too ambitious and artsy for this type of film - it seemed to me like more of a film made by some yearning film student experimenting with new techniques. The video footage on the tape wasn't at all chilling in my opinion, though other people may disagree.I rented Ringu, the original, shortly after the movie because I wanted to see if it would be any better. It was, by far. I won't include a review of that since I did an extensive review on it earlier and you can read it there. Go watch that instead. I highly recommend it. Don't waste your time with this one - the original offers just as much and more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary, irrelevant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take "Ringu", make it visually slicker, overexplain plot elements that don't really matter and remove the paranormal explanation and you have "The Ring". The moviemakers involved in the remake had the laudable idea of taking the near-perfect original plot in new directions, but all their initiatives fall flat by the 75th minute. In-depth character development is not a necessity in a genre movie, just a brief explanation will do. I can't blame the American team for trying to dig deeper, but their new ideas don't hold water and go nowhere. The actors don't even sound like they believe their own lines in a few scenes.There are some great moments in "The Ring", but they were integrally lifted from the Japanese version. The way the story unfolds in "The Ring" may seem unoriginal to someone who has already seen "Session 9", "Stir of Echoes" and M. Night Shyamalan's work, but that would be unfair since all those movies were obviously inspired by the J-Horror wave of the late nineties, which arguably culminated with 1998's "Ringu" (although I hear the recent "Dark Water" is brilliant). If you thought "The Ring" was good and if you don't mind sub-titles, do yourself a favor and seek out movies by Kiyoshi Kurosawa ("Cure", "Seance"), Hideo Nakata ("Ringu" 1 and 2, "Dark Water"), Masayuki Ochia ("Hypnosis"), Takashi Miike ("Audition", "Visitor Q", countless others) and Higuchinsky ("Uzumaki").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's that time of year again when the leaves are turning kaleidoscopic colors, the air is tinged with the crisp scent of renewal and brain busting midterms are once again a distant painful memory. It also means that we will be bombarded with ads for half-baked horror flicks that have been gathering dust on studio shelves, in the vain hope of scaring up some cheap Halloween thrills. Worse yet, the gullible masses will inevitably take the bait. Everyone is shocked when Rachel Keller's teen aged niece literally drops dead for no apparent reason. An investigative reporter, Rachel's curiosity is piqued when she is hears that Katie and three of her friends died after watching a cursed videotape. Determined to debunk an urban legend and make great copy in the process, Rachel inadvertently stumbles upon a sinister secret. If she doesn't solve the ensuing mystery in seven days, not only will she blow her deadline, she dies. Nothing like a little incentive.Based on the 1998 Japanese film of the same name, The Ring rises above it's contemporaries: it doesn't rely on elaborate eviscerations, naked nubile teenagers or multimillion dollar CGI effects. The first hour of the film is a pure Hitchockian-style thriller with a supernatural bent, mixing disturbing surreal imagery with quick cut away shots and an eerie score to devastating effect (there were moments where the hairs on the back of my neck literally stood on end). It's too bad that the remaining fifty minutes are a different movie.The second half of the film serves as a caveat for film makers on what not to do: introduce irrelevant characters, lose sight of your plot and allow it to ramble aimlessly, have a fake climax (that's never a good thing), and wrap with a predictable ending. The biggest glitch however is the `villain' of the piece.Whether demon, psycho, monster or serial killer, there needs to be some underlying motivation that drives the antagonist to seek vengeance. While the killer in The Ring was indeed wronged, it is never fully explained why this happened, and the victims are in no way associated with these events. Consequently, the antagonist's actions make no sense within the context of the film, especially when efforts to ameliorate these injustices only serve to magnify her rampage. Regardless whether you prefer the thinking person's subtle horror stylings of The Sixth Sense or the pea soup expectorant head spinning of The Exorcist, The Ring will leave you unfulfilled and annoyed for having let you down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Ring" is about a woman named Rachel Keller. She lives with her young son, Aiden in their Seattle apartment, and holds a job as a journalist. She comes upon the story of a bizarre video tape with strange and frightening images. Supposedly, if you watch the tape, the phone rings, and you die seven days later. She is a little skeptical at first, until she begins investigating the death of a teenage girl who died seven days after watching the video. She heads to a cabin in the mountains where the teenage girl was staying with her friends, and comes upon the video itself. After watching it, sure enough, the phone rings. Now a believer in the tape's mysterious power, Rachel begins to uncover the mystery behind it before she becomes the next victim - and she only has seven days to save herself and her son.A remake of a Japanese horror movie, "The Ring" is a well-made American retelling of the unique, creepy story. Naomi Watts delivers a great performance as the heroine, and does it quite convincingly. The video tape displayed in the movie is really creepy, loaded with all kinds of gruesome images and bizarre things. I really liked the plot of this movie, it was rather original and creepy, aside from all of the unoriginal, dime-a-dozen horror flicks that are carted out constantly. The film may seem to drag a little for those who are so used to the fast paced slasher films, but if you pay attention it's actually quite interesting.Naomi Watts leads the cast as Rachel, and is believable and empathetic - both good things for her character. David Dorffman is her mysterious but intelligent son, and Martin Henderson is Rachel's ex-husband/friend. The cast performs well and all was believable. One thing notable about this film is it's disturbing and vivid visuals, which are really great looking and add the movie's spooky and strange atmosphere. There are plenty of bizarre and scary sequences in this film, mainly in the video tape itself and the horrifying backstory behind it all.Overall, "The Ring" is a pretty good horror movie, not perfect but very good for sure. I found it to be pretty creepy, and very different from most horror films out there. Definitely see it, it's sure to scare you even if it's the slightest bit. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having not seen the original, here is my two cents: an interesting premise, and a solid build-up, plus a few genuine slight scares here and there (but no where near as many as some will have you believe) are all let down by a convoluted, messy and just plain lame explanation at the end, which will make you go "phtt, yeah right" (or make you LOL) rather then "Ahhhh, so that's it" M Night Shyamalans suspense-thriller Signs similarly has a lot of flaws, but it excels in the suspense department, and the last 10 minutes in that movie (before the final, similarly disappointing resolution) are a hell of a lot more nail-biting (and satisfying) then anything in The Ring. And about that so called 'terrifying' scene toward the end of film, I say that birthday party scene in Signs is not only more chilling, but a lot more riveting and interesting. Not without it's merits, but it's sheer over-ratedness prevents me from delving in to either of them. 2/5. BTW- I saw both movies at the cinemas.</fullReview>

You are presented with a thousand little puzzle peices that end up neatly tied together in a very gruesome realization. Aside from some Hollywood special effects fluff that was unnecessary (the coming out of the TV scene), the filmmakers managed to completely creep you out with just good acting, a great script, and greeeeeeat filmmaking. 9 outta 10.</fullReview>

The story is rather predictable other than the plot twist at the end, but the direction of the movie makes the surprise all the less surprising. From the beginning when the two young girls are teasing each other about the urban legend about the tape, you're given the clue the director is going to tease you by presenting suspense only to turn around and say everything is just a joke. The buildup is somewhat entertaining but the conclusion is quite rushed and leaves you with an empty feeling. The relationship between the characters is almost nonexistant, you're given no indication of any connection between Rachel and her son other than she's his mother. Most of the interaction occurs between Rachel and Noah, but even that relationship is distant and uninteresting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Adaptation of a Japanese Horror Original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent quality and well directed adaptation of an awesome Japanese film. Stays true to the original storyline while expanding on the more American back story and details of this bizarre haunting/curse. In the same vein of intrigue and high school mythology as the likes of "Nightmare on Elm Street" is "The Ring." Both original and this remake create an intense and interesting horror tale around the stories that circulate in school halls, universally apparently! Though main characters of "The Ring" are adults, we have a high school legend of this tape that supposedly kills you when you watch it. Campfire Legends and Modern Folklore.It is interesting to note the differences and similarities between the original and remake, as both are strong and well done in their separate styles and plot elements. The intense or intriguing moments of artistic flair happen at different moments based on each director's vision of this story. Obviously, this Hollywood version has higher production elements and, of course, a bigger budget. Some may scream against the changed back story, but the back story in this eerie, gripping and disturbing and far more detailed to the Japanese counterpart.Both films succeed at being new horror classics with strong impacts on horror cinema as a creditable and profitable genre. It is great to see the far too few remakes where the director really had a vision and working understanding of the material and also, really trying to give the audience a good film. Almost always with the multitude of remakes of foreign horror, as well as Classic American Horror, we see completely uninspired versions of far superior originals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely hated this film. First off, the acting was atrocious. I have not seen such a miscast group in a very long time. The children were overly cute, the female lead spent more time worrying about her hair than studying the character, and I'm pretty sure the male lead was a model. They were stiff and wooden, and entirely unconvincing. Every emotion was overdone; I felt as if I were watching theatre (and not in the good way). And the lead female character was a total monster (which was a complete departure from the original). That actress butchered that part, being calm on second, hysterical the next, flirting with her ex-husband and showing no real personality under the surface of classic modern sarcastic bitchiness.The direction was brutal. A good director could have at least made some improvement in the acting, but sometimes I got the feeling that no one had even screened the film after it was made. In on scene, the mother enters her son's bedroom, looks at his bed, and the shot of what was supposed to be her line of vision was actually at ceiling height looking down. And oh my God the dialog. I wrote better dialog in stories when I was eight. Predictable, simple and completely lacking any flow. It was also overly flirty and sarcastic a la Dawson's Creek, that distracted the viewer from even the possibility of setting a suspenseful mood. Which then brings me to the unbelievably annoying subplot of the rekindled romance between the two leads. Totally unnecessary and so nauseatingly Hollywood. Once again we find a director who falls back on ridiculous notions of sexualization for the sole purpose of fattening up weak material, and subsequently failing miserably. Then we come to the plot problems. While the film overexplained a million tiny details, it ignored numerous necessary points, such as the chronology of the horse family's events, and the girl's psychic abilities. She obviously could control events/actions with her mind, yet there wasn't even an attempt to explain how. Also there was a complete lack of explanation of where the girl came from and/or why she was evil. Yet the film spoon fed certain details to the audience, to the point of choking. Us hearing the voice on the phone, the extended first death scene, the water oozing out of the television, what was up with that whole Before you die you see the ring nonsense? Which was, incidentally, totally inconsistent as the boyfriend was not drawing on magazine faces or scribbling circles before he died! And what was with that stupid female lead getting knocked into the well? Most rediculous scene ever! And then we come to the ending, which was so obviously complete left open for a sequel, and in doing so, dropped all moral implications of the tape. Instead of the ending in Ring (where the mother asks her father to watch the film and die, giving up his life to save that of his grandchild, and effectively ending the cycle), in the remake, they imply that all that matters is saving the son, regardless of who sees the film and if the cycle continues. It is appalling that this film was able to be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wraps Itself Around You.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atmospheric and definitely disturbing modern horror film that sticks with you like crazy glue during its running time and beyond. Teenager Amber Tamblyn dies mysteriously one night at home and it appears that the youngster was literally scared to death. Aunt and Seattle news reporter Naomi Watts quickly learns that her niece had supposedly viewed a strange video tape a week earlier. Tamblyn's three friends had also watched the tape with her and died under odd circumstances. Watts' investigative skills lead to the discovery of the video, but she makes a huge mistake by viewing its contents. Now it seems that Watts is the target of the curse and she must race against the clock to find out how she can overcome the evil powers. Former lover Martin Henderson and young son David Dorfman also fall into the trap of viewing the film and their lives become jeopardized as well. Together Watts and Henderson embark on a journey together to save their lives and save the life of their young son. Naturally mystery lies in every direction as the contents of the film are slowly presented in real life, but what symbolism do the striking images possess? "The Ring" is one of those odd films that really leaves more questions than answers. It is a disturbing film that has some dark imagery that will stick with you long after viewing it. The PG-13 rating is very misleading as this should have been an R hands down. The movie wants to be a darker version of "The Sixth Sense" and somewhat succeeds in that regard. However, "The Ring"'s tone makes it a film that bears sharp comparison to films like "Night of the Living Dead" (the 1968 version) and "Rosemary's Baby" in the fact that it relies more on confusion than clarity. The direction is solid, the screenplay is all over the map and Naomi Watts steals the show as she did in the equally confusing "Mulholland Dr.". While "The Ring" does not match the brilliance of Lynch's "Mulholland Dr.", it is still a striking work that ends up being a success by the last intense act. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I've been following the trend of films about films. Horror is an especially interesting case. In quick succession, we have had `Blair Witch' in which the tape and film embodied the evil and the act of filming brought it into being. That was followed by the even more clever `Witch 2' where the realities of video and film were separate and warring for control over there mere humans. In the following year we had four slasher films which employed the making of slasher films in their plot in varying degrees of reflexive sophistication.And now we have this which pulls out all the stops. In this version, a character supernaturally creates the video. The video plays a marvelously multipurpose role: as a film within a film, as the charm which saves the boy, as the charm which both contains and summons the spirit of the girl, and the useful device of showing it all to us.Along the way, we have heavy use of cinematic icons: water, the ring/well, the tree, the horses, the TeeVee. There is some skillful camerawork and clever use of height in the well and the barn attic room. Naomi Watts stars in her second film of this type where a character creates what we see and what we see is blurred with `reality.'The story is relatively simple: the intrusion of the film-within on the world of the `basic' film, starting with a fly within the video entering the world of the watcher. It all proceeds according to a pretty clear logic with Naomi entering the world of the girl (and vice versa) by steps until we see the daughter conflated with her son. The only breaking of the rules are those darned telephone calls.But the rest is from the self-reference playbook: the husband works in the film business, the wife in the `reporter' business. The sign of impeding death in the blurred camera. The whole mystery is unraveled by finding and looking at newspapers and videos.I saw this under the very best of circumstances: in an audience of about two hundred midteenagers at the 7:30 show. They came in groups sufficiently large to make them unruly and vocal. The swell and movement within the theater was extraordinary, which brings up a quandary fro the filmmakers. The self-reference of the story works best when this will be rented by small groups of teens for showing at home, and the larger market these days is rentals over the theatrical run. But the effect within a theater is notable. Clearly, they have their eye on the rental market because many of the effects could have leveraged the big screen at least as well as the original, especially when contrasting between the contained video and and video taking over the screen. Oh well. This is the first really obvious compromise -- in terms of artistic decisions -- in favor of the rental market I know.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing about THE RING - and there's a lot of good things in it - is that this is a horror film that doesn't insult your intelligence. Forget about that "don't go in that dark place/open the door to the creepy axe-murderer" kind of thing. You won't get any of that here, I promise.Basically, this is a story "? la Sherlock Holmes": there's a murder (actually 4 murders). In comes Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), the aunt of one of the victims. On the day of her niece's funeral, she meets some of the teenager's friends that tell Rachel about this tape. Rachel's also a journalist and starts investigating the murders on her own. The clues will soon bring her to the possession of the accursed tape. She watches it. Then, everything gets really creepy.The photography is superb! The movie has a greyish hue all over it, making the story even more brooding and menacing. The setting is Seattle, a city already plagued by near constant cloudy and rainy weather. You get the feeling that Verbinsky's been watching a lot of Ingmar Bergman and Kubrik as inspiration. The shots, during the wake, with Aidan framed by the corridors and staircase reminded me o "The Shinning"; also, the way time goes by is very much "shinningish".The plot takes us through the investigation, as we watch Rachel Keller putting together the pieces around this puzzling death. At the same time, she has to come to grips with her child - Aidan, who never calls her "mum" - and her estranged ex-boyfriend, Noah.When finally Rachel puts the puzzle together, it still doesn't make sense. We can't understand how did that tape got recorded in the first place. This was the reason some people criticized the film, but it goes to show that sometimes you don't need to show everything. Suffice to say that the murderer is not human.Kudos to the director and the crew, and also for superb performances all around. This film has a great dramatic depth and a lot of character development, even though the story centres more on the investigation than the synergies between characters. The plot goes around the mystery, with great editing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling, Mature Horror Film of Depth and Emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always puzzled over criticisms that this film is a soulless cash-in of a superior Japanese horror film, intended for low attention-span teenagers. While the original RING stands as a intensely horrifying ghost story on its own, it is safe to say that the American remake is its own fresh take on the same story, adding to the horror of the original with thematic complexity and penetrating subtext.The Japanese RING is effective because of the stark realism and dry terror it evokes; the remake takes the opposite route, taking on a nightmarish and surreal atmosphere. While RING steams forward to the final climax with menacing intensity, THE RING creeps forward with a languid, contemplative pace. Criticisms for being "slow" are inevitable, but to those who can appreciate it, THE RING ultimately benefits from the way it languishes on its vivid dreamscapes. One is not likely to forget the shot of the well, bathed in blue, or the leaves lighting up "as if they were on fire." But my real point in writing this review is to praise the excellent adaptation this film is of its Japanese counterpart. Scriptwriter Ehren Kruger adds his own version to the legend behind the tape, replacing psychics with unnatural conceptions, and scandal with tragedy. Kruger also adds layers to the film, introducing arcing themes of parenthood, the nature of children, and empathy.Parenthood is examined in a number of places in the film. Naomi Watts' character, a crass and insensitive journalist, is also an uncaring mother, not wanting to acknowledge the distance between her and her son. Martin Henderson's Noah is a deadbeat dad, afraid of taking responsibility of the child. Jane Alexander, as the Moesko Island doctor, talks to Watts about her mentally retarded grandson. "We loved him anyway," she says. "It takes work. Some people have limits." She is indirectly talking about the Morgans, whose daughter shows them the worst-case scenario of becoming a parent. The extent to which they go when dealing with their child is horrifying. Aidan and Samara have a subtle relationship in that they are both victims of parents struggling with their role as parents. It is finally the curse that leads Rachel Keller to take full role as a mother, and the empathy she creates with the neglected daughter Samara Morgan's plight ultimately reflects on her own son.There is a lot more to this film than one would think. The final climax with the television has its own dark edge, even with the superior climax of the Japanese RING edging it out. The final scene brings up a moral dilemma though that rivals the original in resonance.For added insight, watch the DON'T WATCH THIS feature on the DVD. There is one scene between Rachel and her sister Ruth that should not have been cut from the film: their conversation reflects directly another mother-child relationship and how "involved" a parent should be with their children.Great film, one of the best horror films in years. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not without flaws, but better than the Japanese original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having seen both the original Japanese "Ringu" (1998) and its American remake "The Ring" (2002), I found the latter superior in almost every aspect (atmosphere, cinematography, effects, soundtrack, acting, pace), though the script is in the usual Frankenstein-style of contemporary U.S. horror films -- borrowed pieces from everywhere put together with visible stitches all over.The original "Ringu" is part of the "new trend" in Japanese horror films (and since then imported by the U.S.) that goes like "when everything seems the quietest...when you're least expecting...it's precisely then that...NOTHING happens!" (add loud metallic noises). The cinema of anti-climax!! "Ringu" was full of these anti-climaxes, with an annoying slow pace, but it had other major problems: a very unsympathetic male lead character with Cronenbergian "Dead Zone" ESP powers played by a deadpan actor (in the American remake this far-fetched stuff is left out); perfectly expendable characters (such as the grandfather); several plot holes impossible to come to terms with (even more than in the US version), culminating in a very confusing third act.The American remake has several assets of its own: a trimmer pace; lovely and charismatic British/Australian actress Naomi Watts; fine attempts at creating haunting images (the breathtaking horse sequence on the boat; Samara's psychiatric treatment; and especially the "short film on the videotape" itself, a gem of surrealistic inspiration and telegraphic efficiency -- no wonder, as director Gore Verbinski was a highly successful publicity director). However, there are some letdowns too, especially those impossible phone calls (how DO you explain them at ALL? Who cares?) and some of the cast (the male lead, insipid; and the boy who plays Naomi's son, creepy beyond any sympathy). Not "revolutionary", but with subtler, richer shades than the usual U.S. noisy, in-your-face-special-FX brainless horror routines and much more exciting than the anti-climax Japanese modern horror films. My vote: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A captivating and terrifying mystery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, it's important to know that this movie is an American remake of the Japanese 1998 film, Ring (which I'll call by its literal title Ringu for this review), which is itself based on the novel of the same name by Koji Suzuki. The critical and commercial success of The Ring brought in a whole slew of remakes of J-Horror movies, like Dark Water, Pulse, One Missed Call, and most successfully, Ju-On The Grudge(both the original and remake are quite good, though the original is perhaps a little better). And this is a remake that outshines the original.The plot is simple; Rachel, played by Naomi Watts and her ex-husband Noah, played by Martin Henderson, have a week to answer the mystery of a cursed videotape, which has claimed the lives of several teenagers. Telling anymore spoils the mystery, which is the heart of the movie. A fair bit of it is different from Ringu, but for the majority, these changes are far better for the movie. The intrigue of the tape and it's background is the real grip of the movie. The contents of the tape itself are incredibly disturbing, and at first appear as a seemingly random string of images. Each little piece gets slowly revealed to the viewer, and you begin to piece it all together, without the film telling it all to you. You solve the mystery and are invested in it just as much as our heroes. And thankfully, these heroes are excellently played. Watts performance of Rachel is a grounded, level-headed, and intuitive one, making Rachel a sleuth in all but name. Henderson brings some much-needed humour to the earlier parts of the movie before the horror starts to creep in, but soon reveals a versatile and human nature to Noah. Brian Cox (without saying too much) also has a few unfortunately brief, but powerful scenes, that bring real gravity to the situation. Our villain probably has less than 15 minutes of screen time, but her presence is constantly felt throughout the last half. The other actors aren't all that much to write home about however. They're far from bad, but instead feel only like links to where the plot will take the mystery, or to tell you about some dark event. The Ring is a great balance of mystery and horror. While Ringu perhaps focused too much on the mystery, and could only scare you a handful of times, The Ring has scares spaced out sporadically to keep you on your toes. There are jump scares, but a lot of the terror is from what you don't see. As mentioned earlier, you constantly feel the villain's presence, just breathing on the back of your neck. The soundtrack is unnerving, and the music that you would expect to play in the calmer moments is distorted, just to remind you that things are never safe. Two scenes in particular start with an almost mundane scenario, and soon escalate to something nightmarish (one of them I had to pause the movie for a few minutes).Now to air out a few of the bad things, but these are almost petty. The child actors are...well, child actors. They're not amazing. But for what they have to do, they do it well enough. Much of the film also has a green hue to it, but I suspect this was because it came out no long after the Matrix, and being green was the thing. Viewers may also find parts of it quite confusing. I saw Ringu and read the book before seeing this, so I knew the plot fairly well, but I can understand anyone's confusion. The Ring is a fantastic film, combining elements of a classic mystery and psychological horror. You'll be on the edge of your seat throughout/ The Ring eclipses Ringue in my opinion, though I know many who might disagree. Ringu worked really well for a book. But The Ring works even better as a movie. If you like a good mystery, some unknown terror, or just watching a good movie, The Ring is one of my highest recommendations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The seventh day is a day of permanent rest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ring" (2002) is a horror movie with a pretty decent story about an embodied ghost that acts up against new victims because of the way in which it was murdered and left to die when human. There's more to it, of course, and it involves a detective story as reporter Naomi Watts, who is personally involved and scheduled to die in 7 days, seeks to unravel the mystery and save herself and child, David Dorfman. A kind of curse is involved in that people die 7 days after viewing a videotape. This video might be the best thing in the movie. It's a film within a film, and it's done in a great surreal style that harks back to the German expressionist horror films combined with surrealist images. This part was so artistic that when the film goes into the standard visual vocabulary of our own era, it looks quite stodgy and ineffective much of the time. I mean that the direction and camera work does almost nothing creative in using the available expressionist and surreal tools that are available. The movie is commercial Hollywood and it would be risky to film it along more creative lines, I suppose, or maybe the director simply didn't have the know-how to frame and edit the picture differently. SO what we see is typical edits, camera motions, and framing and it doesn't really deepen the story visually. This story needed more daring in being brought to the screen.Naomi Watts was excellent in "Mulholland Drive". Here she seems more stuck in one groove, one emotion and one open-mouthed expression, and that gets wearisome after awhile.I don't scare easily in watching movies, so you can't go by me. I didn't find this especially scary. In some horror films, I get goose pimples or involuntary chills in places. This happened once to me in this film. I'm a fan of old horror films (Universals and such), but my enthusiasm wanes sharply somewhere in the middle of the Hammer output. I'm unsure what makes a good horror film. I'm not at all sure that scaring the audience is the main thing. The mystery of it and reaching beyond that creates uncertainty in everyday life because of the unknown forces and powers -- these may be more solid criteria. "The Ring" has a good deal of those.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality of Horror and Plot over Quantity of Bad Horror is This Movie's Focus, and it Works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring is a horror crime drama about a video tape that, if watched, will lead to death in seven days. It's a decent plot for a horror movie, and for the most part is quite well done. The plot is, like I said, well done. It's not what you'd expect from a horror movie, as it's more focused on the mystery of the horror over actually scaring you. There aren't actually that many scary parts in this movie. So as far as the plot goes it was done in a more original way, and it was interesting to watch. The story of the horror itself wasn't terribly original, but it was good nonetheless. The characters were pretty good, especially the main character. She's not a complete idiot (unlike in most horror movies), and she makes choices that are understandable. She does some stupid stuff, but nothing that would make her anything like the average horror movie girl. Everyone else is fine. There's enough screen time for them to show you what they're like, and there's only three major ones. The other ones you know aren't important so they aren't focused on. The horror itself is good. There aren't a whole lot of cheap jump scares, and most of them are more startling and scary because of how the scary thing looks, not because of the surprise. As for how scary it is overall, it really isn't usually. If you're looking to be scared, you probably won't really be by this one. Overall The Ring is good. It's an original take on the horror genre that I really appreciated, and while it isn't fantastic it's still very good. I'd certainly recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror, just don't expect some lame average horror, because it's anything but.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me and my friend were talking about horror movies and he suggested this one and it was quite good!The story itself - I guess - is similar to many of other horror stories and movies. I actually thought that the end of the movie was when she 'rescued' the girl from the well and you see the reporter with her love interest sitting on some old bench. OK, so she did a good thing - 'heard' the little 'evil' girl and now that the wrongdoing is kinda redeemed, everything can be as before. I was wrong! That is the beginning of the twists that happen in the last 6, 7 minutes of the movie and last two minutes being the ultimate twist!I liked that the movie was entertaining from the beginning to the end. I did not expect the ending to be what it was! Actually, at one point I thought that the little evil girl is now grown up ( not dead or in the mental institution) and that it is the girl who moved to the apartment of the reporters ex love interest ... I did expect however the drawings of the kid to be explained. Especially the last ones he was drawing on the floor - the big black hole. But it was not. There were too many drawings circulating in the movie with not really clear connections or purpose - at least, I believe. So, I do wonder what they all mean and above all why the faces of the girls / people were blackened / distorted. I mean, OK, you can say it is the evil presence / force, but ... I saw that there is the part two, so will probably see it tonight. I know the sequels are almost never as good as original movies, but... Will give it a try.Eight for this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is surprising to say this movie didn't really scare me. The Ring is about a woman who comes across a video tape that seems to be causing the deaths of people who die seven days after viewing the tape. It's probably my own fault I waited too long to see this movie. I have seen so many horror movies that this film didn't really scare me. However that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It has a good story and some really effective imagery. I was not scared but I was pretty creeped out. In my opinion if you have yet to watch this film and if you are easily scared watch it. But if you are not easily scared watch this with a group of friends so they can get scared and you will have a good time with it. It does have its ups and downs but it was an okay horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring (2002): Dir: Gore Verbinski / Cast: Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, David Dorfman, Brian Cox, Amber Tamblyn: The title doesn't really represent what the film is about. It is beautifully crafted with dazzling production values and intriguing plot setup that somehow falls deep in the well of despair by its conclusion. It is a mind exercise about a video tape that kills its viewers after seven days from initial viewing. How it does this is never explained, and we never learn who's voice it is on the other end of the phone. Fear Dot Com had a similar idea that was even worse. It opens with the death of a teenage girl whose face is masked in terror. Naomi Watts plays a single mother and journalist who seeks answers and tension rises when she ends up viewing the tape in order to move on with the case. She seeks help from her ex-husband, a video processor who also views it. Directed by Gore Verbinski who has done worse than this. He made The Mexican as well as a wretched little number called Mouse Hunt. Here he is backed by visual elements and creative plot turns that fail to make sense of it all. Naomi Watts holds her own while Martin Henderson is effective in his collaboration. David Dorfman as her son fears that he too is at risk. Other roles are not as broad or are just plain strange. The film contains visually striking images that add to the film's pointless and warped presentation. Score: 5 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gore Verbinski's The Ring is a commendable effort of chilly atmospherics and bleak grey cinematography, with a nice central performance by Naomi Watts. Before I get scolded for giving this airtime when it's based on a Japanese fright flick, I've seen that one and I think this is the stronger film (same goes for The Grudge). It's just got such a personality all its own. Watts plays Rachel, a journalist who stumbles on an eerie mystery after a suspicious death in the family. She's led to a videotape containing stark, disturbing black and white images, a video tape that's purported to kill you in seven days upon watching it. She, of course, watches it, spurring on a delirious search for the truth behind it before it's too late. She's led from dreary, rain streaked Seattle to a remote horse farm on an island off the coast, the adopted home of a strange little girl with some vaguely terrifying abilities named Samara (Daveigh Chase, also Donnie Darko's little sister and Lilo from Lilo and Stitch). Underrated Martin Henderson plays a colleague who helps her out in the investigation, and creepy little David Dorfman is her strange kid. Brian Cox, as Samara's adopted father, walks away with his segment of the film, giving him fierce heartbreak and fear. Heart stopping secrets are unleashed, and the threatening presence grows and follows Rachel. I like that the film never really clarifies exactly what is wrong with Samara, just makes it very clear that it's something very wrong, which for me is much scarier than spelling it out in bland exposition. There's some skin crawling moments in this one, mostly iconic now, but I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it and will say no more than the sequences involving a well, a television and of course the omnipresent video tape are highlights. It all looks fantastic too, the colours absent in favour of a suffocating monochromatic tone, punctuated occasionally by gasping breaths of red in the fall colours at the motel she visits, and a few other moments of brief vibrance among the gloom. A true fright flick that takes its time, ratchets up a slow, mounting fear, and releases it in short bursts of stinging shock moments, bridged by lapses of pure atmosphere.</fullReview>

According to legend, the video tape kills those who watch it in seven days.

The cast is led by Naomi Whats, Martin Henderson and David Dorfman, in the role of Rachel, her ex-boyfriend Noah and their son Aidan, a child who has an intelligence higher than normal for his age. Naomi Whats deserves a certain prominence, having got here one of the most memorable performances of her career to date.Adapting for the screen a novel by Koji Suzuki, this film has a very interesting soundtrack, which further deepens the suspense and expectation, that are just right for lovers of this refined kind of terror.

		<fullReview>Maybe I'm just getting old and have seen too many horror movies through my lifetime, but this one failed to impress me.It was very formulaic - tension in the right places, and times that made you jump, but that doesn't make a good horror story. I am a fan of this genre but feel this one offers nothing new. Even the acting performances weren't particularly notable.I am quite capable of suspending belief for the sake of a good horror movie, but saying that, some of the reactions to certain situations just didn't add up for me. There were too many flaws - style over substance. It might have more appeal to younger people who haven't seen a huge selection of the horror genre yet. I really would like to be more complimentary - sorry!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Scary After All These Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been 13 years since The Ring was released, and yet, somehow, the film holds up incredibly well. Maybe not in terms of technology, but in terms of scares, it's one of the best out there. I remember watching the film as a teen and immediately regretting my poor decision. Having recently rewatched it, the film still managed to get under my skin, and for good reason: The atmosphere is palpable, and a sense of dread is consistently sustained from the first scene through the end credits. And let's talk about that first scene featuring a young Amber Tamblyn who, nowadays, is instantly recognizable. What a scene to grab an audience's attention! Haunting and unpredictable, it's no surprise The Ring's opening is considered to be one of horror's best, easily as good as the ones from Scream and Jaws.Despite its scares, The Ring is also a surprisingly beautiful looking film, and with a $48 million price tag, it should be. Unlike most horror films these days, cinematographer Bojan Bazelli provides some amazing compositions and frames every scene with unexpected allure, even though the film is filled with plenty of disturbing imagery. Of course, director Gore Verbinski should also be given credit for the film's success. Rarely have I seen a horror film in which all of its moving parts worked together so well. From the production design, performances, the aforementioned cinematography, editing, and soundtrack from Hans Zimmer, it's like witnessing a master who actually understands the language of film.As for the screenplay, writer Ehren Kruger of... (wait for it) the Transformers films, gives time for the story to breathe and build, an uncommon characteristic for a horror flick. Kruger also cleverly writes in an familial subplot that provides an emotional underpinning for its characters. What people tend to forget about The Ring is that even though it's about a journalist trying to solve the mystery behind a cursed tape, it's also about a broken up family that slowly comes together in the wake of a crisis. Because of that, I will say that the ending is unnecessarily cruel and unearned, providing a twist that pulls the rug from under the audience just for the sake of doing so.Still, lead Naomi Watts is able to carry the film on her shoulders through and through. In spite of not being a notable actress at the time, her impressive performance as the strong-willed Rachel quickly put Watts in the mainstream spotlight. Martin Henderson and David Dorfman also provide memorable performances as the remaining members of the family, though it's disappointing to see Henderson has yet to reach A-list status as Watts did. He provides the charisma, charm, and humor required for the role. Cameos from veteran actors Brian Cox and Jane Alexander also raise the film to another level, and both are terrific in their limited screen time. Overall, The Ring is an unnerving yet gorgeous film, supported by an assured direction from Gore Verbinski and a breakthrough performance from Naomi Watts. Who says PG-13 horror can't be scary and well made?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This stunning American adaptation of Japanese novel "Ringu" bucks the horror movie trends of jump-scares and torture porn in favor of creepy, muted atmospherics and hypnotic psychological chills. Director Gore Verbinski and screenwriter Ehren Kruger move the setting to Seattle and the San Juan Islands, which Verbinski films in gorgeous, washed-out grays and greens occasionally punctuated by sunlight and blood, both of which are used sparingly. The effect is to make the film seem almost black &amp; white, like the videocassette recording that kills you a week after you watch it. Naomi Watts leads a superb cast as the journalist investigating the unexplained death of her niece and perfectly combines both the grit and determination of an intrepid reporter and the growing fear and desperation of a mother trying to protect her child from a malevolent force she can't completely grasp. Happily, the movie doesn't try to wrap everything up in a neat package -- it gives you enough information for its central themes and mysteries to resonate hauntingly, but doesn't try to explain away every last detail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring is a classic horror film of the 2000s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rachel (Naomi Watts) is a journalist who investigates a mysterious video tape that purportedly kills its viewer 7 days after watching it. The Ring is an American adaptation of the Japanese horror film Ringu. Following the success of this movie, it spawned its own sequel and introduced the Western audience to J-horror adaptations, notably The Grudge. There's intense tension, scares and mood developed in this film that are still palpable every time you watch. In doing so, director Gore Verbinski shapes a timely narrative about communal disconnect, modern alienation and the all-conquering power of technology with this adaptation. Naomi Watts delivers a superb performance as Rachel and I'm so glad it propelled her into mainstream consciousness. Martin Henderson too is equally on form as Noah, her confidant.No matter how many times I've seen it, I enjoy watching this film. The Ring is a classic horror film of the 2000s, if not 'the' classic horror film of the 2000s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very scary remake that is even scarier then the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Ring' is based on the Japanese novel originally called 'Ringu' written by Koji Suzuki in 1991 and was made into a Japanese movie in 1998. This is by far the creepiest Japanese horror movie remake I've seen. It is the story about a young woman who finds a a cursed video tape and watches it, then she finds out that she will die in seven days so she must solve the mystery behind the cursed tape.Everything about this movie is creepy, especially the scenes when Rachel (Reiko Asakawa in the original Japanese version) watches the video tape which wasn't very scary in the original Japanese version to the scene when Samara (Sadako in the original Japanese version) which is a lot scarier in this version. The special effects are really good for the film, and Naomi Watts is brilliant as Rachel considering she won a Saturn Award for her performance. This is a very good remake that is even scarier then the original. I give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best horror film out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, you should know that 'The Ring' is the American remake of Japan's 'Ringu'. That being said, I think that this is one of the best remakes ever. In my personal opinion, I think that 'The Ring' is a far better movie than 'Ringu'. Not only is it superior in acting and storyline, it also features better effects and a darker tone overall.I think that this movie is what all other horror flicks should strive for. It sets a very dark atmosphere from the very beginning and does a brilliant job at delivering hopelessness throughout its entire duration. It never reveals too much, as so many films nowadays tend to and gives you just enough eeriness to keep you hooked to the screen, waiting for the next hint at what the story behind the mysterious videotape is.It's honestly the most suspenseful film of its genre and I would recommend watching it as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anachronisms abound...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it's only little over a decade old, THE RING is chock full of anachronisms: a VHS tape (analog, as opposed to the current digital dvds); a newspaper reporter who actually goes out and hunts down a story; a newspaper; a newspaper that actually prints the story that the reporter turns in; an implicit warning about the horrors of watching too much television; etc. Although it's an "Americanized" remake of a Japanese Fright Film, it's not dumbed down in the traditional manner of American remakes: it's superbly crafted, with some fine performances throughout; there's even a bit of suspense along the way. The opening scenes culminate with a real zinger (it surprised me back when I first saw it, and I was already familiar with RINGU). The makeup is VERY effective, by the way. Anyone who watches the tape that triggers the Horror has seven days to get their Earthly affairs in order. Rachel (Naomi Watts), the reporter, makes the mistake of showing the tape to her ex and, later, leaving her son alone with the tape- which he, too, watches. At this point, it's a race against Time as the Otherworldly occurrences commence. When Rachel tracks down the man ultimately responsible for everything, Morgan (Brian Cox), he tells her: "You take one person's tragedy and force the world to experience it. You spread it like a sickness." It's Morgan's dead daughter who's back from the dead, a "horse whisperer" who hated being in the barn with the horses that the Morgan family bred. THE RING is one of the better Fright Films of decades past, and it's still worth a look Today. (Note: Yet another comment has been censored.

		<shortDescription>Darkly Beautiful Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gore Verbinski's 'The Ring',released in 2002, still possesses a distinct eerie quality which continues to effectively creep out audiences 12 years after it's initial release. This is largely due to the wise directorial choices made by 'Pirates of the Caribbean' director Verbinski in shifting the focus away from gore and more on atmosphere.What sets 'The Ring' apart from most horror movies of today and recent years, is the emphasis put on atmosphere, visuals and suspense, much unlike popular films such as the 'Saw' franchise, which rely more on gore and gratuitous torture scenes to shock or scare the audience. Unlike the 'Saw' sequels(or even 'The Human Centipede')which are just excuses to show people being killed in graphic and disturbing ways, 'The Ring' hooks you in with a compelling and interesting story with revelations and discoveries made one after the other. Technically, the film unfolds like a mystery, with reporter Rachel Keller(played sturdily by Naomi Watts) investigating the curse of a strange videotape and the dark secrets it possesses. No more will be said about the plot, as the fun of watching the film for the first time is discovering the secrets of the tape. A second viewing is where one can be more able to appreciate the enormous amount of craft and effort put in by Verbinski and his production team, which is where much of the beauty of the film lies.'The Ring' is set in Seattle and surrounding Pacific Northwest locales, which gives the film an exceedingly rainy and gloomy look. The filters and colour schemes that Verbinski and cinematographer Bojan Bazelli employ to capture these locations is of a sickly green and blue tint, which makes the look of the whole movie appear somewhat unnatural, or 'off', which is subtle but extremely effective in it's own right.The score, by renowned composer Hans Zimmer, is absolutely brilliant in evoking different moods throughout the film. While there are the somewhat typical loud booms in the soundtrack when something frightening or tense is occurring on screen, it is the quieter segments of the score that give the film it's unique and beautiful sense of melancholy. Zimmer employs many types of instruments, including effective use of the piano, to give 'The Ring' a haunting quality that echoes with sadness and despair, with sinister violins succeeding in painting an atmosphere of dread, while in contrast pianos and other instruments combine to create the melancholy atmosphere. There are even segments of the score, for example a grim lullaby from one of the film's characters, that actually give the film an almost fairytale like quality. The eight minute track from the score, entitled 'The Well', represents a fantastic overview of most of the musical ideas explored by Zimmer, and is a great listening experience in itself.The core theme at the heart of the film is the negative side of television. For example, the two(rather clichd) teenage girls at the beginning of the film discuss how the unhealthy waves from watching too much TV can result in brain cell loss. Later in the film, Rachel is out on the balcony looking into the adjacent apartments across the street. The camera pans over several windows, showing people transfixed to the television screen, accompanied by Zimmer's sad and moody score. And finally, the television acts as the bringer of death to a major character. Since television is such a large part of contemporary daily human life and culture, 'The Ring' shows us a glimpse of the negative side of it and portrays the television as a gateway to another, sinister world that could potentially have the power to kill us. By having the story focus on something as universal as television, 'The Ring' has the power to unsettle basically anyone.One amusing thing about the film is how much of a product of it's time it has now become, mostly due to the fact that the main plot device is a VHS tape(Remember those?). Since VHS tapes are now a thing of the past and have since been succeeded by DVDs and Blu-rays, some plot holes in the narrative do come to mind if you think about it for a bit. But never mind. The movie is too beautifully made and creepy to get nitpicky over, complete with a bleak and terrifying non-ending that will get you thinking, 'will it ever stop?'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best American remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider "The Ring" to be a classic now. It's scary, suspenseful, and engaging. The twists and turns of the story keep you guessing even in the slower parts of the film. "The Ring" is really more of a mystery with some elements of horror than straight-up horror. There are definitely some very scary scenes such as the opening scene and when Samara comes out of the TV, but the film is really about trying to crack the curse. The fact that the main character, Rachel, only has seven days to break the curse adds an extra level of tension. "The Ring" also has great acting from the entire cast, and the cinematography is amazing. This really isn't the sort of movie that resorts to jump scares and excessive gore to scare the audience; it's all about tension and atmosphere. "The Ring" is definitely one of the better, if not, the best remake of an Asian horror film. It's really one of the best horror movies of the 2000's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dare you to watch this movie and not be afraid of your own TV a week forward. Or at least look at it with caution. As if it would betray you. As if you are afraid to happen to see something you shouldn't have seen.It doesn't matter how many times i see this movie, the atmosphere of it gives me the chills every time. The performance is flawless from everyone involved. It does not rely on cheap jump scares or shaky cam or the recent find footage trick. The find footage in the movie is actual find footage and is important to the story. Many horror-movies tried to copy its formula for the years to come. Iwould say that even paranormal activity was inspired by it. All fails to comparison to the ring. Only one that came close was the grudge.I've never seen the original Japanese version, but I never felt the need to do so after watching the remake, simply because I was satisfied and scared at the same time. A movie 12 years old that still captures you in the moment and gives you the chills. Thats an achievement!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be fair, this movie did have decent acting, good special effects, some creepy moments (emphasis on the horse under the boat), and good soundtrack. The plot, from what I can figure out, is that a woman tries to solve the mystery of a video tape that causes anyone who views it to die within seven days. That is an interesting plot but it was hard throughout the movie to understand what was going on. It also stretched out and got very boring at some parts. I might re-watch it because I'm not sure I got all the details. It's not a bad movie, 2002 was a great year for horror movies, but my friend and I watched it together and neither of us could really understand much in it.You've gotta give them credit for that scene with the poor horse going under the boat though, that was scary as heck and really disturbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric and mysterious but not without faults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ring" is the Hollywood adaptation of the 1998 Japanese film "Ringu", which was itself based on the novel of the same name by Kji Suzuki. I haven't read the novel, nor have I seen the original film, so I can't comment on the faithfulness of this adaptation. My only point of comparison for this review is other genre films.In that regard, "The Ring" is a cut above the usual horror fare. Relying more on atmosphere than cheap shocks, the movie engenders in the viewer a keen sense of unease. The central mystery of the story is absorbing and creepily presented.The story revolves around a videotape that somehow causes the death of anyone who watches it. When a young female journalist (Naomi Watts) sets out to uncover the mystery of her niece's death she ends up being exposed to the tape's malign influence. With just a week before her appointed death, she frantically attempts to unravel the mystery in an attempt to escape her fate.While the story is interesting, the cast isn't especially impressive; that is, apart from the beautiful and talented Naomi Watts. The male lead, Martin Henderson, isn't too bad but he seems to have been cast more for looks than acting prowess. Young David Dorfman contributes a pretty good 'creepy kid' performance but his character is a little underdeveloped. The always reliable Brian Cox is a welcome addition in support but most of the remaining players are satisfactory but nothing more.Gore Verbinski's direction is nicely handled with a good understanding of building tension and sustaining mood. The visuals are often creepy and the cinematography is appropriately gloomy. The score by Hans Zimmer is also a key part of the film's foreboding atmosphere.However, while the movie does several things right, it isn't perfect. There are at least a few scenes that are like something out of a more conventional, teen-oriented horror movie. The central mystery of the story also may be a bit too obscure for some viewers. The ending also seems a bit forced to me, coming from a time when last minute twists were particularly fashionable. I also feel that the final act extends the movie a bit beyond its ideal running time.Ultimately, though, "The Ring" is definitely one of the best horror movies of the last decade or so. The PG-13 rating shows that the movie's impact comes from carefully managed suspense rather than gratuitous gore. So, this movie should appeal to more than just horror fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely on my top 10 horror list. There are almost no clich moments (except for the "don't answer the phone" type of thing), and Samara is truly scary. Even though there is minimal gore, this film needs no blood to deliver chills and keep you up at night. The special effects, especially towards the end of the film when Noah is killed, are beautiful, and all the loose ends are tied up, so if something seems like a plot hole, it's guaranteed to make sense by the end. If you like mystery and horror, this combines the best of both worlds. Also, at the beginning of each day of the curse, an on-screen caption reminds you of the day count, increasing the suspense as Rachel races to understand the meaning of the tape before her time runs out. The only complaint I have is that the teenage girls in the beginning aren't the best actresses, but that doesn't even bring down the rating! After this movie, you'll be expecting your own phone to ring with a call saying that your days are (literally) numbered, good if you're looking for a mystery, a scare, or a bit of both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring - the only film to give me nightmares more than three times. The Evil Dead pulled it off twice, but the Ring? yeah, THREE TIMES! I first seen this film back in 2007 - it was around winter time, so it was presumably January/February. I was young, but old enough to point out a few things/understand a few things (here and there), and so on.Uh, so yeah. After watching the Ring I was left, well, quite like the woman that's found in the closet. That's what my face was like (you'll know if you've seen the film!)after watching it. I was creeped out to the maximum. It scared the life outta' me. Such a scary, haunting, creepy film with moments you'll not be able to get out of your head for a LONG TIME, depending in what you're scared of anyway.Quickly, i will say what the film's about: Two typical friends, Katie and Becca, are at home, when all of a sudden they start discussing a mysterious videotape that's said that if you watch it, you get a phone call once it's finished saying "you're going to die in seven days" and then, seven days later, after watching it, you die. Becca learns, seriously and suddenly, that her friend Katie watched the tape with a couple of friends at an inn cabin one week earlier, and that now, seven days later, it's the supposed date for her to die. After some mysterious, scary, and creepy (super)natural hauntings and happenings, Katie goes to her room only to be killed, suddenly, with her face turning slimy, yet pale, and green as she gets killed. Her mother asks her sisters who's a journalist named Rachel (Naomi Watts)to investigate the whole thing and find out WHO KILLED HER or HOW SHE (MYSTERIOUSLY) DIED! From there on, it's a pulse-bursting creepshow with haunting moments and very creepy happenings....8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best J-horror Remake ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Contains Spoilers* Based on the Japanese horror sensation "Ringu" the American remake "The Ring" launched the J-horror craze in the fall of 2002. Ever since several Japanese and Asian film have had remakes but none have had the power and success of "The Ring" Before you die you see the ring.Set in the wet and ominously gloomy city of Seattle single mother Rachel, played by Naomi Watts, works as a journalist who comes across the mysterious story of a video tape that has deadly consequences 7 days after watching it. Her son Aidan is a strangely mature and articulate little boy who seems deeply troubled but he is just another part in the thoroughly creepy and inventive story. The opening scene of two teen girls talking about the tape has been spoofed many times but effectively sets up the urban mythology of the killer tape and gets Rachel involved as the victim was a relative and one of Aidan's closest friends.7 Days.When Rachel starts to investigate she finds out that a bunch of teens that stayed in a cabin at some resort all watched the cursed video have all recently died. So what would be the logical thing to do? Watch the video of course. Rachel drives to the resort and stays at the same cabin, number 12, she views the short black and white video of bizarre images and immediately afterwards the phone rings. When she picks it up a voice echoes 7 days and the countdown begins. She enlists the help of ex-flame and current co-worker Noah to help her find out the origins of the tape.The technology portrayed in the movie is in that period where everybody still had the big tube television and VCR's were still hanging by a thread. Those two things made all the difference in making it as creepy and scary as it is. HDTV's and DVD's are just too cold and clinical. The old technology has a worn in grungy feeling that is indispensable. But also in a strange way the movie invented the term viral video.Their research has lead Rachel to a horse farm on a remote island where what's left of the Morgan family resides. The old patriarch Richard Morgan lives there alone with nothing to do but work the land. His wife Anna had committed suicide years earlier. But wait there's more, desperate for a child the Morgan's adopted a daughter named Samara. Now this is a creepy kid and the key to the cursed video. We learn the disturbing back story of Samara and the Morgan's and its Rachel's job to set things right and stop the curse. Then comes the clever twist that sets this movie apart and brings us the movies signature moment.Almost three years later we were given a lame duck sequel directed by the guy to did the original Japanese version. Needless to say the original stands alone as an entertaining and frightening experience.</fullReview>

After watching it, the person gets a phone call claiming that person will have only 7 days to live. It's a classic horror movie intro right down to the girls' school uniforms. It works surprisingly well for such a try and true setup.Rachel (Naomi Watts) is a single-mom reporter with a troubled son Aidan (David Dorfman) who lost his close cousin Katie recently. Rachel decides to help out by investigating the mysterious death. Only the mystery deepens when she gets a hold of the tape. She watches it and receives the creepy call from Samara (Daveigh Chase) telling her "7 days".The movie is able to carry the classic horror styles all the way through. It maintains the creepiness from the well made opening. Everything from the set design to the actual tape is made with the same creepy vibe. It also delivers something new to this genre. The Japanese original started the idea but this is a better made film. Even washing out the colors with blueish green creates its own unique creepiness. Naomi Watts is just so compelling, and David Dorfman looks so sickly. And the use of the ring motif also works. Just about everything works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring is a remake of the Japanese film Ringu . It can be classified as horror and thriller, the second category is the best classification. The film was released in 2002 and was directed by Gore Verbinski, the director of Pirates of the Caribbean. Everything starts when the niece of Rachel Keller dies in a completely strange way. At the funeral, she meets some friends of her deceased niece and during a conversation she discovers the existence of a tape, a legendary tape that supposedly kills all who watches it. Rachel then starts a race in search for truth. Her son Aidan is a young psychic who immediately senses that something wrong and paranormal is in this story. Rachel finds a copy of the dreaded tape, and skeptically, she just watched. At the exact second that the tape ends, the phone rings and a voice tells her that she has seven days. Then comes Noah, Aidan's father. He is more skeptical than Rachel and gets to mock the former partner for believing in the history of a tape that kills. He ends up watching the tape too, and because some strange happenings, he changes his minds about the veracity of the urban legend. The problem begins when Aidan, suffering from insomnia - probably caused by something supernatural - decides to watch the tape . Rachel finds him sitting on the floor of the room just when the last image passes. Then Rachel and Noah begin a journey to save their son. It's a real race against time to find out as much as they can about the tape and its motive to kill people. After several bizarre events and some deaths at the end of the film, Rachel unravels some of the mystery and save herself from the curse, she also manages to save her son. Gore Verbinski used and abused from oriental techniques to cause fear in movies. Terror of The Ring is the one caused by bodily mutilation or constant appearances of monsters. Terror is totally psychological, leaning on the great atmosphere of suspense that the plot provides. The movie has subliminal passages (in the passage of a particular scene to another, it is possible to identify the appearance of an image by fractions of a second) and a surrealist aesthetic with influence. The images on the tape are complex, a total nonsense at first glance, all carefully fitted to unravel the mystery(which by the way is just completely unraveled in the second film) the viewer can understand the meaning of each. Moreover, the shadows of the actors were taken to make a greater impact in the mind of the viewer. The film was highly praised, one of the few remakes that did not disappoint. The only criticism made very soon after launch was towards the end, which was confusing for many. One needs to watch the film very carefully to understand (or else watch the second movie, there are almost all drawn) the whole story. On the issue of performance, David Dorfman gave a show. His way of interpreting a gifted and sensitive boy convinced and won. His interpretation was as good as Haley Joel Osment in AI Artificial Intelligence. Always serious and sentimental without many statements. Naomi Watts also played very well its role as sloppy and desperate mother. The plot has a few holes, for example, does not explain the relationship between the call and the curse. Also it uses much scares clich, with a tense music in the background and moments of silence. But even so it's a great film for those who enjoy suspense and mysteries to unravel. The "villain" in the end, is not that villain so. Recommend watching calmly, paying attention to the smallest detail to understand the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mysterious atmosphere makes this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ring" is a psychological horror film from 2002, an American remake of the 1998 Japanese film "Ringu", which in turn was based on the 1991 book. The story revolves around a VHS tape that is cursed: whoever watches it will die in seven days. A reporter (Naomi Watts) catches wind of it and watches the video. She starts to sense that the curse is real and tries to find the answer.Shot mostly in Washington state (with some parts in Oregon and California), "The Ring" is a polished film with a nice, haunting vibe, which can be attributed to the excellent cinematography, the thick forests and constant rain. Watts and Martin Henderson are worthy protagonists as well.Unfortunately, the back story of the ghostly girl is convoluted and too much is left unexplained (Why do horses go nuts on two occasions? Why is the little girl evil? Where did she come from? And the chronology of the back-story is hard to figure out), but maybe the answers are there if you rack your brains. I'll do that the next time I watch the film.Another positive is that the ghostly element is actually rather chilling. This is important to me because ghost flicks normally bore me. After all, what can an immaterial ghost do to you anyway? Not much except maybe make objects fly in a whirlwind of negative energy. So what's to be scared of? They're dead and can't do any significant harm. "The Ring" effectively changes this and makes the apparition frightful. Other films have followed suit, like 2004's "The Grudge" and it's sequels.Speaking of subsequent films, many of them have taken elements of "The Ring" and made better films, at least as far as the story goes; for instance, the excellent "From Within" (2008). But it's hard to beat the mysterious ambiance of "The Ring." Some complain about one or two false endings, but the movie couldn't end without revealing what killed the girl in the opening teaser.The film runs 115 minutes.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling, but doesn't resolve the issues it addresses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring is a horror movie about a video that kills people. If you watch it, you will experience hallucinations for seven days, and then die mysteriously. The movie's protagonist, a single mother named Rachel, watches the movie in the hopes of finding out what caused the death of her niece; but Rachel soon realizes that she is going to be the movie's next victim.In The Ring, we find that the video was created by a girl named Samara, an adopted child whose origins are never explained, much like Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights. But, while Bronte's novel shows Heathcliff's demented psyche to be the result of much harsh treatment at the hands of his adopted family, this movie shows precisely no explanation for how Samara came to be the satanic, sadistic child that the movie reveals her to be. She was adopted by a couple who wanted a child. Was this girl the creation of witches, or goblins, or Satan himself? There are hints that she is an aberration upon nature itself: her presence causes horses to go mad and pitch themselves into the ocean. Similarly, in Macbeth, the title character causes nature to go awry because, by murdering the king and taking his place, he has interrupted the great chain of being. But Samara, as far as we know, has committed no act that violates nature. She simply is a violation of nature, was born a violation of nature. Either that, or her adopted parents were extremely cruel to her, but nowhere in the movie is there evidence of such cruelty.The movie is a fantasy ? televisions turn on by themselves; people's images are distorted in photographs; a mysterious phone call informs Rachel, moments after she watches the movie, that she has "seven days" to live (couldn't she do *69 or something to determine the source of the call?). Yet it also does a remarkable job of imitating a detective story. One by one, the odd images of the videotape are all explained by what Rachel sees in her research. Unfortunately, her research never does more than lap the surface.How, for instance, did Samara create this videotape in the first place? How did she distribute it? Why does she attack people whom she does not even know? The ready answer is, "She is evil, it is her duty to do evil deeds." Rachel's ex-boyfriend Noah remarks, upon examining the videotape, that it does not read like a normal tape and that its lack of a proper imprint is like a person being "born without fingerprints." That captures Samara to a T: she has no fingerprints. She came from nowhere, she returned to the nowhere, and she insists on dragging people with her retroactively.Samara has no remarkable effect upon anyone's personality. She has nothing to say about the real world, or how people ought to live their lives. For all practical purposes Samara is not a person at all, but simply a monster whose form happens to be that of young girl. Rachel knows she will not bring her niece back from the dead; she watches the videotape out of curiosity, and love for her niece. Five minutes after she has watched the tape, the niece is as good as forgotten, because Rachel must protect her own life. She investigates for the sake of survival, and because the story behind the tape is, I must admit, moderately engaging and it arouses her curiosity. But we watch because the evil of Samara terrifies us. Ignorance has always been the chief source of fear: the less comprehensible the object, the more powerful the fear it inspires.This focus on the concept of fear lends itself to the fact that the movie is, in the end, about a videotape. Most people in the world have little or no idea how a videotape actually works. You pop it in the VCR, and the movie starts; you neither know nor care what happens inside of the VCR. It is only the image on the television ? the surface, not the depth ? that matters. In our modern world of information technology, we are farther and farther distanced from the inner workings of the mechanisms that daily serve us. We want only the images, not the wires and sparks within. And so this movie asks the question, "What happens when a videotape is possessed by a fantastical spirit? What kind of repairman do you call for that? He'd be just as confused as anyone else."The Ring contains no redemption, or morality; it is horror for the sake of horror. Needless to say it is not the first of its kind; but it is a half-hearted attempt to be something more. My problem with The Ring is not even that the movie raises questions and fails to answer them ? the questions themselves are never formed or articulated. Throughout the movie there is a loosely visited theme of families staying together, but neither Samara's family nor Rachel's family obtains the unity it deserves. "How can we live without any love?" Rachel's son Aidan seems to ask of the audience. Aidan alone seems determined to coexist with Samara, to live within the bizarre parameters that she has set. They are parameters we can neither see nor chart, but they are there, and Samara has provided a way to survive if you can figure out the route.There is no "ring" in The Ring; the title refers to something different, although you might figure it out before I did. Relationships between people end unhappily in this movie, but the evil of the videotape runs uninterrupted. Samara is, somehow, the absolute, and when the movie finishes her hold on the world has not been weakened. And although Rachel solves the mystery of Samara's effect on her adopted parents, Samara's origins remain a mystery, and the filmmaker shows no interest in solving this other, deeper mystery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie on the whole actually does not maximize its full potential in unleashing the full meaning of the ring(which is the outer lid of the well Samara was thrown in).The film had a good starting for its roller coaster ride as the beginning reveals a little of the tape which arouses the audience's curiosity and makes them want to watch it till the end to know what the tape actually is.Overall,the film was excellent in delivering the thrill and suspense.This film has the potential to open ways for another film which I think will be named The Room.This film will be based on The Ring,but for The Room it will be a girl who will be the victim.She will not be like Samara who drives the horses crazy and disturbs everything around her.I feel that the victim in The Room will be an innocent child.I feel that Samara in The Ring should actually be just like other children ,innocent children.This description will have more impact compared to Samara being a child who disturbs anything around her,which leads to the confusion of her adoptive mother pushing her into the well and the reason behind it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that the ring was one of the most interesting films i have ever watched. The 20 minutes at the start are brilliant, the director changed a few of the elements from the Japanese original for the better thanks of course to the higher budget. The end of the film is great too, one of the most inventive and genuinely frightening conclusions i have ever seen.Its these final exhilarating 20 minutes that almost make you forget about the painfully slow, dull and boring middle of the film. If ever a film has drawn attention away from what in the original was a great story this is it !!! Where as the Japanese version went by with a quick pace never dwelling on small details that have little bearing on the characters the Hollywood version labors over and over. I was honestly on the verge of tears when i thought the film was concluding.However, the ending saves what for first time watchers will agree was almost one of the biggest anticlimax's ever. All in all i can only say that if Hollywood script writers are struggling with the translation from japan to USA just set it in Japan. Better that than create a ridiculous insert in the storyline which not only bores viewers but at times makes no sense whatsoever.Is this film a horror ?..... yes ! is it scary ?..... not particularly ! 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so freaked out after watching this movie that I couldn't sleep for a month. There was tension in the film from start to finish with only a two minute bit of comic relief and then right back into it. I liked the story line and how they wrap it all together. I really liked the ending. It wasn't what I was expecting, I don't think anyone was expecting that, so it just made the movie that much greater. It doesn't have (and doesn't need) the gore of most horror movies these days. It is all in the mind. And let me tell you- some of the images they show you in the film are so disturbing that they stick with you for a very long time. Like I said, I couldn't sleep for a month after seeing this movie in theaters. Some people may laugh at me for that and say, "It's just a movie!" You think I don't know that?! Even still, those images haunted my dreams and stuck with me for a long time. In my mind- that makes a really great horror film, when it sticks with you and you just can't shake it off or forget it. And I will never forget The Ring. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, "The Ring" is the best horror movie yet. To me it wasn't scary, just suspenseful and creepy. Naomi Watts rock the role of Rachel. Whoever did Samara did great, too. Really, the only scary parts are the faces on Samara's victims. The tape is so very disturbing and they play it a few times. Definitely don't show to kids 13 or under, unless they are super mature and the have seen this kind of thing before. It might scare some kids who live in houses with wells, or barns, and it might scare them to not watch VHS or DVDs for a while.(But who watches VHS' anymore?) Great movie and I recommend buying it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider myself a horror movie lover, but so far no movie: old, new, classic or gory, can top "the ring". This movie is truly terrifying. After watching it there were many night i had to sleep with lights on, pretty embarrassing, but true."The ring" looks and feels real. The imagery just gets in your brain and you can't stop thinking about it. The tape itself is creepy and the reactions from all the characters are very close to real reactions (if it was real). The girl: Samara (Daveigh Chase), really nailed this role, she was scary, weird and creepy.I definitely recommend watching this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original. Creepy, yet inexplicably dull at points</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gore Verbinski's adaptation of the Koji Suzuki novel from a screenplay from script writer Ehren Kruger is certainly an improvement on the Japanese adaptation "Ringu" (1998). It's a very creepy film with some superb use of colour and grainy-camera work to create some very memorable and uncanny imagery. What runs down this remake is it's long run-time of just under two hours. It should have been shorter as there are many times when literally nothing is happening. And although this is obviously to add to the suspense, it actually becomes too intense at times as we are inevitably left hanging and baffled by the back-story that attempts to explain the origins of the video tape. Rachel (Naomi Watts) is a single-mother and a journalist who, after attending her 16 year-old niece's funeral who died suddenly, she hears rumours about an alleged video tape which her niece had watched with her boyfriend the week before. Her boyfriend has since died too in unusual circumstances. Word on the street is that if you watch the video tape, you'll get a phone call telling you that you'll die in seven days and of course, that's what has happened to this poor girl. Rachel launches her own private investigation, finds the video tape, and watches it. And sure enough, she gets the phone call, and when her son watches it (After she left the tape lying around the house) it becomes all the more important that she gets to the bottom of this curse as she begins to to uncover the origins of the video tape.The imagery on the video tape is probably the scariest aspect of this film. Verbinski employs some superb techniques here. The entire film has an overwhelming grey colour, which psychologically makes the viewer feel cold and tense. Naomi Watts is pretty good in the lead role, although Martin Henderson was a complete miscast as her estranged lover Noah. "The Ring" delves too much into the origins of the video tape in my opinion. The filmmakers neglected the well known artistic fact that the unknown is always more unsettling than what they can put on screen. Rachel's solo quest aided somewhat by Noah becomes very tedious and overworked as the camera just seems to linger agonizingly slow over certain scenes. The ending could have been altered slightly. The studio appear to have been keen in preparing us for the inevitable sequel, thus we are left with a cliffhanger type ending that just does not serve the plot any justice. In fact, it completely inhibits it. There are quite a few plot holes that the film attempts to just skim over, but they serve to just leave us baffled at the end wondering if these questions will be answered in the sequel."The Ring" is a mile better than the Japanese version of the novel. It's superior both cinematography and scare-wise. Credit to the film, it neglects gore in favour of atmosphere and supernatural tension. It's a pretty good film, however, in spite of all this, it cannot be denied that it is pretty dull and boring, particularly towards the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie does posses some really disturbing imagery, but the movie makers didn't rely on that, what they did was they made the story tasteful that will draw you the viewer in, the movie main plot may be ridiculous but the delivery is masterful, the cinematography and the effects were good enough and the movie delivers the chills that horror movies are suppose to make you feel.The problem with this movie will have to be the actors themselves, I felt they were not just the right set of people to have been used to deliver this movie, although Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean 1, 2 and 3) directing was masterful and was able to outclass the actors poor delivery you will still notice a lax that makes you wonder how greater this movie would have been if it had been done by other actors in it.Tagged as the best Japanese Horror remake ever, this movie is a remake of the 1998 Japanese horror film Ringu. The films are based on Kji Suzuki's novel named Ringu, the book is about a mysterious cursed videotape, which contains some disturbing images. After the viewer is done watching the tape, the viewer gets a call, upon which she hears a girl's voice telling the viewer that he/she will die in seven days.The movie plot is similar in foundation to that of the book, it features a journalist who is investigating the death of four teenagers, there is a weird tale going around that the death of this teenagers was caused by the videotape that they saw. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) the journalist took the tape home, and she and her son watched it (not intentionally though).Now Rachel has to race against time to save her life and her son's from a mysterious girl.The Ring was met with considerable amount of criticism but most of which were positive, it was also a financial success, production cost was 48 million and the move raked in over 240 million dollars, such numbers led to the studio making a second part to this wonderful horror movie. The sequel still bordered around the events of the first film, but it was not as good as the first.If you have not got the time to sit down to see this horror flick, maybe you should, just to get the fun of the chills, I guarantee that this movie will make you smile, smile in fear.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It all depends on how you define the word 'Scary'...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie offers me everything that I could possibly expect from a ghost story and more. A good plot line, a reasonably good amount of emotion from the characters and amazing camera works are just a few of the things that make this film so exceptional.If you ask me, the movie is frightening, not scary. It doesn't make you want to scream and run away while watching it. It just sends a shiver down your spine which I wouldn't say gave me a nightmare. It doesn't give you any cheap thrills but goes on with a vague presence of death and terror all along.The movie may seem a bit incomplete to a few people because the making of the Tape was never shown or even hinted towards. But I quite liked that part of the movie. Humans have been fascinated by the thought of ghosts from ages ago. We don't know how they work or what makes them tick. So withholding that bit of information from the audience is a well thought out idea.I could give the movie a 8 or 7, mostly due to it's overly clichd general outlook of it. But I suppose I'd just be lying to myself if I said that I didn't watch it at least 6 times. So, I award it a perfect 10.</fullReview>

The soundtrack is also interesting, containing a creepy tonality but fast paced tempo which provides the feeling that the viewer is unraveling a mystery. This movie has a few jumps, but what makes it great is the creepy atmosphere (greyish tint the whole time) and the psychologically induced terror. I imagine this movie was scarier when the tape format was more prominent, but this film is still worth watching. The Japanese version of this movie really created what most people today consider Japanese horror, and the American version is no slouch.

		<shortDescription>Easily the best true horror movie of the past 20 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since the horror genre reached its peak in the late 70s and early 80s, it has almost completely dropped off the map. There are movies branded as "horror" films, but they are either crummy rip-offs, sequels, or lame "slasher" movies that provide no atmosphere. Or, they are psychological thriller types like Silence of the Lambs, which is a great movie but barely fits into the genre. The truly great ones have told interesting stories while frightening us with the ugly side of our nature. The truly great ones, like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Exorcist, are unsettling enough to make a grown man like me have a little more trouble sleeping that night.The Ring is one of two horror movies of the past 20 years that I think are legitimately worth owning (the other being The Sixth Sense). It is a great movie for the same reasons that The Shining, The Omen, and The Thing are great movies ? because it is creative, it tells a great story, and it has great atmosphere. It also features a threat that you can't hide or run away from. The monster is scary because you don't get to see it for most of the movie. When you finally get to see the "monster" at the end, it is a spectacular, surprise climax ? one of my favorite horror scenes of all time. The Ring is highly unpredictable, and at the end, it has a meaning that is completely different from what you expected it to be. It is a movie that gets better the second time that you see it, because once you know how it ends, you notice the themes a lot better ? themes that are relevant and play off of the things that we see in our life that scare us.I have seen mixed opinions about whether The Ring is better than the original Japanese Ringu. It is rare that I say this, but in this case, the remake is better. If you ask me, a lot better. Why? In my humble opinion, it is because of the outstanding cinematography and production values that this movie showcases. The vibe of this movie is "David Fincher meets Twin Peaks". The sound effects, especially, are fantastic. The movie revolves around a mysterious videotape that is supposedly fatal to watch. When you finally get to see that tape, we see that it is nothing but a bunch of short, black and white video clips spliced together. But boy, is it creepy, and that is because of the sound that comes out of it. It is so creepy that if you hadn't been told how dangerous it was during the movie, you would immediately figure it out on your own.This movie does have one big weakness and that is the acting. Bryan Cox is in a brief supporting role, and he is good. Naomi Watts gives a somewhat flat performance as the main character. When she has to step up and show a bit of emotion, she doesn't do it very well. For the rest of the cast, it's no-name city. Watts's son and ex-boyfriend are equally "meh" in their performances. I don't mind that much though, because Watts's character dominates the screen time, and she is almost a passive observer. Although she has a personal stake in solving the movie's mystery, she spends almost all of the movie just asking people questions, researching, and watching.The Ring is a movie that deserves a score higher than the one that it has here on IMDb. I would give it a 10 to try and prop it up, but it's not quite a masterpiece like The Thing. I think that The Ring suffers a bit, public perception-wise, from having started the short-lived "Japanese horror" fad of the mid-oughts. Creepy ghost children became old hat almost immediately, so now this movie looks like just another flick that tried to score cheap thrill points by following along. What none of the other "creepy ghost children" movies like "Dark Water" and "The Grudge" ever had was an interesting reason for the creepy ghost children to exist, or an interesting story. The Ring has those in spades, along with the ability to make itself linger in your mind for a long time after you turn off the TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To this day, I have not watched the whole thing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was six years old when this film came out, and I can still remember my mom and my grandmother watching this film together, while I was told to go sit in my bedroom, or the other room. But of course, being the kid that I was, I would sneak peeks at the movie here and there, which me doing so would scar me unknowingly for life. As a kid you love television, I grew up with Spongebob and Winnie the Pooh, so being exposed to something like The Ring was something I had never experienced before, and growing up I always had my grandmother and mom telling me about Poltergeist, in which the Carolanne was sucked into the television, so you could only imagine how it was for me to watch a girl climb out of the television! I had nightmares for months, and every time I would close my eyes I would see Samara climbing out of the television, coming to get me. Every time the move was on television, I would stray away from it, I would eventually go on to watch the second one first, to which I had no problem watching, it wasn't in till I saw the first one on DVD at my grandma's friends house when I was around eleven, but even then, I ran out of the room as halfway threw the first scene, when the two teens are at home. I would have gone on for for four more years in till I watched it finally, and even then I was on the edge of my seat, with the blanket by me almost the whole time. It has been many months since I watched almost all of it on HBO, but I made it to the end where Samara goes after Naomi Watt's boyfriend in the movie, and that's where the channel was changed. I have still not seen the whole movie from start to finish, but I have been looking for it on cable everyone in awhile. This is a truly scary movie, and a great one at that, so that is why I gave it ten out of ten stars without seeing the full product first. I wouldn't let small children watch this movie though, it could give them recurring nightmares like I experienced. But I recommend this move to any horror fan, and anyone wanting to get a good thrill on a Friday night.</fullReview>

This may sound odd but I think the oval-shaped mirror is one of the scariest things I've seen in movies.Samara's story is an interesting one.

Needless to say, the legend proves to be true, the tape allowing the vengeful spirit of freaky murdered girl Samara to literally scare viewers to death.As someone who can actually be bothered to read sub-titles, I generally dislike it when Asian horror hits are remade to appeal to a Western audience, particularly since very few of them turn out to be as effective as the originals. Gore Verbinski's The Ring, however, is a genuinely worthy effort, because instead of simply being a quick Hollywood 'cash-in', it is actually a lovingly crafted movie.Storywise, Verbinski's film stays fairly faithful to Hideo Nakata's Ringu and effectively replicates its creepy atmosphere, but The Ring avoids being just a slavish copy by expanding on certain plot points, providing a few crowd pleasing jump scares along the way, and best of all, by being as visually impressive as possible, with coloured tints and CGI effects used to great effect throughout (I usually moan about such things in modern horror films, but here they actually work).I wouldn't go as far as to say that The Ring is better than the original, but I think it is equally deserving of a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring will inevitably be compared to Hideo Nakata's original, and I'd say both end up about even, with tradeoffs between the various things they add or subtract. The original's snappier pace meant fewer indulgences in atmospherics, which are in full effect in the more leisurely remake; the backstory in Nakata's film is fairly airtight while Verbinski and screenwriter Ehren Kruger don't smooth over all of their narrative potholes. But what make both films work is the same: the creepy exploration of the unknown and unexplainable, which is far more frightening than the violent killings that typify most horror films, particularly ones that come out of the big studios this time of year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring is a psychological horror film that stars Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson together with David Dorfman,Daveigh Chase,Brian Cox, Jane Alexander,Lindsay Frost,Amber Tamblyn,Rachael Bella and Shannon Cochran.The movie was a remake of the Japanese horror film Ring. It is based on Koji Suzuki's novel Ring and focuses on a mysterious cursed videotape which contains a seemingly random series of disturbing images. After watching the tape, the viewer receives a phone call in which a girl's voice announces that the viewer will die in seven days. It was written by Kji Suzuki,Ehren Kruger and Scott Frank.Also,it was directed by Gore Verbinski.The Ring starts when a strange videotape begins making the rounds in a town in the Pacific Northwest.It is full of bizarre and haunting images, and after watching it, many viewers receive a telephone call in which they are warned they will die in seven days. A handful of teenagers who watched the tape while spending a weekend at a cabin in the mountains scoff at the threat, but as predicted, they all die suddenly on the same night. Rachel Keller, the aunt of one of the ill-fated teens, is a journalist who has decided to investigate the matter and travels West with her young son, Aidan, a troubled child who has been drawing pictures of strange and ominous visions. Rachel managed to find the cabin in the woods and watches the video herself; afterward, she receives the same phone call, and realizes she must solve the puzzle of the video and the person or persons behind it within a week. Rachel turns to her ex, Noah, an expert in video technology, who at first is convinced the story is a hoax until he digs deeper into the mystery.The Ring is a horror movie made not only to scare the viewer in front of their TV screen but it also has a story to tell.The creepy exploration of the unknown and unexplained is far more frightening than the violent killings that typify most horror films.Also,brilliant acting was prominent in the movie as the characters involved have depth.The visuals were also effective as it will definitely put somebody at the edge of one's seat.Overall,The Ring is one scary movie with a great story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Ring is Solid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What you get here is a stylish horror film that is, stunningly, better than the Japanese original. Are there plot holes here and there? Sure. Is the kid annoying? Absolutely. Do we need a little old lovers' conflict brought up, or young dad anxiety? Nope. None of that hurts the movie, really, chiefly because of Watts' wonderful performance and, again, the style. It is easy, in fact, to make light of 'The Ring' because of association with all the rip-offs afterward. But - it's just damn good. It moves in a fine arc, presents truly creepy visuals, and goes where it needs to go. As a plus, Noah, the ex, is hot. You even get the marvelous Jane Alexander. 'The Ring' isn't absolutely brilliant, but it's the best American horror film to come along in a long, long, long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect with this film, but I didn't expect what I got. Again, I was expecting this to be scary and it wasn't. I'll admit at the beginning I was like weeing myself thinking it was going to be really scary. Then as the film carried on it just didn't get scary. I mean it was scarier than the likes of paranormal activity (absolutely shockingly bad) but it wasn't great. I thought that it was very clever when you see all the things that were linked into the film. I was really shocked to find out that it was the actually the mum who killed her. I think the ending was silly when she found her in the well and she came back to life and killed that guy. It did freak me out a little when she found the girl in the cupboard but overall I would give The Ring 6.5/10, it is a good film with a clever story-line and is okay for ages 13+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is no tacky Hollywood cash-in horror film, this is the real thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's so hard to explain the premise of The Ring without making it sound dumb, so I'll be brief and then get to why it is so good.First up though: The Ring is the best remake / reimagining / reboot or whatever you wanna call them in the last decade. Films like this and Dawn of the Dead justify the 573 crappy films that come out every year trying to capitalise on the skill and/or success of other films.The Ring starts with a mystery VCR Cassette that appeared from nowhere it seems, whoever watches it gets a phone call that whispers only "7 days", 7 days later something is summoned and the viewer dies, usually with a look of pure wretched terror smeared across their face.Now that sounds straightforward, and upon scrutiny we can tick off a lot of other clichs from dozens of other horror films:* The protagonist is a woman (named Rachel).* Rachel is a single mother (to son Aidan with ex Noah).* Aidan is creepily mature and emotionless.* The ghostie moves strangely, and is a girl whose face is covered in long black hair.Check. Check. Check. Checkity-Check-CHECK!"So tell me then Mr, why is The Ring any good?" I hear you ask.Well doubter, The Ring is better than just good, but for too many reasons to explain?I'll try anyway;Firstly, Naomi Watts isn't afraid to make herself look like a goose, I've seen the film a dozen times - I love the film - but I still think that it makes hardly any sense.A VCR summons a chick from a horse farm via a well in a chalet through a TV?Whaaaaa????Yet Watts is deadly serious throughout, though perhaps the furrowed brow represents the fact that she has no clue what the hell is going on. Nevertheless there is no hamming it up from anyone, even the no-name cast of randoms play it all straight up and Brian Cox in a two scene cameo is convincingly nuts.The film gives you nothing that you don't earn as a viewer, if you snooze for a little you'll miss key info, in saying that the fact that none of what happens really makes any sense anyway if you think too hard, so perhaps it might be better not to concentrate? What do I know?Secondly, despite the fact that in the opening scene a young teenage girl on a sleepover is the first victim, there are no big "Wow" setpieces in the film. No carefully staged, well choreographed deaths with multiple fake loud noise scares and perhaps a flying cat suddenly appearing to shock you. Everything grows through Rachel's investigation, with each seemingly minor discovery building the tension and creating further unease.It's again fair to say that a lot of the unease is found through not knowing exactly what is going on, but random bloods noses and photos of flies coming to life aren't run of the mill occurrences.The video itself is also pretty creepy and most definitely offputting, with staccato imagery that appears to be randomly spliced images, some cringe-inducing. When you later see some of the actual images crop up during the film it is a little eerie.Thirdly, none of the growing unease and serious stuff would mean squat if there were no payoff to be found. The final third of the film finds everything falling into place, again there are no earlier clues and they don't join the dots so to speak, each discovery leads them to another place to look. In the end though once Rachel and Noah "solve" the case and breathe a sigh of relief we the audience think well that's that then?Only it wasn't.Fourthly and finally, the real finale of The Ring gets the hairs on my arms standing on end every time. What should be hokey actually works so well that it demands repeat viewings, most horror films lose 60% of their impact after the first viewing, and a second often wraps up any loose ends from the first viewing that you missed. For real scare value there are precious few horror movies that hold up, simply because you know exactly what's coming up and the surprise factor is gone. Only this film, Session 9 and perhaps the Exorcist hold up to repeat viewings, they may no longer scare but I grin inanely in the moments prior to the reveal because I know what's coming.If you can get a newbie to watch it with you that's even better.Writing about this film is annoying, as trying to explain it only confirms the logic holes and flaws, even if you simply try to cover the early events. If you are a horror buff and you have doubts after reading the above please ignore my shambolic inane ramblings and give the film a chance, it is worth your time.This is no tacky cheap horror film, this is the real thing.Final Rating ? 8.5 / 10. A horror film for those that claim horror is an inferior genre and not worthy of respect. Watch it with the lights off and the sound up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring is an eerie story about a cursed video tape that kills whoever watches it in exactly seven days. I have heard from my friends that this was a very scary movie. I thought to myself after hearing this, "How scary could something be that could never happen ever?" One Missed Call was laughable. One Missed Call was more of a comedy than a horror. But, The Ring was the first movie that contained many things that could not happen, but had an interesting story line from the beginning, and had you wanting more at the end. Be aware that the following sentences contain, should I call it, warnings for the squeamish, not spoilers. I am not giving away important plot points.I watched this film with a friend of mine on YouTube in parts. Within the first ten minutes we couldn't stop watching it. There was always some question we were waiting for the answer to. For those parents who are wondering if this is appropriate for their child, I would say 11 and up is fine. If you have heard about the tape, you do see what is on the tape throughout the film, and parts of it throughout the rest of the film. On the tape are a random series of disturbing events, which are really disturbing. This movie IS meant to ACTUALLY SCARE the viewer/viewers. SQUEAMISH: If disturbing images, strange noises/songs, disturbing facial expressions, and death bother you, do not see this film!All in all, I give this film 9 out of 10 stars. The fact that this film isn't explained well enough cost this film that 1 other star. One last warning: This film does have parts that will make you jump, just to warn you. This is a great film and I would recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing piece for American audiences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring started what became a wave of horror remakes from Japanese cinema, and while other tales such as The Grudge were not as critically well received, The Ring truly earned its merit among audiences. The movie starts out with Seatle reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) aiding her sister after the mysterious death of her niece-- a death that was provoked by watching a mysterious videotape and not following the rules in order to save one's life. After seeing the tape herself, Rachel is horrified to learn that those who see it have seven days until they die, unless they somehow manage to avoid death, by performing the task that the spirit haunting the tape wishes the viewer to do; if you're not familiar with the full plot by now, keep yourself unspoiled and discover it for yourself! As the film progresses Rachel seeks the help an exboyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson) in order to discover the origins of the mysterious tape before it is too late. What Rachel discovers is a dark, hidden story from one of the Pacific Northwest's many small island communities, where a small girl arrived with her adoptive parents, only to cause grief that they could have never imagined. Has she young girl returned to seek her revenge? The visual style of The Ring is arguably its greatest asset. Imagery is both creepy and alluring, with the film's dark color palette adding to the cold, wet climate of The Pacific Northwest. While certain aspects of the film are a bit far fetched or not fully developed, The Ring stands out as one of the better psychological horror films in recent memory, aided by a unique story, strong performances and haunting visuals. Highly recommended for all, and enjoy looking for a hidden DVD extra!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is she still in the dark place?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the mysterious death of her niece Katie, journalist Rachel Keller starts to investigate an urban legend about a videotape which kills you seven days after watching it. With dire consequences coming her way if she can not solve the mystery....The sentence, English language remake of successful foreign horror film has been known to instill fear of the wrong kind in many a genre fan. So when it was announced that Gore Verbinski was to remake Hideo Nakata's terrifying nerve shredder, Ringu, the reaction in horror circles was akin to someone urinating on your chips. Refreshing to report then that The Ring is a candidate for best American remake and proof positive that remakes sometimes can be a good thing.Starring Naomi Watts (who is terrific) as Rachel, Verbinski and writer Ehren Kruger {adapting from Kji Suzuki's novel} successfully transfer the atmospherics of Nakata's piece to a dank and eerie Seattle. It's with atmosphere that The Ring starts to play on your nerves, after viewing the creepy and unsettling tape itself, we ourselves have been set up for the race against the clock that is driving Rachel on. And as the mystery starts to unravel, and sadness threatens to take hold, the story quickly shifts direction to give horror one of its most baddest and cruelest characters. It's impact is the kind that crawls under your skin and refuses to move when you are trying to sleep at night.Tho the story has been streamlined from its source, The Ring still has a bit too much filler in its structure. Feeling a need to give Watts a quest among quests, Verbinski almost over cooks the mystery essence of the plot. But with much relief, he reins it in to stop any sort of scooby doo like nonsense detracting from the creepy sense of dread that has been built up. The ending here works, but it is a tone down from the source and with that it's not even close to Nakata's version, and just maybe it has something to do with Dream Works wanting to secure a PG-13 rating? What is left tho is a truly suspenseful and unsettling thriller-come horror film. One that even on revisits manages to bother and keep one on the edge. It made an $80 million profit in America alone, ensuring that a sequel was sure to follow. Now that one was a bad idea! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring is pretty much the scariest movie I've ever seen. This movie is so scary all the way through. It is the perfect movie to watch if you really want to be freaked out. I saw it twice once when I was about 11 and once at 16. I was terrified after the first viewing for weeks. I just recently saw it with some friends. My best friend was in my same boat. He saw it at the same age. We both had trouble going to sleep afterwords. Although I liked the movie during both viewings I enjoyed it more the second time. Great acting from Naomii Watts (female protagonist; Rachel) and David Dorfman (her son; Aiden). The Ring starts off with a very dismal atmosphere, and it increases as the movie goes on. This is what makes it so scary. It has a continual mood of doom, quite unlike any other movie I've ever seen. Samara Morgan (antagonist) is absolutely horrifying. She scared me very much during both viewings. But what scared me the most was....just the face of her first victim. Overall, this is a very effectively scary movie, it's almost too effective. Some people think it's boring, but I don't really understand that. I think it is gripping, just the way it counts down the seven days. With each passing day the suspense increases. It's like this certain doom destined to happen. One which is hard to turn away from. Although this isn't a pleasant movie to watch, it is a movie to watch if you're looking for a really good scare. No other movie has scared me in the way the The Ring has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kaballah of the Ring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ring" contains secret esoteric information, that everyone has a right to know.There was a Bible story left out of the Bible about a King, a Scribe, and a High Priest who went to the ruins of a another King's Temple, found a well, descended into the well, and in there discovered the "lost word".This "lost word" in the sound of a cylinder sounding like the word "whine" and "fine", and "line". I cannot spell it in Hebrew here, for, that would be counted as incorrect spelling which wont go through in this forum system.But, the "lost word" in an ancient language adds up to 61, and the number of the apartment is 601, the 6, 0 the ring, and then the 1. The same word is the (wont go through) word for well, ring, eye, and nothingness.This same sound was the meditation sound used by a meditation system popular in the Sixties. Only sincere looking members were given this "lost word". By meditating on this sound you experience a taste of nothingness, which is very refreshing. It is the heart of every pleasure. The Oriental radical for heart is the serial number 61 radical.The name of this movie is "The Ring", the well was important in the story, the girl, 12 years old at the time, had her long black hair covering one eye, and revealing the other one eye.The girl's name, I don't even think the girl's name would pass through this spelling sensor, the girl's name means "a guardian" in (wont pass); but, this movie originated in (wont pass), and the (wont pass) name for it means "Happy Apple Horse".

Fast entropy production rates bend time space globally leaving the rigid orthogonality of flat time space behind so that all that involved gets a tenuously indistinguishable from that which is called "spirit".In such a field the body is able to snap back to its original health template, curing disease, and even renewing youth.

		<fullReview>The Ring is a very well-made mystery thriller. First off, the writing is very good for a film of this genre. Sure, there are some flaws in the screenplay, but ultimately, very well written with touches of drama, suspense, and mystery. Namoi Watts is a strong leading lady, and she gives a great performance here, touching on all the emotions her character should go through. A small cameo from Amber Tamblyn is great, she is truly a strong young actress. Martin Hendeson is good, but nothing special. The true standouts in this film were Brian Cox, David Dorfman, and Daveigh Chase. Brian Coz is one of the strongest older actors working today, and he does the best with his small screen time. Both David Dorfman and Daveigh Chase give two of the best child performances I have seen in recent years. Both are genuinely very creepy and mysterious.The Ring is technically perfect. Gore Verbinski is a really talented director, and he makes the film be as creepy as it is. Another aspect of the film I found to be masterful was the photography and cinematography. There are so many beautiful shots in this film. Some are scary, some are mysterious, some are just well-crafted. I think this might be the best shot 'horror' film in the last 10 years. There is so much depth and color to each shot. The film is also very high on atmosphere. It might also be the most atmospheric film of the decade, even more-so than The Others from 2001.Overall, The Ring is a beautifully shot suspense/horror film, with some really scary scenes. It is flawed, but it achieves so much. It has all the elements to become a future horror classic, among films like The Exorcist and Poltergesit.</fullReview>

It's brilliantly put together, and considering it's made in America, keeps the Japanese feel of the original. The concept may seem silly - a video cassette that kills you. But when all is explained, it actually makes it plausible to even the most critical critic. Well, most critical critics anyway. Some people are never happy.*This paragraph has some spoilers* Look out for the moment where the boy says - "You helped her? ... Why did you do that? ... You weren't supposed to help her." Granted, the fact that I've just told you about it spoils the whole moment. But the concept is brilliant! And the idea that you can be frightened to death is also excellent. When she climbs out of the TV the first time, with that spooky Japanese camera flickery thing, its scary. More so than any other film I've ever watched.

		<fullReview>If you are a fan of the original Suzuki novel, you will enjoy this. The film IS NOT an adaption of the original novel. This however is a positive factor as it allowed the writers to tool with the concept of the cursed videotape, giving Sadada/Samara an interesting, new back story for us to follow.This film could have been like any other modern day horror, knives, blood and mindless violence. This film, however focuses on a more mystery based Thriller, which is good as it doesn't ruin the atmosphere of the original Suzuki novel.The acting is very good, Naimoi Watts does an amazing job at capturing the films horror psychologically. The child actor playing her son is very skilled as well and creates an eerie feel to some of the scenes.The film isn't very graphic and focuses on a more artistic horror. This is a nice break from the amount of mindless slashers like saw and the stupidly on going Jason series. The film only doesn't get a 10 stars because the book had a slightly more gripping back story for Sadada/Samara and explained a bit more about why the cursed videotape exists. Still this film is a classic and will remain in my DVD collection until blue-ray out-dates everything, pff unlikely!</fullReview>

But this is just the kind of horror movie that will leave you feeling utterly helplessly creepy even days after you have walked out of the theater. The disturbing scenes, the creepy music, the cabin in the woods setting, everything seems just right enough! Rent it, not alone of course, enjoy it with a group of friends.

A curse on a VHS tape, an evil essence infused into electronics, a disturbed child mumbling and grumbling, everything adds up to an overblown mystery leading consequently and literally into a deep well ... a fitting metaphor for the yawning black (plot)hole(s) swallowing director Verbinsky's useless efforts of creating anything coherent, logical or scary out of this soulless teen scam. And if you'd watch this movie a thousand times, it still wouldn't make any sense. My two stars are probably the result of this bright early summer day.

		<fullReview>I love horror movies and I find it strange that there are people who tend to think of horror movies as not-realistic!!! There is no such thing as not realistic. Once a mind can imagine something, that something has officially become reality. It has logically shifted from something that didn't exist to something that exists.Horror movies have something pleasurable about them even if the same idea of people getting killed every time is being repeated. There is always the new way used for eliminating the victim and the factor which is causing the horror. This is the case with the ring, the source of horror this time is a regular video tape and here lies the originality of the idea.I am fanatic when it comes to horror movies. I love to watch them at late night with the light off and nobody is around to feel the tensity of the movie and to enjoy it more. Then, I tend to watch it again with my friends with the same environment but after I judge that it's a worth sharing movie. The second time I watched it with my friends, one of them actually asked us at the end what if we all die now that we have seen the tape. He was joking of course and we all laughed but obviously the idea got to his head and made him think of the possibility.It's a good movie only if you like horror movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A review I have read prepared me for a bad movie; but THE RING is not bad at all ?. It's very scary, creepy ?. It is true that it's only mechanically scary; it can be conceded that the supernatural remains exterior and that the note of the movie is very tonic, like that of a suspense action movie. The most creepy character was the small boy; the most inexpressive was Watts' husband.The atmosphere is purely natural, and, when the scene is not scary, is that of a tonic suspense movie. I guess this in-aptitude for conveying the supernatural must have disappointed those who dismiss the movie as failed; and this, I can concede?THE RING is not a bad movie, but a failed one. It utterly fails to achieve a supernatural thriller. All the supernatural remains exterior and mechanical.Given the otherworldly plot, the movie's note is very mundane and basically secure and tonic. Like a wholly _movieish suspense romp; as I doubt that Verbinski meant otherwise, the movie is conventionally well?done. If confronted to its own premise, anyway, and not to the director's intentions, it's failed.Verbinski did not flop; he has skills, he is deft; and his mistake being as subtle as it is also obvious, I doubt he would understand what it was. His version is a 'desupernaturalization of the Oriental movie(s).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hype behind this movie is what makes it truly scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember this film was hyped up so much as the next great scary movie; as good as Exorcist or even better. Naomi Watts is a reporter who investigates the death of her niece and four other teenagers; there is an urban legend about a tape, after watching ti the viewer will experience spooky situations and then die.The film builds up to the end brilliantly but for me the hype was a little too scary; but its wasn't as terrifying as I thought, the film itself is very weird, a woman brushing her hair and it works it keeps the audience watching and trying to work out what is happening. Naomi Watts is brilliant as the reporter and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, she proves that she in fact is a great actress. The other actors are satisfactory and the end is very thrilling and jaw dropping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are thrillers that vacate your thoughts as soon as the credits roll and then there are thrillers that sink deep into your subconscious and remain with you for days, weeks, months... dare I say years after the credits roll. "The Ring" takes its rightful throne in the latter category.When her niece dies a gruesome death, journalist Rachael Kellers (Naomi Watts) investigation leads her to a mysterious videotape. As soon as she views the tape the phone rings and a malevolent child's voice warns "seven days". When she rings her old boyfriend into watching the tape and their young son decides to have a peek too, thus begins their desperate search for the truth."The Ring" scared me. It scared me for weeks. I unashamedly admit that I slept with the light on and moved the TV out of my bedroom. I have one word for you. Samara.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are worse ways to spend an evening (...or late night...)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not one of the best horror-thriller films I've ever seen, but the acting performances and basic storyline were good enough to make it watchable. Plus, it had other elements I liked.While the story's basic premise was sound, the script could have used work: primarily, I would have preferred a "deeper" storyline for Samara, the Morgans in general and the circumstances surrounding Samara's "partial" demise. I also thought it got a bit slow in places, and seemed to "jump" at points. I also wasn't too thrilled that Amber Tamblyn, one of my favorite young actors, got knocked off so early, but that's more personal than anything.Naomi Watts turned in an excellent performance as did Brian Cox, who was quite believable in his role as the troubled and disturbed patriarch of the Morgan clan. Young David Dorfman's performance was eerie (which is good for a horror film). The only downer (if you could call it that) was Martin Henderson's performance - though it wasn't "bad", I felt they could have found someone a little better to take the role of Noah.Nice touches: the "countdown"; Samara's "look"; Rachel's initial belief that 'all is well' when, in fact, it wasn't, followed by her subsequent (failed) race to get to Noah; and the scene at the very end showing resulting circumstance driving the "good guys" (Rachel and Aidan) to not be so good.While "The Ring" doesn't come up to the level of many other horror-thrillers, there are just as many worse ones, and worse ways to spend an evening (...or late night...).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can traditional horror get any better than this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me be blunt for a second: I hate most everything that is defined as "traditional" or "classic" because they're almost always synonyms for unoriginality and predictability. Movies with those tags usually amount to nothing more than a big-breasted woman (who is topless half the screen time) being chased by a killer/monster(s) until she either finds a way to kill him/it or dies. That's all. Point A, topless sex scene, fake scare, "Oh my God! The monster is real!" scene, chase, woman lives/dies. For reasons like this, I have always preferred horror movies like Saw where every rule/plot you think you know is thrown out. However, The Ring completely made me remember that traditional horror can still be complex and original . . . and actually scary. In more way than one, The Ring is The Shining of its time.First, let me get the cinematography out of the way?it's gorgeous and incomparable. The blue tent has never been done to this level of effectiveness, and the camera angles take me back to the time when people actually put effort into cinematography.The plot is one of the most complex and memorable a ghost story has ever had. Also, it's revealed through action, mystery, and actually requires the main character to actually physically do something rather than just talk and talk until I fall asleep, as in most movies anymore.The acting is solid on all fronts. There is entertainment value, rather than just another clich social commentary. The storytelling is never bloated or boring. The Ring also never plays it safe and uses the easy clichs that it could use. I also can't point to a single cheesy moment, ever.Overall, I cannot think of a more perfect example of truly flawless traditional horror. It ranks among The Shining and Alien for me. I can understand why a lot of people wouldn't like it, and it isn't for everyone, but I loved it. Watch it and make up your own mind. Just know that the original Japanese version has had more impact on the horror genre than most any other movie of our time, and the remake, in my opinion, is far superior.10/10</fullReview>

I enjoyed this movie better than the original (the reason being- its beautiful score and stunning performances from Watts and Dorfman)This is not your traditional horror movie, this is what movies is all about.P.S You'll enjoy it more if you watch it on a VHS system, in the dark, by yourself, on the biggest TV set you can find =]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was told by a friend that this film was one of the scariest movies he had seen in a long while, and, I decided to watch it. And I loved it, it was exiting, scary and it was just all round a good film to watch.In this film, a local news reporter goes searching for an unmarked video tape that apparently kills anyone that watches it after her niece unexpectedly dies, exactly 1 week after she had watched the video. She finds the video, and watches it, and it becomes a race against time to find the mysterious secret, behind the ring.The film does have some issues, and the plot seems overworked sometimes but the acting is overall quite good, with the sons acting being something all young actors should strive for, also Naomi Watts is good as the reporter.Overall, the film is quite good, Scary, thrilling, surprising. I rate this film 73%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes scary other times not...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I started watching this movie, I thought it was going to be really scary, but it was actually not so scary and I can't blame the people who didn't like it, probably it is all because of the very little content of horror or they didn't understand the script. The beginning of it looked as if it was another ghostly movie with ghosts and scary settings, but I must say "The Ring 2" has much more supernatural horror than this epic. In some scenes I felt like I did not understand a single various thing like at the very confusing end, but I think you have to watch it again to get the full meaning. Also, in some scenes, were actually scary and it kept me on the very edge of my seat, wondering what is going to happen next. So there are ups and downs for this movie, but the bring it to a conclusion, I would say, it was an OK movie but if you're looking for something scarier - watch the sequel to this.Naomi Watts, another successful actress, took the chance to perform a single mother and in my opinion she did it really well. She was the perfect choice for Rachel Keller and you could see she really tried and surprisingly it looked as if she was doing it for real. As for Martin Herderson and Brian Cox - they are really marvellous actors. Like every actor/actress in this movie, they truly done there roles fantastically well and they really tried their very best. So the performances really brought this movie to the next level - which was great. But there was a real let down on the script, like I said, I didn't understand anything in some particular scenes. I mean, in the end and some scenes in the middle...what? I did not understand! So, like the content of horror, that was a negative point to the movie that is what makes the movie get poor ratings. So if you're looking for a little bit of a scare, but not a lot, watch this movie, but I guarantee you there will be a 75% chance that you might not like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad at all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a fan of the original Ring (Ringu here), and sure The Ring doesn't meet up to the quality of the original, but this is still a solid horror movie and an adaptation if you want to compare.Ringu drew the horror with its intense mood (rather than shock/jumping scenes), and The Ring doesn't fail at doing it either. Acting is solid, and the music is as creepy as the original. It is definitely a "different" type of horror movie than the traditional American "slasher" films, and I'm sure both horror movie fans and non-horror movie fans can enjoy (and be scared) this film.The downside is that the plot was almost as I expected, leaving me with nothing new to take away. I guess its unfair to judge it this way, since it is an adaptation, but I did hope that the director would add some kind of change that made The Ring distinct from Ringu.Also, I felt that the presence of Samara was very toned down compared to Ringu. In Ringu, Sadako was an angry girl that I would wet my pants upon meeting, but in the Ring, Samara seemed almost like a sad girl with a sad past and no more. I'm sure other people would disagree, but at least the character of Samara did leave me with less fear for compared to Sadako (which was borderline traumatizing). But in either case, fans of American horror films would most likely feel a lack of impact that the main villain would leave, compared so lets say Freddy Krueger.Otherwise, its still a solid movie. I suggest anybody to watch it for a taste of so-called J-Horror adaptation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Days And You Will Die.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A tape of something so strange and so disturbed was in the hands of some teenagers; Katie and her friends. After watching it, stunned by what they saw, they received a phone call saying they will die in exactly seven days. Believing the tape was some sort of twisted joke, they shrugged of the feeling and lived life as usual. But a week passed since they watched the video and all four ended up with the same fate: dead. Katie's mother, confused and shaken by the loss of her daughter, asked Rachel, her sister, to find out what really happen to their troubled girl.Now determined to solve the mystery of Katie's death, Rachel finds herself and her son, Hayden with the same fate as her niece. Can she save her life and Aidan's as well? Directed by Gore Verbinski, The Ring gives a fairly decent work of art. I applaud Gore for directing the effect of viewers sensing that they're not alone anymore from start to finish. However, I find the tape (The Death Tape, as I nicknamed it.) disturbing. It was some of the images of the finger and the suicidal horse that made me feel unusual, almost at the point of being uncomfortable.The cast was also very well picked. Naomi Watts, who played Rachel, gives a performance that will surely give her more success in her career. But what was more surprising was the work of little David Dorfman who played Aidan. He gave some excellent acting skills in The Ring. The girl who haunts the tape (Daveigh Chase who acts as Samara) gave a frightening job as well.The Ring was, I thought, more of a thrill then a horror movie, but it does frighten well. But I heed a warning to those who want to rent 'The Ring'. If you're easily disgusted, then I suggest you pick another movie to watch. To those who ignored my warning, however, will surely be pleased that they did, because it really is a one of a kind movie. I give 'The Ring' a two thumbs up well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent entry, if not overtly spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ring" is the kind of film that really lives or dies with it's virtues.**SPOILERS**Several days after their cousin's death, Rachel Keller, (Naomi Watts) and her young son Aidan, (David Dorfman) are still having trouble with the recent events, and are trying to figure out what happened. Using her journalistic instinct, she begins to search into their lives, but all the clues lead to bigger confusion. The only clue to lead anywhere, a tape their friends had watched previously, results in her learning that she will die in seven days. Turning to her ex-boyfriend Noah Clay, (Martin Henderson) for help, and soon he is cursed after watching the mysterious tape. Using the tape itself as a clue, she begins to track down the images from the tape one-by-one, as the time continues to trickle down. Finally uncovering the meaning of the tape and how to stop it's terrible curse, they quickly race to put an end to it before the curse continues to be passed on.The Good News: This does have a few pretty nice points about it. One of them is that this manages to really do some stylized individual scenes. One character sees themselves in a live surveillance monitor and notices their face is all distorted while everything else around them is fine. Another starts pulling something out of their mouth that just keeps coming and looks like a long string with something on the end of it. We then see water coming out of the end of a phone nearby as a spark-plug is pulled out of their mouth. A bunch of marbles come together on the floor and make the image of a pointing arrow. It's also got the ability to build up some great scare scenes. One character has a really weird dream where they see an image of a young girl who grabs her on the arm. When they awake, a hand-shaped burn mark across her arm where they were grabbed is noticeable. An encounter on a boat with a horse really manages to deliver some chills, and the experience within the well at the end really sends shivers down the spine. The highlight, though, is the memorable and very creepy scene where a person's TV suddenly comes on and then does so again after being turned off. Video footage then plays, the phone rings and with it blaring throughout, a partially decomposed girl crawls out of a well on-screen and then comes toward the camera. She then crawls out through the TV, onto the floor and then starts walking toward him. They the begin a very tense and creepy chase through the house, which is just all sorts of chilling. The only other thing that really works for the film is it's pacing. While it's not all that cohesive, it manages to stay interesting all the way through. There's never a dull moment, and this has it's good moments spread throughout to avoid making anything lifeless. These are all great in making the film quite watchable.The Bad News: This here was pretty flawed at times. One of the biggest one in the film is that the film didn't need to be as abstract and ambiguous. It's a mystery, and as such should provide us with a clearly defined solution. Its apparent Samara was quite twisted, yet we have no idea why she was mental even before being confined. Absolutely no explanation is even hinted upon what made her that way. What's even stranger is her sense of priority. Nothing is given as to what she is trying to get out of all of this. There's one cryptic little piece of dialog where she whines, "I just want to be heard!" It's obvious we're supposed to feel bad for her, but if they're completely crazy, then there's little chance of it happening. It's also not given how she got inside the videotape anyway, or why a videotape. This is the new millennium, and that's far too obsolete a technology to make much impact. Why she isn't trying to possess a DVD or an MP3 player, or even a slightly more 'cutting-edge' piece of technology, would make that fear all the greater. Another really big flaw is that there is just way too much confusion derived from the twisted and confusing plot. While it's pretty much kept to a singular plot device, there's always the film going back on itself to what had happened before. They never completely solve one mystery before starting to investigate another, and come back to what was gathered before and piece it together with other knowledge acquired from looking into other clues. This is quite aggravating and keeps the film from really moving forward. This also makes for a seriously disjointed plot. This bounces back and forth with so much regularity that it's nearly impossible to keep track of what's going on where, and that leads the film with an incredibly confusing feel to it. This could've been an easy flaw to fix, but instead it's one of the most noticeable things about the film, and mixed with the others in the film, lowers it substantially.The Final Verdict: All style and not enough to make up for it, this is at the very least watchable if you're into this kind of film. If you're able to look at a film like this and ignore the negatives, then give it a shot, but heed caution if you're one to find those negatives will heed your viewing experience.Rated PG-13: Language, Violence, children in danger and animal violence</fullReview>

But beware a third part is scheduled for 2008! Judging after this movie that wouldn't be bad! So let's leave the sequel alone for a moment and concentrate on this. Naomi Watts takes the lead here and the movie does it's Japanese original justice, with it's adaptation. The story is changed for American/western audiences, but that's good and should be like that! And if you bought or rent the DVD, I have an easter egg that will have you ... Let's just say, this is not for the faint of heart!!!Follow these instructions (from dvdreview.com): "Insert the DVD in your player and wait until the Main Menu comes up.

If you press the 'Enter' key now on your remote control you will get to see the entire footage of the deadly videotape from the movie."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing about this movie is that it starts out pretty scary. There is this weird VHS tape and if someone watches it they die in a week. This is the 21st century and it's time to upgrade to a DVD. Anyway, it's scary but the scary girl looks like cousin Itt from the Addams family. I almost thought that Gomez and Uncle Fester were going to pop out. The hair covering her face didn't scare me at all. I thought it was funny. If they had just shot her with her mad face, it would have helped the movie.What was on the video was pretty creepy and the horses were creepy. I also didn't like the end. I would have cut it way shorter than what it was. The ending went on and on and it drove me crazy. Finally it did end but it left little room for a sequel but there is a sequel. Other than the girl and the ending, it was a pretty scary movie but I've seen scarier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit the American Ring is very faithful to the Japanese original one as I've seen the original one as a Japanese. Though it was very interesting that I didn't feel scared much comparing to the original one. That might be simply because that I knew the story already, but I would say the expression of horror is very different from Japaense way. As Japanese horror tends to hide the most scary part and let viewers expand their imagination to get scared, American version is more revealing the part you should get scared. The depiction of mother and child is also bit different and seemed very American to me. I thought it must be very hard to translate this Japanese way of fear into American way, but I think this gets really well translated in the end to the understandable Americanized version of the Ring. I could enjoy the movie as a totally new version.</fullReview>

The film spooks you into the belief of the story and Samara's death. The film is extremely convincing about the websites being read by Naomi Watts.This film is the remake of the Japanese film RINGU and I saw this few weeks ago and RINGU is not too scary, but Hollywood feeds on dramatizing reality and this time they were successful with THE RING. The Ring is a simple story of a lady who watched a 30 second spooky video and is cursed to death, after which she conducts research on the truth behind the 30 second video and finally gets successful in her mission. All this is too simple to read, but wait till you watch THE RING, I guarantee you that "Friday The 13th" will seem lame.My credit goes to the director of THE RING and he has done an excellent pre-production plan prior to the making of this film.WATCH IT AND STAY AWAKE ALL YOUR LIFE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of all the horror films I have ever seen this wins heads down. I wouldn't consider this as a horror movie as I normally associate horror with blood and gore and terror with mind haunting and chilling. This is a terror movie. My eccentric old maths teacher made my class and I watch it as punishment for 'scaring' him all year. From the moment it started I couldn't rip my eyes away from the screen. Most of the girls in my class were screaming when that poor girl got killed. The atmosphere was so effective as well. The constant raining in Seattle, the clouds, the TREE (I still have dreams about it) and the cursed people's clouded faces when ever a photo was taken of them or if they were under video surveillence.I couldn't concentrate for the rest of the day (and to be honest I don't scare easily!). I had drama next and luckily I watched Carousel to wash the images from my mind. "Oh the Ring. My its terrifying. Jack saw it and stayed awake all night and it takes a lot to scare him! Watch the Sound of Music a few times and you'll be back to normal" my drama teacher said. Its been over 5 months since I've seen the Ring, my friend recommends that I see the Japanese version. It doesn't have as many special effects but what it suggests it much more terrifying, is what he said. I think I'll pass there. After watching the Ring you think more deeply about the plot and what the 'video' was really about. So the reason Naomi didn't die at the end was because she let her husband watch it and so pass on the ring to someone else. Also the woman in the video was a psychic of some sort who burned her thoughts into it. Well for those of you haven't seen it I'll not ruin the plot anymore but be prepared for very late nights!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror I've ever saw!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring, that movie wasn't just disturbing and mysterious, but special. No other director could film a horror movie like this. Not a lot of gore in the movie, but shows lots of details that can wet your pants. The sound effects were great, such as the unearthy wind passing by. The graphics where great, like grayish clouds movie fast, and sinster looking places. This movie might be a PG-13 movie, but it's a hell of a horror movie compared to R rated movies. I've NEVER saw a scarier PG-13 movie. Compare it to Gothika, which ones scarier? I have to say The Ring was more scarier. This movie is a must see! It's my all time favorite horror movie! you'll want to watch it over and over again. And oh yeah, remember to disconnect your phone....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A riveting and disturbing horror/mystery that will not be forgotten.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first rented THE RING last Halloween, and boy did it scare me!! Starring Naomi Watts and Daveigh Chase. THE RING is a creepy, menacing film involving a journalist who gets involved with the mystery of a videotape that kills people in seven days after the viewing of it. Somehow, a girl from the past who had died is involved with it. With unpredictable twists and turns, THE RING is actually based on a more-terrifying Japanese film, RINGU. An unforgettable horror film that will surely make it on your list of the scariest films.Grade: 9.4/10MPAA Rating: PG-13My Rating: Ages 13 and up (adult situations, terror, disturbing images, gore, language)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best pure horror film made in the US in many years. I must see the Japanese original. I won't give away any plot. This film scares (very effectively) without gore, without chase scenes, without gross monsters, and without startling sound effects. It scares with mystery and with its disturbing cinematography. It starts with a million questions: who made the lethal tape? How? Why do its viewers always die? Why would anyone make such a tape? Every question is answered, and every answer is an unhappy, twisted, and insane answer.I don't know why this film was only rated PG-12 in the USA. I have a friend who is 24 years of age who was unable to sleep all night after watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating, hair-raising movie that most people can enjoy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who have not seen this movie, I would recommend it. It will be worthwhile and make good entertainment if you watch it late at night...most likely. With that said, I also believe this movie is not meant for everyone who watches it. Some people who I've discussed this movie with hated it, simply because it was too weird for them. The movie is extremely imaginative and fairly surreal, so if you go into the theater expecting the ending to have every single question answered and a solid ending, you'll probably not get what you want. You need to be more open minded than that, and be able to think of it more as an idea or a philosophy than a story. After all, the movie is supposed to be an Urban Legend.Personally, I saw this movie in theaters 2 years ago exactly (on Halloween Night), and had a great time! But for me personally, there was more to the movie than just chills and frights. Rather, for some who may pick up on the ideas the movie presents, it can be quite an experience to see it.I voted for this movie as a 10. Others of you may feel it is a 8, 7, or 6...some may be completely unable to grasp the movie's abstract concepts and would rate it a 2 or 1, calling it a waste of time. However, if you are able to approach this movie at a different angle and can accept it's world, you will be in store for a great adventure!If you liked the movies "Unbreakable" or "Kill Bill (both volumes)", and can enjoy horror movies, I think you will love this movie from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is how you make a horror movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing scary about vampires. Or werewolves. (I've never seen one, so why be scared?) There's nothing scary about blood and gore. (I've seen plenty, so why be scared?) What's scary is the situation--when your TV turns itself on and you see something that makes you wet your pants. That's scary.And that's "The Ring". You could call "The Ring" a ghost story, and that would be fair, but instead of starting out showing us the ghost, the movie builds up suspense by first showing us what the ghost is capable of, then why the ghost is so angry. After we understand this, then and only then do we see the ghost. This creates an understanding in our mind of what this thing is going to do. So when we see it, we scare ourselves.You see, the scariest stories involve the mundane (like televisions and video tapes). They take the things we see everyday and ask, "What if..." This bypasses our rationality because we accept the plausibility of the scenario. And when a person can't think rationally, it doesn't take much to terrify them.Psychology 101. It'd be nice if more filmmakers would take a refresher course.</fullReview>

Make-up is so good but I could not understand why the victims were like the zombies. It was made to give a horror mood to the onlookers.

		<shortDescription>Verbinski's vision reigns supreme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a novel like Koji Suzuki's 'Ringu' spawns films in Korea, Japan and Hollywood, it's rare to find the one made in Hollywood beats all that came before it. With The Ring, Verbinski has broken Hollywood's usual curse in this respect, and delivered a fine horror film.Fanboys often claim Hideo Nakata's earlier Japanese film based on the Ringu novel is superior, and Verbinski's film is a shallow copy. Nothing could be further from the truth. While Nakata's film is faithful to the novel, the execution was flawed by several items in my opinion. First was a low budget which limited the scope and production values severely. The most annoying however was the suspension of disbelief required with respect to the psychic powers of the ex-husband. Although common in Japanese supernatural films, Western audiences find this plot device very hard to swallow. Nakata also attempted to explain too much of the back story of Sadako/Samara and ended up losing some of the impact of the story. While the back story may have worked in a novel, it doesn't work well in Nakata's film. Finally the ending scenes of Nakata's film were perhaps the weakest of the entire movie and robbed the film of impact. I submit that Verbinski's The Ring is a superior interpretation of the original novel to the screen. Verbinski took the core elements of Ringu, transplanted it to Seattle with a much larger budget and a superior cast and overlaid a certain sense of style earlier interpretations lacked. Unlike Nakata, Verbinski deploys no deus ex machina plot devices and the key characters in the film are much more believable to Western audiences.The result is definitely one of the most original horror films in the last ten years. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring is one of the only horror movies ive seen that actually scared me while watching it at the cinemas, this is truly a great horror movie, i've heard that the original Japanese version of this is better &amp; even more scarier than this, but the reason i haven't gotten around to watching that is because i would have to watch that movie in subtitles. Naomi Watts is great in this movie. Seriously this is a pretty creepy movie. People say that "THE EXORCIST" is the scariest movie ever made, but i hardly got scared of that movie plus its a very long a somewhat boring movie. The Ring is actually very jumpy, the image of the tv screen with fuzz is so scary. I don't know how good the original is but this is one excellent remake, if you like horror movies i recommend that you watch this movie. If you like movies like "Gothika", "The Sixth Sense" or even "Identity" this is for you. Two thumbs up for this movie 10 / 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been wanting to watch this one for the last few years but my wife refused to let me buy a copy of the DVD (of the Japanese version) as she said "I don't want that film in the house". Anyway, I finally taped a modified version of the American movie from HBO and watched it during the day with the curtains open. My hair stood on end and I had to take two breaks but I got through it.It is a very harrowing and clever film - and don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it by saying more. Previously I thought "Halloween" (the first one) was the creepiest film ever (the music is still haunting) but this film is a masterpiece - scarier than "The Sixth Sense" but similarly unnerving and deserving of a repeat viewing. I compare it to "Seven" for shock value and style.Now I have to summon up the courage to watch the Japanese version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new breed of terror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface this by saying: if you think slasher movies are horror movies, you will not like this movie.The Ring is not intended to scare you during the movie itself, first off. It's the first horror movie I've ever seen wherein the real scare is what you get out of it later. That feeling of looking at your TV late at night and just waiting.The plot needn't be explained, both because it's already been shown and because it's best to go in not knowing what's there. But what should be said is that this is a paced movie. It's not like your Dawn of the Dead where the scares are from gory makeup and chase scenes. Rather this is a movie that gets to you by breaking down the gap between the movie and the viewer, it manages to invade the concept of "well it's only a movie" that gives you that safety net after viewing.Trying to explain what makes The Ring so incredible is like trying to explain Stephen Sondheim to TRL pop fans. It's so different from the formulaic "horror" movies most are used to and is so much better made that most won't know what they're looking at, and will chalk it off as poorly done.I've purposefully said very little about the movie itself, because that's what YOU should see. But rest assured, it is incredible. From the slow beginning to the heart-stopping finish (which may be the most terrifying bit of cinema ever captured on film), The Ring is something special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, even if flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming at the end as no more than good Friday night fare, "The Ring" is, even so, a scary movie. Since we can't talk about originality (this is a remake), our attention focuses on the way the concept is handled. As a horror movie, it has a great idea to watch: a cursed tape, which kills anyone who sees it in seven days. Naomi Watts comes across the tape, and the story unfolds, revealing finally that such original concept wouldn't survive for long. Soon, the formula comes roaring, and you'll start to see some clichs (face it - ever since "Shining" we have seen endless times a creepy girl with a covered-up face that says "you're gonna die" or something like that). Even so, it manages to twist a little and to get some surprises. I was glad to see that they didn't repeat the "screeching orchestra" gag too many times, which is always nerve-challenging. It's basically a classy horror movie, that doesn't extend on the gore and the guts, and wisely relies on the unseen to help us take it seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring is a film starring Naomi Watts and Daveigh Chase (from Donnie Darko and Spirited Away). Personally, I did not find this movie scary, even the infamous "walking out of the TV" part. It follows a woman who is trying to uncover the mystery of a mysterious videotape and why people die 7 days until they die. Naomi Watts is that woman and she is a journalist and very good at uncovering the mystery, while both she and her son must race against time because they have both received the mysterious phone call saying they had seven days. This is a movie that does not follow the conventional, commercial means of getting a cheap scare, and it is above average with its intelligence. The answers to all of the mystery are very interesting, but sometimes this movie borders on silliness. It was remade from the Japanese movie Ringu, which is much more praised and also much more scary. Both of these movie use the use of technology as means of fright: videotapes, telephone calls, etc. This is an enjoyable movie, but not very scary.My grade: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was the only movie in a scary movie genre that actually set out to do what it wanted to do: scare the crap out of the audience. I seriously did not want to be alone by myself after this movie and watch tv. I liked the idea of combining electronics/technology we're familiar with to heighten the sense of fear. That little girl was creepy. I saw her at the People's Choice Awards or something like that and she did the "You're all gonna die part" and it freaked me out again, even with her in normal clothes. Now that mess is freaky. The movie was a little slow at first. I tried to rationalize to the characters that they should just keep watching the tape over and over to extend their time to die. You know, like write it in the schedule: "Must watch tape so as not to die this week" kinda thing. Then I began to wonder about the plot of the movie. It didn't make sense that a girl from the early 20th century is making videotapes. How is that possible? Could we see that process? It didn't make any sense to me. However, she finally killed someone and then it became scary and I loved it. It's still my fave movie as a scary film and I think it should be a classic. I didn't get the dead horses part and I don't understand how her adopted father looks as old as Harrison Ford when he must have been born like in the late 1890's. Definitely not quite right in terms of plot holes, but still scary, so I forgive them that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had tons of shock value with disturbing images, I'll give it that. It also proves that a movie these days doesn't have to have tons of gore and death to be scary. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat more or less for the whole movie. By the time it got towards the end my heart was literally pounding, wondering if she was going to die or live. One great comment I have about this movie is how it leads you on that it's over. It makes you feel comfortable by giving you that warm feeling of seeing the kid's mother and father holding hands and then cuts to the scene with the kid's dad. The ONLY gripe I really have about the movie is how open-ended the ending is. It just leaves too much out and doesn't even really give you a solid clue of what happens after the end. It doesn't even really give you enough to think about to try and form your own hypothesis. I probably would've given the move a 9 if there was more closure at the end. Still a GREAT film and I highly recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally-maybe the first GREAT horror to come out of the last 10 years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring, which I almost didn't originally see, being that it looked so scary, turned out to be more then I bargained for. When I did see it, I had no idea I was about to view a horror flick that actually had depth and originality! Finally, Finally- a movie where the movie makers hit it spot on!This movie blows away other supernatural thrillers like:"The Others", "stir of echos", "what lies beneath" and "gothica". It also blows away movies like "Scream". The ring is a heavily atmospheric, genuinely frightening film that relies almost NILL in the way of blood and gore and still manages to absolutely horrify-as well as haunt you.The Ring reminds me of the movies I grew up loving, those atmospheric horrors of the 70's and early 80's, it seems nobody MAKES anymore, like "The Other"(NOT "The others!) and "Let's scare Jessica to death". I had kind of distanced myself from the horror genre in the last decade or more actually, because there were so few truly GOOD ones around-most horrors now rely on gore and cheap effects. And the supernatural ones, many times just bore me with their unoriginality. I was exhilarated at the end of The Ring because it threw me back in time to when horrors were actually good!The acting was great. The scenes were vivid and surreal and stay with you. The photography,lighthouses, fog, scenery etc is haunting and has that air of quiet gloom where the movie is WAITING ,that is just perfectly reminisint of old school horrors. The makers of this should be proud. It also reminds one, how bad some of these other horrors can be. I actually rated "Gothica" about a 5 or so on here and after seeing ring as a rental(after I saw gothica) I wondered why. And really BAD movies like "what lies beneath" aren't even worth mentioning in the same breath.A good horror has to have more then the ability to scare. It has to be well made, atmospheric and if it's haunting so much the better. It has to hook you in. And as far as the sequel to the ring, The ring2 goes, I am not nor have I ever been a sequel type of person yet I am looking forward to this. I have to see it. This movie got me, hooked me and I'm GLAD! It's about time!I'm all grown up now but I bet if I'd seen The Ring as a kid, it would have scared me triple. The most frightening scene by far is :SPOILER When Samara comes walking out of the television set. Also when Aiden tells Naomi Watts :that she shouldn't have let "her" out. Also the pictures coming out distorted which really freaked me out and it didn't help when the phone rang right after the first murder and it was late at night. Scared the heck out of me but in a good way!Only bad thing-there was a tiny bit of gore which was rather icky and not even necessary-could have lived without it-that and the horse scene which was more sad then scary. Go see The Ring-right now if you haven't. It rocks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, a horror film the makers can be proud of.A remake of the Japanese hit Ringu, this movie is one of the few Western horrors recently that make the genre look good. Starring Naomi Watts as journalist Rachel Kellar and Martin Henderson as her ex-flame Noah.After Rachel's niece Katie dies mysteriously, Katie's mother asks Rachel to investigate. She soon discovers that 3 of Katie's friends are also dead, exactly a week after they shared a cabin and saw a videotape. Soon Noah and their son, Aidan (David Dorfman) are also dragged into it after Rachel watches the tape, giving her one week to unravel the mystery of the videotape.The movie doesn't give into cheap scares like killers jumping out at you, which unfortunatly leads people to think that it isn't scary when the frightening themes and images are what make it true horror. This movies is only slightly bettered by the original, but is still a great film.4/5 stars</fullReview>

This movie made me keep on watch by how things would go in the movie. Out of the strangest movies I have ever seen this would be one of them. And that gets to a lot of freaky movies. What I liked about it is that in the first part when the girl is researching she finds out that all of the kids that watched it at the same time died at the same time.

		<shortDescription>not as good as "Ringu", but not crap either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm big on horror films, so I had seen "Ringu" about as soon as it hit the US. Here's the american remake. It's not as good, but it's not bad. Excellent acting, creepiness abounds, but it has problems.Why does every little kid in a horror film since "Sixth sense" have to be weird and creepy? "Ringu" drenched itself in some of the more obscure horror traditions, and resulted in a post-millenial update of Robert Chamber's book, "The King In Yellow". "TKIY" concerns a book so evil that those who read it, die. It's obscure these days, but it is highly regarded by the Lovecraft mythos afficianados. Along with this, "Ringu" dips heavily into the vocabulary of David Cronenberg, (more than any film since "Demons 2"!), and that really got me intrigued. This remake is easier to take, (no subtitles!), but it lacks some of the creepier aspects, and the adaptation of the original story seems foggy. I look forward to further remakes from this series, although the japanese have made several TV-movies tying in with this and that might be a bit much. "Ringu 2", and "Ringu 0" really fill in the story, and that would probably be a good thing. It's a good but somewhat confusing movie, with a fascinating history. Although it's better than "Fear.com", that holds some interest for fans of this, but comes from a different tradition that might not fly well with all fans of this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gore Verbinski (The Mexican, Mouse Hunt) has run with his first opportunity at making a horror movie and, in the process, handed fans of the genre a taught, suspense filled thriller with brains and scares. The movie opens with what has become an obligatory `opening scare' that involves two girls, Katie and Becca, scaring each other with talk of a videotape. The tape, it seems, is cursed and after the viewer watches it, he or she receives a call explaining his or her fate: death will come in seven days. Kate admits that she has seen the tape. In a scene of brilliant tension, this opener takes us through Katie's final minutes; it has been exactly seven days to the hour since she has seen the tape.We are then introduced to Katie's cousin, Aidan, and her aunt, Rachel Keller (played by Naomi Watts, Mulholland Dr.). Rachel is a newspaper reporter and, at Katie's wake, begins a search for the cause of Katie's death. Rachel learns of the cursed videotape and is quickly tangled in the mystery. Her detective work leads her to Shelter Mountain Inn where she watches the video tape and receives the legendary call. `Seven days,' she is told, and the count down begins.Rachel and friend Noah (who also watches the tape) work together to discover the origins of the tape. The hints are many and varied and, at first, don't seem to add up to much. There are horses, a lighthouse and a family called the Morgans. How they are linked and what they have to do with the videotape, I will never tell. Midway through the film, the urgency the investigation carries is increased and the ramifications of the reality of the urban legend are amplified.The movie is expertly directed. There's a drenching rain to many of the scenes and even when the weather clears up, their remains a wetness of dread. The colors are subdued except for a red that figures prominently into the story. Overall, Verbinski has shown his talent in droves here, successfully keeping the pace taught, the visuals interesting and the tensions paramount.The acting is great across the board. Some mention was made of the performance of the young boy, but I found him to be quite charming and much better than many child actors. Naomi Watts does well (even if she is handed some questionable lines) and very much shows her versatility of the actress. Her work here is completely different than knockout performance in Mulholland Dr..The only problem I found with the movie is that, taken in a series of unnerving parts, there are some moments that feel very familiar. The film borrows heavily from other popular horror films. Aside from this, however, the sum of the parts shines as an excellent horror film.This film has a long history. It is a remake of a Japanese film, Ringu, which is an adaptation of a book. I have seen Ringu and find that film to be slightly scarier, though lacking in plot. The Ring fleshes out the story and accurately recreates the impending dread of the original film. This movie is a genre fan's dream: a suspenseful, smart horror movie that, as a whole, is highly original. The Ring make no attempt to spoon feed the audience and leaves the viewer to connect the dots.</fullReview>

In fact I was asking myself if it really should have been categorized as horror as most of the times director Gore Verbinski (the man from "Pirates of the Carribean") creates a sort of style in where some David Lynch-style is certainly there! The story itself is simple...there is a videotape around and once you saw it you will die within 7 days. Most of the directors would have made a sort of Friday The 13th with it but director Gore Verbinski let us investigate why such a videotape is made, where it comes from and it is here where the viewer will undersrtand some bits but not the whole thing, not that there is any need to understand the "Eraserhead"-like movie that will kill you once you've seen it. "The ring" is a Hollywoodversion from some Japanese cultmovie "Ringu" and Verbinski did a well job but only he should have chosen some better actors though, and not someone like Naomi Wats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfying thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. It was somewhat unique to the horror movie genre - a suspenseful scary movie without any gore!One of the problems movies like this have is they tend to fall apart. Loose ends don't tie up, mysteries are introduced - then not explained, etc. I thought The Ring did well in this regard. While I had a problem with the way it ended (no spoilers but it just did not make sense to me), the preceding pretty well panned out.Watts of course was good, and I thought her boyfriend Henderson did a really good job too (not all critics agreed). The kid was appropriately remote and kind of creepy.I highly recommend it to anyone who likes horror films. I have never been a fan of slasher films and movies like this are so welcome as an alternative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>scariest movie i've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>********Nothing but spoilers****I've seen both the American and Japanese version. Even though I think the Japanese version makes a whole lot more sense, I was definitely more scared by the Naomi Watts rendition. One annoying difference was that every image on the deadly tape in 'Ringu' was an important clue. But on the American version, the truly disturbing images were the most useless. I was disappointed with the decision to sex it up by making Watts' character more dominant, but it made for a much more effective scare- especially in the last well scene. In the Japanese version, the ex husband lowers himself in and they drain the well. Creepy? Yes. The American version is hella scarier. The idea of being supernaturally pushed into murky water when you're pretty sure there's something in there with you is freaky. Samara was much more sinister in the American version. The flashbacks to her interviews in the insane asylum were too few and far between. All in all, good times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very clever horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original film 'Ringu' from which this movie was based but I would have to say that Hollywood did an OK job on this film. The plot is not Hollywood's, thank heavens, because in recent years any horror movie with any plot coming out of Hollywood seems to need to conform to the Scooby Doo format. By that I mean by the end every little mystery has been explained in full detail.... unfortunately at the expense of the real ingredients, fear, suspense, etc, etc.The idea of this film is very clever, if you didn't know anything about it then you would be surprised at what is going on and you would not be able to predict the ending even if you were convinced you had it right, you'd be wrong. Having read reviews to other Japanese horror movies it seems that many of them have intelligent and curious causes to the supernatural phenomenon as well. An influx of American remakes may follow The Ring.To give some sort of review I would have to say that it is for the most part one of the very best horror movies of the last 5 years. There is a deep and disturbing atmosphere, although I will see Ringu next and compare to see if it comes close. There is an excellent score of music to set the mood and tone of what the director wants you to feel during the scenes and the sound effects are used well to develop the tension. The storyline itself is by far the movie's strongest point and compares with any horror I can think of.In short I would definately say watch this movie if you like supernatural horrors, or maybe you should see the original 'Ringu' first though??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**************SPOILER ALERT********************I just saw this movie 2 days ago on cable and I had no bad issues with this film at all.This film is one of the few that made me feel such deep empathy for a major horror villian. The circumstances surrounding Samara/Sadako's childhood and death definitely made me understand why her spirit would want to exact posthumous vengeance. I would too in her shoes. My empathy was so great that, on the LiveJournal of someone roleplaying as the character, I commented that if she ever came for me, I'd go so far as to help her out of the monitor (I viewed the video on QuickTime) and just give her a hug so she knows that someone out there actually cares, and if she still feels she needs to kill me afterwards, then at least she knows she has friends out there. I dunno, maybe I'm just weird that way.I just ordered "The Ring", "Ring"s 0&amp;1, "Rasen" (the more literally canonical sequel), and "The Ring Virus" (the Korean version) on DVD...mark me as a new 'Ringworm', I'm hooked!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the film more than 15 times now, I must say that I am confident about my interpretation of the film and of its plot. The "object of the game," so to speak, is for everyone to see the tape. In order to survive, as we know from the film, a viewer of the tape must make a copy of the tape. But this process can be ended, because as I see it, all one has to do is make a copy, destroy the copy, and put an end to all the tapes out there. I did not see a sequel coming at the end of this film, but since I loved the film, I am excited about "The Ring 2."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a dark, dark movie. I haven't seen Ringu, but if it's scarier than this I might die. This was one brilliant movie. If you take a dead body and mutilate it to make it more disturbing, it looks scarier than anything else! The video tape kills you and somehow screws your face up. Man, that's creepy! Brings me back to Alice, Sweet Alice And The Texas Chainsaw Massacre! The video tape is bizarre, the mysery is a gas to see unfold, and the ubrupt and artsy endng was genius! The filmaking was brilliant!This is the kind of thing you have to watch. This ranks up there with Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, Alice, Sweet Alice, Zombie, Ghost Ship and The Changeling. If you to be scared and disturbed, rent it.9.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly good remake but endless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was impressed by the original Japanese version "Ringu" and that film was more tidy in it's storytelling but the same cannot be said about this remake. Story is about a video tape that when watched the telephone rings and the viewer has seven days to live. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is a reporter and when her niece dies under suspicious circumstances she investigates and hears the story about the tape. Her son Aidan (David Dorfman) has been drawing strange pictures that end up being part of the mystery. Her investigation leads to a cabin where the viewing of the tape took place and she takes it back with her so that her ex-husband Noah (Martin Henderson) who works with video equipment can check it out.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Aidan views the tape and now Rachel must hurry to find out the source of the curse and she and Noah head to a ranch where a woman named Anna Morgan (Shannon Cochran) use to breed horses but she meets her husband Richard (Brian Cox) who seems hostile. More investigating leads them back to the cabin and they discover a well under the floor where they think Anna's dead daughter may lie.This film was directed by Gore Verbinski who is a very talented director and he would end up making "Pirates of the Caribbean". This is a very good looking film that keeps a dark and hazy atmosphere throughout and I don't recall one scene that has sunshine in it. Every shot that takes place outdoors is either rainy or overcast and it helps create an eerie mood to the film. I enjoyed the pacing of the film and it keeps your interest throughout although there are a few changes in the script from the Japanese version to make it more Americanized. The one problem I had with this film was that it didn't seem to want to end and there were probably three different times that it could have. It just seemed to go on and on and I have to admit that I can't really explain everything I watched in this film. It is a complicated story and to it's credit this film never ventures into typical Hollywood cliche's but I wish this could have been wrapped up better. I do recommend this film and Watts once again proves she's a solid actress but the script sure could have been tightened up. The original is definitely better but this isn't a bad effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read many, many dismal reviews over this film. I personally think it was a break through in cinematic horror. Long have we waited for a movie to terrify us while leaving us scratching our heads. Not since "The Sixth Sense" have I been so inspired by a horror movie. The directing is pitch perfect. Gore Verbinski did an outstanding job capturing shots that will stick in my mind for many years. The acting was as well great. You don't go into a horror film expecting good acting. Sometimes, the acting is completely absent all together. In this film, it was well above average. Bottom line: not just a great horror movie, great movie. Two thumbs way up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unraveling of mystery adds to appeal of film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One aspect of this film that I particularly liked was how the main character unravels the mystery: by studying the tape, going to the internet, newspapers, hospital records, the old farmhouse, etc. This was so well done so you felt these were real clippings, real records. The photos of the lighthouse, the horses, Ann Morgan, the snippets of text in the articles were haunting. The music adds to this. This reminds me a bit of "Blowup" where a photo is searched to find a killer. Another eerie investigation takes place in "Angel Heart". Also in The Shining, Nicholson discovers the history of the hotel by looking at old articles in the basement. The viewer becomes as obsessed with the history as the characters in the films do. In The Ring, one is left wanting to see more of the history to explain what has happened. I could have had another hour or so on this investigation side of the film. This was a really classy horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Journalist stumbles upon a creepy video tape that she believes is killing all who watch it.There are clearly two types of people in the world. Those who find stuff like this scary, and those who do not. Its quite reminiscent of Stir of Echoes, and follows the same basic storyline with a few twists. I havent read the Japanese novel upon this was based. What I have read, however, is tons of stuff by the Victorian horror master MR James. He has a tale called the Mezzotint, about a man who buys an engraving and watches in horror as a diabolical event is slowly reenacted on the engraving. The images shown on the video in this film, and the overall mood I found to be quite evocotive of that particular tale, and nearly as effective. The film does a wonderful job of producing the kind of images that are only otherwise found in nightmares. Whether the resolution and explanation of the how and why will satisfy you is another story. I thought it could have been better. But that is not to say I wasnt totally creeped by it, and that I'm not still. It will most certainly have you hearing each and every creak in your abode as you sit late at night in the dark while this plays. Naomi Watts, my fav!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have only one problem with this remake, and that is the scene with the fly coming out of the tv. This completely spoils the ending of the film! I watched the remake of the far superior Ringu with certain trepidation and was mildly surprised to find I was enjoying it. However the scene with the fly completely ruins the film! The whole point of the shock ending is that you are supposed to be thinking that nothing crosses over from the tv world into the real world - this is why the end of the original was so powerful, disturbing, eye-catching....... However, the remake has already let you in on this as a possibility with the fly - thus rendering the shock aspect of Sadako (sorry Samara) coming out of the tv! Very silly mistake, very silly!</fullReview>

Drawbacks are the inevitable difficulty of child actors although the boy does his best, and the uninvolvement of the police or other authorities in grisly deaths which lends an air of unreality to the proceedings. However the solid pacing and scare rating allows any negative to be overlooked when the time comes for show and tell. Don't watch it alone.</fullReview>

They both must find out what the cause of the impending death of anyone who watches a mysterious video tape. They find out that the video was linked to a mentally ill horse tamer and her unstable daughter. Unlike some horror flicks that have an endless array of blood, gore, and violence, The Ring has a plot that's more consolidated, and not so nonsenical. The Ring really has lived up to it's hype. It's a horror movie that's actually good. The location shots of the Pacific Northwest were breathtaking. Even if you don't care for horror movies, The Ring is still a great movie to watch with friends or family. It's worth seeing again and again. It may as well be The Blair Witch Project of 2002!

Instead, we see the main characters rushing around in search of information in an attempt to save their lives. Meanwhile, we have yet another kid with "supernatural vision." Anybody seen 6th Sense, Stir of Echos, The Shining?OK, recycled plot aside it was still interesting to see how it all played out. However, they abandon the (all-be-it predictable) satisfying ending, in place of the gratuitous death and "things-leaping-out-at-you" tactics that they started out with.Give me a break.

		<shortDescription>Modern horror at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching so many diabolical let-downs (House on Haunted Hill and Ghost Ship for a start!), it was so refreshing to finally find a modern horror film that is actually scary! Indeed, not only did I revert to a silly wimpy 7-year-old - sleeping in the lounge with the light on for 2 weeks - but I also found it impossible to stop thinking about this film!This film worked very well for me, but I can understand why so many viewers thought it was poor. I saw this version before watching the Japanese one or reading the book. Indeed, neither film is very close to the book, which is a shame as I thought it was very good. However, after seeing the Western version and knowing what the concept was all about, I thought the Japanese version was dull, slow and an anti-climax, mainly because the film was so dark I couldn't see it and because the special effects were rubbish. Indeed, Rick Baker made a much better job, which, ultimately, saved the film from being a potential farce. However, had I seen the Japanese film first, I would probably be championing that instead!The black-and-white film quality and eerie sound effects maintained suspense right through the film. My only complaint would be the decision to cast Dorfman as the "cute" kid, who looked more like the scary midget in "Don't Look Now"!Action-packed from the start, intelligent and original with fine performances from Watts, Henderson (come a long way since Shortland Street!), and especially Cox, this is a masterpiece of modern horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very Scary Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert "The Ring" WOW!!! what a scary film!!!! This Film was marvlous it was the best film I have ever seen!! My favourite part had to be when the lady watched the video and she had to find out all about it!!!!! It was scary when you saw the little girl who was murdered. Also when they put in flash backs of the victims of the murder by the tape, who had blood and all sorts of nasty things on their faces. But the Scariest part had to be when at the end when the girl came out of the TV when the man was watching the video!!!!!! I would give this film a 10/10 for a Good, scary, exciting and terrifying video!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****.When The Ring came out I wasn't sure if I would like it or not. To my surprise, I did end up liking it. It also gave me some pretty good scares.The acting is good in the Ring, surprisingly. Naomi Watts does a good job here. Brian Cox has a pretty good cameo. The kid was really my only complaint dealing with the acting, he just came off like a rip off of Haley Joel Osment's performance from The Sixth Sense. The Ring represents Gore Verbinski's best work as a director, though there was one shot that maybe a ripoff of Rear Window. The dialogue is fine, though the TV conversation was a little strange and not in a good way. The Ring has some chilling scenes and some pretty scaring, disturbing ones. The film is pretty atmospheric, theres pretty much a sense of atmosphere throughout the movie. There are questions unresolved in The Ring. I'm hoping they will be resolved in the upcoming sequel. You still wonder when The Ring is over, like Where did it come from? But nevertheless, The Ring is an entertaining and thrilling experience.</fullReview>

Daveigh Chase annoyed me to start with, but hey, she's a good actress, way better than Hilary Duff, Naomi Watts proved that `Muholland Drive' wasn't her finest hour, David Dorfman, makes a good cross between Haley Joel Osment and Rory Culkin, and Brian Cox is a very good actor. No matter what everyone says, I will always like `The Ring.' It scared me more than `Freddie Vs Jason' ever could, and it's a hell of a lot more funny than the likes of, say `The Lizzie McGuire' movie. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Inferior Americanized (Canadianized) Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This near miss borders between the genuinely creepy and the genuinely absurd. Director Gore Verbinski (Mouse Hunt, The Mexican, Pirates of the Caribbean) manages to give this film an eerie, ultra dark look, but it's impossible for the storyline to rise above the preposterous. Why the tape? Who makes the phone call? There are no answers to the unanswerable. And...just when you thought it would (and should) end, there's yet another failed attempt to explain what happened. The best thing I can really say is that this is a FAR better film than Darkness Falls, and has me curious to see Ringu (the Japanese film of which this is a remake of), which I'm sure is superior to this. Naomi Watts (Mullholland Drive) is pretty easy on the eyes too. I'll give 'er a 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of remakes. I'll insist everyone sees the original, there's something elitist about remaking a film which can't really be improved upon to a great extent. However The Ring makes pretty good viewing. Much of the film is scene for scene the same but there are alterations to the plot. The acting pretty good, on par with the original although of course the dialogue is easier to understand. Visually it's more ambitious than it's counterpart but a little too glossy in places. Your always aware that your watching a film which dilutes the overall effect. As usual i'm going to mark he original above this release although it's suitably unnerving and a damn sight better than most recent horrors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Officially freaky, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror movies had been for a long time regarded as the more bloody it is, the scarier it will be. Take for instance the "Friday the 13th" movies. After a little while, it became ridiculous. When "The Sixth Sense" came out, M. Night Shyamalan re-ignited the sense that scary doesn't always have to be someone after you, but the unknown. The mystery.A mystery is a good description for "The Ring". The scary story comes out of the belief that if you watch a certain video tape, you will die in seven days. Why? That is what the story is all about. That alone is kind of freaky. Just to think that by watching a video you will die kind of gives one the "eebie jeebies"."The Ring" doesn't waste time on gore. There are only a couple of moments that there are glimpses of disturbing images. They are on the screen so briefly that it almost acts as a camera giving you a mental picture of what the people looked like after they died. I was surprised though that it only received a PG-13 rating. I really don't recommend to anyone that they allow there 13 year-old to see it. They WILL have nightmares. Either that or they'll never want to watch another video again. Especially if they just find it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Battle of the Rings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen both versions of The Ring, the American before the original, and I prefer the American version better. Although the Japanese version has the definate trump card of preceding the American, it's too mucked up in Japanese mysticism to really have universal appeal. The American movie is not without its flaws, the horse branch never really plays out, and the ostensible holes, yet the tone and feel is overall more creepy. It may go for the 'jump' scares rather than an overall feel of unease, but these jump scares linger with you for a while. There are some truly ridiculous parts in both movies, but the Japanese scene where they decide to empty the well takes the cake. See both because it's ultimately just personal preference that wins in this battle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film scared the **** out of me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, I am just back from a two-week holiday on a Greek island, where I saw this film at a open air cinema. I think my situation at the time influenced my experience: I was alone at the time (someone else were coming to live with me four days later), there were no people I knew in the audience, it was just me and my need to follow the creepy story. Afterwards, I walked home through sparsely-lit streets to the empty hotel-room I lived in. Luckily, I saw the late screening, which ended at about 1 am, otherwise the night would have been 2 hours longer. I went to sleep at about 2 am, for a few hours. At some time, I had a nightmare where I "saw" an image from the videotape in the film, and I woke up. I didnt dare to close my eyes again, instead I looked around the room, fearing that Samara was there. I finally checked my watch, and luckily it was 5.30 am, because at 6 the sun started to shine through the window. For the next three nights, I had a hard time sleeping through the night. Believe me, this film can do this to you! I can understand that people who have seen the film on video or DVD, can say: - Nah, this isnt scary! But if you have several friends around you, you can pause or stop the film, go out for popcorn etc., and that can diminish the effect of the film, but I am telling you, if you see the film under the same circumstances that I saw it, it can keep you awake at night. As for the film itself, it is very detailed, well worked out by the filmmakers. Instead of gore, Verbinski uses mood to create the scary elements. I liked the way he, in essentially non-scary scenes, focused on weird-looking characters and creepy sound-effects for chills. Check out the scene where Rachel talks to the female doctor, while a retarded boy turns around on a carousel in need of oiling. Warning: The following contains *SPOILERS*! I have read several of the comments posted here in order to recollect the details in the film. Id like to mention the (possible) significance of the Biblical names given to the main characters. I havent read ALL of the previous comments, so I dont know if it has been mentioned before, but here goes: Rachel. In the Bible, Rachel was the wife of Jacob, and she was barren. But then, by a wonder of God, she was able to have a child.My interpretation is this: If, as suggested in the film, the Morgans used black magic to have Samara, is it possible that Rachel used white magic to have Aiden? When you see him in the film, he looks weird, but he is creepily well-behaved no matter what he does. And he has the ability to to communicate with Samara. And is this the reason Noah treats her with so little respect, because he knows that he isnt actually Aidens father, because he was conceived supernaturally? I read some previous comments saying that Rachel looked too good to be convincing as a mother, could this be the reason? Noah. In the Bible, Noah built the Ark, to save horses (and other animals) from a flood. So, symbolically, Noah is a saviour of horses. Samara, on the other hand, hates horses, because they kept her awake at night, and she used her powers to kill them. Well, they didnt really keep her awake, because she never sleeps, but she hated her parents who bred and owned horses.... The reason she communicated this through Aiden, was probably to lead Rachel and Noah to her "room" in the barn.Anyway, this could be the reason she comes to kill Noah at the end. I totally disagree with commenters who write that the film falls apart at the end because what happens is unlikely. If you read folklore, something that is regular, is that a haunting stops once a victim of a murder is buried in Christian soil. But this is a horror-film. In Halloween, Michael Myers is killed, or mortally wounded three times at the end, but he survives.So does the villain here. Also, if you watch the scene at the well beneath the cabin, it is Rachel who jumps down there - experiencing exactly what Samara did - while Noah behaves like a wimp. That could be another reason why Samara kills Noah and not Rachel, beside the Biblical-name-symbolism. This leads to the finale where Rachel "finds out" that copying the tape can save you, but as mentioned above, there are several hints that this is just false security, and that Samara might be coming soon to a TV-set near Aiden.Also, Rebecca is a Biblical name, but I havent checked it out. I noticed some similarities in the story of her and the dead teenagers, and the plot of the novel Dracula. In Dracula, the count goes to England by boat, and kills the crew, while Renfield is left alive to announce the coming of Dracula, "a John the Baptist to Draculas satanic Christ". In The Ring, the four teenagers die, while Rebecca is left alive to announce Samaras coming, or at least help Rachel solve the mystery. One note: I saw Daveigh Chases wonderful acceptance speech for the Best Villain-award at this years MTV Movie Awards, she ended it with the line: - Everyone will suffer! I heard her say it in the trailer for the film, but I didnt hear her say it in the film, although I listened closely for it. But I have read in other comments that it is in the film, too, so I guess the sound-level was just too low in the cinema where I saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice compilation of the Japanese versions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few weeks ago I saw all 4 of the Japanese Ringu films and was very curious about this American remake. I didn't think the original was 'the most scary movie you've ever seen' - like everybody said, but I really like the concept of the cursed videotape and thought the Japanese did make a great movie. This US-version is a very good remake and also takes some information from one of the sequels. And that was what I missed in the original first movie.Though the story is just slightly different (e.g. the horses) it's the same idea. Some scenes in the beginning are literally copied from the Japanese and that is wise 'cause the scenes were good as they were. Later scenes obviously had to change because the tape was totally different from the Japanese tape (and not the same as someone here wrote).They succeeded in creating the same uncomfortable atmosphere by such small things like a fly and a bloody nose. The tension is always under the surface and is not spoiled by loads of special effects. I thought - even though I knew the story - this one gave me more creeps than the original. The scene with the horse on the ferry had my heart pound like crazy! And a big thumbs up for the cast. This is how I like my scary movies. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie yesterday on my vacation, with a lot of other kids, and most of the girls were screaming. And I can't say they weren't right. This film really kept me on the edge of my seat. Well, not that, it was just very, very frightening. I did see the original "Ringu" from Japan, but that movie was so 'eastern' with al those difficult Japanese names, and weird situations, different way of speaking (and I mean not the language, that's logical, but just some pretty vague and difficult use of words), so I could just understand pieces the story, not the hole story. For example: at "Ringu", I couldn't understand SPOILER!SPOILER!SPOILER! why the (dead)girl was walking out of the tv from Riko(Ringu)/Rachel(the Ring)'s ex-husband. At "the Ring" I did (okey, with some explanation from a adult). But although, it's better to see the original film first. Then you've got an idea, and you can the differences and similarities in the story. The story from "the Ring" was very different, but I do have the feeling that I understand the story better. The acting was great: Naomi Watts takes a revanche from "Down" and Martin Handerson has some funny scenes. Perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see that so many of the comments here are based on such ancient films as Friday the 13th, Last House on the Left, and Nighmare on Elm Street. You people could never hack it as critics. You were to busy looking for what you considered "horror" ( i.e. blood and guts, gore and cheap shock scares ) to give The Ring its due credit. This film was not the horror you grew up with. It isn't Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or Night of the Living Dead. It is a movie such as where Alien broke ground as a new Sci-Fi based Thriller. This one being though, a Paranormal based Thriller. You all ask "Well how did they do this?" or "How could it do that?" ... well, I truly hope none of you watch any "One-Man army" movies and think they are great. I don't know how those guys get anything besides being killed accomplished.Original, and filled with new ideas, the Ring was indeed a movie which carried an involved story line from start to finish. Well, maybe drifting away a bit at the ending, but still keeping you wanting to see what happens. I'm sure not one of you can say that you turned the movie off. A chilling scene indeed when you get to finally see this alleged death tape, espescially if the phone rings suspisciously afterwards .. which I am expecting the director may have anticipated to happen in a small percentage of watchers houses when it came to DVD. I didn't have any sort of anticipations when I watched this movie. I thought it would be another run-of-the-mill modern day teenage angst horror flick. Instead I got a great story, an interesting charcter back, and brooding, rainy Seattle.A cute tale of terror. Not horror.8/10</fullReview>

I still want to know how the boy is psychic...??? The lead actress was not very good, neither was her boyfriend. I expect the boy to be around, he was convincing, although no one knows how/why he's psychic. One thing I really liked was the video. Whoever put that together has to be really sick in the head, that was VERY engaging, although it raises so many more questions. For example, the girl was left up in the barn with a TV. How does her spirit connect to a video cassette? Who made it? For what it tried to be, The Ring is tolerable, I didn't HATE the movie afterwards. There are just too many plot holes for it to be taken really seriously. I'm interested in watching the original Japanese version though. ** stars out of **** .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very scary film about people who die seven days after watching a mysterious videotape. It's been compared to "The Sixth Sense" and that's a fair statement. Both films involve death and extrasensory perception, and both involve someone reaching out from the grave to the living.The story is about a reporter, Naomi Watts, who discovers that her niece died at the exact same moment as her boyfriend and another couple. Upon some investigation, she discovers that all four watched this videotape together. She tracks the tape down and watches it herself, and then the phone rings and a little girl's voice tells her she has seven days to live.I don't want to give away any more of the plot or the ending, but suffice it to say that it's a scary ride. The mood of the film is enhanced by the spooky images throughout, of scenes where time is warped. You're given little clues during the woman's search for what's behind the video, but the ending is surprising nonetheless.It's a good horror film. And wouldn't you know it, about five minutes after I turned off my television set and was standing alone in an empty house thinking about what I'd just seen, the tv turned itself back on ......

		<shortDescription>Horses in Place of Volcano-A different look at a horror masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that I've seen the original Japanese version of THE RING, I would be hard-pressed to choose between the two films. Both films are not that faithful to the novel, I understand (Can't verify it until an English translation comes out), but the US version is generally a mirror of RINGU. Except that the female protagonist in the US version is a much stronger character than her Japanese counterpart. That is because of the difference in our cultures.Another difference is that we seemed to replace the volcano from the original with the strange death of one woman's horses. The horse-owner replaces the psychic, placing more of the power in the daughter (It's also interesting that it is the mother in the US version who throws the daughter into the well, while it was the father in the Japanese version). Verbinski (or the script writer) was wise to set it in the Seattle area, so to echo the original's obsession with water. One last observation, The scene at the hospital was taken from RINGU 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish, Disturbing, and better than 'Ringu'- a lot better (no spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing first, I saw "Ringu" about the time I first heard they were shooting an American remake. I watched it and didn't find it bad at all, just- not that good (and I love subtitled movies, so that had nothing to do with it). So it was with some trepidation that I walked into the American version of the film directed by none other than the man who made "The Mexican."Well, my worries were unwarrented. This movie was great. I'm a huge movie buff, especially horror movies, and none of the classicly "terrifying" films have ever really gotten to me. I have jumped during movies before, but I can honestly say that no film has ever really gotten under my skin until this one. I'm not sure what it was, it's not particularly scary, it just hit the right buttons I guess. After getting "The Ring" on DVD, I rented "Ringu" just to refresh my memory of it. I was immediately reminded of why I didn't like it very much, and the points were made even more blaring watching the two side by side. "The Ring" is very stylish, and in certain scenes/shots rather graphic in visuals (the nail through the finger) or themes (Richard's abuse of Samara). The original, which did also have graphic bits, for me, just lacked intensity. After watching both films probably five times or so I still just can't be affected by "Ringu", and I try. From what I've read and people I've talked to, it seems that people who saw "Ringu" first prefer it and people who saw "The Ring" first prefer it. I don't fit in either category, seeing "Ringu" first but finding "The Ring" vastly superior. The look, the actors, the storyline (the minor differences improve it a lot), and especially the score are all top notch on this one.Even if you didn't like "Ringu", or you did and don't think this could match up, at least give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not so impressed with the new horror movies coming out these days, but for this one, I was very impressed about how good it was. I don't usually go to the movies to see the new horror movies coming out. The reason why I saw this is because my aunt made me watch it telling me and persuading me that I would definitely like it. The beginning was really scary to me, but the end was scarier. The movie did move a little slow but it was interesting because the whole time you are wondering what is the cause of what is happening and the ending all explains it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among recent horror films, subtle and genuinely creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers.This film does small things splendidly, and gets major points for eschewing huge film FX overkill that has plagued supernatural cinema from the '90s on. The makers of The Ring should be on the lookout for a parcel of all our unused Starbuck's coupons for crafting a film that appeals to the devotee of the Last House on the Left and the original Cat People alike. In fact, The Ring feels like a summit, as if M. Knight Shamalyan (Mr. Sensitive) met David Cronenburg (Mr. Gutwrench), and the two agreed to split the telling of a good ghost story 70/30 to appeal to the broadest possible audience.The Ring is, at its very best, a film of rich yet understated, indeed Lewtonesque moments. When the heroine picks a fly off the TV screen, after viewing the video several times and having seen clearly up to that point that the fly is a part of the recorded video image, her nose begins simultaneously to bleed. It is simple as can be, but a moment of supreme unease. And just after passing under a ladder propped against a wall on a downtown street, something clicks in the heroine's brain. De javu. She wheels about and places it as the exact ladder and wall setup from The Bad Video. The film is full of slight unsettling moments, such as these, that intelligently portend things dark, deep and grave as the heroine realizes her life and The Bad Video are beginning to intertwine.The part I have mixed feelings about: Inevitably the format of the film merges into an investigative procedural. They simply had to make some gesture of explaining "Why?", I suppose. Well, I wasn't going to ask, and they didn't have to go there. She is an angry spirit, sure, a thwarted soul. Leave it at that. But, no, once we start being asked to ask, we want to know their theory on it at least. How is she different from any other angry spirit? Her father says, significantly, she wasn't supposed to have been born. This is left hang. The film creates a killer atmosphere of wonder, out of not letting us know. We are inundated by enough genuinely creepy stuff we don't stop to wonder about backstory. But once the film assumes the level of a detective story, that now very familiar X Files/CSI guys-with-flashlights plane, we may begin to feel that we are waiting for a very important message. Ultimately, I think their explanation is disappointing. The horror in this film is in our feeling during the trip, not our arrival at any particular destination.The Ring is a welcome step out of the routine of crap like 13 Ghosts and the remake of The Haunting, films that give much sound and fury signifying nothing -- so beloved by generations of horror film fans -- a rotten name. I recommend The Ring with only small-quibble reservations. Seen in a year or two, totally clear of the hype, I think it will be more clearly seen as one of the best horror films in a while. Right now, the aftertaste of the films promotion and well-intentioned but blathersome audience buzz dilutes the purity of this delightfully creepy dark ride/deer-in-the-headlights experience.9 of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the scariest and best horror movie since "The Exorcist"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*This comment passage may contain spoilers, so read if you dare* *If you haven't seen it, go rent it NOW* I love The Ring! It is the scariest and most spectacular movie ever created! Gore Verbinski is a genius. For one, the original Japanese movie, Ringu, was horrible! Their acting was terrible, they had no expression at all, and it wasn't even scary! Hello! Can you tell the director to get a make up artist here!!!! Gore (V.) totally revamped this sucky movie into an incredible film!!! The girl's face (Katie) is completely amazing, how her mouth is unhinged, her eyes are rolled back, and how she is green and scaley! That is awesome!!!! Samara, played by Daviegh Chase, is soooooo adorable when she's talking, but when she comes after you, it's the scariest thing, that will make u scream in your dreams for weeks. This movie has an incredible storyline...it's like as you watch the movie everything is unraveling and one thing leads to another and so on. In Ringu most things in "the tape" didn't make any sense, but in The Ring everything has to do with what Samara (the little girl) is trying to explain to you. And, at some parts it's like as if, this one little things never happened, nothing would have. Like, when Rachel steps outside after Katie's funeral, she finds out that they watched that tape, but if she never stepped outside for a smoke, the whole movie never would have happened. This movie is scary, horrifying, and fantastic!!!!!!! Congrats to Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, and the incredible 13- year old Daveigh Chase for playing the evil (yet cute) Samara!!!! The Ring is fabulous and a must see!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifying in the wrong sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, first off, this movie was the kind that kept you terrified for days because it left you wondering so much. This may or may not be a good thing. Scary movies are supposed to be thrilling, full of suspense, and horrifying. This film attributed to all three. That is, for me anyway. Though it was just because I thought of it so often. So, you have this mysterious tape that kills people. Alright, I'll buy it if you can make me BELIEVE it may be possible. This was never identified. What? I suppose it's magic? Also if this little girl has so many powers, why couldn't she ask for help when she was still alive? you know, like send for the police or something. I think it's just down right rude to for her to kill innocent people because of her horrific life. I mean, YOU'RE DEAD,GET OVER IT! Come to think of it, what the hell makes her so special, and able to perform these kind of tricks post mordem? Plus, I never understood whether Samara was adopted or not. I stepped upon this question while watching the DVD that enclosed some deleted scenes. One of these scenes encases the reporter questioning some of the town locals. One of the men stated something about the couple leaving town for a while and returning with the Mrs. Morgan pregnant. Though if the child was adopted, what makes her so "gifted" and who where her parents? There, now with my questions, or most of them, laid out on the table I can get to some complimenting. The movie was unique (not this version in particular, because "Ringu" was the original that deserves the credit.) It had thematic elements, great graphics, thrilling on-the-edge-of-your-seat scenes, and a good villain (though not a well defined nemesis.) So, if you're the kind of person who doesn't care for plot, go rent this one. It's good to see with the boyfriend or girlfriend. It has plenty of scenes they'll fling themselves upon you from. So, in conclusion I fully agree with the comments of the previous. Though, of course, I had to satisfy my urge to trash a bit of this movie. To be frank, I was disappointed in this film. I felt it had good potential, but never filled its quota.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing comparing to the original "Ringu"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ring" is a re-make of a popular Japanese horror movie, "Ringu." I watched "Ringu" first, and I still find it scary after watching it more than ten times. So I went to watch the American version with high hope, and unfortunately, though predictably, it turned out to be a complete let down. The atmosphere of the original version, which was what made the movie oh-so scary, was almost completely wiped out in the American version by all the visual and sound effects. In fact, the quietness in the Japanese version creates the atmosphere and gives you an extra level of horror because you just don't know what to expect next. (SPOILER) I just can't stand the fact that in "The Ring", the TV chases Naomi Watts and pushes her into the well.(END SPOILER)I'll recommend "The Ring" to those of you who haven't watched either version. If you've watched "The Ring", I strongly recommend you to watch "Ringu" as well. If you've watched "Ringu" but not "The Ring," don't bother. It's nothing comparing to the original one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sufficiently scary and disturbing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to preface this review by saying two things: Firstly, I have not yet seen Ringu, yet I understand that it is superior to the remake, The Ring. Secondly, part of the reason that I have not seen that film is because just the trailer for Ringu terrified me while watching the DVD of The Ring.It took me a long time to see The Ring. I am notoriously a lightweight when it comes to horror films, a trait that still baffles me as I was a horror film junkie when I was in my teen years. Having heard the premise of the film, I was intrigued - I thought it was an interesting idea, an urban legend in the making. However, finding someone to watch this film with me proved an impossible task - they had either seen it and were freaked out enough by it to wait awhile, or they were so offended by it's very audacity to try to compare itself with the original. But, see it I finally did, and I'm glad that I did.From the start, Gore Verbinski directs the film with immense style. The cinematography is the visual embodiment of despondency, and it works. The atmosphere is incredibly dreary (you never see the sun shining, and rain is the forecast for much of the film) but it *should* be as such. These elements, added to some incredibly disturbing imagery made me feel like I was in a dentist's chair waiting to have a tooth pulled: The tension was palpable.**Spoiler Within**This is not a `fun' horror film to watch, however. Perhaps if I had watched it in the theater it would have been different, but I remember seeing House of 1000 Corpses and having a great time because the audience was getting into it. This was a horror film that kept me at rapt attention, and I didn't laugh once, even nervously. It did, however hold surprises for me: There were not a lot of `BOO!' type scary scenes, I can actually only think of two where I jumped, rather the imagery itself was extremely disturbing. The actual `video' is comprised of several frightening images with jump cuts that at first made me harkens back to my student film days, but became more disturbing as I thought about said images. Additionally, the movie was a surprise to me in that it wasn't just a horror film; it actually could be deemed a mystery/suspense film as well - with life and death depending on its resolution. It also contains one of the scariest sequences I have ever seen, when Samara is crawling out of the well and out of the television. This was the second time I saw the film, and I was just as scared during this part, if not more. There are few people I have encountered who saw the film who did not acknowledge that this scared them, just a little.The Ring is far from a perfect film. The acting is wooden, the characters have no substance and I'm getting a little tired of the clich creepy kid with a `sixth sense'. It also had a pretty weak ending. However having said that, I feel that some of the most common complaints regarding The Ring are a bit unfair, and most of those complaints are those that say that Ringu is the better movie. My thoughts on this? Then watch Ringu. There is absolutely nothing wrong with remaking a film that has been recently produced. It is obviously a good story that Hollywood deemed worthy to put their own spin on, like it or not. I can't make my own comparisons until I have seen Ringu myself, and I won't deny that I relish in the fact that foreign films are more liberal with `unhappy endings' than Hollywood films, but I feel that The Ring was a decent film on its own merits. If anything, Ringu loyalists should be delighted that The Ring gave Ringu so much press that it is now available to buy or rent just about anywhere. I heard rumor that a sequel to The Ring is in the works, and if it does half as well as Ringu 2 and Ringu 3 did in Japan I think we are looking at a franchise here. Hopefully it won't follow in the tradition of most franchises and sacrifice quality for quantity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary? but could have been better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring, a story of a killer videotape is a good concept, and it was very scary, but it could have been much better. Causes happened without effects and effects occurred without causes. The film was a touch too long, and lots of the scenes were played out for way too long.I can't say that I didn't enjoy it, but there seemed to be something missing in the film. Perhaps it was the element that nothing ever seemed to go together. Seemingly random newspaper ads and such were throughout the film.While the film was entertaining, it most definitely had flaws. While this film is much better than some of the other things that comes out nowadays, it certainly is no Halloween or Psycho, and it shouldn't be treated as such.MPAA Rating: PG-13 My Rating: 13 &amp; up My * Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film was pretty good. Was pleasantly surprised that the film kept faithful to the original and also incorporated aspects from Ring 0 and Ring 2. I still think I prefer the japanese version, although there is not much in it. I thought Ringu had a greater sense of evil and darkness which The Ring kind of lacked. Like Ringu...no way near as scary as people say but distinguished nontheless...7/10 then</fullReview>

Like if the people that saw the tape had to make copies in order to save themselves thats really stupid coz who else is gonna see the tape?? At the end since the lil boy copied it too theres two copies but wouldnt it make sense to destroy the tapes or hide them so no one else can see them...so then no one else would die?? I just dont get the ending. Its like they couldnt think of a good way to end it and threw in some randomness instead. I feel like i've wasted an hour and a half. Although the imagery was really good and some scenes really were very freaky, but other than that the story was worth nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a real scare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people I know have seen both this and the original Japanese version and concluded that the original is way better and scarier. Nevertheless, "The Ring" does scare .As the lead character, Naomi Watts is about as close to perfect as she can possibly be, and in such a movie it would be easy to solely concentrate on her. However, one can also be made to worry for the parts played by Martin Henderson as her ex-lover and that of the child David Dorfman.Some scenes, including the videotape itself are very disturbing. It uses such imagery and atmosphere that it's quite an intense experience to watch and I have to say this goes down as one of the scariest films I've seen. The direction was utterly unsettling it had me on the edge of my seat and left me crept out in the end. But putting a little thought on it, some elements don't make sense. This is where the film loses some points. In an effort to explain itself, the whole sense of the story is lost along the way.But disregarding that, it manages to get out of its deep well to give a real scare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not enough "booga-booga"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes are a tricky business, especially if you are remaking one of the scariest films to come along in recent memory. 1998's Ringu is a masterpiece of atmosphere and psychological terror from Japanese director Hideo Nakata that became a sensation in Asia, spawning a prequel, a sequel and a comic book. It's difficult to describe the plot without giving away any spoilers, but suffice to say that the story of a reporter named Reiko who investigates the mysterious death of her cousin, only to discover a videotape that kills people seven days after they have watched it will scare the pants off you. The American makers of the The Ring wisely chose to retain the best elements of the original story, but what they forgot to include were the thrills and chills. There are some minor shocks, and one sequence that will upset horse lovers everywhere, but the overall sense of tension that is so pervasive in the original is lacking. Naomi Watts (last seen in Mulholland Drive) is the best reason to see this movie. She's natural and believable, and even though she is in virtually every scene, seems underused. This whole exercise might have been more interesting if a director who specialized in making horror and suspense films ? like M. Night Shyamalan or David Cronenberg ? had been given a crack at the material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DEFINATELY creepy (spoilers here, youve been warned)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw The Ring, I expected it to be highly overestimated. I had seen The Sixth Sense, which wasn't too bad, and Signs, which was a pathetic scary movie wannabe (no offense) so naturally The Ring couldn't be that bad, right? Wrong.now let me just say this....I guess when I was actually watching the movie i was a little scared but mostly tense, you know. Like when samara crawled out of the TV i was like "Oh my God this is it." And I was actually TRYING to be scared. Big mistake. After the movie however......let's just say this.....it's VERY hard to get ANY movie to scare me (maybe creeping me out is a little easier but...)and The Ring had me lying wide awake in bed for like an hour half expecting samara to come out of the TV. (psycological horror is what it takes to get even the bravest people worked up and The ring uses just that. to bad that most scary movie wannabes STILL rely on guts and gory or evil monsters or something to make people scared *cough...signs...cough*) so like i said, its very difficult to get a movie to scare me and i respect any movie that can.there's even an explanation that makes sense most of the time to everything that happened during the film. maybe you wont get it as soon as it happens but if youd just think about it there's a reason for everything. like when samara grabbed rachel's hand and left burn marks on it. in the tape and under the wallpaper in samara's room there was a burning tree. there was a tree near the well at shelter mountain that when the sun set the rays would light up the tree and make it look like it was on fire. because the tree weas near the well samara would BURN her handprint into her victims. theres even a logical explanation to why the well was on the mainland. samara and her mom's doctor said she sent them to a hospital on the MAINLAND. mayb the well was near the hospital and they let them out to watch horses from a stable there. and when her father and aiden both say "she never sleeps" and in the video SM0015 er whatever she never slept, ever. so that could mean like she never rests, so when the father says it he means she'll never stop showing him psycological horror visions. he also said that "you take one person's tradgedy and force the world to experience it" (you hear rachel remember that at the end) it also means shell never stop and aslso explains "everyone will suffer." when aiden says it he means shell never rest in peace because not only did she feel like nobody cared about her but there was something wrong with her. so she was INSANE. once again in SM0015 she said she wanted to hurt people, and it wouldn't stop. and even why she crawls out of the tv can be explained. in the tape there was a picture of a chair just sitting there. when rachel and noah went up to samara's room rachel said 'while her mother was going crazy, morgan blamed the child, so he kept her up here, all alone' and noah says,'not alone. and he points to the TV and i guess there was a camera somewhere and then in the reflection off the TV there was rachel with the same chair in the same position as it was on the tape. so samara was constantly watched on the TV so she crawled out of it to kill people. and even when after rachel showed the tape to noah she was still seeing things. mayb even after you show the tape to someone you still get the curse except you wont die.the only things i think that cant be explained is where samara got her powers, they say the pictures are x-rays but in SM0015 they ask samara how she made them so would that mean she drew them or they were x-rays of her before she was born? and also samara's doctor said she was adopted but then rachel or noah (i forgot) found a certificate of live birth for samara morgan. i feel this is a minor fault for this movie so that keeps it from a 10/10 to me.overall, this is a VERY good movie. id highly reccomend it to scary movie buffs and its even good for a scare on halloween or for sleepover parties. sure it may give you nightmares for at least a week (except on your 7th night where you wouldnt go to sleep if someone paid you) but its fun to watch. ive seen it a few more times and it doesnt rele scare me now, but its still creepy. whoever wrote the japanese original novel REALLY knows how to scare people. ill give it a 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say is that this movie was SCARY!!! I am a big horror buff and it really takes a lot for me to say a movie was scary. Most horror movies I like are just entertaining.The Ring does a great job with introducing you to the horror about to happen in the beginning. The questions around what has happened is eventually answered in the end, but it takes you through a maze of events that have you glued to the movie waiting for the answers.What I really liked about this movie is how it was so scary with so little gore. Sure there were scenes that made you just shudder at the sights of certain things, but no real blood and guts. I loved that.I tried to write this comment without giving out to much information about the movie, because I think viewers need to look at this movie with no idea of what is going to happen or why it's happening. It is the meat and strengh of the movie...9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like a good scare so this was a good choice to watch alone, at night, in the dark. Except for maybe a couple scenes, it wasn't exactly scary. But the atmospheric imagery and sounds definitely give a creepy vibe.So there's this video tape which causes a person to die 7 days after viewing it. We all know that from the previews. The intrigue comes in slowly learning why the tape exists and how the people end up dead. Most of The Ring involves a newspaper reporter (Naomi Watts) researching the history of the tape, once her family comes in contact with it. It becomes a bit of mystery film, before reminding you again that it's also a horror movie. Not a mindless gore flick, but a clever thriller that aims to give you some big chills. It's one of those movies that may not be as enjoyable after the first viewing, because you know all the twists. But I definitely want to watch this one again, to see what new info I can pick up during a second viewing.The DVD has nice menus that emulate the surreal video tape shown in the movie. Unfortunately this disc is pretty lacking in bonus features (and the trailer for "Catch Me If You Can" feels pretty out of place). But there is a 15 minute montage of deleted scenes, which give you a little more insight into the story. There's also a hidden feature that lets you watch the full contents of the deadly video tape. I know it's just a movie, but I said to myself, "Should I be watching this?" And when the tape was done, I heard my phone ring. Seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so much scary as it is psychological</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that The Ring isn't as scary as many make it out to be. Yes, it has some moments where you may jump a little bit, but those moments are few and far apart. The movie is mostly psychological, with many freakish moments, for example, the haunted tape. The story is pretty good. It's about a video tape that kills its viewers seven days after they watch it, and a reporter who tries to investigate its mystery after watching it herself. You probably will need to see the movie more than once to fully understand the plot, but when you do, it'll be worth it. I couldn't help but ask, why? I won't ruin the story for you, but after you watch it, you'll be asking the same question. Since this movie is based on the hit Japanese film, Ringu, you might have already seen it, but I doubt that. And it has many differences with the superior Japanese version. All in all, The Ring is a great movie to watch at night time, in a dark room, with few people huddled around the television set. Definitely check this one out.Final Score - 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's face the facts:1) The concept was even dumber than Minority Report2) Horror films are just a mixture of drama and bad luckHaving those two things as disadvantages to the film, still did minimal harm, it's a great movie that I'd recommend to anybody.I don't generally like horror movies, and this movie was slightly too unrealistic in the sense that there were WAY too many coincidences in a row, however, it kept me entertained throughout the entire duration. The ending was a little stupid, but I guess where it left you is probably the best that could have been done, as horror movies don't often have sequels, at least none that are related to the original AND good.The Ring all in all, is a good movie and a good story, I can't say it's a good horror, simply because I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to. It's arguably the best horror I've seen (that instantly comes to mind) and as much of a movie buff I am, that is saying quite little.By no means is this movie a waste of time, it took a stupid concept and turned it into a great movie. In that sense it was like Minority Report, but good.</fullReview>

From the first time we see the video play through, I guessed quite correctly, that the "Ring" was someone looking up from inside the well as the lid is put on. It was just so obvious. Yet the characters take an age to figure it out and never seem to look for a well wherever they go. They never think to rewatch the video for clues, either. After all, if they're gonna die, why not watch it repeatedly? They might have made the connection with the well and the ring then.Anyway, they watch the video (once each), get a phone call, then begin to die off. The characters investigate with Scooby-Doo efficiency and finally get to the bottom of things (sorry, couldn't resist that pun).It's not bad, much better than I expected, but you'll probably grit your teeth at the characters' slowness of thought. I haven't seen the original, so I can't compare the two. But this played out like an episode of the X-Files really, but without the imaginative Mulder to come up with wild theories as to what was going on.It's worth a watch, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the tagline (before you die, see the ring!). And the movie definitely kept my interest. But, there were to many scenes that didn't add up right - maybe that was my way of keeping from being scared out of my wits.I think it was mean to kill Noah off. And give me a break on making a copy to save yourself. If that was true why'd the girl in the psycho ward tell our herione she had four days left - she'd already made the copy.The event dates didn't add up. The Video seemed to be at the turn of the century (Victorian - even her toys were of that era), but mom and dad seemed to be WWII people. And then how did the girl get killed inland far away from her home and horses? Also, what about the video being made of the daughter in the psycho ward - wasn't that before they had videos??I had a friend who finished watching the film, and when the TV went to static his phone actually started ringing. Now that was scarry!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exciting movie with a cool plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OVERALL MOVIE RATING: *** stars. A Good Movie.THE RING REVIEW:The Ring was a really good movie. It actually was as good as I thought the trailers made it look. This movie lived up to be as thrilling as it was said to be. One of the better movies in 2002.The plot of The Ring is about Rachel Keller (Watts) who investigates a strange series of deaths. She is told that each of the dead teenagers watched a mysterious movie and all died 7 days later. Rachel watches the movie and afterwards gets a strange phone call from someone who says "Seven Days...". Rachel finds out that it is true, and she only has 7 days to save her life and figure out the mystery of the tape.A really good movie, it has a lot of scary moments. The tape in the movie is really weird and it kind of gave me the chills. This also had some cool special effects to add something more to it.Watts does a good job portraying Rachel Keller, a strong willed reporter. The writing in this is really good too. Each character was given some pretty good lines throughout the movie. Good writing made this a lot better than it would have been if the writing took no effort.A really good, scary movie, I recommend this to anyone wanting a bit of a scare, or even if you are a fan of the actors in it. This has a really cool plot and interesting characters. This has a couple scenes that could have been cut out, but for the most part every scene worked. It also has a good background score to make scenes more intense. I advise you not to watch it over and over again though, as it will take some of the thrill away.</fullReview>

The whole idea of horror movies (*I think*) is to make u wonder if something like that could actually happen; maybe to u.Drawing u into the movie is the biggest part. They have to be able to reach-out to u on some real level and that's what also makes u jump and scream w/ surprise (fear?).I do have to say that I liked the movie, the ending... so-so... I think alot of people had questions at the end, it leaves u on the edge ur seat (like most movies do) and wanting more and wondering all sorts of things.After watching this movie, I seen "Darkness Falls" not long after. I found myself compairing the two against eachother. I just find that most "Horror" movies made today are no match for the thrillers and screamers from years ago.

		<shortDescription>Movie Left Me Confused - Not Frightened</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this video recently after some of my friends told me it was an "awesome movie" and it was "really scary". I remembered seeing the trailer all over TV when it originally came out, and figured I'd give it a try. I'm not a big horror fan, but if there's a decent horror movie, I'll watch it.The plot is this... Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is a reporter who's cousin dies recently of mysterious causes. With some investigation she finds out that three of her cousin's friends died the same night, at exactly the same time - 10 PM. She also finds out about an urban myth of a strange video tape that once you see it you get a phone call with a strange voice saying "seven days". Seven days later, you die. Rachel finds the tape and watches it, then brings her ex-husband (I think ???), Noah, a video expert into it. And together they try to track down the history behind the tape.'The Ring' has a very atmostpheric mood to it, which makes the first hour or so of the movie seem creepier than it is. The video tape is a series of disturbing images which slowly begin to make sense as the story unfolds. All of the actors seem to do a good job in their roles, but three quarters of the way through the movie I got lost. I fell off the "wagon" and wasn't able to catch up with anything that was going on from then on.The movie's plot is very strange. I know it has something to do with a girl who is adopted by a couple who own a farm on an island. There they breed horses, and the father abuses the child. Then the whole horse disease by-line is introduced and it gets more confusing. And the girl supposedly is telepathic or something. The confusion ruined whatever chances I had at comprehending what was going on with the rest of the movie.The last ten minutes in particular were horrible. I won't give away anything, but, then again, I didn't quite get the whole jist of the ending anyway.Overall, a decent horror movie, with an indepth plot which can easily get confusing. There are some truly scary scenes here and there. And there are some scenes that are supposed to be scary that just end up getting confusing. The explanation for the video tape and the young girl's death the writers come up with towards the end doesn't quite add up.The movie has great cinematography with a moody atmosphere. Acting is good, also. The plot, though, is too confusing - at least for me. And the confusion spoiled the whole movie for me. Rating: 5/10</fullReview>

I didn't understand some of the logic of the plot, but I guess it's a pattern of this type of movies. I liked it. For what it does, it's really intriguing. It's not boring, not stupid, not predictable (pretty rare, huh?), and a bit more sophisticated than the common Dracula+Ghost+Dragons+Monsters+Aliens+Fallen Angels+Dark+Sprits+Curses+masks+evile persons+blahblahblah common stories.

		<shortDescription>A mixed bag.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone seems to have mixed feelings about THE RING. Some (like me) think it was pretty damn scary. Others think it was pretty stupid.THE RING is modeled after a Japanese horror film called RINGU. (It's supposed to be better, check it out.)After the mysterious death of her niece, Rachel (Naomi Watts) starts trying to unveil the mystery. She finds and watches a videotape that, seven days after you watch it, will kill you. From there, she also finds the tragic story of the Morgan family. Rachel is determined not to die, and does her very best to figure out the videotape.Does she? Watch the movie.The videotape itself is pretty disturbing ... a bunch of random images is what you see at first, but as the movie goes on, you begin to piece together those images with parts of the plot. The only thing that kind of annoyed me was that, when one of those times comes, when something about the videotape begins to make sense, they show that part of the videotape and don't let the viewer figure it out for his or herself.Anyway, this movie is sort of more of a psychological horror--if something like this really happened, you'd be pretty scared. Admit it. I would give THE RING an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

Some who found this 'Boring', 'Not scary', 'I wasn't scared' etc...blabla..etc.. could do well to see it again, the way in which it should be seen, might find it quite a different experience - 'I wonder'.

		<fullReview>I was sceptical at the begin because I was afraid of some teenage-girl-slaughtering (you know, "Scream" etc pp), and the first scenes seemed to direct into that way - although it kept the suspense by the haunting atmosphere of the clean, lonely house ("Shining"?). What followed created more and more shivers: the gloomy pictures in foggy, rainy landscape and the well-wrought plot giving you no clue where it all ends did not fail to make this quite a frightener. The video itself is a fine, morbid piece of art, the clues in it are so hidden that one does not think that there is actually a story hidden in it. And the end was a really cynical surprise. This is a modern version of the classical subtle haunted-castle horror. Stay away if your nerves are thin - or if you lack sensitivity and only go for splatter blood-baths. (9/10)</fullReview>

At first, I didn't think it wasn't too bad. After the first half hour or so, it became incredibly gruesome. The whole Rachel-puking-her-guts-out thing was just sick. It had the stereo-typical twisted, evil, physco kid that you can find in almost any slasher flick. (Actually, TWO evil, physco kids).My advice: Don't waste your time and money on 'The Ring'.

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best horror films made in a long time. I have not yet seen Ringu, but I will in time. Basically, this remake of the Japenese version, is more creepy than 'scary'...it doesn't have a lot of jump out of your seat moments, but the real fear stems from the chilling after effect. I watched this late one night, in the dark, and I thought it was pretty good, though not as good as I had heard, until I saw the end...all I will say is that the movie ends, and then it doesn't...kind of like The Sixth Sense. I found the final 20 minutes to be incredibly exciting, and the end to leave a profound feeling of 'huh'? You really have to watch the movie more than once to understand all of the story, I still don't understand a few things, but I've heard there will be two more sequels coming out, so hopefully they will shed some light on the mystery.Anyway, the next day was when I got creeped out by the movie...it may not scare you that much once you watch it, but if you start to think about it (and if you have a tv in your room), you may think otherwise.Overall, one of the better horror films to come out, though I don't really think it should be classified as a horror film. There are some parts that could have been done better, IMHO, but otherwise, you have a pretty solid film with good acting and great suspense. I recommend this one, but remember, this is more psychological than 'scary'. 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You could be forgiven for expecting to see Hobbits when viewing The Ring (R16) but the film contains nothing so wholesome.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In director Gore Verbinski's horror/thriller flick a young journalist called Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is forced to investigate a mysterious video cassette which is believed to have caused the death of her niece. Helping her solve the mystery of the ring, which appears on the short video, is her former partner Noah (Martin Henderson) who also happens to be a video expert. To top it all off their son, Aidan (David Dorfman), is receiving strange messages from beyond the grave. Nothing is as expected in this unusual film ? a remake of the 1998 film Ringu. Watts performance as Keller is entirely believable, with the audience wondering what fate may befall her following her viewing of the video, although her skills as a journalist leave a lot to be desired ? I may have missed it but I didn't even see her carrying a notebook. Henderson, too, delivers a good performance eventually having the audience eating out of his hand. Dorfman's turn as Aidan is nothing but spooky. The film mixes horror, as it opens with the death of the ill fated teen, before turning into a thriller, with the search for the origin of the tape, including elements of the mystery genre too, as to how and why the child is receiving such messages. There's a stab or two at moral responsibility, when the true parentage of the child is revealed, but otherwise the film is fairly dark with plenty of sinister overtones. Not recommended for the feint of heart. The Ring is now showing at Te Awamutu's Regent Theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>YES! Finally a GOOD "scary movie"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are scary movies that are your typical no-brainers with silly little plots that really don't drive the movie, but rather hinder it. These movies are purely for fun and not so much for mulling over at the water-cooler on Monday. Then there are those scary movies that make you think...question...and ponder. The Ring is definitely the latter.The premise: there exists a video tape that when you watch it, you have seven days before you "see the ring" (ie: die). Sounds silly enough...at least I thought so upon seeing the previews. I will happily admit I was wrong since The Ring turned out to be one of the best scary movies I've seen in years. The acting was well done on all accounts, right down to young David Dorfman as the Keller's young son, Aidan. The imagery is incredibly freaky and was enough to make me sleep with a light on (Not something that happens very often, mind you, having seen about every horror movie I could lay my eyes on). The plot was good enough without the standard "cheese" associated with most scary movies. I like a movie that can make you think!If you're into a movie that holds your hand throughout and gives you a neat, tidy little explanation in the last thirty minutes or so, this movie is not for you. Oh, don't get me wrong, it DOES give you answers; but it makes you think for them. With subtle innuendos, imagery, and whispers of conversation, the viewer is able to decipher Samara's message and the overall "meaning" of this thrilling ghost story. And while attempting to understand Samara's message, she will scare the bejeebers out of you.Honestly, a very good ghost story with few "plot holes" (regardless of what other reviews might state...there really ARE explanations). Overall, The Ring deserves a 9 out of 10...not quite the BEST, but quite close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated much? *spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tendency of most people to exaggerate really ruined this movie for me. Before watching this movie last night, I had heard that it was the creepiest movie ever ("Oh my god, the phone rang right after the credits!"). Maybe I've just seen too many movies, but I saw right through this thing. The acting was decent, but the script was so loose and the movie couldn't decide which direction it was going to take. Is this a horror movie? A mystery? A love story? What? The story revolves around Rachel Keller, a reporter (or writer, whatever) who stumbles upon a story about a certain videotape that, after a person watches it, kills them seven days later. Obviously, curiousity gets the best of her, and she watches it -- as does her "Sixth Sense-esque" son and her pretty boy ex-husband. The videotape is full of all kinds of creepy images, such as nails going through fingers, nasty bugs crawling around, and middle-aged women brushing their hair (wait, what?). So it's a race against time to find out what this video is, where it came from, and why it does what it does. Now this part is why I don't think this movie is a complete loss. The mystery element pans out very well. The second half of the movie is the better part, because there is constantly a cloud over it. We never know quite what to think and our theories keep being swayed. However, the movie just feels a little fake. It gets so stylish that it sort of takes the viewer out of the movie. I didn't really feel attached to this movie, and like I said, I could see right through it. And also, I have to say, I am really tired of movies without endings. Oh well, at least it was better than Feardotcom...6/10</fullReview>

Anyway, if you take the time to understand The Ring you will find it rewarding, as there really is not any plot holes at all, and if you think you have found one, it was most likely put there on purpose as a mystery, people like mystery's, why do you think people gossip about The X-files around the watercooler all day?

		<fullReview>i love horror/supernatural movies, rather then slasher types, because of the thoughts that it implants into your head. i saw the exorcist when i was 15 and it wasnt the movie that frightened me, but the thought that the devil could take over my body. i know it was stupid, but the movie did it to me.it is the same for the ring. the movie itself was no scarier then the sixth sense, but the thought of footage that kills you played on my mind. the dvd i watched had the entire 'real footage', and after the movie i began to watch it. the movie was so effective, that as i watched, i subconsciously looked away for a few moments at a time so i didnt watch the entire footage. about half way through i was forced to eject the dvd (on command from the brother's friend) since the footage could not be stopped. however, i will end up watching the entire footage later (i hope).the movie itself was not as scary as i thought it would be, but resembled the sixth sense quite a bit. but i recommend watching the 'real footage' alone in the dark after having watched the movie. it will give you the biggest scare of your life. another thing would be to watch it with mates, and create myths about the 'real footage' actually killing people or the rumour that the japanese version of the movie had put people into physciatric hospitals.to conclude, the thought of the ring itself is scarier than the actual movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie is terrible. It's not scary. The plot is overwhelming. I wanted to take the nap in the middle of the movie. First, some people say how it's scary, because you can relate to it. How? It's totally impossible. How was the little girl controlling the tape? The movie doens't even give you sufficient explanation about the supernatural.Second, the should've ended it after Rachel was saved. Noah's death was just too much. It was it better than most of the current horror movies, including the other ones in this class of newly revived thriller-horrors, but skip it. I give it 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It tries hard, but it's just not that scary. Eerie, maybe, but not scary. It also leaves too many important plot points unclear for my tastes; there's a thin line between being cleverly mysterious and being just plain vague. The extra scenes the director glued together on the DVD release help a tiny bit, but if a scene is important to telling the story then it obviously should have stayed in the actual movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best scary movie in a LONG time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buuut, it's obviously not for everyone. I thought "The Ring" was extremely well made, with great pacing, acting, cinematography, characters, and a suberbly creepy soundtrack. My wife and son were so freaked out by it that they refuse to even be in the room when I watch it - but, then we all have very active imaginations. My brother, on the other hand, and two of the people I work with could not get into it and were not scared in the least, so to each his own. I think the key word with this film is "subtlety". If you like horror/suspense movies that scare you with the subtle things you can't see, then "The Ring" excels. If you want some knife-wielding maniac to jump out at you every 10 minutes, then you will probably be bored and underwhelmed. As far as the "holes" in the plot, several explanitory scenes were cut from the final film because they disrupted the flow. I still think the movie worked just fine leaving some things unexplained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, scary but silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another day, another Hollywood remake and this time its the turn of a Japanese horror classic on the metaphorical chopping block. Its got a cool concept, it has a cool actress in it (Naomi Watts of Mulholland Drive fame)and a cool trailer. Cool then? Well...Gore Verbinski (sp.?) chooses not to out-gross the audience (a la Halloween H20) and instead works on our deepest fears- that of the unknown. Oh, and a television. Naomi Watts proves she's no flavour of the month with a surprisingly good portrayal of a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown- again. Also there's the inclusion of everybody's favourite late 90s horror symbol- a scary looking child. Hmmm, I'm wetting my pants.But honestly, this is a very good scare-'em up. It has you on the edge of your seat throughout and you actually (SHOCK! HORROR!) care about the characters. The only thing that detracts from the film's appeal is the final, silly 30 minutes. I won't give too much away, but the film shifts from horror of the unknown to horror of the surreal. And the audience laughs.Not for your kiddies. It'll stay with you, that's for sure...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot Holes? Try paying attention.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** MAJOR SPOILERS ****After reading a sampling of the comments about this movie, I've been amazed at the number of people who criticize the movie for not providing answers to questions which it does answer, which are clearly being left for a sequel, and/or would be a total waste of time to explain clearly. To be clear on this point, I've seen the movie twice and have neither seen the original movies nor read the novels, so I haven't combed the earth looking for the answers to these questions.1) Why is Noah killed and Rachel not? Honestly, were you even watching? Samara wants the story of what happened to her told, and while she was in the well, the video was her only way to spread her message. *Therefore* people who make a copy of the video are not killed because they help spread her story and her "evil." The significant images in the video tell the story of Samara's life in a very twisted way, which makes perfect sense since it originates from a very twisted mind.2) How does the video get made? When the kids try to tape the football game in the hotel over her well, she is able to implant the images onto the tape. It's not explained how she does this, but there is a precedent. Remember the X-ray films with the strange images (dead horses, women with needles in them, etc.)? It's very subtle, but the implication is that Samara has the ability to put images she wants onto devices like cameras, X-rays, VCRs, TVs etc. Also, when they're exploring the barn, Noah notes pointedly that Samara had a TV to keep her company. One can presume that being alone with nothing but a TV contributed to this ability.3) There are images on the video Samara couldn't have seen. I don't have the DVD handy to review, but the only image I recall that Samara could NOT have witnessed personally was Anna jumping from the cliff. However, since Samara has been implanting images in her mother's mind since birth it's not hard to believe that she could have "seen" her mother's suicide. In fact, I think that Samara probably caused her mother's suicide by showing her the image we see on the tape to drive her mad. Regardless, we never know that the image we see is in fact Anna jumping. It could simply be Samara's imagination of how it might have happened.4) What is the deal with the assistant at the end, and why does it matter whether Samara's body is in the well or not? I've combined these two cause I think one answers the other...or will when the sequel comes out. I think Samara did a body snatch on the assistant. This didn't occur to me until the second time I watched it, but the assistant looks pretty much EXACTLY like what Samara would look like as a young woman. Anyway, I will grant that if you don't make that connection (which requires some imagination), neither question is answered.I think an awful lot of people came into this movie with preconceptions about what it was going to be about (a video that kills people) and when the first few minutes of the movie seemed to confirm this, they basically tuned out. I nearly did the same myself when the story of the video was being told and all the friends scaring each other, then not scaring each other cliche was happening and the whole thing looked like it'd be another bad teen horror flick along the lines of Valentine's Day, etc. But it really went in a different (and much better) direction after that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling, but... (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** Some slight spoilers ahead *** Chilling, but not as scary as some have made it out to be. I've read through a lot of the user comments here and I'm surprised no one has made reference to Ghost Story. The similarities are there to be sure -- a drowning, a restless and vengeful spirit that kills, embodiment and revealing of underwater decay, female, etc. I thought the "unmasking" of Eva in the house in Ghost Story (when she pulled her wedding veil off to reveal her true features) was more mortifying than Samara's so called "evil eye" face that was revealed to Noah in The Ring. And the opening scene in Ghost Story was far more riviting than the one in The Ring in which just a well was shone. Ghost Story stayed with me far longer than The Ring did (but I was a lot younger then too, granted.) A lot was made of the horses, but that all turned out to be a side-show. Anyway, if you can be spooked, this film will definitely do it. But I've been through worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A top-notch thriller chiller, a two-hour freight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ring is Gore Verbinski recent contribution to the cinema scene. Verbinski who made his feature film directorial debut with the comedy hit Mouse Hunt, and then the action comedy The Mexican, starring Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini is probably best known for his award-winning work as a commercial director creating the iconic Budweiser frogs. Verbinski has also been honoured with four Clio Awards and a Cannes Silver Lion Award for his innovative work on an assortment of memorable advertising spots, working for companies such as Nike Coca Cola and 7-UP.The Ring was based on a novel written by Kji Suzuki. It was originally entitled "Ringu" (The Ring), and was initially published in 1989. The work was supposedly based on an urban myth. Urban legends are the most enduring, are often the most disturbing-stories of murder and mayhem happening to ordinary people that are shared around campfires, retold at slumber parties and spread through chain emails. Suzuki, who wrote the book, actually a series of novels, was once a somewhat obscure writer, but is now referred to as the Stephen King of Japan. Japanese director Hideo Nakata brought the story to the screen in his gothic horror mystery "Ringu," which was released in January 1998. It quickly became a phenomenon, spawning the most successful horror film franchise in the history of the Japanese cinema. The mainstream Hollywood film community then picked up the basic story of the ring. Ehren Kruger who attended college at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts then rewrote the story to attract the western film audience. Kruger's subsequent credits include the hit horror sequel Scream 3, directed by Wes Craven and John Frankenheimer's action thriller Reindeer Games. The new adaptation of the ring was then produced to Hollywood standard using special effects by a top production team, including Walter F. Parkes and Laurie Macdonald the husband and wife team and heads of Dream Works Pictures and two of the most active producers in Hollywood today. Mysterious videotape is killing off anyone who watches it. Whenever the victim watches it, the phone rings, telling them they have only one week to Live. A young reporter named Rachel is investigating these events, but after she and her small son watch the tape, it becomes a race against time to find out why the tape is killing everyone and how it could be stopped. The story centre around Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is a young journalist with a divorced husband, Noah (Martin Henderson), and a son, Aidan (David Dorfman). Her niece was recently found dead with a look of pure shock embedded in her face as if something scared her to death. Upon Learning that her niece's three friends died at the same time, too, and hearing about a disturbing videotape that is said to kill you seven days after watching it, Rachel comes into the possession of that same tape. Now, as time grows short, Rachel And Noah race to save their lives from impending doom and discover what the tape has to do with a tragedy-stricken horse ranch and a very strange little girl named Samara.The ring is a top-notch thriller, chiller horror for a Friday night date. A successful nail bitter of a Film that rattles the nerves and the imagination. If you're looking for a jumpy Friday night of a film look no further but the Ring will not play on your mind, don't expect to remember the film in week. The shots are clich and at times I found myself bored but the ring is successful in it's appeal it is nothing more than a two hour long fright as it's full of jumps. If your not easily scared don't bother but if you have an active imagination and have nothing more too do at the weekend get yourself along to the Odeon and go and see</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the film very intriguing being that the concept of this type of killer video is relatively new. I've seen the original Japanese version of the film and find both of them delightful to watch. The American remake added other storyline which is fine because it adds another dimension to the horror/drama. Instead of just spirit photography, this is a form of spiritual rage video where the outcome is horrible death. Very interesting and different.If one wants to see another movie that had to do with a kind of killer video then one should view VIDEODROME.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>scariest movie I've ever seen!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi there!!I watched "The Ring" for the first time a few months ago, and let me tell you, I got the scare of my life! I went to go see it in the afternoon so that I could have a good night sleep, instead of waking up horrified from a dream the involved a gruesome little girl coming out of a tv, so that's why I went to go see it in the afternoon!When you see the movie, at first you think: "Wow, that was freaky!" after jumping up from your seat, but then, the movie has this way of sticking in your subconscious. I couldn't even go by my TV at home after watching "The Ring" withought thinking about that little girl! And man was I terrified! Even looking in one of my mirrors at home ( which looks like the same mirror that you see Samara's (the little girl) mother brushing her hair! No joke, it's a crazy coincidence! I almost flipped after realising it!) just gave me goosebumps!Because of that movie, I also experienced one of the most scariest moments of my life, what I'm about to tell you is the absolute truth, I not just saying it so that I can make the movie look good or anything, but it's really scary, and just goes to show that the movie was so well maid, that it had that much of an impact on me!Ok, it's not that long of a story, all that happened, was that I suddenly woke up in the middle of the night (approx. 3:00 in the morning) and had a nose bleed! This was on the same week that I just watched the ring, as if it was one of those signs that I was going to die. No this was not a dream, my brother ask me the next morning what I was doing up in the middle of the night!So anyway, very freaky! Just goes to show that the movie was extremely well made, and well acted. I hope they come out with another one just like it!-Marcus</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely one of the more thought-out and intelligent horror movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best horror or science fiction movies you will ever come across. It competes with the likes of Poltergeist, and is an instant classic in all respects. As is usual, it takes a certain type of person to appreciate it for what it really is, and those who were more than content with it likely didn't bother to comment on it here. So you can disregard just about ever negative post here, since you have to really go out and see it for yourself to make that judgement.Regardless, The Ring is an excellent flick with a winning idea behind it. It has a symbol (the ring itself, of course) and what has to be one of the most original plot lines anyone has seen. A video tape that kills you seven days after you watch it, subliminal hints at what will become your ultimate fait, and a truly unique character to be afraid of. Yes, it will leave a lot of loose ends untied at the end, but that's the point. You will remain affected by this movie long after you have finished watching it.This is a deserving addition to really everyone's home library, whether you thought it was just 'okay' or utterly fantastic. It's truly a one-in-a-million movie, much like The Sixth Sense, Titanic and Poltergeist. Don't pass this one up. At least bother to see it once before giving up hope.Anyway, to wrap things up, this instantly became one of my favorite movies and has all the fixings of a well-done theatrical feature. And I really, really hope they slap on a sequel to clear up some of the confusion that seems to be plagueing a lot of watchers. Excellent, fantastically done movie.Before you die, you see the ring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Scary Horrer Movie? How did that happen?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Horrer Genre over the years has degredated into teenage supermodels running around half naked in the woods being picked off by Axe murderers. Somewhere along the line people forgot that Horrer movies were suposed to scare you beyond a few startles. Enter: the Ring, this movie was an exelent example of what a horrer movie SHOULD be. It's not just another blood and guts slasher flic, in fact the movies suceeds in scareing the crud out of you wihtout showing more than a few drops of blood in the entire film. The ring follows a female reporter who investigates a mystrios video that suposadly kills you seven days after you watch it. After veiwing the video, she finds out not only that it's real but that it kills you in the most horrible way possible: It scares you to death. Victems of the video are found with a horrible looks of terror etched on thier face. Not only does this woman have to figure out how to survive the vieo by solving it's mysteries, she has to save her son who watches the video himself! The director does an exelent job of being very spooky. Scenes don't jump around like most movies, it uses very slow cuts and disoves to give the movie a very slow pace, and belive it or not the slow pace makes the film. You find yourslef stuck in a slow process of anticipation, you don't know what's going to happen, but you fearful of it. The reason this movie is so freak is it INCLUDES you as part of the film. You have to think that since you yourself saw the video, that your in the same situation as anyone else. You know that it's just a movie but in the back of your mind you can't forget what you saw and the fear is still there. Basicly your freaked out, and will stay freaked out for days after you've seen it. You won't be able to walk though a dark hallway with the same vigor ever agian. And don't think your to big a man to be freaked out this movie: that kind of man does not exist. This is the first move to ever really scare me. My advice? Check it out, you won't regret it. It's a purly entertaining, and it'll have you guessing until the very end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the ring... where do i begin. well its about a journalist who's niece died mysteriously. she hears about this urban legend that theres this tape and it is someones nightmare on it. but after you see it, you die exactly 7 days later. so rachel (the journalist) tracks down the tape and watches it. the legend is becoming a reality and she now only has 7 days to unravel the mystery of the ring. #1 the script alone is brilliant. it makes you think and you really dont understand the movie completely until you've seen it 2 or 3 times, which i loved. it keeps you on the edge of your seat, and it isn't gruesomly gory or scary, which i also loved about it. the suspense is what really scares you, and this one ending scene really creeps you out. #2 the acting is great and the understand the meaning of there characters greatly. i jus totaly loved the entire piece and i praise the writer of the ring who origanally started it all because he is a brilliant man. i definatly recommend this thriller to anyone who likes these kinds of movies. let me tell you... its full of twists and will keep you guessing and trembling long after you see it!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was appalling, and didn't scare me in the slightest. Granted, there was some suspense there, but this was simply due to the hype surrounding the movie - I constantly expected something to jump out and terrify me, but it just didn't happen. I would have been equally scared watching Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, had I been warned that it was 'the scariest film of the year'.There were far too many plot holes, the characters were boring, and it took me about 3 hours after leaving the cinema to figure out what the heck the ending was supposed to mean.I'd like to blame the film's quality on the director and dismiss it as a bad remake, but having seen the original I can safely say that both versions are equally terrible.If you're easily scared and don't care whether a film makes sense or not as long as it throws in as many horror movie conventions as possible and builds up suspense with lots of scary music leading up to a huge anticlimax, go and see this film. I expect you'll love it. Otherwise watch the original, laugh at how bad it is, and trust me when I say that the remake is even worse.</fullReview>

Once the story finally explained itself, which took forever, the ending still didn't make sense. How was the tape shot? Why would she still kill people after being set free? Why was Aidan involved...is he clairvoyant? How did Rachael survive and Noah not? ugh. anyways, lots of scenes that leave nasty images in your mind and it definitely needed the "R" rating. No way this is appropriate for pre-teens. Heck, I'm 30 and I could barely handle it.There are better psychological thrillers out there. Save your rental money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't horrible, but it is a clear rip off on many levels from the Sixth Sense. For starters, the spooked out and somber little boy with the glazed eyes - a clear rip off. The thing about the tape was interesting, but it bugged me. I wanted to know more, like what the hell was so wrong with this freakish girl Samara who was so wretched the mother had to push her down a well. And Samara supposedly died in 1978. So why the hell was the mother wearing a laced up Victorian dress when she tossed her in? Finally, this last point really bugged me. What the hell is a little kid like that calling his mother "Rachel" for? Is that supposed to be cool or something? That this supposed tough, hardened, independent, career-driven single mother insists on having her kid call her by her first name? That made me want to vomit. I know it sounds petty, but for somereason it really, really irritated me. It was like they were trying to make the mom cool, like they were trying to make this movie cool.Instead of being scared I was annoyed. if you want to be scared, try The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, or Helter Skelter - a true story that will have you shivering.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring has finally bucked the trend, started by The Sixth Sense, of trying so hard to have a surprise ending that you write yourself out of a decent story. The great mystery writers of the past never lied to you about which person committed the murder, they convinced you that you didn't need to know who did it until the end of the book, this is the best way that I can explain the way that The Ring redefines the budding modern horror/thriller/mystery genre.I felt that, after The Sixth Sense, M. Night was trying too hard to do something special, and lost sight of filmmaking. This is also true with alot of lesser filmmakers who have tried to make a decent entry into this genre.The Ring may be a remake, but it is a truly original piece of work, I haven't yet seen Ringu, but boy do I plan on it now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! I never saw this movie at the theater because I thought it was going to be another ridiculous teen slasher fest that was tired and dated long before Scream ever graced cinema screens. After renting it and watching it, I was nicely surprised. They took a concept that would be deemed as ridiculously jouvenille, made it into something that actually was pretty scary, executed it quite well, built the pace and even give you a nice false ending where everyone is happy and safe, then all hell breaks loose, or so I thought it was going to. For those who have seen it, you know what I'm talking about. For those who haven't...SPOILER AHEAD...No one should have lived a the end of this movie...it would have only been fair in keeping the pace. The little boy himself says that she never sleeps, and she'll never stop...unless you make a copy of the video tape and make someone else watch it? No thanks. It regressed back to jouvenille silliness with the very last shot of the movie...which was a gigantic dissapointment to such a chilling movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the movie was about as scary as the wizard of Oz. interesting premise, however the execution was weak. The film starts out as an Urban legend kinda thing, that proves to be true. that part is the redeeming quality of the movie. the Investigation as to why it happens, and the How, is what bogs the movie down.Intersting, but not a movie to buy on DVD, rent it and then never watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When watched all by yourself in a completely dark room this movie will scare the hell out of you. I hadn't have so many goosebumps since I saw the Blair Witch. I admit that you have to be a lover of horror movies in order to enjoy this one as I did. If you are willing to let yourself go and be drawn into the story I promise you'll be in cold sweat. There is no real gore here but the scared frozen faces of the victims are absolutely shocking.If you like the following movies you are likely to enjoy The Ring: Se7en, Halloween, Blair Witch, Alien Series, SWF, Dead Calm, Fear, Cape Fear. Basically, if you like a good scare, surprises, plot twists but also predictable situations. P.S.: Don't let the soft MPAA and FSK ratings fool you. Do NOT watch this with younger teens or children. (Or you'll get a certain phone call.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT alright, i understand most of the movie, but there are bits that just dont make any sense at all! like Noah's assistant at the end of the movie, my guess is it'll be explained in the sequel. anyhow, after rachel got Samara out of the well, they arranged for her body to be have a proper burial, Rachel thought it was over. Until Aidan points to her that Samara doesnt want to be helped, all she wants is to hurt other people as she had said earlier in that tape from the psychiatric, so rachel tries to warn Noah but he doesnt answer his phone, and later Samara kills him, so Rachel becomes confused as to why she was spared and realizes the only way to avoid death is by making a copy of the tape so that more people can get to see it, and she makes Aidan make a copy himself.. i just have one question: what did richard morgan mean when he said: she (anna morgan) wasnt supposed to have a child???!!!</fullReview>

Although I hardly feel that it was the scariest movie of all time ("The Exorcist will always hold that record in my opinion) the story was spellbinding at the very least. Those who love a thrill ride, or simply a film that will keep them guessing and guessing to the very end will love it. Much fresher and innovative than those of the likes of The Scream trilogy, this really is unpredictable. Those who enjoy Hitchcock will enjoy the guessing, again and again about the ending.

		<fullReview>The Ring is a movie that holds your attention from its start due to its tremedous editing, direction, and story. The music by Hans Zimmer is also terrific. Naomi Watts is very good as the catalyst in the story. Brian Cox delivers his usual fine performance. The rest of the cast is good, but not great. The direction of Gore Verbinski is outstanding. His directing builds the suspense to a head, without giving much away. The art direction and sets are very well done and set the mood for the whole story. The Ring is one the best horror movies I've ever seen. The screenplay lacks in some areas and excels in others. I give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Is All About Goose Bumps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I swear this movie has a Chinese origin, remake or Japanese. I knew it. Tell me about little drowned girls undead in a wet dark well - I was hit the hardest.The DVD cover claims "the best since the Sixth Sense". Technically it is very good, clean straight horror, no hanging parts there. However there is an important difference. Sixth Sense speaks a powerful humanity, ghost or not, a palpable longing for living that is very sad and beautiful. The Ring has some good moments - the island, lighthouse, a mysterious pall reminiscent of Hitchcock's Vertigo. But it's mostly about a kind of pure, wantom evil, that after the paralyzed state I start to want badly to fight back, tooth and nail, come what may. As of the moment, millions of worms are squirming on my screen(in the DVD extra). My hair is still raising but the scare is giving way to rage, sort of. Strange to be so worked up. Rachel, handles herself admirably 7 days up to her scheduled doom, but the film detracts greatly with the end. It should be much better just with the scene in the extra, an unmarked tape beckoning ominously from the shelf. Making copies only to keep her own life - the man-eating tiger's pawn, another chinese origin!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gore Verbinski... Before The Ring I had seen only one movie from this director. I must admit that I really enjoyed Mouse Hunt and its pure old-fashioned slapstick style. But still, Mouse Hunt wasnt the kind of a movie that would make its director a top director in the world of cinema.Ive never bothered to watch the Mexican because it simply doesnt interest me. I dont remember when I first heard about the Ring, but when I read all the positive reviews I knew this was a film I didnt want to miss. And when the movie opened in Finland some weeks ago I went to see it with my friends. And I was so glad that I catched the movie during its cinema run.The Ring is a movie that shouldnt be watched in daylight. The best place to see it is a theatre with lots of people. If you watch it home, wait until its dark and then play the movie. And if you have a home theatre system the experience will be even better. This is a creepy movie that will scare you at least a couple of times.Ive never been a fan of "horror" films like Friday the 13th or Nightmare On Elm Street. I enjoy creepy ghost stories like What Lies Beneath, the Sixth Sense, Poltergeist etc. Horror is a very difficult genre because you can easily cross the line between being scary and being funny. Take Thir13een Ghost, for example. I couldnt even watch the whole movie because of its stupidity. That film didnt give me any creeps at all. But luckily every now and then a good creepy movie comes out of Hollywood and the Ring is such a movie. I was very impressed by the movies autumnal style, dark atmosphere and performances. You rarely see memorable performances in this kind of movies.Itll be interesting to see what Gore Verbinskis next movie will be like. Hopefully itll be something as memorable as the Ring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. I had wanted to seem it in theaters but as usually I just stayed home and got drunk. So finally I rented it and watched it at home. The filming style reminded me of the same style used in Koyaanisqatsi that eventually found it's way into the hands of Trent Reznor for the Nine Inch Nails video Closer. If that wasn't enough to pull me in, the Jacob's Ladder style of creepiness that runs throughout the movie would also have sufficed. I'm so sick of movies like Scream and Signs that have a certin wacky predictablity, and plot that fit together so tightly that it's a wonder why the charecters in the movie don't figure out what's going on. Here we are now with a visually intense what-the-why-the-hell-is-this-going-on creepathon that doesn't seem to pander. The movie contains very minute amounts of actual violence on screen, much like Jacob's Ladder and has this kind of decent into insanity where "why?" just sort of becomes an invariable question. As far as reasons are concerned for the source of or cause of the evil, lots of theories can be hypothesized. Mine goes along the line of thinking that the lesson learned by the movie is that much like the government, the only way to stay safe from evil is to partake in it's execution. No pun intended. I give this movie a nine out of ten because as much as I would have enjoyed some female nudity from Amber Tamblyn or Naomi Watts the movie would not pander to my idiocy. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap scare tactics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been told by everyone I know that The Ring is the SCARIEST MOVIE EVER and MADE ME LOSE SLEEP FOR WEEKS, my expectations were fairly high. I honestly don't understand why this film has everyone pulling the covers over their heads. It's average, nothing more, and it's cheap. Most of its supposed horror is of the "jarring musical chord as a door is opened to reveal a mutilated corpse" variety. It wasn't effective in Friday the 13th Pt. VII, and it's not particularly effective here. Once in a while something will disturb you or make you jump - the girl lurching out of the television, or the disgusting makeup job on the victims of the killer videotape - but on the whole The Ring is inconsistent and annoying. The two main characters were so irritating, inept and aggressively stupid I not only didn't care what happened to them, I wanted them to die BEFORE their seven-day countdown reached zero. There's simply no reason we should care what happens to them. The son is nothing but another incarnation of the "preternaturally intelligent or intuitive child" archetype we see in too many movies these days. His connection with Samara is never explained. The ending is smug and self-satisfied and makes no sense; I could almost see Gore Verbinski (who also directed Mouse Hunt) standing up in his chair, yelling "1 4M CL3V4R!!!1"If you want to watch a movie that's as creepy and atmospheric as The Ring tried to be, watch the vastly underrated The Mothman Prophecies.6/10</fullReview>

I hadn't noticed any comments on this in this group, but I played back the dvd, and noticed it every time. I thought this might be a problem with the dvd, so I rented it again, and noticed the same thing. It's very quick, and you have to really be paying attention, but it's there. Maybe it's just my TV, or maybe I'll die in seven days, but take a look. Did the director put this there on purpose? Was this just a glitch, or did I see what I thought I saw?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, maybe it's because I've watched "Ringu" first before watching this, but this is a complete travesty compared to the sheer horror in the subtlety of the original.*Spoilers ahead*When the girl comes out of the TV in the first one, I was creeped out (note: but not scared) like crazy, and there were many nights where I had trouble sleeping. With the special effects in this one, it was way over done.I guess when it comes down to it, it really depends on which one you watch first... if you see this one first before the original, you might like this one better. "Thriller/horror" like this is all about first time watching, when you least expect something to happen. I will say this however: part of the problem with this remake compared to the original is that it tries too hard to explain everything (typical for western audience, where everything must be explained and addressed), part of the thing that did it for me in the original one was that it started mysteriously, and ended mysteriously.Anyways, I just didn't like it... I wasn't as creeped out as I wanted to.</fullReview>

I watched it on a laptop DVD with headphones and the sound was quite impressive. Still, the whole story hardly made any sense at all. Without going too much into spoilers, Where did she come from? Why was she so bad? What was her motivation? What the hell was with the fly? The horses? The list goes on and on...I guess it was worth watching just to look at Naomi Watts. Made me want to watch "Mulholland Drive" again. The only thing good about this film is you can play tricks on your friends after watching it, like calling their cell phone and whispering "seven days...."

		<fullReview>Now this flick will definitely scare the sh*t out of you! Demonstrate it for you on a "scary" scale from 1-10: Evil Dead/House on haunted hill ('99) = 6, What lies Beneath = 7?, Signs/Exorcist = 8?, The Ring = right off the scale! If you are a wannabe (or perhaps to-be someday) horror movie director, I seriously suggest you give this a viewing, since this is by far the best example of getting the maximal effect out of minimal effects. Gore Verbinski, you a re a true genius. The plot has very much potential (just happens I had this idea of a net site that pops up randomly causing deaths... oh well...), but it's the sense for visuals of Verbinski that REALLY boosts it all up. And talk about the ending... that b&amp;w chick coming through the TV screen is just one haunting image and an instant classic, deserving its place right up there with similar over-the top scenes in horror genre like "The chestburster" from "Alien", "Michael's gone" in the end of "Halloween" and "the twisting head" from "The Exorcist", just to name but a few. BTW, after seeing "The ring", I just can't take my eyes off the TV screen when it's not on... I swear, if it happened to turn on showing static, I'd die of a heart attack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring is a very creepy film with one of the most amazing plots. This is an excellent film! I never have seen Ringu but I've never been one for Asian films so I'm glad this was remade in an American version and still came out as good according to the people who have seen both films. Naomi Watts is a phenominal actress as good in this film as she was in Mullholland Drive as she adds a suspense element to her charachter which a lot of other actresses wouldn't be able to play on screen. The other actors in this film were nothing all that special though the young child actor who plays Ms Watts son in the film is a very good actor. The child villianess is as creepy as any horror boogeyman and the legend of watching this tape then dying 7 days later holds an urban legend like mythos that made this story truly terrifying.I loved the fact that even though I love horror films with excessive gore scenes The Ring was just as good without any gore in it.If you haven't seen this DO SO!!!

		<fullReview>****there are SPOILERS in this review*****I heard this was gonna be the scariest movie ever, and I guess it might be. I'm not a big scary flick girl, so I don't have much to compare it with. In my opinion, there were really only a few parts that were very scary. If you've never seen it though, it can be scary if you watch in total darkness alone. The beginning was the scariest part in my opinion.I liked the movie overall, but there was so much left to be answered.How did that tape come about???? Who made it? Samara I assume, but how? Did she really have access to a video camera? I know Samara said she sees images and they just "are" with the photos. Maybe it doesn't make sense because I don't buy that something can just appear out of thin air, or that a ghost can make a tape. Apparently the movie is kinda based on this notion. Someone suggested Samara made the tape while the kids were in the cabin trying to tape a game, but there was a tape in the mental hospital archives that was missing, so obviously it had been around.I didn't get the whole deal w/ the father and Samara's relationship and the horses and all that stuff, and everything the dad talked about when Rachel went to see him. Maybe i just need to pay more attention or maybe someone could explain it to me.And why did Samara start communicating w/ Rachel's son Aidan?? Like why him? She didn't communicate w/ other people's families who'd seen the tape?And was the girl just evil? Cause they weren't supposed to help her and stuff? Why was she like this?? And what's w/ the fly that comes off the screen and makes Rachel's nose bleed, seemed pointless to me.Oh please somebody explain this to me!!!!!! This movie just doesn't wrap stuff up. The only part i got was that they had to make copies to show others so Samara could be heard. BUT why did Samara want to be heard??????????? What did she want them to "hear"?????? Man, the more I think about it, the more confusing it is.</fullReview>

Perhaps a little slow in places but with strong lead performances and a terrific basic idea, watch a video tape and seven days later you die...genius! I haven't seen the Japanese original but I don't think this version would have let it down. I went to see this at the pictures on a Saturday night after a few beers so I feel I really need to see this again at home on DVD. The film contains several jump out of your seat moments, proper ones, not the pathetic attempts to shock the audience in the likes of "I still know what you did last summer", which actually shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as films as classy as this one. The sequence with the horse on the ferry was the stand out moment for me, it was superb. I highly recommend this one.</fullReview>

Pretty impressive, i must say.But anyways, i can highly recommend this film - even though it's not for people who aren't into horrormovies, or doesn't like psychological suspense.Rent it, buy it, go to the theatres, whatever - just make sure you get to see this fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was an absolute stinker. I had heard great things about it, but when I finally saw it on DVD I was massively disappointed. The problems I had with it were... that it was not scary, the story was incoherent with massive plot holes and no motives, bad acting, bad music and a sell out ending. Stay away from this botched re-make and rent the original japanese version instead (at least it had some real style &amp; atmosphere).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the scariest movie I have ever seen--EVER! My spine really started to tingle and it had shaking from fear after I finished watching. I went into The Ring thinking I would have my usual laugh fest but 5 minutes into the movie I realized I was in for a treat. Never before have I screamed in a "scary" movie, but the Ring had me screaming like a girl! But, it was all in good fun and I could easily be scared multiple times watching the Ring over again. Watch this movie it WILL scare you!P.S. The faces of the dead bodies creeped me out to DEATH! And also when I came home from the movie and turned on my TV, it was the same static screen as in the movie and I FREAKED OUT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I could go on, and on, and on, about what I liked, what I didn't, what this movie means, but it had apparently been done to death about a trillion times. Suffice to say it was atmospheric with a few plot holes. Whatever. Just one thing that p***es me off: a lot of reviews say, "I don't know why everyone says it's good/scary/original/cool/whatever, because it's not, and they're wrong". Keep in mind it's JUST AN OPINION. You have the right to disagree, but don't say that your opinions are fact and concrete. Say, "I didn't like it", not, "It wasn't scary, I don't get it", because it makes you look stupid, anyway. There. Done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some answers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***MILD SPOILERS*** I just recently saw The Ring with a friend, and thought it was a great movie. I do agree that I was left asking some questions when the movie ended, and I was reading some of what other people wrote. I think I have a few answers so here goes! *SPOILER AHEAD* Who made the video and why? Samara made that video. She did this when the 4 teens were at the cabin (note: it was right above the well) and the girl said they were trying to tape a football game on the tv there. Instead of the game, they got the video. Samara imprinted those visions on the tape. I figured this because if you re-watch a few scenes, you keep hearing that Samara just wanted to be heard, and that's how she did it. This answers yet another question... why did Rachel decide to make copies? Making copies and showing them to others, who in turn made copies and showed them to others.. and so on, got Samara heard, it gave her attention, and that's all she wanted. But after I discoverd all of this... i got another question... the girl who died in the beginning, her friend knew about the video.... how!?!?! if the video was made the night her and her friends were trying to tape the game, how did her friend know she would die in 7 days... unless of course samara was not only communicating with Aiden, but with her friend also... SO CONFUSING! but anywho... I hope i helped some of u w/ a couple questions!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were more holes in the plot than a generic condom. The writers and the director just couldn't sell the plot to me. ...If Samara had the ability to do all these supernatural things, and she was alive for seven days in the well before she died, why in the blue blazes didn't she call somebody and say "I'm in the well. Get my butt out of here!" I mean, think about it. That's what I would have done. I'll get even later, just get my butt out of here first, dangit! Screw that mystical crap. Get my butt outta here!!! I mean, why I am I going to make a tape, with all those stupid images, and take the chance that a moron gets hold of it and can't figure it out??? She can supposedly call someone and tell them they have seven days before they die, she can make tapes, etch images into wood, film, etc. BUT she couldn't send a message out to get her sorry butt out of the well???!!! Come on...Pretty much ends the movie right there, doesn't it? ;) Then it would be more akin to watching the rescue of baby Jessica on CNN than a horror flick...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a horror flick should be like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a great fan of horror movies, I feel that the future looks promising for this genre. During the last two years, there are two movies in particular that have made an impression on me, "The Others" and "The Ring". What they have in common is the lack of excessive gore, something that otherwise seem to be the foundation of American horror. Instead, they are creepy and scary, ie they will terrify you, but they won't make you sick.The storyline of "The Ring" in short: A young reporter investigates the events surrounding a strange videotape, where a few people have died a week after watching this tape. During her investigations, she watches the videotape, and immediately after receives a phonecall by someone, telling her that she have seven days left to live. This quickens up the pace a bit, and this reporter eventually uncovers what she believes to be the truth of this cursed tape - Case closed? No, there is a twist, you see... And that's about all I'm going to tell you, watch the movie if you like to know more. ;-)In difference to some of the other reviewers that consider this to be a crappy movie, my verdict is that it is one of the greatest horror movies I've seen in recent years. A simple reason to disagree with them is this - Each and everyone with an internet connection and an e-mail address can write a review here on IMDB, regardless of experience, knowledge and judgement, and I know that writing reviews is NOT easy, if you like to communicate anything more than your own opinions and personal interpretations. Some reviewers claim that every movie they've seen is either the lowest piece of crap they ever seen, or the greatest movie to ever hit the market, with a total disregard for the fact that there is quite a span between "utter rubbish" and "finest piece of work ever done". It's hard to take that kind of shallowness seriously.Thus, I rate "The Ring" as 8? out of 10 - It's a great horror flick, but I don't think it's the best I have ever seen.Others have complained about "The Ring" as being too much of a 6th Sense-ripoff, and claims that anyone who compares this movie to "The 6th Sense" is doing the latter movie a great injustice. Well, on the contrary, in my opinion - "The 6th Sense", although a good horror flick is far from as good as "The Ring", as it relies more on blood and gore (all the ghosts you see are either decaying, covered in blood and gore or puking) than horror, in order to scare you. Unfortunately, blood and gore equals to horror to a good part of the American crowd, but I believe Europeans have a little more taste than that. Covering everything with ketchup is a very cheap trick, and it don't work on me. Otherwise, "Black Hawk Down" would be the pinnacle of the horror genre. ;-)The bottom line is this: If you like to watch a great horror flick with a creepy mood, some unexpected twists and a good deal of mystery, this is the movie for you. If blood, gore and excessive use of sound effects is what you like, I'd recommend you to watch "Pet Sematary", "Night Flier", "Terror on Elm Street" or some other splatter movie. ;-)"The Ring" is a horror movie, no more, no less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it was the fact that I waited to watch this on video, but this movie didn't impact as much as I thought it would. Normally, I like a story that doesn't explain everything, and leaves the viewer to wonder about plot lines and conventions. "The Ring", however, even after my second home viewing, seems to be reaching and grasping for its "plot twist". It is never really clarified for me why a video tape is the tool used to scare the death out of those who view it (although it makes an interesting premise for a way to spread the young girl's pain and suffering that she wanted to share with the world). The flashbacks to the tape images as Naomi Watts' character found them in her search were not as distracting as I first thought, but overall lacked clarity when things come full-circle (disturbing as they were).5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary... Kind-of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring is a fairly frightening bit of Hollywood celluloid. It definately scored quite a bit of style points. It was interesting to watch.. to see. The acting was good. The mother did a great job, but I have to admit that her son in the film was teetering dangerously close to the 6th Sense school of child manipulation. The story could have been much more scary if it didn't have you trying to follow the plotline. It left me with many questions... then watching the added features clouded things more... for those who have seen it... do you think that Mr. Morgan put the girl in the loft because he really resented her? Just before he runs some current through his bathtub with him in it, he says "she (his wife) wasn't supposed to be able to get pregnant". But in the movie, it comes out from the Dr. that they just came back with the girl, and no one knows where she came from. I'm thinking that he resented her because 'he' wasn't responsible for her creation, and it was 'him' that wasn't supposed to provide the juice to bear children. Leading me to believe that the wife cheated... thus explaining how much Mr. Morgan hated and resented the child. This is the main stumbling block for me. Otherwise I enjoyed being scared. Some of the scenes were exceptionally well done. It left me with a lot of questions... I reccommend the film to anyone who likes a little scare. Plus, the film has a nice visual style, which adds to its value. Thanks for listening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a bad version, a bit heavy on the special effects. The effects aren't needed if the story is told right. Most viewers are intelligent...we want the mess with your head scary stuff, not the someone/thing jumps out and says "boo" scary. It was well acted and the gray/blue color of the film really gave it a gritty depressed feeling. Not horrid, but not as good as the original.SPOILER: Rachel should not have been knocked into the well! If the curse was lifted from her (by having her x watch a copy of the tape) then the TV wouldn't have come after her at all. I suppose they just had to add in some more "boo" scary stuff. In the original the "Rachel" character willingly goes into the well to find Sadako's (Samara's) body.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this film and thought that it was fairly poor. A good horror film should make you feel that it can happen to you - the classic being The Sixth Sense, where you go round for days expecting cupboards to be open when you go in to the kitchen. At one point, you think that you're going to be affected to because you've watched the film that killed the kids, but then when you see how they died, its easy to dismiss.Having said that, it did manage to keep the tension for pretty much the whole of film. Not scary tenstion, but kept you into it, especially if you watched it with a jumpy girl as I did.I thought that the twist at the end of the film was good, especially considering that I had guessed most of the course of the plot within about 5 minutes.I would recommend that this is a hire film, not one to buy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad for a horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary movies have had something of a renaissance over the past few years. After the devil-baby prime time of the early 1970s, the genre fell into horrible self-parody, high school squeal reflex actions, sex-and-death associations for post-pubescents, the franchising of countless sequels, and quick pocket change for many a B movie queen.But just when the self-parody-parody set in (e.g. "Scary Movie"), so came a few experiments that worked: The Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project, etc. The Ring, owing to its Japanese origins free from the American massacre of the American massacre film, qualifies among them. While it falls short on a lot of levels, many criticisms stem from my improved expectations from scary movies of late.To its credit, the movie delivers the scares. There's enough to keep your interest throughout the film, and for the most part the movie rides the right side of the scary-silly line. There's a lot of good and convincing acting. There's a good plot with the right amount of the unexplained to keep you guessing -- a nice change from most American movies where subtlety comes with a sledgehammer.But therein also lies some of its flaws. In the end there are clearly too many questions and inconsistencies left behind. For every question that might be best left unanswered for effect (***spoiler*** : for example, how was Samara conceived, and what made her evil), there were multiple inconsistencies in the plotlines that left the movie feeling incomplete. Other areas were spelled out that either detracted from the plot or added nothing (***spoiler***: Did you really have to show Samara crawling out the the TV? ***non-spoiler***: And what did it add that Aidan turned out to be the son of Rachel and Noah in some kind of Darth Vader-lite plotline?).As for plotline, to its credit, many parts worked. However, some did not. There were a few scenes where I had a far greater urge to laugh (and did) at a ridiculous situation than be frightened by it. And while unravelling the mystery makes for a good story, the 40,000-ft view of this movie is little more than a fatalistic episode of Scooby Doo.Sorry, but contrary to some opinions here, the child actor (David Dorfman) who played Aidan was stiff, annoying, and wholly unconvincing. It made me realize how much of a joke "Sixth Sense" could have been without Mr. Osment. By the end I was hoping for some kind of mythical man-month math, wanting Aidan to watch 7 copies of the tape so they could eliminate his character in a single day. But the performances by Naomi Watts and particularly Brian Cox are solid.Some scenes interestingly struck me as something lifted completely out of Japanese comic books or anime -- like the scene where Noah is first walking up to Rachel's apartment in the rain in his hooded coat, his wet hair flying about.The fact that I wrote this much about it says something. Despite all its flaws, it's a good movie (7/10). But the gaping holes and questions at the end are too much to call it a classic by any means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating but good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Possible spoilers* What can one truly say about the Ring? On the one hand it was frustrating. The relationship between the Samara, Aiden and Rachel is not explained well. Why did Samara choose to speak to Aiden? Why was it important for Rachel to pull the remains of Aiden from the well? Why does Noah get whacked? After all, he helped solve the mystery. I would think he would be on the inner track with Samara. And why does Rachel make copies of the tape for distribution? There is no indication that she is compelled to do this. The whole thing is not explained well enough in my view. I understand that we want to leave some of this to our own interpretations but there is always the possibility that by leaving too much we become frustrated. This film comes very close to that line.On the other hand it was disturbing. I have to admit that as I went to bed after watching it I had a far-fetched tiny little fear that my TV set might suddenly pop on. If it had, I guarantee that I would they probably would have found me in the morning with that same twisted look of fear on my face as the people in the film. It was disturbing enough for me that it was just a little bit harder to feel completely comfortable in the dark. The whole sequence where Samara comes out of the well and walks towards the `camera' is totally creepy by any interpretation. If the goal was to leave images in the mind that continue to creep you out for days after you saw the film, then the filmmakers succeeded in that respect. I think for that reason you can forget about the frustration and have a good time with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling to the bone. You won't see this twice !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of horror films, I continually keep an open mind and interest in modern horror films. At the age of 21, perhaps I should grow up? I found this film absolutely chilling, at times I had shivers down my spine and all my hairs were on end. The scene at the start is fantastic, you have no idea what to expect as the girl walks up the stairs, and opens the door. I found the most brutal image the picture of the girl in the closet at the start. This film is seriously scary, do not see it if you are easily scared. The audience all breathed a sigh of relief when the credits rolled at the end, it is that gripping. I found the storyline somewhat ambigious, the scenes are sometimes very David Lynch style, but the ending is left to your own interpretation. Read the user comments here for possible answers to your questions. The filming is excellent, close ups and meeky colours add to the atmosphere. I was reminded of the final scene in 'The Blair Witch Project,' some of the scenes stay in your head for days, with the words, 'She never sleeps ...' I also found the ending unexpected, I thought it was over, and it continued again! Overall, excellent for a scare, if you don't scare at this then I'm not sure you will ever, (do you understand?) and this one will leave you at first frightened, but later you will want to find out the answers to your questions.8/10. Certainly worth a watch. '7 days ...'</fullReview>

I was expecting a teen slasher movie. However, I was quickly hooked by its stylish imagery and interesting characters. Some of the scenes were very David Lynch. I like a story where the characters behave (more or less) believably in unbelievable circumstances, and I think they did a pretty good job in that regard. The pacing of the movie is very good. I never felt the story was dragging or jumping to far ahead. Extras were minimal on the DVD. I would have like a directors commentary, or "making of" segment.

		<fullReview>The Ring was a great movie, don't get me wrong, but I was really disappointed because of all the hype surrounding this movie in its debut. The guy in the seat beside me seemed to actually be scared by the first few minutes of the movie. My problem became the obvious scenarios and ploys to scare. The "scary" parts, for the majority of the movie, were completely predictable and disappointing. There were a select few that made me jump a little, but nothing like I expected.Also, the love story in the movie gave me a sour taste in my mouth. It seemed as though they had just thrown that in for effect. Unfortunately, it did not achieve the effect they were hoping. They could have minimized this part of the movie.Also, the Samara character didn't make a lot of sense in her actions throughout the movie. We all understood her evil nature; what we did not understand were the ways in which she killed (like coming out of the TV...)The movie was overall quite interesting, but I cannot give this movie the standing ovation it seemed to receieve everywhere else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not the most scary film since the Exorcist, the Blair Witch or the Sixth Sense, it's the most scary film ever. It's a remake of the Japanese film Ringu, which is apparently based on a novel(?), but I don't think the novel can have been as frightening. What does it is the suggestiveness of the images, the unimaginable terror that, it is hinted, lies behind the surface. Obviously the strange phenomena are not explained: what with the horses, the tree, the amulets, what sort of hellish method was used to conceive that child? What do the victims see in the last moment before they die (the short glimpses of their faces was possibly the most frightening thing in the entire movie)? If you have an vivid imagination, the images and thoughts that will come to mind for days after watching the movie will be at least as scary as the actual thing. (When the girl crawled out of the tv and took on corporeal form, the whole thing became more tangible, and then, in my opinion, less scary.)</fullReview>

Its a good thing.Why, you might ask?Well, the plot tends to revolve around these images. The images come from a VHS tape that one youngster described as someone's nightmare. Perhaps. Strange nightmare. But then again, nightmares are supposed to be strange.Was the movie scary?I found it rather disturbing in a very strange sort of way. My 14 year old son and my wife did not. I found it just disturbing enough to watch it again. All in all, I really don't know weather I would recommend this movie or not. There are some plot holes, the pacing is off, the writing is not bad. I did like the lighting and the direction. Approach it with an open mind. You'll need it to soak up the images.I gave it a good solid 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tightened script, extraordinary use of visual story telling methods, and well cast actors make this version of The Ring a feast for horror fans. All the gimics of the genre are incorporated, while the suspence of the Japanese original remains intact. Many of the original sequences are reborn and enhanced, and along with this rehashed script, are not dumbed down in anticipation of Hollywood audience prerequisites. The idea of Sadako/Samara is fantastic. Perhaps the main difference in feeling from the original lies with our perception of her: In the original one understands Sadako to be non-human, supernatural, and a product of some ancient sea torment. The Ring (2002) however, portrays Samara as a fundementally evil entity out for revenge. All in all this was an excellent film, a tribute to the first, which adds its own original concepts and visual artistry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the creepiest films ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the creepiest films I have ever seen! Verbinski manages to set the perfect mood for this movie. From disturbing imagery (especially that tape!), to the inspired choice of Seattle, Washington as the location (it gave the movie a murky grayish quality).This is a movie you need to pay attention to though, otherwise you will miss many of the answers to questions asked. Even those questions don't always get completely answered, I suppose that makes for good sequel material. Casting was quite good, especially the kid, Aidan. Reminding me a bit of Rory Culkin, he had that bug-eyed look that let you know that something is just not quite right!Overall, if you're looking for something to really creep you out, and you don't mind some loose ends, the Ring is a good choice.7/10P.S.: I found an easter egg on the DVD. On the main menu, keep pressing the up button until the red arrow indicator disappears, then press play. This egg uses surround sound systems to full effect, especailly at the end!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the American version. I recommend that you see the Japanese version first. The story line in some ways explains much better why and how she survived and her ex-boyfriend did not. The American version hands down is more frightening! There are probably 2 scenes that scare the crap out of me! I've scene every horror movie out there...I was caught off guard with this one. THAT'S WHAT MAKE THIS MOVIE GO! YOU'RE CAUGHT OF GAURD 2 TIMES! You have to take my word for it. I'm usually not scared of anything. After seeing this, MAN!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of only three great horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always love to see a good horror movie. Almost always I am disappointed. There are very few movies in the genre that I really like and think `A-Ha, that's a good scary movie'. Some of what qualifies usually under this genre I don't think as `horror/scary ` movie (like the six sense and psycho). I hate slasher movies. I loved `the others' but as a good `ghost story' that is lightweight. There are only 3 memorable scary movies for me: The Exorcist (of course, #1), `Angel Heart' (underrated, not many people saw it even though it had Robert DeNiro and Micky Rourck) and now `The Ring'. Here is finally a movie that is creepy enough, close enough to home, and has one original new scary though and scene thay you will remember forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary but better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' was sold out so I grudgingly went to see this. Usually I hate supernatural horror but I enjoyed the original Japanese version of 'The Ring'. Despite its inherently implausable premise (a haunted video tape) the Japanese movie had enough atmosphere and interesting scenes and characters to make it a worthwhile piece of film.Surprisingly, the American remake is not a total disaster. Of course, it has been Hollywood-ized greatly and, needless to say, it doesn't improve on the original, but it is not without merit.There is some interesting imagery and some chilling moments (though most of the scares come from unexpected loud noises). Funnily enough, I could detect an influence from the trashy horror movie 'Final Destination' -particularly the water motif and a sequence towards the end.The writer and director have tried to explain the story of Samara more than the original did. This works in some respects but really could have been developed further (and the CGI used near the end was not necessary).The worst change is the new version of the video tape which is crap. Not scary at all -it looks too professional and well made. Also, the soundtrack throughout the film is too overpowering -a bit of subtlety would have been nice.Naomi Watts has had some bad press for her acting in this film but I thought she was fine. The actor who annoyed me most was the one playing the little boy -he just did a poor impression of Haley Joel Osment in the 'Sixth Sense'.The more you think about the film, the more stupid it seems, but whilst you're actually watching it, it is an effective and quietly disturbing movie. Still, see the original!5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a big fan of the original trilogy( and it is a trilogy regardless of what some people say(colin)) i watched the re-make with a certain degree of caution. On the whole it was pretty successful. It was well acted and directed with a few good jumps but the film does have its faults. In my opinion it had a tendancy to rely on the jump shock with a loud noise rather than just let us get involved in the atmosphere. The horse sub-plot was a disaster and pointless. The child was just a left over from the sixth sense and not just a normal child as he was in the original. It also tried to answer too many questions. What is it with american films? Why do they have to try to explain everything? I don't need to be told all the answers. It's nice to be able to think for yourself. Maybe thats part of being a european film goer and not an american. We don't all want to go home with a smile on our faces.As i said earlier tho', it's not a bad film and could have been a lot worse.One final comment though. For all the people who have written into the thread at the bottom - JUST WATCH THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY AND ALL YOUR QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED. DON'T BE PUT OFF BECAUSE IT'S GOT SUBTITLES.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but not as great as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm just here to comment. I swear, anyone who calls this the scariest movie ever has not watched the original Japanese production of "Ring"(also credited as Ringu).They actually did quite a good job in adapting this Japanese original into an American-setting remake, and they improved the effect with lighting and special effects like only Hollywood can do.However, it doesn't beat the Japanese one, which concentrates more on explaining the story then the occasional Hollywood- movie scare(that we see so often), which they save for the ends parts, but still scare you more that "the Ring"'s and leaves an after-scare when you finally realize how spooky the movie really is. Okay, I believe that this movie did explain the story, but was kind of rushing it a bit, since I believe they're not going to have a sequel, whilst "Ring" could afford to take it slow, since it was a trilogy, not to mention, it had a prequel.Still, like the original(but doesn't have as much effect), after watching this, you're not going to be scared only in the cinema. This is such an applicable and practical movie, very effective since most everybody has a TV set these days. You won't be sitting too close to your TV for a long time. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary, but stupid and humorless too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Ring' is a horror movie as slick and stylish as a music video--and as pretentious. Sure the imagery is beautiful, but the approach is so self-important--and, more significantly, so humorless--that you feel like you're watching a Calvin Klein ad much of the time. To be fair, `The Ring' can be terribly scary, especially for a movie rated PG-13. The movie does have the quality of a genuine nightmare, even if the techniques used to achieve that effect are overly self-conscious and obvious. And, with the exception of the first scene, it resists the temptation to be yet another ripoff of `Scream.'Unfortunately, it's a ripoff of just about every other horror movie ever made, though I'm sure Gore Verbinski would prefer to think of it as an `homage.' Tomato/tomahto; call it what you will, but there are direct visual quotations from at least ten and probably more like fifteen or twenty classic horror films. As a scary movie buff, I found it distracting and annoying: `Oh, that's from ?When a Stranger Calls,' and `Oh, that's from ?The Omen,' and `Oh, that's from ?The Shining,' and `Oh, that's from ?The Changeling.' Verbinksi obviously studied the genre meticulously before making this movie; it's just too bad he couldn't come up with some original ideas instead of recycling other people's into a relentless shock-movie mlange. At times I felt like I was watching a new version of `Terror in the Aisles.'It doesn't help that the story is preposterous. I won't give away any spoilers here, but I will say that every plot development is head-bangingly dumb, and it gets boring after a while. Now I realize we're talking about a horror movie here, and so a little suspension of disbelief comes with the territory. And maybe if the movie could laugh at itself a little bit, I'd be inclined to forgive its faults. But it has all the dull gravity of the most excruciating art-house `masterpiece' you ever saw, and that doesn't help it one bit.Performances are OK; the only real standout is David Dorfman as the kid; he kind of looks like one of the orphans from `The Cider House Rules' would after spending a year at the bottom of a lake. Gratuitous underwear scene aside, Naomi Watts doesn't show much of the promise she did in `Mulholland Drive,' and Brian Cox and Jane Alexander are pretty much wasted.But the point of a horror movie is to be scary, and, like I said, the movie does that pretty well in places. If you can stomach its stupidities and other problems, you'll probably be entertained. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blank Videotapes Are Spooky...There's A New One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was younger, the spookiest thing that had ever come on a blank videotape was a loud, sustained beep that came on the head cleaner that was used to clean my VCR. After watching "The Ring", now I realize that this movie is video tapes what "Psycho" is taking a shower. Here are my reasons (some spoilers revealed): (1) Naomi Watts is a very capable actress and she has cemented herself as a suspense queen ("Mulholland Drive" is also recommended). (2) Very solid plotting and very solid writing. Ehren Kruger is a superior screenwriter and this is the best effort since "Scream 3". (3) Brian Cox is one of the best character actors out there currently and he stuns here as well. (4) David Dorfman had the best performance in the film. He reminded me a lot of Haley Joel Osment in "The Sixth Sense". (5) Since when can Gore Verbinski direct a suspense film so well? I was very surprised to learn that he also directed "Mouse Hunt". (6) The mystery of the tape's origin kept me glued to the screen because it was strangely complex. (7) I was still asking questions at the end of it. (8) I found the film to be an odd mix of "8MM" and "The Mothman Prophecies". (9) The American version has inspired to check out "Ringu". (10) Watching "The Ring" late at night makes you want to keep the light on as you fall asleep. Ten reasons give a score of ten. "The Ring" is definitely a great film if you want a good fright or if you want to waste time.PS: As I watched this movie, I especially paid attention to Naomi Watts. The way she acted made me wonder if I was watching Nicole Kidman at one point and then Laura Linney the next. She was a great choice for the film and I hope she chooses more roles to showcase her unique style of acting. Here ends my rant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>horror not totally fun or great but compellingly disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film. I was quite impressed until thinking about how some of the elements of the film didn't add up. Why was Naomi Watts a bottle blond? Why were the "scary" people dark-haired with everyone else in between? It seemed contrived, with badly bleached and dyed hair. That was really ugly, black hair I was seeing. I have hair that color, and it's not that ugly. That bothered me. The worst thing that bothered me was the beginning of the movie. The teenagers had banal dialogue. It seemed like it would be one silly thrill after another. The beginning of the movie seemed like it belonged on a home video. It began in a rather awkward way. I'm used to being lured into a movie, just a little.The hair color was pretty annoying. And the young boy under Naomi Watts charge most of the time was spooky. The kid was innocent and good, yet scary? I don't get it. But I definitely did not want some sensitive Haley Joel Osmet. So, overall, I didn't get what I wanted, no matter if the kid was different.Then there was the video. Watts' character is disturbed, but not her video geek friend? Not convincing that the video is horribly seductively scary. And the whole thing about the drawings. Too Sixth Sense. And the teacher's comment about the cousin being dead a week ago and not three days ago. What was the point of that?Here is what I did like. I was quite disturbed the whole film. I kept getting jerked around to believe different things, the way the characters would. And my eyes were big as saucers by the end of the movie as if I had watched the disturbing video and was about to die myself. I didn't scream once, but can say I had a deep soul horror, the kind that says, oh my, I hope not, really. The black and white dull cinematography was great. The unexplained yet, to me, logical parts of the plot I loved. To me, when it worked, the unexplained was the wonderfully, deeply understood.I loved how the movie commented on how things spread in a community by the use of curiosity and mystery. There was no cover or label for the bad video.I enjoyed the image of the tree. I was not disturbed by the mirrors. The well was very Old World looking, therefore quite cursed looking, as if Britain, land of the legend and the paranormal was about to invade the U.S.I found the movie flawed, yet compelling to watch. It was not what you call seamless, but jerky for mystery, thrills, and some disturbing thoughts that are keeping the lights on tonight.My rating: 3/5 (for overall disturbing effect on me)SPOILER AHEAD: DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIEI hated the end. We were supposed to draw conclusions from the dialogue between Watts' character and little scary boy? I had no idea what they meant. Did they go evil? What would they do with the copy of the tape? What about the showing of the dark-haired girl going up the lift after Watts' character sees her friend is horrifically and unexpectedly dead? Did that mean knowledge? Did blond mean no knowledge or innocence and dark hair mean knowledge? That didn't even hold up the whole film. And I didn't like the video girl stepping out of the screen. Please kill me and get it over with, like the poor characters in the movie. That is so contrived, so bottle-blond. And how do I believe that the scary little boy would aid his mother in learning about the poor poor dead girl when he knew she was evil all along if he was actually good though weird? Mind tricks? Come on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 115 minutes long gutwrencher has changed my idea of how a movie can affect me. I've never felt so much that I not wanted to see some things again - for example the scene after the mother of the dead daugther says "Rachel, I saw her face".With cold, gothic-like, strong pictures of nature and weird scenarios this movie relies on mystery and psychology to make you shiver.It's simply genuinely and impressively horrifying. All scary movies and thrillers together honestly won't beat this movie in intenseness of experience. It has forever changed my views of how scared a movie can make me. Believe me, the movie isn't just 115 minutes. It's still on show in my head two days after I saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see that some people have been really hard on this film because there was apparently a lot of hype about it. Well, I rented it on DVD expecting it to be an average post-Scream horror movie that would be entertaining in a mindless sort of way. Not having a clue that it was a remake probably helped. Anyway, I was completely wrong. Say what you want about the story or the plot or whatever, but this movie could make it on visuals alone, in my opinion. Whoever put this together seems to have a very good understanding of what sort of images will cause a knot to rise up in your chest and hot chills to run down your spine, and in that respect, The Ring works beautifully. I'm still getting chills and I watched it over an hour ago. It's likely to stay with me for days. I'm not someone who scares easily, and I've experienced a lot of horror movies, including Italian greats like Suspiria. Few films have affected me the way this one has. The Exorcist is really the only one I can think of right now. I think a lot of people try to intellectualize horror films way too much. The main reason horror films are made is to play on that instinctual, gut-level reaction we have to the abnormal and the unnatural. For the most part, true horror doesn't really try to stimulate your intellect. It's goal is to reduce you to a quivering puddle of human jelly who's scared to get up and go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. If the movie succeeds at that, then you can always use your imagination to fill in whatever gaps you notice when your heart calms down and you're able to think rationally. That's how I like to look at it, anyway. I don't WANT to have a film about the supernatural explain every little detail to me. It takes all the fun out of it. Kills the mystery. Anyway, if you're here, at this point you know what the movie is about, so I won't describe the plot here. I'll just list some of the things that scared me the most. POSSIBLE SPOILERS - SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET! The image that is most haunting to me right now is the little girl's hair moving up out of the well, seemingly of it's own will, before she climbs out. It's almost as gut-wrenching as the famous head-spinning scene in The Exorcist. Just completely unnatural. Something inside you just screams, "That's not supposed to be happening, make it stop!" I am trying not to freak out right now as I'm remembering it. I don't think I'll be getting much sleep tonight. The girl's slow lurching towards the television screen as you're hoping the guy will have the good sense to grab a chair and smash the screen before she gets there. The final glimpse at the girl's water-logged, bloated face after she comes out of the screen. The distorted and collapsed faces of her victims is also terribly disturbing. The video of her in the hospital, just sitting silently with her hair obscuring her face, or pacing her cell, never sleeping. Her lonely little loft in the barn. The look on the little boy's face when he asks his mother why she helped the girl get out of the dark place after you thought it was all going to end happily is also quite a blow. The blurred faces of future victims in photographs is effectively creepy. This stuff alone is worth the price of the DVD. The entire movie is just that, creepy. The beautiful scenery of the gloomy countryside, the stark black and white video and the flashbacks as the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, the music...it all just gives you a tense, uneasy feeling as you wait for the next haunting image to pop out at you, one that may be so frightening that you can't bear to watch anymore. And that always makes a more intriguing horror film, to me at least, than those films that try to make you jump with loud noises and false scares, and if that doesn't work, outright gross-out. This movie does have a few moments that make you go "What are they thinking?", but that's to be expected. All-in-all, I think this film is a work of art in it's own right, and I recommend it to everyone. It is definitely one of the best horror films to come out of Hollywood in a while. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie scared me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very scary movie. Of course it wasn't as scary as The Exorcist (which I have not seen, and probably never will) or Nightmare on Elm Street but "The Ring" kept me hiding behind my pillow. I watched this with my parents and they were even frightened! The lighting and the rain just made it even more creepy. The way the people's faces looked after they had viewed the tape was very disturbing. I liked the storyline. A videotape that kills you? That's not something you see in a lot of movies. And why are little kids so creepy in these kinds of movies? That little boy was freaking me out. I think one of the scariest parts in this movie was when the girl came out of the screen when Noah was watching the tape. I thought this movie dragged on a little bit too long and the ending just left me hanging but all in all I thought it was a great scary movie. It disturbed me and frightened the wits out of me. I would recommend this one to anyone who likes scary movies without all the blood and gore. "The Ring" was a good scary movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS.Good premise but the film is unrefined. Here is how to fix it:1.) The opening scene is awkward. The girl had expectations of being wacked (her &amp; day anniversary was coming up) and she's acting silly. And if all these kids who watched the video are aware of what's going to happen (or have suspicions) why are they all seperated. A scene with them all together as time runs out, where some believe and some don't would have been much better.2.) Don't make the first victim the cousin of the main character. Since she is a journalist the oddity of the kids' deaths (as well as the rumors) her looking into it would have been justified. Maybe later on have a close relative of her's get killed.3.) Their should have been more victims that she ran across in her investigation to build up tension.4.) The relationship between her son and the girl was okay but it needed to be fully explained. As it is it's weak. The kid could be presented as the strange young lad that he is with an imaginary friend. Then as the plot thickens we find out who the friend really is. Need some reason for the boy to be picked though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very well done movie, though I disagree that it was the "scariest movie ever made." in fact, I would say that it really wasn't scary, rather it was tense and disturbing; while there are horror genre movies out there that are extremely morbid, and huge fans of those movies would probably finds this film rather pale in comparison. This movie is much closer to being a dramatic thriller rather than being a horror flick. For what it is, it's very well composed; though you'll find a more frightening movie in classics like "Silence of the Lambs," or "Jaws."For being the scariest movie ever made, I think that's a tough title to earn. This certainly didn't out do "The Exorcist" or the original "Haunting."All in all, it was definately worth seeing, but don't expect to be scared out of your wits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying, I'm not one to be unnerved by scary movies. I don't believe in the supernatural. The usual horror fare (Scream, Halloween, etc) doesn't phase me in the least.This is hands down the most scary movie I've ever seen. I watched this movie alone in a hotel room and I did not have a very good night.It's not a hack-em-up, gross-things-jump-out-at-you sort of movie. It builds a sense of fear from the start and keeps building it right to the last scene. This movie scares you in the way the original Shining or Blair Witch did.I'm not a self proclaimed movie critic and won't go into a long dissertation on the sound, lighting and camera angles used to make this film so scary. I'll just leave it at this:This movie really disturbed me. If you like to be scared out of your wits and made to feel uneasy for days by a movie, its a must see. If you don't like scary movies, its DEFINITELY not for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie must be the BEST scary movie I've ever seen!(and trust me I've seen a lot!)The scariest part was the closet scene. I screamed in the pillow I was holding! I definatly recomend this to anyone who loved The Sixth Sence! It starts off with a scary beginning and a fabulous ending! It has what makes a scary movie exciting! Chills,thrills,suspence,and a little comedy maybe. My rating 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>**1/2 out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you all sit there, scratching your head in wonder over who made the video and who was on the other end of that dreaded phone call, I sit here in all my slumber, merely a day after viewing this film and wonder how such a beautiful looking piece of cinematography could be so bad. This film tenders on the brink or ridiculous and seems content on explaining to us what is going on while never giving us anything to even remotely attempt to fathom what has just happened on the screen before us. Mulholland Drive bombshell Naomi Watts stars as Rachel Keller. She is a single parent who lives in a high rise apartment and works as a journalist. When her niece faces sudden death (seen in the films prologue) Rachel fins herself out to investigate a mysterious video tape that, when watched will kill you in seven days. Rachel stumbles upon this video and after watching it runs around in a frantic panic to find out what is going on before her seven days are up. Yet after being viewed by her son and his father she is still running around in a stupor and we still have no clue what is going on. This film has some sort of hypnotic grip surrounding it that will either hold you until the very end or release you very early on, if you haven't guessed it released me. The film runs just a minute short of an hour, a time that makes it so tedious you will end up wondering when this thing will finally end more than what the heck is going on. The film was beautifully directed by Gore Verbinski who adds a certain aura of demented beauty into the repulsive images that plague the screen and rob the film of any real scares. The mixing of bright colours set upon the tone of a grey backdrop makes for a haunting images and probably the films only artful image (I am talking about a lone tree that stands atop a dying plain that slips from grey to bright red was the sun slowly glazes over it). The best part of the film by far is the video itself. Verbanski was reading heavily from the book of Lynch while he was dreaming up this video that sees pools of blood, swarms of maggots, a mirror that shifts positions, a musty old well and a women falling off the edge of a cliff. In fact Lynch's stylized weirdness pops up often in this film. In Lost Highway (Lynch's most abstract work), nothing makes sense in its pure irony. Weird things happen by never without reason or cause. Here weird things happen for the sake of having weird things happen. We see unexplained flashbacks; irrational explanations and pure amazement at how much more illogical on film can stretch itself to be. The film starts off creepy in theory, things happen that are not explained or are cause for explanation, wasn't that half the fun of The Sixth Sense? Then after seeing the video, Rachel goes on the hunt for the creator. She searches for a woman only to find she had committed suicide. She the gets caught up in a strange triangle involving horses going buck wild and then dying. She then meets and odd character who works at a horse ranch who refuses to discuss the video and finally begins her search for a little girl who may or may not be dead. The problem is that none of it interconnects for form and sort of opinion of explanation into the motivation behind neither the video nor the killings. *If you have not seen this this, this is the time to stop reading* This film left me with so many questions to situations that can't possibly have simple answers that I have to wonder why such a film would even want to evoke such questions. First who made the tape and what is its purpose? What relevance did the tape have to the dead horse rancher and the little girl? If the ring itself is the light the reflects through the opening around the stone barrier that sits on top of the well how can any light get in when the stone goes to the very edge on both sides of the well? What did mass horse genocide have to do with anything in this story? Finally if the little girl didn't want to be helped then why was Rachel led to help her? The ending of the film closes in an abrupt halt that again pays homage to Lynch but doesn't execute the technique right. Lynch can end his films like that because his stories have no beginning or ending. We open in the middle of someone's life and we close in the middle of someone's life. This film clearly established a beginning during the opening, possessed no real common ground that you could call a middle and exits without an ending. This film also never wanted to end; it had so many false endings that you almost need a spreadsheet to keep track of them. Instead of clearing up any unwanted confusion the film tries to prove itself to us by throwing in loads of new facts that only make the proceedings make even less sense. When you start your career at the very top of the heap where is there to go? That is a problem that Naomi Watts faces in this film. She is a great actress but with all the glory and pure emotion awe that was presented in Mulholland Drive it is usually not smart to follow up with a film that is of the same style but of a lesser grade. Although knowing not what this film was about I will still give you my honest thoughts on what I felt was presented. We are all reflections of what we see on television. The TV is a tool used to create false awareness and manipulate our minds into seeing ourselves in different light. I believe that Rachel was a reflection of the little girl. You will notice that almost every time we see the water we also see Rachel's reflection in it. Yet that is a contradicted thought because it is my belief that this is nothing more than an attempt to shock mainstream audience with a style only made popular in cult fashion. In all of my honest glory I must say that this film did nothing for me. It never once scared or intrigued me. I felt no emotion for these characters as they themselves had none, I really must stress that weirdness is not a good substitute for characterization and ever more so, logic. If it were up to me the cover of this film would not say `the scariest film since The Sixth Sense.' It would say `the biggest disappointment since Unbreakable.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack the Ripper: First of all before you go bashing japanese movies, remember, the ring is an american movie based on a japanese movie. Yes, the plot is the same, but it is the style that is lacking, and you probably forgot to take you ridalin before you watched it. FearDotCom was not ripped off, in fact it probably draws more from the original Ringu. and if you are disappointed with this movie and still give it 4/5 stars, you are sheep. I liked the pace of the japanese version way better, it didnt have as much of the crap to satisfy the type of viewer that needs everything spelled out for them, and prefers Ponderosa or Old Country Buffet over a distinctive restaurant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh My God.I went to the theater having read and heard a lot about this movie, so my expectations were pretty high.I really almost s*** my pants. I haven't been this scared during a movie since The Others. The only difference is: The Others stops being scared when the movie's over. The Ring haunted me for at least a week. Because seven days later I actually got scared again, thinking: "Crap, at what time did I see the movie? How long do I have?" Luckily I survived.Go and see this. Be sure to pick a date and time when the chance of being in a theater full of highschool kids is minimal. It will ruin a lot if you're a person like my who likes to "expirience" a movie. Children tend to resort to laughter when emotions get too big to handle.I can't say very much about the Japanese original(s), but I've heard they are even scarier, so I don't know if I'll be able to sit them through...One definite advantage the Hollywood version has though is Naomi Watts, Mulholland Drive fans, eat your heart out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Go figure, another Asian moive ruined by remake. I saw the the original Ringu and it was very well done. Original Ringu was one of the movie that stayed on your mind over a week. And even after couple day, you could still feel the impact of the movie. The Ring, remake was different. I was willing to even accept to quirky plot about the horse but what the complete let down was the ENDING!!! Ringu didn't have to reply on much SFX or jumping right in front of you scare tactics to get you scared. Whole atomosphere was what made the movie. For the most part, The Ring (2002) was okay, maybe even on the par with the original except the ending. Especially when the Samara come out the tv. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?????? Remake is a complete let down....Go figure...once again... Since American producers can't come up any decent plot, they have to reply on import movie and add some lame sfx and make some quick bucks. I think I'll just watch the original Ringu. If you seen Ringu, don't bother with The Ring. LAME!LAME!LAME!!Ringu 8/10 star The Ring (2002) 2/10 stars</fullReview>

The protagonist is both haunted and driven by the girl to uncover the truth and 'set her free'. In the Ring, the hotel floor is torn up to reveal the well and the dead and decayed girl; In Stir of Echoes, the wall in the basement is torn away to reveal the dead and decayed girl. Also, in the girls in both films both lose a tooth. I'm sure there are others I haven't mentioned as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good film, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm tempted to be as harsh as possible, on principle. This film cost $US45 million to make. The cost of striking, say, 3,000 subtitled prints of the original Japanese "Ringu", which had already been made and paid for, would have been, effectively, nothing, since distribution costs aren't included in that $45 million figure anyway. It would have made as much sense to have paid $45 million in salaries to the hundreds of people who served on the cast and crew making them shuffle around in aimless circles for three months.I'm not saying this because "The Ring" happens to be a remake. There's nothing wrong with that. I don't think Francis Ford Coppola should have been deterred from making his 1992 "Dracula" by the existence of John Badham's 1979 "Dracula". Clearly, Coppola felt that he had his own approach to the material, and he was right. It was, admittedly, a stupid approach, and he bungled it even so, but you can't blame a man for trying. The 1979 "Dracula" was itself an nth-generation remake, and IT was an effectively different movie from ITS predecessors ... and in at least some cases, a better one.But a mere four years separate the Nakata's "Ringu" from Verbinski's "The Ring" (less, if you count from when the original was released to when the remake commenced pre-production), which is hardly likely to be enough time to come up with a distinct viewpoint - and Verbinski seems to have one out of his way to avoid doing this. Even the locations seem to have been chosen so as to duplicate the original Japanese locations as precisely as possible; they've also been shot in almost exactly the same manner. When we get our first glimpse of Anna Morgan it came as a shock to me that she white, not Asian. What was I expecting? I don know, but I probably forgot, for the moment, which movie I was watching. (By the way, the fact that the villainess isn't Japanese is actually a problem. The thick veil of black hair that covers her face - this, too, Verbinski has slavishly copied - looks far more like the work of make-up artists trying too hard.)Since it's been slavishly and competently copied from a brilliant original, there's no denying that "The Ring" is a good movie. Everything that worked in the original also works (to some degree) here; it probably also worked in the Korean remake, and if the film's ever made in Germany, it will probably work there, too. But a director who binds his fingers in this fashion and forces them to trace the outlines of someone else's work is highly unlikely to be able to command as much power. The most extreme example of this effect is Gus Van Sant's remake of "Psycho", scene-for-scene identical to a masterpiece yet bordering on being downright bad. And when Van Sant DID have the nerve to change something and strike his own path, the result was, to put it kindly, unmotivated; to put it more accurately, breathtakingly moronic. The same happens to a lesser degree here. Nakata's "Ringu" had an admirable simplicity. Verbinski, aware that he's contributing nothing of substance, can't help gilding the lily here and there, which does only mild harm, but cetainly no good. For example, there's too much STUFF on that cursed videotape. The heroine in this version has at least a dozen different premonitions of her impending demise - nosebleeds, horses, water, dreams, scars, coughed-up wires, ladders, blurred photographs - where two or three would have been more than enough. And the added digital effects serve no purpose other than to let us know that there are digital effects.In this fashion Verbinski ruins Nakata's scariest scene.Spoilers follow... The scariest scene in the original was the one in which the villainess crawled out of the well in the videotape... and then proceeded to crawl out of the television, and across the room, as well. This took place in a small, closed, sparsely furnished apartment, in the dark, and we saw it in a single, unblinking, front-on camera shot. Verbinski sets the sene in a a more open place with plenty of windows and he keeps CUTTING: showing Samara crawling out of the television from the front, then from the side (in the kind of effects shot designed to make the trickery of the special effects people look more imressive, at the expense of everything else), then from a long shot, all the while jumping back and forth between this and action taking place elsewhere.I could forgive Verbinski these missteps on the grounds that he has, after all, made a decent, involving, atmospheric, and mildly terrifying film. But it really is the original all over again. The only difference is that it's not as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once you've read this, you will die in seven days.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as remake's go, Gore Verbinski's version of the Japanese horror film Ringu is one of the rarities that are as good as the original.Based on the same premise as it's predecessor, The Ring is about a mysterious video tape that when viewed, causes the watcher to die in seven days. Reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) catches wind of said tape after her niece dies under mysterious circumstances after reportedly viewing such a tape. She then tracks down the tape and views it for herself. Then what follows is a race against time as not just to save her own life, but the life of her son who accidentally watches it.What makes The Ring stand out is it relies on genuine scares and psychological terror to strike fear into the audience. Whereas most films use the 'it's-only-a-cat' routine, there is nothing in the movie that leaves the audience screaming at something ludicrous.In terms of acting, it is of high quality, especially from the Haley Joel Osment type sprog who has a sixth sense type of ability (that's being able to see dead people for those who haven't been initiated to the genre).Verbinski has proved himself a worthy director and the movie could stand him in good stead for future blockbuster's. It will also make you think twice about going down to the local video shop to hire out the latest titles. You never know, you may get a phone call saying you will die in seven days after watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WORTH IT FOR: The incentive it gives to go get a DVD player, just incase VHS tapes kill you.IMHO: Despite what the title would have you believe there are neither Hobbits nor hemorrhoids in sight. And it's nothing to do with Christina Angulawhatever's new clip, altho I'm pretty sure you can see the ring in that... No, this is infact the heart warming tale of a video that kills you 7 days after you've watched it. I'm not sure if watching the same thing on DVD kills you, but I suppose it does. I guess it depends how close you sit to the screen, and how violent Blockbuster get when the copy of The Little Mermaid you rented is 7 days overdue. This is another horror movie involving creepy kiddies. It seems every flick that attempts to be scarey has to involve a creepy kid in someway. That doesn't make it bad tho, it is infact pretty good. The story is nice and original (it's a remake of a Japanese version which has spawned a sequel and prequel), and the cast, led by talented Aussie Naomi Watts, is great. But is it scarey? Well I was sitting in a puddle at the end, but that may have more to do with the size of the large Coke... After being told by people who had already seen this that I'd be having nightmares afterwards I packed a change of underwear and prepared for the worst, but it didn't come. Altho there are a few sudden frights (one made the girl behind me actually scream), and while you're watching it there is an undercurrent of "What's going to happen next??" kind of scarey-ness, after it had finished I looked back and thought "Well that wasn't really all that scarey". It didn't haunt me like The Sixth Sense or Bambi did. So I guess you have to decide for yourself whether its scarey enuff or not. That said, I'm never watching a video again. Infact I came straight home and took an axe to my VCR. Then I jumped on the pieces. Then I burned my shoes. But no, this isn't scarey. Either way this is a good flick and its fun to watch. Go see it. But don't sit in seat S17 in Cinema 6 of Village Crown til they've had a steam cleaning done...IT'S A BIT LIKE: A horror movie involving creepy kiddies!SCORE: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't care too much for "The Ring". I didn't find it scary in the least and fairly comedic at times when it wasn't intended to be (its pure slapstick when the horse jumps off the boat). The plotline seems solid enough but it lacks any real depth. The videotape in question origin is never explained, nor where it came from, only a horror story involving a child (which has become fairly cliche in psychological horror movies as of late).The supposed 'twist' at the end (which was supposedly more surprising than the one in "The Sixth Sense") was bland and didn't warrant me going through and watching the movie again to appreciate the full magnitude of it, since there was no real magnitude to it whatsoever.I always liked movies that had an open-ended finale, but this was just idiotic. The question "How can we stop this tape from killing more people?" is essentially asked. My response: JUST DESTROY THE DAMN TAPE!!! The special effects were admittedly very well done, especially in the final scene, but that's hardly reason to recommend so much as a rental of this. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can be said about The Ring without bursting into fits of hysterics? Being a person who is easily scared, I was surprised when The Ring didn't frighten me at all. It's problem was that it tried to make every scene spine-tinglingly scaring, which actually gave the impression that misty looking forests and spooky hidden islands are the norm, and therefore became less frightening. The effects and the music were the best things about this film, as the acting was relatively poor and the plot became more of a predictable cliche as the film went on. If you're into horror flicks, though, you'll have a field day with this one. If not, go see it, it'll give you a laugh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me personally I found The Ring a bit creepy. But then again I let it be. I can watch any type of zombie movie that can be thrown at me. But this movie has a less then direct way of getting to you. An artistic approach to the typical what's "behind the door" style of suspense really lets this movie push people's senses. When the movie first starts you won't really know where there going but after the first 15 there is a defining moment in the movie that will keep you weirded out for the remainder of the film. But as it's been stated before, only of you let it be. I heard a few rumors about this film that `It's the next best horror / suspense film since 6th sense'. So I dimmed the lights except a candle or two and challenged the movie to get to me. With the DTS on full alert (Try it in Pro Logic II for the hard core VHS guru's out there). I was well surrounded by the unique yet eerie sounds this film had to offer. And let me tell you the sounds are the money makers with this film. The plot can easily be put on paper; the film can be easily watched. But if you let the sound put you in the movie... be prepared to be crept out... for a few nights. I watched this on DVD but I have a good feeling for those of you that watch it at home on a quiet night on VHS. You probably will get a little more out of the experience of this movie then the rest of us...//NYReload (10 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is all I have to say after watching the Ring! The plot is great. After the funeral of her niece, Rachel Keller decides to investigate what seems to be a chain of death. Upon retiving clues she watches a mystious video and learns (from a chilling phone call) that she has seven days to live. this drives her on a rampage of solving the mystery and saving her and her son's life. I didn't find the movie scary because I was a vitim of spoilers, but it was exciting enough for me to enjoy. That starts to dwindle it gets a little boring and some parts seem like the cutting crew was asleep. But other than that the movie was suspenseful and cool. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*I was expecting better from a movie hypes as the "scariest of 2002". I found The Ring to be drawn out and much too slow paced. Too much time is devoted to the investigation into the origins of video. This leads to resolution of sorts at the end, but creates too many dead end sub-plots and plot holes in the process. Overall the suspense just wasn't there. The freakiest moments of the film are delivered at the end, but by then I was left feeling cheated that at 116 minutes running time I had only seen 10 minutes that were remotely scary. The DVD edition contains an imaginative presentation of what appears to be deleted and alternate scenes from the movie. To me, it was more enjoyable than the actual movie. All in all, I found that The Ring failed to deliver on it's promises. Maybe it's just because of all the hype... 4/10* A fun little prank to play if you are watching this movie with other people: If you have a cell phone, near the end of the movie discreetly cue up the phone number of the place you are watching the movie at without removing the phone from your pocket. When the credits are rolling, call the number (again, without removing the phone from your pocket). This should elicit a bit of fear, especially in younger viewers. Heh heh heh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is well made, well acted, and has some great visuals. It was very creepy and I enjoyed watching the story unfold. I have to disagree with people who have said it relied on run of the mill scare techniques. The story was compelling. I was sure that the video was going to be some mish mash of unexplained ambiguous crap meant only to scare and disgust the audience. Instead it's like a map of clues, albeit deadly ones. They didn't come right out and mention psychic photography, but that is what I believe it was. You see that when they show the negatives from her file. In the beginning, the teenager says they put a tape in that was supposed to have been football. Instead a bunch of strange images appear. These were images from the ghost of a girl capable of psychic photography. That was compelling in and of itself. The reporter follows the visual clues which lead her to the body of the girl and you assume that once she's peacefully buried it will all be over. This is what most ghost movies end up being. I was sitting there thinking...why would she kill innocent people...when the woman's son drops the bomb about "why did you let her out of the dark place you weren't supposed to". A lot of people haven't understood why her son had to make a copy or why she lived because she did. It's simple she gave the girl a victim, her son's father. The chilling part was the question the boy posed of "What happens to the person we show the video too?" Theoretically the cycle can end by the woman being smart enough to say. Hey watch this and make a copy of it....etc etc. I was uneasy after watching it, but not terrified. It's well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Ring" overall is a very well-produced, well-directed, obviously "Americanized" version of the 1998 Japanese film "Ringu". Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is a journalist looking for answers regarding teens deaths after having apparently viewed a "killer video-tape." Rachel gets her hands on the tape, views it, and only has a week's time before her own demise to solve mysteries of "The Ring." However strange and cheesy the premise may sound, the movie is surprisingly eerie. Many of the scenes in the movie have a deeper meaning that could easily be missed. If you have seen the movie and hated it, chances are you weren't paying attention or were only watching the "surface movie," not looking for the allegorical references. Laced with strong theatrical elements as well as creepy effects, this movie is not recommended for viewers under the age of 10.Overall: A creepy movie, not a scary movie. Pay attention and be aware of details. If you want a scary movie, rent "The Exorcist," a truly scary, mindless horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was an excellent movie, and its high quality surprised me. Long before this ever came out, I was a big fan of the original Japanese version and when I heard Hollywood were doing a remake, I thought "oh no..."However the result is very good. Okay, granted, parts of it are slow and cliched. But the good qualities by far outweigh the bad.A modern horror movie with hardly any violence or gore? Yes, that is the Ring! As a result it was panned. I think it was brave of the filmmakers to make a modern horror movie without buckets of gratutious gore. They do throw in some shock moments that are very disappointing (they're there to make the movie more scary apparently but doesn't work - mere Hollywood stereotype pandering) but for the most part its psychological suspense, not physical.It was panned too for not being suspenseful enoguh. True, there are very little action sequences. This is more like reading a book than watching a movie. It is a mystery thats all about story, and if you warm to it, then it WILL be suspenseful for you.Naomi Watts (so vastly different than in her excellent performance in David Lynch's "Mullholland Drive") is a great actress; and her intelligence and grace really benefits the movie. Also check out Brian Cox's cameo. This excellent actor steals the show in his few minutes of on-screen time.Compared to the original, which just went for unexplained weird, this movie makes the attempt to explain many things... which some felt weakened it. I disagree: I think it makes the movie more complex and intriguing.On a final note: the opening scene. It starts out very cliched, like the start of a typical Hollywood slasher movie (the scene with Drew Barrymore in the beginning of "Scream" gave birth to this): two young girls, alone in a dark house on a rainy night, one of them walking around clutching a cordless phone. I think the filmmakers were not being unoriginal, but rather starting the movie this way on purpose: making you think you were about to see a typical horror/slasher, then changing course and delivering this instead -a daring, intelligent, suspenseful modern thriller. Watch it!BEFORE YOU DIE YOU SEE ... THE RING!9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD***'The Ring' is a great movie. It's a very good story (completely with deeper meanings and all), but I think that the strength comes from the visual interpretation. De shots are beautifully filmed (f.e. on the island), the sound is excellent (f.e. the scene with the horse on the ferry) and the scary moments are surprising. I really appreciated the subliminal effects (the ring is seen for a fraction of a second) as the film proceeded. It's like you (as an audience)are a victim as well: you have seen the video, and as the days go by, you see the ring flashing before your eyes a couple of times. At the end of the movie, you see the video in full speed and then... a black screen (no image, no sound...). I thought that was very clever.So even if not everything is crystal clear (there are some weird things that I didn't really get), 'The Ring' is worth seeing for its visual style!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think I'm alone in saying this was really confusing and just a jumbled mess. I mean, I didn't feel as if the scenes tied the story together. Like Brave Sir Robin said, there's lots of side plots that have no relevance. Personally, I didn't even get the ending. Yes, the girl coming through the TV - and her face - made me wince, but what I didn't get was why Rachel and Aidan survive just by watching a different copy of the tape?I mean the film overall is creepy, NOT scary. I think some have mistaken the differences. Maybe it's a possibility that I just don't get the heebie-jeebies easily. The only movie that makes me pee my pants is "The Exorcist" and this does not, by far, even compare in the slightest. Especially considering what occurred in "The Exorcist" has been reported as actually happening, whereas this is so unbelievable and fictitious.I might have enjoyed it more by not having the expectations that it was one of the most horrifying films of the past 10 years or something. I'd recommend that if you do see this, just take it in how YOU want to. Maybe you'll like it, who knows. But I personally don't plan to watch it again in the near future. AND I get the feeling this has sequel written all over it, due to the ending and the enormous success (which I'm sure the film company would love to duplicate).</fullReview>

If the viewer see the film for the first time on DVD, going to the "Don't Watch This" section of the special features may absolutely freak them out.

		<fullReview>Other than maybe 4 separate situations during the movie , i wouldn't really characterize this film as a horror but more of a thriller /mystery.Not saying that's bad being overall , i enjoyed this film.( SPOILERS AHEAD ).. The beginning 10 minutes of the film reminded me to much of the movie Scream so with that said i didnt enjoy maybe the first 10 to 12 minutes of the film on shear unoriginality IMO.Now i will credit the movie a little where other people I spoke to downplayed the movie , which is the beginning middle parts of the movie where we have Naomi Watts(Rachel) watching the videotape and having to find out the origin of the tape which i actually liked. The scenery is beautiful and the clues Naomi searches out add to the drama of the film.Again I took all of this as more of a drama than a horror being I was trying to guess the whole time instead of jumping or getting chills.There are many scenes which stand out in my head even when i am not even thinking of the movie.That alone is a reason to see this film.Rachel's son's demeanor and glare throughout the film were a welcomed presence, that definitely added to the movie.The end i felt overall was a little corny being Samarah just wanted to be heard and that is why ultimately Rachel and her son don't die , being that Rachel made a copy and showed it to her ex beau and later has her son make a copy so he also survives.In my eyes being heard doesnt mean making copies of a video tape and showing it to people when the tape had no real answers from Samarah anyway , so how is she being heard ? But i won't go any further on why i didn't like the film being the scenery and the mystery of the tape make this film a stand out .Overall id give it a 7.5 - 10 not .Some flaws but not enough to bring the movie down , go see this</fullReview>

Another point scored.I was quite impressed by the lead's acting. Even better.The only major gripe for me was the kid. I'm not talking about Samara, I mean the Kid. The boy.

		<fullReview>It seems to me that if you have seen the Japanese version of "The Ring" the new American version isn't scary at all, but as I haven't I found the movie effective in every way. The build up of tension was perfect. Not a scene went by when I was on the edge of my seat simply waiting for the next scare to come. I have no idea how I am going to manage to sit through the Japanese version when I spent half the film saying 'f**k, f**k, f**k' over again as I waited to be scared out of my head.The best performance of the films came from the youngest members of the cast. The portrayal of the haunting Samara Morgan played by Daveigh Chase was outstanding and paired with the performance of David Dorfman as Aidan Keller the two seemed to both spark in a way that is rarely seen in such young actors/actresses. Overall I found the film haunting and moving in ways that I didn't expect. Not only was it a horror story about an killer video tape, it was a story that explored the relationship between mother and child in both the case of the Keller's and the Morgan's. You should see this film simply for entertainment purposes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>gee, I've given up horror/thriller flick since the genre is becoming worse and worse. Ones that can pick it up were what lies beneath (so so), 6th sense (not scary, touching instead...oh boy), bone daddy (only 1st 20 min), house on....SPOILER unlike all those movies, the ring makes you let your guard down and then attack you with full strength. I have to admit I'm biased regarding the scare factor, death people in an abandoned well climbing out was my childhodd nightmare. I was watching the DVD with friends at 1am in a stormy night when we thought, good for Samara, her soul can finally rest in peace...when boo final scene...The movement of a body seems to lose its muscle support after rotting is just excellent. What scares me more is the fact that I can't help but smiling at every gore/deformed scenes (even making jokes that people die because they watch TV too close)...except the last one. It gives me creep for days. Blair Witch Project has "the unknown is the scariest thing" since no ghost etc has actually ever shown. Scary, but no images to linger in your head as a result. I feel bad for the actress playing Samara, she's supposedly little beautiful actress etc, but now when I see her photo, I can't help but to feel the creeps...oh well, at least she's a good actress thenDarn this movie, good thing it's TV, if it's a computer monitor that I face 24/7.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the original Ringu film, I was very happy to rent this it's first week out. Having heard from friends how it scared them so bad, and how it was a good film, I had to see it. How disappointed I was with the regular bland american studio produced crap it turned out to be. With Gore V. directing I should have known, he would sell his mama if the studio's told him to. This remake is so slow and pointless that it makes the original look so much better. All of Naomi Watts' character's findings come to her very easily. Maybe she is Columbo's daughter the way she solves this mystery.In the Ringu version the story unfolds slowly, but realisticly. The actual video that you watch and will die for, is much more scary in the Jap version. To much CGI and rip offs make for a bad time. I guess the ending is what most people talk about. I felt that the ending in the american version was forced upon us very quickly to the point where it wasn't even scary. The Ringu version has a great scary ending, that will make you stop breathing (at least for a few seconds). The biggest difference is the explanation of what's going on. The Ring confuses people because it is a bad movie, period.There are 3 Ringu movies from Japan. Ringu 2 is not that good, but decent. I think they used a few things from part 2 in the american Ring. Ringu 0, which is a prequel might even be better or at least as good as the original Ringu. Be sure to get ahold of Ringu 0, it is available on Ebay with subtitles. Ringu has been available as well, even though Dreamworks just released it on Friday, to cash in some more. Why does this movie have such a high rating? Let's get with the program people.</fullReview>

There's a couple of beautiful actresses (term used very loosely). There's one cool evil (heh) part in the movie. Now the bad: That one cool part comes exactly 5min 30sec before the credits roll. The holes in this plot are inexcusable. There's probably at LEAST a couple hundred light houses on the coastlines of America. Is mental hospital security really that easy to circumvent? There's plenty more but don't want to spoil the ridiculous plot details. Didn't someone else make this movie before and call it 'Stir of Echos'? This is like Stir of Echos and Ghost Ship with a VCR and without a ship. I didn't jump once and don't EVEN try and compare this movie to the Exorcist. DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!

It's as if the first half of the movie was written by a moderately unskilled writer who had some idea of where he was going with this lame, seen-it-all-before story, and the second half by someone with alzheimer's desease, who couldn't remember anything that he had just wrote. The scared blonde woman, the likeable guy hero character, the spooky little kid who sees dead people, it's all been seen before. The movie throws things at the bewildered viewer, all of which have no relevence and add up to nothing. A woman killed her daughter, a horse jumped off the side of a boat, a man electrocuted himself in a bathtub, a girl crawled out a TV set and killed a guy, and then the journalist and her son watched the movie on two TV sets at once and the damn thing just ends. Oh no, the tv is leaking! Oh no, I'm getting a nosebleed! The audience is left more confused at the end of the film than they were when they watched it. What was the point of making this thing?

		<fullReview>The Ring had a interesting plot concept, a video tape that gets its viewers killed. Believable? No. Scary? Yes. The film is very thrilling from the beginning to the end. It starts as a young girl realizes that she had seen it exactly a week ago. After some really scary scenes she is dead and her aunt, a reporter starts to investigate this mystery and ends up seeing the tape herself. And her ex-boyfriend and son too. So the clock is ticking for them to solve what is behind it or they'll end up dead too. The suspense keeps the viewer in its grasp all the way trough the film, but...It seems that the writer ran out of ideas how to end this and how to give a reasonable explanation for the tape's magic powers. The ending simply sucked. The suspense that the film built bursted like a bubble and makes you laugh. Might have passed as an episode of X-Files but a feature film, no. 4/10 for a good attempt and the scary parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't why so mamy folks demand that every question be answered in a suspense thriller like this one. This movie is scary enough to be fun and creepy enough to be disturbing. Being a skeptic, and not believing in anything supernatural, it is very unusual for a film like this to entertain me. But this one did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the Japanese original, but this version certainly did not live up to anything friends and fans have raved about- at least in my opinion. They say scary, I say a little gut wrenching once in a while, but certainly not incredibly scary. (one friend spoke of leaving the theater 2/3 of the way through- LO doggone L). As for the plot, it was far from perfect and had gaps.**SEMI-SPOILER**Unless hallucinations of a couple drops of blood, maggots, a centipede, and that notorious fly give you the jibbies, I fail to find what was so "scary". I guess that would unnerve some people (not me). Maybe the slow homicide death of the little girl is also unnerving, but that is more tragic than supernaturally horrific still in my opinion. Puzzling and twisting they say? Well.. As someone summed up, (not word for word) not too logical either. Why does a ghost need to use videos, phones, etc etc etc.***Maybe I'll see the original, and if there is any worthwhile contrast.Worth a watch, and not THAT bad, but certainly not some ultimate horror masterpiece its cheerleaders parade about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One ring will do, thank you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In taking on Kozi Suzuki's novel "Ringu," director Gore Verbinski has accepted a considerable challenge: how to make a seriously chilling tale and maintain a level of drama clearly superior to run-of-the-mill teen victimizing slasher films. Having previously given us "The Mexican" and the Budweiser frogs, he is certainly up to the task technically. However, his gifted focus on visuals, including the opening "ring" on the deadly videotape, is undermined by the second "ring," that on the telephone, bearing a gloomy forecast to those who have just watched the tape. After a number of teenagers have viewed this tape, it is alleged that they have died, precisely as forecast, by an eerie telephone voice giving them 7 days to live. The strange death of her niece and sinister affects on a teenage friend set single mom and newspaper reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) on a search into the events preceeding the tragic night. Cynical regarding an alleged death-dealing videotape, she heads for the remote Shelter Mountain Inn, where her niece had gone with friends. We are also introduced to her young son, Aidan, a strangely introspective, sensitive and very observant child. She too, views the tape &amp; immediately hears the phone ringing. Yep, that same, eerie disembodied voice for whom good news seems an impossible commodity. Now frightened, she enlists Aidan's father, Noah [Martin Henderson Watts], a videotape and sound expert. Also cynical, he views the tape and is surprised that he cannot trace its origins. Rachel is at her best now, researching individual visual images from the tape and constructing a locale, identities of people on the tape, and a background on them and their histories. The Morgan family, horse breeders, seem to be the people depicted; and there have been tragedies, both with horses and a daughter. We have learned that the daughter is/was severely troubled through Dr. Grasnik [Jane Alexander], who treated her for a time. There is also, among the isolated images on the tape, a fly which makes a seamless transition from the world on tape into Rachel's real world. Rachel travels to the remote Morgan center of operations, now almost deserted, and inhabited by the former family patriarch [Brian Cox], a man who seems as haunted by his family memories as he is by the strange happenings with his horses. A ferry ride proves to Rachel that the significance of horses may not be entirely behind us. When the combined efforts of Rachel [research and legwork]; Noah [calming, reasoned approach]; and young Aidan [sensitivity and absorbing presence] drive the plot, "The Ring" is at its best. However, the excellent cinematography is severely undermined by visual effects which stretch a point [one in particular, involving Noah, a tv screen and a certain young woman]. Here interactive television takes on a whole new meaning. Furthermore, the visual competence should never have been compromised to preserve the hokey telephone element: the message could have been imbedded on the tape. Had Verbinski only subscribed to the "less is more" theory of suspense and horror, this could have been a dramatic winner. Had "The Ring" ended ten-fifteen minutes sooner, with Rachel musing over the life expectancy of one in an awful situation, it might have lived up to its promise. Young Aidan's questioning admonishment of his mother would then have had a nice, ominous ring to it. The visual exaggerations and story extension however, tend more to leave a ring around the tub.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I consider myself a seasoned veteran of the movie world, and I gotta say this one was probably the best that I've seen. Excellent usage of photography and suspense through-out was just awesome (the video they watch was probably the most intensely scary part of the movie... made the little hairs on the back of my neck stand on end). I haven't seen the original Japanese versions yet, so I can't compare it to those, so I'll just give it ****3/4 off the bat.The story was well-written (a bit confusing at times, but overall, well written). The music actually did a lot for the movie;it kept the suspenseful atmosphere going without getting in the way (thumbs up to Hans Zimmer).When I first saw it, I kept thinking it would be the normal cat-in-the-closet type thing... boy, was I wrong!And, this is one of those movies that has definite rewatchability (to catch all the little subtle things included in it). It's well-deserving of at least one Oscar (at least)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been years since I've seen a flick as scary as The Ring. I was definitely intrigued by the whole movie. The scene of the girl in the closet with her face warped was burned into my mind for the entire movie and definitely disturbed me. The tape itself had me wondering the entire time what it was all about and I absolutely loved the way everything fell into place. Alot of movies leave me wondering well what about that or this, not this one. The ring thoroughly explained every question that I had or would have had. Overall it was a great movie with great visual and audio effects on getting blood pressure up. The storyline was killer and I felt tired after this movie from sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time I was in the theater. 8stars out of 10</fullReview>

Just what was wrong with her?Why did the little boy keep knowing things that were going to happen? Why did you see different things on the film as you saw people watching the tape later? Such as the girl climbing out of the well? Why did the girl's mother have on clothes from another time period when she was killing the girl? What significance did the fly have that the journalist picked off of the screen when she was watching the tape? How could a dead person make a tape and call you on the phone? Why use the phone? Did she have a phone in the well? How did the teenagers who all died from "watching" the film know that when the caller said 7 days, the caller meant they would all die in 7 days?If you knew four people had died from watching a tape exactly 7 days from the day they had watched it, would you rush to watch it? Why not call in some help?? Why did the journalist not take a picture of the deadbeat dad after he watched the film? See if he was blurry too?? Why leave a tape so "dangerous" around, convenient for your kid to watch? (hope mom was better with her X rated tapes) Who was lurking around in the foyer when the journalist and the deadbeat dad were in the farmhouse AFTER the old man had fried? In the sequal will the killer movie now be in DVD?? LMAOHey I'm surprised I didn't DIE after watching this film, just from remorse for wasting my time.Some eerie video effects, the hint of the possiblity of a truely scary story, tied together far too loosely.Sorry, gotta get me with a good story as well as good effects...Even sorrier that the mass public is eating it up. I have had a hard time finding a good movie lately, and now I know why. If we applaud such ill thought out plotlines, that is what we will get. Why take the time to design a truely believable plotline, when you can churn them out faster if the plotline is not to be worried with?When have we last had a movie of the calibre of Shawshank Redemption, Sling Blade, Forest Gump, Babe, Pulp Fiction, or Blair Witch? For the last year, I rent em, I take em back, usually shaking my head and saying, what the hell was all that about??I'm sorry guys, but we gotta demand more for our movie $$$'s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the most deceptive films i've ever seen !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that the ring was one of the most interesting films i have ever watched. The 20 minutes at the start are brilliant, the director changed a few of the elements from the japanese original for the better thanks of course to the higher budget. The end of the film is great too, one of the most inventive and genuinly frightening conclusions i have ever seen.Its these final exhillerating 20 minutes that almost make you forget about the painfully slow, dull and boring middle of the film. If ever a film has drawn attention away from what in the original was a great story this is it !!! Where as the japanese version went by with a quick pace never dwelling on small details that have little bearin on the charecters the Hollywood version labours over and over. I was honestly on the verge of tears when i thought the film was concluding.However, the ending saves what for first time watchers will agree was almost one of the biggest anticlimax's ever. All in all i can only say that if hollywood script writers are struggling with the translation from japan to USA just set it in Japan. Better that than create a ridiculous insert in the storyline which not only bores viewers but at times makes no sense whatsoever.Is this film a horror ?..... yes ! is it scary ?..... not particuarly !6 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to say it, but I may have fallen victim to media hype on this movie. I thought this movie was terrible. It sparked memories of Jacob's Ladder, and such over "scary" movies that incorporated disturbing images and quick cuts to 'bubbling blood shots' and such to mortify it's unlucky viewers. Throughout this entire movie I kept waiting for something to catch me...suck me into the story. This movie lacked focus. The entire portion of the movie where she tried to figure out the puzzle of 'who is this woman, and why is she haunting me?' was dumb. At that point I found my self saying 'who cares'...bring back the video and watch it again or something. The more I think about this movie the more I feel like it's a cheap copy (which it is), and we all know a copy of anything is not as good as the original. Bottom line...I was very disappointed...maybe Ringu will be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who said this movie was scarier than the "Exorcist"?!?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok.....some of you kiddies who have seen this movie are probably not going to like this but "The Ring" doesn't hold a CANDLE to "The Exorcist". We're not even talking the same sport here, let alone the same ballpark. After all the hype and all the stories going around that this movie is as scary as or scarier than the "Exorcist, I decided to let my daughter go out an buy it since I'm a BIG horror/Sci-fi fan. I popped in the DVD and we were on our way. The first scene, poorly acted, by two teenagers was the first omen that I was NOT going to like this movie. I don't mind "campy" or "corny" horror movies provided that they're not hailed as "the horror movie event of the century" or "The scariest movie ever made".In any event, After the opening scene, I decided to give it a chance before leaving the room. Well, I'll tell ya what......when she opened that door with the water leaking out from under it to reveal the TV playing that water well in black and white and the camera RUSHED at her face.....I nearly poopied in my pants!!! (LOL)."Ok" , I thought...."you got my attention!!" That was ONE of the three, maybe four scary scenes throughout the entire movie. Enter Naomi Watts.......Where did this girl/woman get her license to act!??!?!........In a cracker jack box!??!!? MY GOD, MAN.....she was absolutely horrible! SO bad, in fact, that she ruined the entire movie in my opinion. Ok.....so there's more bad acting. I figure, what the heck, let me finish it because I really have to see what everyone is talking about. And besides, that opening scene was really something.She watches the tape and blah blah blah.....she tries to figure out what's going on with the death of her niece and more blah blah blah......Then there's a horse that escapes from his container on a ferry boat and jumps in the water and more blah blah blah.....THEN, she finds Brian Cox, who by the way, played in "Manhunter" aka "Red Dragon", the first Hannibal Lecter. He's a GREAT actor and it was a pleasure to watch him. He's no Anthony Hopkins, mind you, but still a great actor.Anyway, moving right along here.......Instead of telling you what happens and giving away scenes, I'll just tell you that, overall, this is a VERY decent thriller despite the horrible acting and slow scenes inbetween the scary ones. The moments in this movie that are scary, are TRULY HORRIFYING. I'll give 'em that one! There's a scene near the mid-end where her ex is watching the TV and Samara starts to emerge from the well. OH MY GOD! That's All I'm going to say! If THAT doesn't raise the hair off your skin, nothing will!It's just a shame that this movie wasn't done a little better. It COULD have easily been as scary as the Exorcist but the poor acting and holes in the plot prevented it. Again, the foundation is there for a brilliant thriller/horror movie but it just didn't make the grade. I'll give it 7 out of 10 for the really creepy scenes that were truly horrifying. I just get upset when you have all the makings of a GREAT movie and then poor acting and holes in the plot ruin it. And as always, I hope I haven't offended anyone. The younger crowd my absolutely LOVE this movie as my daughter did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not even going to waste time writing a full review here. This film is all style, no substance. It's full of plotholes and general stupidity. The characters follow totally illogical paths to arrive at completely pointless "answers" and along the way there's a whole lot of creepy visual non-sequiturs. In a film like The Sixth Sense, a revelation is made which follows back to another revelation and so forth until the whole story is made stunningly clear. In The Ring, things are built up as revelations, but they explain nothing. There are no answers. There aren't even open-ended questions as an intentional choice. There are just a lot of creepy things thrown in here for no good reason. I'm not prone to exaggeration and hyperbole, so when I say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen, especially relative to the hype it received, I mean it's a special kind of bad. Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't let friends persuade you to watch it. They're stupid and they lie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am 45 years old and considered an extremely knowledgeable film buff. I am NOT a teenager.Only "The Exorcist", upon its original release, had this terrifying effect on me. This film sticks with you--it's extremely difficult to shake off. Sure, it contains a number of schlocky tactics, but they are effective. You could shoot arrows through some of the plot holes, but this is a supernatural tale, and not responsible for totally explaining itself.The haunting images and creepy atmosphere suggest a nightmare gone several steps too far. The makers of this film have tapped into exactly what scares an audience. There are several scenes that linger long after viewing this movie. I have seen it twice at the cinema and rented it today, on the debut of its home video release. It still creeped me out to no end!I admit that I have not yet seen "Ringu", but I plan to remedy that situation tomorrow.Now, can someone go down to the basement and get my laundry.....???!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just watched The Ring a few nights ago the film is still very vivid and powerful. Leaving a full aray of haunting images that cant be easily forgotten. The story is about a supposed cursed video tape that if watched results in a phone call in where a young girl tells you that in seven days you will die. We see this happen in the opening part of the film. One of the victims is the niece of Rachel Keller(Naomi Watts) who because of the request of her sister digs deeper into the mystery of four young teens who die in mysterious ways all exactly at the same time. The same four friends who watched the video together exactly one week earlier. Her young son, superbly played by David Dorfman and ex boyfriend (Kiwi Martin Henderson) are drawn into the mystery as well. She soon realises she must solve the origins of the tape quickly as she herself recieved the same phone call straight after viewing the cursed tape. Full of some shocking moments and great horror the film has you gripped from beginning to end with one of the most shocking and freaky endings ive seen in a long time..you will never feel the same about your t.v again! With wonderful cinematography and haunting music (also periods of creepy silence) this is a film you cant easily forget or get out of your head!..leaving many unanswered questions at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A smooth mix between scary horror and put together piece by piece criminal thriller. I most admit, it was quite scary. And the feeling was enhanced when I was walking home that night, pitch black, thick fog and alone in the north part of Sweden. As a film I don't fancy it. Lame actors, no extraordinary sounds, no deep. Not anything remarkable about it. But as a horror film; a little masterpiece. Excellent editing. The flashes in were the corpses are revealed are genial. A very good way to scare the audience, indeed. The picture loses little of it's supernatural charm in the end, but that is typical. Not many movies are good and amusing right through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOTE: THIS REVIEW MAY RUIN THE ENDING OF THE FILM.I thoroughly enjoyed the film, both for its spine tingiling special effects and narrative. I had expectations of a typical teen horror, as their was no star vehicle to promote the film, but I was wrong. The spirit of Samara is portrayed not unlike waht I have observed in the film Thir13een Ghosts. The seven last days before each victims death is also a poinyant number to note, like the film Se7en. There are many copycat American mainstream techniques presented in this film, but this is what makes itr original. The idea of a lonely island, with many hidden secrets, linked with diseased crazed horses and a psychotic child reveals a mystery genre.The idea of a child creating so much chaos and havoc, reveals that children are not as innocent as they seem. Bith leading protagonists in the film gave a brilliant performance, but the casting was not heavily delved into. It can easily be believed taht Naomi Watts could be romantically involved with Martin Henderson, it is almost impossible to comprehend that David Dorfman (who plays the character Aidan, son of Hendreson/Noah and Watts/Rachel) a smart, well-dressed, intelligent young boy could be the product of such a young girl. I think the character Rachel is too young to pass as a young mother.Setting aside the castiong issue, a throughly recommend the film to any thriller/horror fans of films such as Thi13een Ghosts, Se7en, Sixth Sense or Unbreakable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A smooth mix between scary horror and put together piece by piece criminal thriller. I most admit, it was quite scary. And the feeling was enhanced when I was walking home that night, pitch black, thick fog and alone in the north part of Sweden. As a film I don't fancy it. Lame actors, no extraordinary sounds, no deep. Not anything remarkable about it. But as a horror film; a little masterpiece. Excellent editing. The flashes in were the corpses are revealed are genial. A very good way to scare the audience, indeed. The picture loses little of it's supernatural charm in the end, but that is typical. Not many movies are good and amusing right through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn, that's some scary stuff!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring scared the crap out of me. I don't think a movie has ever had the effect on me that it did. I got to watch it the other night on DVD (advantage of working at Blockbuster). Three in the morning was a bad time. The movie does have a great story to it, though. And the visuals are scary, the sound is scary, the story is scary...I don't spook easily, but damn! So one would think that, after being so damn scared, I'd swear it off. Of course not! I want to buy it so I can see the special features (I was too scared to watch them), it had DTS sound, which I think would give me a heart attack, and I want to watch the original Japan version, Ringu. I didn't rent it because I didn't realize what it was, but as soon as I can, I'm watching it. And I want to track down the sequel/prequel to Ringu, thoughtfully titled Ringu 2 and Ringu 0, respectivly.Watch this movie. Just not alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, so you went to see The Ring in theaters and left praising it for its deep, ingenious plot...but little did you know it was actually a REMAKE of a brilliant Japanese film called Ringu. If you enjoyed The Ring, please give the original a chance. It is much more subtle, and, in my opinion, infinitly more spine-tingling than the American remake. Sure the remake has its moments...it could have been a much worse film...but Hideo Nakata's Ringu, originally released in 1998 (the same year as the sequel, Ringu 2, was released) still retains an expressive power over Verbinski's version, mostly because there is no sacrifice to the American gods of specific plot narrative. If you liked this Ring, do yourself a favor and see the real one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similarities to other films, a little confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a ticket to the press preview of this, but I couldn't be bothered getting out of bed to see it (being at 10am, which is a silly time for a horror anyway). I got round to seeing it tonight, and it isn't a bad film at all.--SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THE REVIEW--One thing I came away with was noticing a lot of similarities to other films. It was nearly always raining, much like in Se7en. The kid, well, he harks back to Sixth Sense. It has strong hints of Scream in the opening sequence. There are many other small parts which are common, but still, it has a very unique style.There is some great cinematography in the film as well. The use of the creeping up behind you camera technique is used, but not overused. Some unique viewpoints, such as inside the filing cabinet draws.The score is also amazing - never intrusive, always fits well with the action. Music can make a horror film, and it helps a lot here.After the scene in the well at Shelter Mountain, a great sense of relief is imparted to the audience. You feel like the film is over, it's all relaxed. Then suddenly it turns round again and all gets going. This is done very well.Some good use of computer graphics as well. When Samara comes alive out of the TV, it's done well. The TV like effect, although it has been used a fair bit recently (House on Haunted Hill), is well done.A few things didn't work though. When Anna kills Samara by the well, they both appear to be wearing very old clothing, certainly pre-1960. However, she kills her with a plastic bin bag - it just seems a little odd. The numbers screwing up on the video - they are generally just an arbitary index that the video player generates. The light house lighting just looks wrong, the way it sweeps the floor in the Morgan's house (hmm... maybe inherited from House on Haunted Hill as well).The major problem - the viewer is given a lot of specific information. You learn a timeline, where things happened, why they happened. There is so much there that it feels like it should piece together better. You are left at the end, not really knowing much for certain, but knowing so many small parts, that your mind doesn't want to wander and try to work out the solution. The cross between fact, fiction, and the supernatural world portrayed just doesn't mix properly.It's hard to describe what I mean. Take Magnolia - that leaves a lot of people feeling like they have wasted 2 hours (I think it was longer...). There is so much there, and bits of it pull together, and others don't, leaving you feeling empty at the end. Then there is Mullholland Dr. - again, lots of disjointed events, but they are linked together so lightly, that at the end of the day, you mind has time to explore the hundreds of possibilites.All in all, a good horror film, better than most recent ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the scarier movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very freaky film. It's about a tape and after you see this tape, you die 7 days later. Sounds interesting, yes? So then you have Naomi Watts whose niece died from this tape and she is a reporter and decides to investigate. So it's a horror/mystery/thriller. She watches the tape and so the race is on against time to solve the mystery. She also shows it to the dead-beat dad of her kid (who also watches it on his own).There are a few criticisms I have. One is that there were too many B-movie thrills in it. Things like when the lady in the convienience store tells the dad "You're going to die" followed by "from smoking too many cigarettes." Haha. Real clever there. Then there are dumb things like when Naomi comes home the babysitter is sleeping on a couch and it looks like she's dead. There are some stupid jokes thrown in also and it seems only for the "well we need to correct the joke-to-thrill ratio here"The other main criticism is the ending which was rather bleh. Apparently in the original RINGU movie it was the ending that made the movie but I think the ending ruined it here. Basically they spend most of the movie solving the mystery. Then after they solve it, they really didn't solve it! Wow. Then they use some lame claymation technique that looks like it came from "Clash of the titans" to scare you. OOOHH!But that stuff aside the movie is freaky and if you like horror fliks then this is not only original, but good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as original but in a different way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched both this newer version and the japanese original in the same day. Thus, the japanese version was not as frightening, as I knew what to expect and when to expect it. If I had seen the japanese version first, though, I think I would've found that one better.One notorious difference between the two Rings is that the japanese is just about 95 minutes while the american one runs for almost 2 hours. It becomes clear why when they are compared in the same day as I did - the japanese main characters seem to have some kind of psychometric powers, i.e. the ability to see past events related to an object or a person that they touch. The american version is more true to scientific method and lets the characters find out more for themselves in a "logical" manner. The quote-marks I just used are of course there since there isn't much logic to be expected in this movie.I definitely love both versions, I am giving both 9 out of 10, perhaps I would give the japanese a 9 and the american an 8.5 if possible, but they are good in so different ways that they're almost two different horror movies, although you recognize most scenes and often even the camera angles and architecture of the rooms and the steps inside the houses where the action takes place! This is a Blair Witch Project for the 00's, let's just hope that the sequel isn't as bad as in the Blair Witch case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was meant to be scary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a US remake of a Japanese remake of a Korean remake of a Korean TV movie based on a novel called Ringu.Right 4 perfectly healthy teenagers die on the same night after watching a weird videotape with a ring on it. A journalist who is an aunt of one of the teenagers who died investigates it, finds the videotape and watches it. Then she receives a weird phone call.This wasn't as scary as people made it out to be. Seriously there were a few jump scenes but nothing that would keep you from sleeping.The best performance is from the sexy Naomi Watts (Children of the Corn 4) who plays Rachel Keller the journalist. Her acting was outstanding though Martin Henderson's (that dumb aussie soap Home and Away) and Brian Cox's (Manhunter: Red Dragon) performances were also notable.If this film wasn't cleverly made I would have crucified it and made it out to be terrible. It has a good plot twist but that doesn't make great horror. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The Ring (Gore Verbinski, 2002) yesterday.I went by myself to the cinema, leaving my fiance at home by herself (knowing that the movie would be far too much for her). I was almost an hour early and waited upstairs, staring blankly at a large TV whilst watching the trailers of countless movies to come. The hour passed swiftly and I was soon inside the cinema theatre, seated happily in my usual spot (yes, I'm one of those sad people that always sits in seat B12). No popcorn, just a half full bottle of cherry coke. The movie started ominously. The Dreamworks' logo crackled. Glee. Joy. Happiness. I'm a Ring fanatic.The original (Ringu, 1998) by Japanese director Hideo Nakata, chilled me to the bone. The sequel (Ringu 2, 1998) and prequel (Ringu 0, 2000) were equally potent. They're all members of that fading school of horror cinema in which blood makes almost no appearance (or if present, is a catalyst to the atmosphere, rather than a tool overused by the director to weed out the squeamish). I must admit at this point that I have not seen the Korean remake Ring Virus (1999) also known as Ring, but am planning on getting it from Hong Kong when I can scratch up enough cash to buy a few more oriental horror movies. It's high on my list.Back to the Hollywood English-language remake by Gore Verbinski: I was positively thrilled. He was almost entirely faithful to the Japanese version, but fortunately he also added to the entire Ringu mythology with certain elements. He anglicised others, changing the name Sadako to Samara for instance, and used Western imagery instead of Oriental. He added nice elements of symbolism such as the burning tree, the stagnant water that seeps through the floorboards and under doors, the entire equestrian idea, and others. Fortunately, they all worked well. Gore Verbinski did however add a little gore, taking a bloodless film and adding the odd writhed, decomposed body - a rare occurrence, granted (there is far less gore in this film than in the mainstream Se7en, 1995), but one that Nakata did not use. My feelings about this are quite mixed, but as a whole, I think I liked it.The best way to look at the 2002 remake version is to quite simply look at it as an entirely new film. If you do this, you will not be disappointed. If you look at it in the context of the Japanese versions (and Korean, I imagine), you will find this a thrilling appendix to the Ringu mythology. Either way, you will enjoy it. Unless you are part of that large group of people that actually ran out of the theatre half-way through the film yesterday afternoon. That is always a good sign.Personally, I found that the English-language remake version was as strong, if not stronger than either of the other sequels, but still remain adamant that the original Ringu is both more potent and horrifying than any of its offspring. This is the only horror film in which I have seen myself obliged to switch the light on to watch (I own Ringu, Ringu 2 and Ringu 0 on DVD). The final Sadako scene in Ringu is the most frightening, terrifying, chilling and unreal scene I have ever set eyes upon. Samara's final scene in The Ring is almost there, but this is where I must loudly voice my disapproval of Verbinski's handling of this scene: He cut it with the Rachel's car scene, dispelling in my eyes the uncut, continuous horror of Samara's appearance. This is in my eyes, the single flaw of the Verbinski version.I would recommend this film to all the horror fans out there. This is without a doubt an unforgettable movie and it will hopefully lead you onto a desire to watch the Japanese and Korean versions. Do not see this if you have even the slightest heart conditions or are easily spooked. You will run out of the cinema. Another word of warning: This is not an easy film to watch; it demands your entire commitment to the story and especially the atmosphere (the soundtrack is amazing). Do not watch this film (or its forefathers) on DVD whilst munching popcorn and chatting with your friends. This is not "Watch over the weekend during a Horror movie marathon" material. Your attention is required from beginning to end, switch off the light, pull out the phone cord, close the doors, and be afraid. Be very afraid.I shall now go and build a little shrine to Ringu. Or I might go and watch it again.</fullReview>

I felt it had a "Sixth Sense" feel to it though, the eeriness and the plot. The only flaw I can find in the film is the way in which it felt unfinished at the end. The story-line throughout did not fall into place at the end, although I am aware they may be leaving that for The Ring 2, but all the same. I'm a regular cinema-goer and enjoy most films, from Shrek to Lord of the Rings to films like The Ring and would give it 6/10. It's well worth seeing.</fullReview>

Turns out that I liked the original better. The story was very close to the original and was very well represented on the screen. After watching the original again, I was disappointed to find that I didn't like it nearly as much. The acting in the original seemed almost bland and timid compared to the remake and there were a few plot holes that I never noticed before. Maybe I liked the remake better because I didn't have to read the movie, I don't know, but both are definitely worth watching. If you haven't seen either one yet, watch them both and decide for yourself. I loved it personally. 10 Stars.Did she show you the horses?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon rising from the seat I had been at for the duration of the film, I felt both exhilareted and terrified. Hours earlier, I had assumed this would be some tacky, poorly put together horror film, almost synonymous with the new horror emerging from Hollywood, and not even touching various masterpieces like the Cabinet Of Dr Caligari or Halloween, unsurpassed since.A Videotape that kills people a week after they watch it ? It almost screams cheesy horror, something to waste your time one saturday evening with nothing better to do. But what emerges is an excellent mix of plot and horror and still makes the audience jump out of their seat. Like the main investigator ( reporter ), the audience learns more about the tape as she does, leading to a lighthouse and a family, all culminating in a spectacular finale. Watch it now.</fullReview>

Well worth going to the trouble of seeing the Japanese version instead, far scarier etc. Oh surprisingly the Japanese one has got real actors, as oppose the laughable acting in this one(yeh people in the cinema laughed at it). Japanese also develops the storyline better and more fully, and it will make more sense. Compare it to a fighting scene, e.g. US film is just another fighting scene(steven segal type thing), the Jap is the new matrix style, slo mo etc, fighting scene, they both show a fight but matrix style is more enjoyable to watch and makes the character seem more skillful.Spoilers First it starts off with crappy acting. The girl did not look scary, Japanese girl made you scared. Some scenes were just a complete waste, added nothing really to the story, while leaving out big parts of the story which would have given the viewer a much better understanding. I didn't sense any sort of desperation, when her time was running out, or desperation for her child. That boy annoyed the hell out of me, basically 6th sense child.

The script was also underwritten in areas, not much but a little bit. In the end the movie doesn't end up making alot of sense. You still don't know who made the tape, but that might be explained in a sequel or a prequel.

I'd like to thank Gore Verbinski for finally, FINALLY making a movie that is truly frightening. We need more horror movies that are psychologically terrifying, NOT gore-packed jump-fests filled with awful, second rate acting. A really well-made movie that definitely caught me off guard. Go see it now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest film ever!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not normally a fan of horror films, for the simple reason that films generally don't scare me. I say don't normally, because this did. Some films can feel genuinely creepy and make you feel unnerved in some moments, films like Signs as a recent example, who didn't feel the blood leaving their chest when the first got sight of one of the Aliens in the Brazilian home video scene. The Ring has scenes like this throughout, and it makes you feel uncomfortable throughout the movie, and gets you really jumpy.There are big shocks and lots of little shocks and it is down to some first rate editing, directing and sound editing, as well as some unsettling imagery. The cast are all good, the gorgeous Naomi Watts is excellent in the lead and very convincing and there is a great cameo from Brian Cox, in suitably creepy mode. David Dorfman is good as Watt's son, he is a very good child actor, and in this sort of film it is essential to have a good actor for the child parts, Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense being a good example. Martin Henderson is also good playing the ex boyfriend of Naomi Watt's character Rachel.The film pans out brilliantly. From the initial opening death sequence to Rachel's investigations of the tape that apparently kills people if they watch. The tape holds within it a vengeful spirit who kills their victims seven days after they watch the tape. Gore Verbinski's version of the classic Japanese horror is excellent, and intriguing, it is how a horror film should be, it genuinely unsettled me, no film for years has done that, not even the Exorcist did.You should definitely watch this, and I hope there will be a sequel. I intend to watch this alone in a dark room when it comes out on DVD. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy Interpretation Of A Horror Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the original Japanese version of "Ring" ("Ringu") I am pleased to say that "The Ring" (starring the great Naomi Watts from the David Lynch masterpiece "Mulholland Drive") for the most part complements the original cycle of films and stands as one of the best American horror pictures of recent years.At first I thought the film had already blown it in the first scene. Hideo Nakata's original opens with a nod to horror movies like "Scream", only Japanese style. The American take on the same scene however, seemed to speed up the telling of the urban myth that sets up the film's premise and came across more like a second rate "Scream" clone than a well crafted homage. However, as the opening sequence goes on, it's handling improves and it reveals that this remake is quite capable of serving up scares of it's own.The pace is more urgent in this version and the first few days of the curse fly past. Events and characters also play out differently and much of the revelations are last day rather than spread out. Such is the tension (a combination of direction and Naomi Watts's brilliant and riveting performance) that I almost completely forgot that something we're led to believe about Rachel (Watts) 's uncovering of the curse and impending doom is a red herring."The Ring" retains the dreary rainy grey look of Hideo Nakata's original and the music and sound effects are also eerily reminiscent, which helps keep the creepy mood and gives the story anunsettling atmosphere. There are also a few teasing nods to scenes and events from the Japanese sequels "Ring 2" and "Ring 0: Birthday". One of "The Ring"'s strengths though is that it can both complement and differentiate from the Japanese cycle and stand in it's own right. Sometimes I was unsure of what would play out and how it would play out from the original story. If you're comfortably familiar with "Ring" there's still a few surprises in store. Brian Cox (of "Manhunter" fame) plays a character who is actually an amalgamation of two characters from the original and the protagonist's mother is a bit different to Shizuko (her Japanese equivalent). Shockingly so in one crucial scene. There's also a real heart in your throat scene on the ferry involving a horse which is completely new and very effective. Another main difference is that Noah initiallly seems oafish and gets properly involved in Rachel's investigation of the cursed tape a lot later on than in the Japanese version. The film also concentrates more on building a family link between characters making their fate more emotionally important to the viewer.Now to some criticism of the film. The backstory of Samara and the curse doesn't play out as effectively as that forSadako in "Ring" (1998) and seems a bit half sketched in comparison. Unfortunately the scary finale is one place (like the initial opening) where this film suffers in comparison to it's predeccesor, seeming more overblown and more sped up at the expense of subtlety and building tension. This scene did seem to work well enough, it has to be said on audience members who probably hadn't seen the original, judging by their nervous giggles when the credits came up.Overall if you're a fan of horror that dares to be creative and genuinely scary, I'd urge you to see both this well crafted, spine-tingling, supernatural thriller and the terrifying Japanese films that inspired it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A clear example of how real scary movies are going to be in the future.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SpoilersI realize this is not an original movie, I was very impressed with this version, though. When I say impressed, I really mean it. I still have disturbing dreams about Tv-sets, long dark hair little girls or wild horses.The only flaw (my humble opinion) would be the imperative need to use the editing process in order to create a deep impact in the audience. I think there is a big challenge to change so in the future. However I also think that "The Ring" can be a perfect example of how real scary movies are going to be in the future. If we think about The Exorcist for instance, and how less interesting must be for a whole nintendo-generation despite all of the devil references. In short, the question to ask would be: How can you scare 21st century people who can't be scared with anything at all?, people who are got used to live among winds of war, murderers, etc.Maybe the answer would be: Suspense, no visual effects, fear to unknown things. Because the worst evil, the ugliest monster exists within our own minds. No art designer, make up artist, or screen writer will ever be able to compete with that. M. Night Shyamalan understood so already. I think "The Ring" type of film is the next step.I'm not an easy-to-scare guy. That's why I always feel a bit embarrassed when I remembered I let a scream out in the theater, while I was witnessing the last sequence of this film.The last ten minutes of "The Ring" has the most scary images I've ever suffered in my whole life. I ask my money back going out the cinema because I was shocked.I can imagine Samara coming into my own kitchen, very very angry...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this remake, after seeing the original a while ago. And I enjoyed it a lot. Though it does change quite a bit of the story, it does a very good job of staying close to the bleak and spooky feel of the original. It's probably because I saw the other one first, but so far Samara hasn't had me lying awake at night or frightened of reflections and televisions, like Sadako did. But I did jump quite a few times.

The overall story and tension are just much better in 'The Ring'.The only thing that's a shame about the film is that the credits start rolling so soon after the end of the movie.

Fifteen minutes pass, and I'm still enjoying the movie. But then "Samara"'s videotape is played, and the movie takes a turn for the worse. From then on, the plot removes itself completely from the Japanese original, and the atmosphere is totally non-existent. The movie relies on cheap scares to keep you on your seat. Sadly, the impressive direction could not save a very poor movie, which does not touch the original in terms of greatness.And, frankly, the end sequence is rubbish, unlike the great original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not scary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the upcoming DVD release of this oustanding movie I wanted to add my own review. I admit having not seen the Japanese original leaves my opinion slightly jaded. Pressing on though I didn't find this film scary at all... But it is by far one of the creepiest films I've ever seen.It seems there should be a different genre for these type of films, instead of horror perhaps it would be best to label them uber-thrillers. The movie was very suspenseful and compelling to watch in a very morbid sense. Imagine all those people that slow down driving past car accidents to see the damage and carnage. That kind of morbidity propels the viewer through the ring with a definite sense of "on-the-edge-of-your-seat" tension.When you couple that dreaded sensation with the excellent sound effects, music, eerie locations and grainy film, it makes the American version of this film one of the best modern "horror" movies hands down. I have still be told REPEATEDLY to see the original Japanese film if I ever get the chance as it is supposed to be far superior in story and dread. Hopefully with the American remake coming to DVD next week they'll import the Japanese version so we can enjoy it as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I owe Naomi.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would personally like to thank Naomi Watts for bringing her considerable talent to the big screen. I was totally mesmerised by her performance, just as I was in 'Mulholland Drive'. She's got that Bette Davis-like presence which transforms good movies, which 'The Ring' definitely is, into very good ones. I cannot think of a better actress than her, and whilst films like this don't win Oscars, I'm sure she will one before long. The minute she appears, after what is already one of the best starts of any movie I have seen for ages, you're gripped, and, mainly because of her convincing style, you don't so much suspend disbelief at the plot, but actually want to believe that it's all true. There are many creepy moments. This isn't, thankfully, a gore-fest, nor does it have you jumping totally out of your seat, but it does get you on the edge of it on a regular basis. And for once, CG effects complemented the film, because at least you don't have to worry about cruelty to animals any more...hopefully! My one criticism is that it seemed to me to deliberately leave a big opening for a sequel. Had this been not quite so obvious, I wouldn't have minded, but this aside, I thought it was very good, and the best 'scary movie' I've seen since...well, since 'Mulholland Drive'! Naomi rules!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every now and then a movie comes along that blows you away, and leaves you with much thought, and astounds you with its unpredictability. This is one of those movies.The fact that makes the film so much more psychological is that it is set along the lines of an Urban Legend/Ghost Story, and the horror is something you can't exactly see.The film itself is full of dismal dark and dingy atmosphere, and the kind of plotline that keeps you glued to the seat (perhaps though sitting right at the edge of it).While the movie leaves you in much confusion, as it slowly progresses it begins to all come together at the end and make sense (much as most movies do), don't let your confusion deter you from watching it right to the end, it's worth it for the finale.</fullReview>

Ok it didn't spend much of the time explaining and searching for the little girl like the most recent one, but it created more suspense and used the few special effects to much better use than the American version. However, the latest one does include comedy in the form of a man in charge of video tape archives! Watch and you'll see..but remember to watch the older version too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite chilling, just avoid the Japanese film beforehand (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My only advice to anyone going to see The Ring is NOT to see the original in advance. It sort of spoiled my enjoyment of this as I was constantly comparing it, in my head, to Hideo Nakata's version.That said, The Ring is still a very interesting story and manages effectively to create a tense atmosphere- maybe not as tense as Nakata's, but certainly one of the most chilling US horror movies in recent years.Gore Verbinski's take on the original Koji Suzuki novelette 'Ringu' is interesting in its own right- this is not a shot-for-shot remake (like Gus Van Sant's Psycho remake) and it was enjoyable to get another angle on the story. The opening scene, for example, is more subtle in the original, but I like what Verbinski did with it: he extended the scene a bit and ended it very well, I believe. The revelation near the end, delivered by Aidan was also a nice addition that didn't appear in the original.While a bit heavy-handed (showing us a scene in the present then showing us the corresponding scene on the tape) I think Gore Verbinski's effort was quite good.However (comparing it to the original) there were a few things I didn't like during the film (besides it stopping halfway through, the lights coming on and that awful, awful Avril Lavigne song Sk8er Boi starting to play!). They are as follows [MAJOR SPOILERS]: I didn't like Samara in this one- they shouldn't have shown the face and made us sympathise with her- Sadako was much creepier. And what the hell was with A) Rachel coughing up that long piece of lace and B) the scene with the horse running amok on the ferry? (it was good from a supernatural point of view, but it was bizarre!) Still though, the TV scene was very, very good and the well being under the cabin was a nice twist.The Ring is definitely worth seeing- it delivers some good shock moments with an underlying tension throughout. Perhaps not as unnerving as Nakata's, but a good horror film in its own right.(BTW: I didn't like that they tried to tie in the title with the film. The ring in the original (to the best of my knowledge) referred to the video tape getting passed from person to person not a ring of light like in this one. So I thought that was a bit stupid.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring vs Ringu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never known an original to be less of a movie than the remake but in this case I have to give it to Gore Verbinski for keeping the tone of the original in-tact but amplifying the chills a few notches. I was disappointed with the original (I tried very hard to like it) although the tone was decidedly creepy. The remake really delivers. It is everything a scary chiller movie is supposed to be (including plot holes and far fetched premise). The story line of how the girl came to be so evil was nastier in the original (but why did they switch from the father being the culprit in the original to the mother in the remake??) but the tale around how the tape came into existence was more plausible in The Ring. It gave me the creeps throughout without resorting to gore or special effects. Also,I thought that the character development of Rachel was very cleverly done and more developed. You were meant not to care for her parenting skills in the beginning as it gave the chance for her to redeem herself as a parent when the father did not. Naomi Watts character was certainly flawed and this added to yourself being drawn into the movie. Cardboard cutouts never do well in this type of movie. The role of the son was more prominent in this one which was no bad thing although 6th sense comparisons are inevitable.All in all I would suggest to see both the original and then the remake and make up your own mind. I actually think they compliment one another. I certainly think more of the original now then I did before. This is maybe because I saw it in a more 'western' context and it filled in a lot of unanswered questions I had before I saw the remake. </fullReview>

Andyet surprisingly, everyone seems to love it. Except me. Go figure.Watts is a horrible actress that tries her best to carry a bad moviefrom a hack director (Gore "Mousehunt" Verbinski, who has yet tomake a film that I don't absolutely despise) and a hack writer(Ehren Kruger, who after this and "Reindeer Games" should bebeaten severely).Watts investigates the death of a relative after watching a scarytape at a scary cabin in the woods. She watches the scary tape; heold flame watches the scary tape; he scary kid watche the scarytape; scary girl calls each of them and tells them that they haveseven scary days to live before they die scary deaths at the handsof a scary girl with no motive at all whatsoever to be doing whatshe is doing. Scary things abound.Only none of it is particularly frightening. In fact I found most of thefilm to be quite laughable and never for a moment entertaining. Ifthe very notion of camera tricks and mood lighting telling a storyappeals to you, then "The Ring" is the movie for you. Otherwise,skip this and seek out the real deal: "Ringu" and it's sequel are farbetter than this dissappointment.</fullReview>

By no means is this a bad movie. In fact, it has some inspired additions from the original movie that embellished the story. but plot wise, tension wise and momentum wise, a lot was lost. of course, if you have never seen the original, you might just think this movie is just as good as you could ever hope, and maybe you will tell your friends how scary it is. Its obvious to say a remake is not as good as the original, but this really underlines the point.

		<fullReview>One can safely comment that this movie is absorbing and highly entertaining..The concept that the viewing of a videotape leads to a certain death 7 days later and the struggle to prevent such demise in the meantime while time is steadily running out attracts the attention and interest of the viewer who is captured by the charm of the dark life threatening secret from the first scene and is not released until the end or long after it even...The acting is solid ,the characters behavior not always "smart" but believable , the visual effects convincing ,the atmosphere impressive and it maintains both the agony and the guesswork in your mind active throughout."Im scared but i love it " would be an accurate description of the experience. I wont reveal the exact plot but i will make a couple of general comments on it so if you belong to the category of viewers that don't wish to know anything about the storyline don't read any further.The first observation is that the actual killings are not shown while committed .This "just before and after" approach which is handled well gives the film a less bloody profile and effectively helps to remove of it the label of "another horror movie" since bloodbaths have become very much a clich that provokes disgust but not necessarily fear. But is the movie a thriller proper? Well , if you expect at the end of it to leave the movie theatre with all the answers you will be a little bit disappointed.As in most movies that employ the supernatural as part of the explanation more questions than the ones answered are created and that for me is not a triviality.. If on the other hand you are not bothered with such approaches you can be sure that you will be in happy agony for 2 hours .It is certain that you wont regret your choice to see this otherwise impressive piece of film making. i would rate it 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I was expecting to love this movie (the Japaneseoriginal is a classic in many ways) this American remake is claptrap by-the-numbers red herring filmmaking at it's very worst. Andyet surprisingly, everyone seems to love it. Except me. Go figure.Watts is a horrible actress that tries her best to carry a bad moviefrom a hack director (Gore "Mousehunt" Verbinski, who has yet tomake a film that I don't absolutely despise) and a hack writer(Ehren Kruger, who after this and "Reindeer Games" should bebeaten severely).Watts investigates the death of a relative after watching a scarytape at a scary cabin in the woods. She watches the scary tape; heold flame watches the scary tape; he scary kid watche the scarytape; scary girl calls each of them and tells them that they haveseven scary days to live before they die scary deaths at the handsof a scary girl with no motive at all whatsoever to be doing whatshe is doing. Scary things abound.Only none of it is particularly frightening. In fact I found most of thefilm to be quite laughable and never for a moment entertaining. Ifthe very notion of camera tricks and mood lighting telling a storyappeals to you, then "The Ring" is the movie for you. Otherwise,skip this and seek out the real deal: "Ringu" and it's sequel are farbetter than this dissappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is so creepy and well-crafted. I was really surprised at how scary this movie actually was. The scene at the end had me and my friends (I might note, one of them franticly left during this scene, saying they had to "go to the toilet". Yeah, right) jumping out of our seats. It was that spooky and the jump tactic worked really well on me, my friends and the whole audience. Naomi Watts does really well, expressing all sorts of emotions such as dread, strength, vulnerability and so on. The music was really eerie, contrasting perfectly with the film's bleak, often surreal imagery. Overall, "The Ring" is the most effective horror film for quite some time, and that little girl is truly the most freakiest devil-disguised-as-a-child since Regan in "The Exorcist" Two thumbs up!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, this is so much better than the lame Original. When I saw "Ringu" I was heavily disapointed and wrote about it here. In my post I doubted that the Hollywood remake (that was still in production then) would be any better. I was wrong. "The Ring" is spooky, spooky, spooky! Nice additions to the story have been made as well as really effective shock scenes. There are beautiful haunting pictures that teach movies like "Feardotcom" what "atmosphere" means. I can't remember when I last saw a remake that was so far superior to the original. If only I had seen the remake first. However, although I knew how the story would end I was still thrilled until the very end. A great, great horror movie. Applause!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**********POSSIBLE SPOILERS***********This movie has one of the best chiller openings since 'Scream' (1996). We then get to see the infamous tape which is a supposed death sentence to all who watch. The imagery on it is truly bizarre and quite disturbing. Just like a nightmare. The cinematography is so saturated the movie feels like it's all abit of a dream (don't worry, it isn't, it's not like they all wake up at the end or anything). The main actors play there roles well, and I must say the Naomi Watts is damn attractive! The little kid looks freaky and is perhaps too much of a Hayley Joel Osment clone. He's still good though. Anyway, I digress. Be prepared to jump out of your skin a few times too....aswell as having your skin crawl. This is a very strange film that will clench your nerves. Be warned though, if you're expecting a more teen orientated stalk and death movie as I was from the trailer, prepare for disappointment. This is more 6th Sense than it is Final Destination.HOWEVER, we get to the middle chunk of the movie and we have this rather slow and utterly confusing investigation into the tape and who's on it etc etc. This was over an hour and the film became very stagnated. I began to get bored because no matter what new information was uncovered, I still couldn't understand alot of things. Such as; who made the blooming tape? What was so wrong with the girl that she brought trouble wherever she goes? Why was the well actually nowhere near the island yet horses were running around near there? Why were the girl and her mother there? The cabin had been built over the well, but that cabin looked more than 24 years old. How in the name of God did the little boy know about the girl down the well? And why did she keep on killing in the same style after she had been 'set free. These bewildering questions prevent this movie from being anything above a 3 star movie. I was scared during it though, and the images of the girl coming out of the well will haunt me for a while yet. The ending is good but drags on abit. Just as you expect to see the credits, another scene is played out, then another, then another..........so much you just want it to end. The Alternate Versions illustrated on the Imdb would have been interesting additions, and I don't think we will get to see them on the DVD which is a bummer! Nevermind.Anyway, watch this movie. I recommend it. But prepare to have your brain melted thinking about it afterwards. If anyone reads this and can explain the plot-holes I outlined, feel free to e-mail me and set me straight. Thanks, adios amigos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a remake, this has come out of the US production factory pretty well.After the first scene, you realize that trying to predict the "scares" is a waste of time as they keep being setup and let down so you never know where they are coming from.I was impressed and reasonably disturbed by this and have subsequently ordered the original Japanese version to watch. It's a grown up teen movie and much more "Blair Witch" than "Scream". It does make you think (although if you do too hard you will realize there are plenty of holes in the plot).Basically, a pretty fresh look at horror films and very well directed with some great cinematography too.You've got seven days to see it...

		<fullReview>Film starts very promising and succeeds in haunting you and giving you an uneasy feeling. Visually well made (director also filmed "The Mexican`) and Naomi Watts is a good lead, especially in the beginning when she (still) is the tough reporter. The `ring-video' itself is creepy in a bunuel-style way. An entertaining and haunting film until - well, until the end, or shall I say the second (or even third) ending. unfortunately the makers of `the ring' for whatever reasons felt the urge to top the scenes which seemed to be a smooth and well-fitting ending for the film by . I will not spoil it, go and see yourself. but this is really ridiculous and laughable. And, come to think of it, there are holes in the story you can drive a whole video-store through. No satisfying explanation what was really going on. Very disappointing ending but still - apart from that - `the ring' is an entertaining movie which delivers thrills and not too much gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring,Like many here I've seen the Japanese version and that's pretty damn good. When I heard of this remake I groaned to myself - You know that sinking feeling when Hollywood remake anything. Fresh from watching my most recent Horror film "Ghost Ship" - remove Horror from that description and replace with "Pants"So I don't want to describe much of the storyline - only to say that it's about people watching a video and after seeing that video you only have 7 days to live - why? You watch it and find out!Acting is credible and everyone seems to give good performances. Also it's true to the original in that when the scares happen you get that "skin crawling" kind of fear. It's not openly scary with over the top visual effects like so many other so called Horror films, it's that psychological scary type. (My fave.) Although I will admit to looking away when I saw the face of the first dead girl - frightened the willies out of me.So my advice is watch this and the Japanese one - both are worth seeing. Well done to the makers of this film - first scary film in a while. 7.5/10Is that my phone ringing???????????EnjoyRuss</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It simply gets under your skin.. like a true chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truth of the matter is, I am crazy about horrors and am pretty demanding when I watch one. Coming out of the Ring, I wondered whether they missed lots of opportunity to scare the audience further. But I later realised that would simply have not been a good idea considering the state that particular audience had been :)The Ring is absolutely beautiful in its imagery and Blair Witch Project like in terms of using your own imagination against you. However unlike that particular film, this one gives the scares a much harder push so no matter what, chances are you you are going to be very tense throughout the film and actually be left with an uneasy feeling that you may not be completely aware of until later - a mark ofa true chiller.Ive already ordered the Japanese version and well as the Japenese sequel and prequel - I am hooked, what can I say. However chances are, The Ring may be too much for you to handle. But if you love horrors and you want your ears little ringing at the end of the movie, watch this.</fullReview>

I enjoyed all the rest so much, it's a shame I'll maybe avoid seeing the film again because of this one scene. The crack of the horses' leg against the ship rail, and it screaming as it was sucked under and into the propeller, is unfortunately the main image I've brought home from the film. I like horror movies and I don't scare easily, but however much I know it 'isn't real', I just don't enjoy seeing an animal getting hurt. I think the point would have come across just as well if the horse had leaped over the rail, and just disappeared into the sea. Gratuitous cruelty, -even represented by cgi effects- lost the film a few points from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A finely shot serious storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If we divide the history of horror films chronologically into three eras, we'll find that each of them has their own style of stories. Don't include low-budget B-movies here; they're all the same over the years. Now, films prior to the 70's were, in most cases, derived from old classics. Or, the stories were set in old times in old haunted castles. Films within 70's and 80's are mostly made up of gory violence, bloody horrifying spirits roaming around a quiet town or some deserted place at night and attacking young girls in candid conditions. Films after the 90's generally has a queer storyline and lots of visual and sound effects do the rest job, plus or minus violence. This is the general rule.... but of course, with lot of exceptions."The Ring", a remake of the Japanese film "Ringu", falls in the last category and it, I must say, satisfied the conditions loosely. Well it has a queer storyline, good sound and visual effects, some instant chillers but the most important thing is, it has a fine seriousness over the story that is somehow scarce among the other modern horror films. The film never let the story get loose in any place. Though the plot is basically bogus, but the presentation of this plot is so fantastic and so realistic that when you are watching the film you are bound to take it seriously. That's where the success of this film lies.The content of the tape on which the story stands is brilliantly shot and presented... I must say. It is not really horrifying but artistic if you don't consider the fate of the viewers. Naomi Watts in her first leading role seemed very well. Dorfman as her son rather acted well but it seemed to me that his character is quite influenced by Haley Joel Osment in "The 6th sense" which was not a feature of "Ringu". However, locations of shooting were very well chosen.This film probably is one of the best in its genre and era. But the ending is too much overrated. There lies a little mess. Otherwise it is highly recommended. 4/5.</fullReview>

My friend andrea who saw it with me (who also has a history of immunity towards horror films)and I were speechless, and andrea jumped as her phone rang as we were exiting the cinema. For ages after that we kept saying "oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh" and stuttering in awe. A movie has never before affected me even a fraction as much as The Ring did, as we speak I am in fact home from school because I could not sleep a wink last night from fear.So, just a warning to anyone out there planning on seeing this movie- you better be damn tough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Movie in 20 Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing that could be said against this film is the hype it has generated probably led to some being disappointed. Still, the Ring is easily one of the top 10 horror movies of all time.People expecting the second coming of the Exorcist may have been aiming too high, however The Ring is easily the scariest, most well put together horror movies since the original Halloween back in 1980.The terror starts from the first scene, and the film never relents during the race to discover the secret behind the haunting deaths of those who watched a mysterious tape.I would advise against trying to rationalize the movie. "Where did the tape come from?" and similar questions that can't be answered and really don't need to be addressed. You have to take some things at face value with horror movies because by definition they're not always going to be put together in a nice, neat package.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A videotape that kills people when they watch it. *sigh* All right...The argument of the story sounds somewhat intriguing and the first sequence of the movie makes you think you're going to have a hard time trying to sleep that night. Well, I for one didn't.As the storyline develops the whole videotape business goes down the trash and the movie slowly turns into a "What lies beneath" or "The sixth sense" kind of film. I didn't like that one bit. By the end of the movie, and specially in the last sequence, you have to remind yourself "Oh yeah, the tape! That's what this was all about!". In short, the movie weakens itself progressively and finally collapses, just to have a little spark of life in that "last confrontation" scene. Still, the very ending, in my humble opinion, is nothing short of dumb. And Naomi Watts' performance doesn't help the story much either. It's just not convincing.I think the movie is worth watching for two main reasons:- The videotape itself gives you goose bumps. As they say in the movie, it's something you'd only see in a nightmare. - The "last confrontation" I mentioned earlier contain some of the scariest images you'll see in any movie. The director chose many of those shots so that they would look like an individual point of view, and that has a big impact when you're alone in your room watching TV. But then again, most of this new wave of thriller movie directors do the same.Aside from this two sequences the movie does not contribute anything to the genre. Recent movies like "The sixth sense", "The others" or "Signs" have a much bigger impact on the audience using only the atmosphere built throughout the film and a few carefully selected shots and sounds; they don't rely in visual FX: just good directors and good performances.

It did, however, show a "Sixth Sense" feel to it but you feel that for all of ten minutes as the rest of the film makes up for it. Probably one of the scariest films I have seen over the last year (however, not as good as the original) but I highly recommend that you watch this, preferably not alone.IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS FILM, DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER:-The ending however was somewhat confusing. Did Rachel live merely because she had copied the tape or was it because she had copied the tape AND shown it to Noah and in order for Aidan to live she needed him to make a copy AND show it to someone else... a VERY open ending which does make you think, however very impressive and very good throughout.

The movie begins with Katie (Amber Tamblyn), the neice of Rachel, and Becca (Rachael Bella) sharing information about a tape that, if watched, claims you will die within seven days. Surprisingly enough, the rumor is spreading amongst the high school crowd (courtesy of Becca and others). Katie, along with three of her friends rendezvous at a cabin retreat and view a non-commercial VHS tape of mixed messages and images. From what I've gathered (unless I missed some crucial dialog), this rumor was amassed without anyone actually dying. How many VHS tapes of The Ring actually exist? If the Katie and her friends weren't the only viewers, when did other viewers die where a rumor (or facts) could be built? If the only available copy existed at the cabin retreat, how did Becca find out about it and share the rumor with Katie who actually saw the tape and, no doubt, received the phone call that vocalized her future demise? If symptons developed after viewing the tape, such as a bleeding nose, or a blurred face in a photograph, wouldn't Katie have noticed these things prior to her 7th day and shared the information with Becca? I could go on with the unanswered questions, but I need to redirect my energy.Dreamworks, this is what I call good promoting. It's an overblown production that produces below average results.Thrills, suspense and horror? Give me the first two Alien movies. In fact, Deep Rising was a better horror movie than The Ring and it's current rating is averaging a full 2 points less; and Deep Rising had clever humor where The Ring failed.I hope they don't produce a sequel because this was garbage. In fact, please don't. 2 out of 10 because I did jump during the millipede scene. But, I'd jump even if the millipede scene was intermixed in a comedy because I don't like bugs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good adaptation..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers! This movie is originally adapted from the Japanese movie, with the same title. The American version for The Ring is okay, but I prefer the Japan version... Because -- Spoiler -- 1. Samara (Sadako) is even scarier because in fact she is a beautiful teenager but she has an evil twin who will kill anyone she dears. 2. Anna Morgan (Sadako's Mother) was originally pregnant by sea-devil, and intended to kill the babies by drowning them to the sea. And she has supernatural ability to see the future and some of her sights are captured by Samara (Sadako) and she "broadcasted" it. 3. Samara (Sadako)'s father is the one who killed her and then kill himself. 4. Samara (Sadako) survived for 30 years in the well, trying to escape by climbing up but she never made it. Her anger affected the village nearby by broadcasting her thoughts through the television. A local villager recorded the strange broadcast and then people started to see the cursed video tape. 5. With this story line, it is possible to make the prequel (Ringu 0, The Birth -- which is VERY scary --) the story of the birth of Sadako, and the sequel (Ringu 2) the death of Sadako.So.. get the original version and start to watch..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you are looking for a good scare...ignore this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie should have ended about 15 minutes before it actually did. Then I'd be able to say it was a decent attempt at a horror movie. But the way it is, it sucked. I understood it all, and granted it had a good concept, but scary? No...not at all. Not nearly as scary as people made it out to be. The acting was horrible. I will give props to the first death scene though with Amber Tamblyn. The beginning of the movie made me think I would like it, but the farther it went, the more I disliked it. If you are a mediocore horror movie fan, see it, and be scared. But if you like your horror movies scary, then I would pass on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw the movie in a sneak preview yesterday. I haven't heard anything about it before, so I didn't know what to expect. During the first scenes I thought 'Oh, ok, yet another Scream rip-off', but, man, how was I wrong! When the credits rolled and I got up from my seat, I noticed that I was shivering. I was scared beyond belief. Ring is a must-see for horror movie aficionados.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I went into total paranoia for a few weeks after viewing The Ring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had received sneak passes to see The Ring early. I was expecting a film with some eerie elements, like The Sixth Sense or The Others. I wasn't expecting something that would send me deep into the dark tunnels of my own paranoia and leave me locked in it for a few weeks. I will kid you not. I am a person that doesn't get scared easily and The Ring shook and crumbled the very foundation. Gore Verbinski takes the basis of Ringu, the original Japanese version, and mixes in his own little twists to create the most frightening movie of 2002.SPOILERSThere were two scenes that scared me the absolute most.A) The first being when Ruth tells Rachel about how Katie's face looked when they found her body and they do that quick flash of Katie's body falling out of the closet with that disturbing look of shock embedded in her face. What made that scene so eerie, besides the make-up, was the sound effects used and the fact that you weren't expecting it to happen at all.B) Whoever says that the scene with Samara coming out of the well and the TV in the end wasn't scary is probably lying because they refuse to admit it. That was the scene that sent me into paranoia because I have a TV in my room that's right in front of my bed. Imagine how frightened I was when I was getting ready for bed and having to eye my TV the entire time. The way it's shot and the way Samara moves sends your nerves straight to Hell.END SPOILERSThe film also showcases an excellent cast, including Naomi Watts, fresh off her voyeuristic role in Mulholland Drive, Martin Henderson, Brian Cox, and Daveigh Chase, who takes her sweet roles of Donnie Darko's younger sister and the voice of Lilo and totally changes into Samara, the black-haired, dead-eyed girl with a mind of pure evil.Be warned: don't see The Ring alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story which doesn`t live out of its effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of great effects the movie builds up a tension which does not depend on effects or the spread of blood. There should be more movies like that with such a plot and creativity. That`s what makes this movie special. The reason for that may also be because the original was made in 1914 when special effects were not as available as they are nowadays. I'm fed up with Hollywood-bulls**t and was very impressed to see something positive coming out of this machinery for making dumb people even more dumb. This movie represents everything what I expect from a horror. It gives you the creeps in every single scene. Great!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I saw The Ring twice in the past week, hoping that the second time would change my opinion of it. If you haven't seen it yet, and would like to pay money to be disappointed, stop reading here to avoid the ***SPOILERS***Unfortunately The Ring tried to give a complex plot to a dull shock movie. It certainly made me think, but the more I thought about it, the more questions arose:1)The end reaveals that Samara comes to kill her victims through the TV 7 days after watching the tape, but how did she kill the two teenagers who were driving in the car?2)It is established throughout the movie that Samara never sleeps, but Aidan tells us that "the horses keep her up at night." Since she never sleeps, this wouldn't be a problem.3)When Aidan watched the tape, the end shows Samara's arm coming over the top of the well. This is not on the original tape, as this is the beginning of Samara's appearance when she comes to kill her victims.4)The end of the movie implies that copying the tape (and showing it to someone else) saves you from death on the 7th day. Rachel had already made a copy and Aidan had seen it by the time she and Noah are in the cabin. But the TV turns on and the water appears, signaling Samara's appearance, which should not happen if copying was actually the immunity from the certain death.I know there were other points that bothered me in this movie, but I have tried to put them out of my mind, and have included the biggest ones here. For a horror movie, I enjoyed the shock scenes and overthetop settings, but the plot too obviously paves the way for a sequel... The End? (sigh)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FREAKY!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>********************WARNING!!!! SPOILERS!!!***************************I really hadn't heard that much hype about "The Ring". It was Thursday night, a three-day weekend, and I didn't think twice about going to see a scary movie (I do not fare well with horror flicks)-- I just wanted to have a good time. Wish I knew what I was getting myself into...The movie, at first glance, seems a bit corny-- the girls talking about the video tape seems a bit abrupt and urban-legendish. However, the movie got creepy when the TV kept turning on by itself...and I can't even describe how freaked out I got when they showed Katie's corpse. Whoever did that model is a genius-- I don't think I've ever seen a more disturbing image in my life!! I was really tempted to get up and walk out of the movie theatre right then and there, but the movie sucked me in, and I decided to stick it out.Well, the movie got scarier-- the plot is absorbing, the cinemetography was outstanding, and the acting was more than believable-- especially the little boy. His eyes were really freaky when he was imploring his mother, "You weren't supposed to help her!" And who would believe that Samara was the same girl who did the voice of Lilo from "Lilo and Stitch"?! The great thing about the movie was that it didn't spell out the plot for the audience-- the writer of the screenplay obviously thought a bit higher of the IQ's of the viewers, and certain aspects left to the imagination are much much creepier than spoonfeeding the plot to the audience. And the other thing that sets this apart from other creepy flicks is that the plot doesn't end with the usual "the-ghost-was-an-innocent-child-whose-murder-was-uncovered-and-whose-undisc overed-corpse-was-put-to-rest-so-now-everyone's-happy" note that most ghost stories end with. Samara was purely evil, and while the movie doesn't explain why, the fact that she just won't quit even when the movie ends was enough to freak me out. *shudder* I'm never having kids.And of course, I must comment on the creepiest scene in the movie-- initially, throughout the movie, people (mostly middle school girls scattered throughout the theatre) would let out a scream or two at the scary parts (i.e. the centipede, and the corpse in the closet). However, when Samara starts walking toward the screen and out of the TV, they were screaming NONSTOP. That is probably the most memorable scene in any horror flick, next to the head-revolving scene from "The Exorcist". People were literally trying to crawl back in their seats.Like I mentioned before, I don't fare well with horror flicks, and I spent most of the time hiding behind my coat through this one. But let me tell you, if you're going for an actual SCARY movie, not just a slasher that will make you sick to your stomach, then I highly recommend this one. The plot will make you think, the cinemotography is great-- and I really can't think of anything wrong with it. I give it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

Each thrilling scene hits you like a punch in the face. I really do not like '16' label on the boxes but I really think this movie shall not be seen below 16 , alone at a dark night or if you have any heart problems . The mystery facts are shot well and makes you forget the time while you are watching the movie. The cast is not consist of well known actors/actresses but the performance was great. This movie is a must to see for thriller/mystery fans and is really a must for archives. I enjoyed watching it and still in shock because I didn't think it would pass average and also I don't think that I will be watching it alone at home although it will be 2nd time. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Suspensful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When my husband (20) and I (18) went to see The Ring, we were expecting a lot less than we got. The entire time that the movie is showing, I looked around the theatre and saw young couples clutching each other. Mainly the boys holding the girls. To my dismay, I was the one holding my husband! He said that he would never watch it again. The music was what got to him. In most horror flicks, the music leads up to a scary scene. This movie didn't do this and that was the best part. You couldn't expect anything to happen. My husband claims not to see it again not because it was bad, but because it was too scary for him. I, on the contrary, have seen it 3 times in the theatres and am planning on buying it once it comes out. If you enjoy suspensful, edge of your seat movies, I would strongly suggest watching this movie. It's one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. Love, Brosiaboo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll give this movie its credit. It's probably the best horror movie of 2002, and certainly beats out "Darkness Falls" and "They" of 2003. (Those movies looks unbelievably stupid...and I have no will to see them.)"The Ring," on the other hand, is another story. It's basically about a videotape that people watch, and seven days later they (mysteriously) die. A phone call after they watch the video warns them about this. After the mysterious death of her niece, Rachel (Naomi Watts) watches the tape, gets the call...but decides she won't put up with it. She's determined to stop her death and figure out the damned video tape. What she experiences is a deep, twisted story of the Morgan family, and their little girl Samara (played eerily by Daveigh Chase, the voice of Lilo!).Spoilers!The movie has a genuinely creepy atmosphere. The videotape itself brought me to chills. It's a very disturbing tape, and the little Samara that supposedly created it with her mind, is even more disturbing. Every part is played well, though Naomi Watts's character did not much more than investigate and gasp every once in a while.The special effects are good as well. When they show Rachel's niece dead in the bathroom, it looks so gruesome that I jumped. (I'm not one for jumping, either.) And when Samara comes out of the TV...well, I was impressed with the special effects, but mostly creeped out. It was so freaky. The girls sitting behind me in the theater screamed. It wasn't THAT scary...but it was pretty scary.Ironically enough though, after people watch the video tape, three days later they get a nosebleed, signaling them that their death was coming. I actually got a nosebleed on the third day after seeing the movie--no kidding. And I was freaked out enough by this film to check for handprint-burns on my arm the next coming days. (People who've seen the movie know why I'd expect that.) So, I was scared.I didn't die, obviously. :)All in all, this movie was a well-made, well-carried-out horror film, with genuinely eerie moments and atmospheres. The acting is great, the special effects are great...and the movie itself is great. Most likely, you'll want to check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not nearly as scary as everyone made it sound. My friend had me believing it was so scary that while i was waiting for it to start I was wondering if I should have decided to see Die Another Day instead. Well, I'm glad I saw it for only $4 w/ unlimited soda and popcorn, but I won't be seeing it again. Short summary: If you happen to watch this videotape, you'll die in 7 days. After her niece's mysterious death, Rachel finds the tape and watches it. She decides to figure out who made the tape and why, and how to possibly avoid death, before her time is up.To me, there are different horror categories. First there are the realistic and the unrealistic. Realistic are the ones with human serial killers or ghosts. In the unrealistic, the "killers" may be some kind of robots, aliens, or in the case of The Ring, a videotape. I like watching both types, but the realistic kinds scare me more because I walk out knowing something like that could really happen, or have happened. There are 3 other groups to divide horror movies. There's the scary ones(like Scream), the creepy/spooky ones(like The Others), and the sad/freaky ones(like The Ring). This movie will probably scare some people, but not me. I usually get scared at movies that have a lot of suspense and moments that make me jump. This movie was suspenseful, but there was no moments to jump. And I don't understand why people would scream. It really is more of a mystery type movie than a horror movie. And even though I gave this a 6/10, if you like horror movies you should watch it anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why those complaints?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't get the problem that some of the critics have with this movie. "The Ring" is, for starters, NOT a bad copy of the Sixth Sense. Of course it has a few similarities (a little boy that could see a dead girl), but it still was a story of its own (the movie wasn't about the boy, it was about the tape). So the story was great and original, in my opinion.I thought about another title for it "The Tape", but then I realized that naming it "The Ring" gave the viewer, next to all the other mysteries in this movie, another mystery to think about (I think it's a great title).The final product had some flaws in the direction, for example the fact that some of the effects (I can not agree with critics who say 'all') were not as unexpected as they should be; like the part where the woman found the dead guy in his chair. There were indeed a lot of times I jumped up, and the way it was directed even made me jump up although I knew in advance that something was going to happen.Another great aspect about this movie is that I sometimes thought that the movie was over (because everything seemed to be finished). But then I checked the time and it still had to go for some time, and even I (for a script-writer) had absolutely no idea in what way they could possibly make the movie go on and still keep it entertaining, but they did (and not just a repeat of earlier happenings, but entirely new unexpected ones). And of course the end is great; a closed but open ending at the same time. You don't see that a lot.About the acting... I'm usually quite soon irritated by bad 'unbelievable' actors or acting, it doesn't matter how great the story is, then. The fact that I wasn't irritated this time during the watching, made me consider that the acting wasn't that bad. Important questions like 'Why was the main character not killed while everyone else is' were answered (which made the story complete), and questions that sound important, but could stay unexplained, were kept a mystery.Finally, the greatest thing I like about this movie is that it is great in its essence and simplicity. Simple images and weird sounds (especially later on when the images of 'the tape' were repeated) brought the tension, even without scary music; a thing that a lot of horror movies need. It also didn't show that much blood like movies as 'Nightmare on Elmstreet', and it didn't need that. The simplicity was there from the story itself (for example the simple fact that just watching a videotape could kill you; how do you make up something like that?!) till the eventually product; the movie.So in short, "The Ring" is a great movie and people who disliked it, should see it again with an open mind; I guess they had other things on their mind at the time watching (or they prejudged it before watching), to be able to just let themselves get sucked into the story. But I do agree with everyone who claims this movie should not have a sequel. That would ruin the entire uniqueness of this movie and would destroy the great thing about the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This made 100 million at the box office? WHY!?!?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a pretty bad horror movie. With what everyone was saying I was expecting something completely different but this was awful. The writing was bad the technical aspects for the most parts were pretty awful but the one interesting part of the movie was the fascinating plot. I will admit the story was a very good one, for a horror movie that is, but the execution of a potentially good story was uncannily bad.The writing was awful, the acting was wooden and I only jumped on a few occasions but was hardly ever scarred. Some of the movie was a pointless comedy, some was a pointless love story, and somewhere in there they tried to scare you, they didn't succeed at it but they tried. The story is about a tape that kills people, well something does surrounding the tape anyway.The movie might have been good had it not been for the terrible acting and the general lack of a good pedigree. The movie was extremely low budget and you could tell. Naomi Watts is a terrible actress I swear she actually becomes a worse actress as the movie goes on. I will admit this silly little film did actually hold my attention but after awhile I was looking at my watch.The creepy scenery and background to me really take away from the film. You expect so much more in the area of thrills and scares but you get almost nothing. It is sad really I was expecting many more thrills after a creepy beginning. But a lot of people actually liked the movie I guess this is a throwback to the extremely low budget horror films of the 1980's. But this did a killing at the box-office.The trick to any movie that attempts to scare you is this: you are not supposed to expect the next thrill, but here I expected something to happen almost every time. I saw the next scary moment when it was going to happen. This is a below average movie that will have some minor entertainment value to some but not all. All I will say is proceed at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "The Ring" last night. It's been a long time since I saw something so utterly horrifying. I enjoyed the movie to the last minute. There are no demons or goblins, no gore, no loud, ear-splitting noises, and no aliens either. Yet this movie manages to rivet your attention, holds you spell-bound till you feel the chill in your veins.Any good horror movie should leave some of the details to be figured out by the viewers. This move does.I like horror movies, and this must rank all the way up there with "The Exorcist". The cinematography is excellent. The aerial views of Rachel's car speeding along the lonely road are breathtakingly beautiful. The whole movie has cyan tinge to it, and the images are haunting. The director has not spent much time on irrelevant details, and must be congratulated for it.I'd give this movie an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love horror movies, don't get me wrong. But I like them in the way that I like disco music and the 80's in general. Too fun to take too seriously. This was a good movie, and I'm not ashamed to admit, gave me the heebie-jeebies.The biggest thing about the movie I liked, which, oddly enough, is what more people seemed to complain about, is the fact it doesn't hold your hand by going too far with exposition. You have to figure out what's going on yourself. The average movie-goes expects explanations, reasons, and absolute closure spoon-fed. I hate that. Don't insult my intelligence.The imagery is great. Absolutely wonderful, and oh so condusive to the tense atmosphere throughout. Images and scenes in this film are disturbing, without the need to dwell on unnecessary gore and violence.The sound does nothing to calm your nerves. I normally would not comment on the sound, except for that the last bit...oh, excuse me...=====SPOILER=========&gt; ...There. The last bit, when Samara came through the TV, where most filmmakers would have put in a loud orchestra hit or other sudden noise, The Ring has an odd metallic chord that grows louder, not to say "Boo!" and then let your nerves calm, but to say "Heeeeeeeeey...this is creepy."Though I love horror movies, I would never say I've seen a good one. This was wonderful. Perhaps I'm fortunate in that I don't watch TV, so never even heard of the movie. I was bored, went to the theater, and hadn't seen that one. I was wowed.I can't imagine the need for sequels, as the only unanswered question, really, is "What happens next?" and not knowing forces you to imagine. Just like a lot of good books, you think of what happens next in your own imagination, and I can't imagine a sequel doing justice to that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scariest I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew that this movie would be scary the moment I walked in. Maybe it was the TV spots saying this was the scariest movie since the Exorcist. Or the fact that everyone and their mothers was saying that this was scary. But after I saw this movie, I had trouble sleeping that night, and it takes a LOT to scare me. This movie scared me, and caused my girlfriend to sleep in her parents' room that night.This movie doesn't waste any time in scaring the living crap out of the audience. In the beginning, the film builds up to a climax when the phone rings, because we think someone hostile is on the phone and something will happen, but its just the girl's mom. All that tension built up to nothing. Then, all of a sudden, some of the freakiest things ever captured on film happen.The way this movie works is that this process is repeated so that the rest of the movie, the viewer is a nervous wreck. The film also surprises. The scene with the body in the closet that I still can't get out of my head. It was totally unexpected, and I nearly had a heart attack because of it.Our imaginations get the better of us, and that is how this movie works. We imagine all these horrible things that are about to happen, and then they don't. But when we let our guard down, the horrible things we were thinking about happen. And it all culminates in the final scene. And that final scene is something so scary, that I didn't know things like that were possible.I haven't seen The Exorcist, except on TV, but if it is scarier, then there must be some REALLY tripped out crap in that. This movie is definetly a must see.9/10(Don't let the PG-13 rating fool you. This movie is NOT for young kids.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen the original so I can't comment on that and whether or not this was a good remake and honestly I don't really care about that. What I can tell you is this movie is wonderful...it is a very good story along with great acting...I heard they were making a sequel or prequel about Samara's life beforehand or something like that...which is cool..but I hope they don't butcher it like Blair Witch 2 (which wasn't real bad..I have seen worse..just if you got a hit on your hands don't screw up the sequel). The scariest movie in 2002 is what I give it and hopefully they will get nominated and/or win awards for this cause it was great!! If you beg to differ then remember we have opinions don't try to force reason and whatever on me it is entertainment it is called a movie...it is not real...get over it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a VERY good movie indeed ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing it, i happened to read some reviews about it describing it not very promising. After seeing the first time i was impressed ... in a good way really ... of course, one could endlessly argue over minor details there and here. But all the atmosphere created there (blue-greenish filter all over), small details and lots of left open ends with little unexpected twist in the end, ... ahhh ... mmmm ...Also had the opportunity to see the japanese version of it ... I have always wondered, what do these people see so scary in godzilla ... so naive and childish ...And today, I just tumbled over imdb and just out of interest reading the reviews about both films ... and i really do not understand - does it always have to be SO EXPLAINED with everything? Why one can't THINK and fill in the gaps himself? I take it as good thing when i can brew the movie i saw, another couple of days inside my heard and play with what-if's. The Ring does it pretty well - all these flashbacks and dead ends in it, these really create very paranoid feeling of terror of unknown source or direction ... And the ending was also quite nice - all that trouble and this scary little bugger is still loose :o))) i like that! The fact that our mother here was not some lame hero saving the world, but intentionally sacrificing someone for her son to live ... so mean and evil! :o)))Best horror movie of 2002 definitely!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is very creepy indeed. What I liked about it is the cinematography, the acting, the lighting and the direction. The frights are less "noiser" than the IN YOUR FACE kind of scares that most movie makers love nowadays. There's a lot of suspense in it. And there's one really CREEPY scene in the ending with Noah in his....I don't know shop. Just watch it! My only complaint is that there are FAR TOO MANY HOLES IN THE PLOT. But I guess it's intentional since rumor has it the makers want to film a sequel. I hope they do. And I hope they make it a better one. A sequel to a remake? I dont know. But either way, I recommend this movie to horror aficionados.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every frame of this movie is worth framing. I can't remember when I've seen a movie more thouroughly steeped in creepy atmosphere, brooding cinematography, and spooky music, and all for naught.Every movie needs a plot. This film commits the cardinal crime of thinking that artistic merit will somehow overshadow its lack of dialogue, continuity and overall sense. "If you make it pretty enough, they will come."**spoiler** You've already seen every scene in this movie if you are a fan of Six Feet Under, The Sixth Sense, and assorted MTV videos. My advice; turn on the movie, turn off the sound, and put on your favorite album. It makes an excellent music video.0/4 *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have scored this movie higher, but since it is a remake of the japanese film Ringu (http://www.imdb.com/Title?0178868) it loses a lot of points. Let me get into details:Firstly, the plot. It is very interesting and it immerses you into the movie - I thought it was a quite clever trick, but since this is a remake, the trick is not clever any more. I have not seen the remake by itself, but I think the film does leave a lot of unanswered questions, that if they had been answered they would remove nothing from the film's atmosphere and they would have helped the audience understand something more about the relationships between the various people that only appear shortly. It is good to keep the parents and the daughter mysterious, but the few cryptic sentences they utter do not explain anything nor do they give them much character. I think the best approach would have been to have one of the locals that is already giving away some information to explain a bit more.I have not seen the original, but perhaps a nice idea would be for the actors to already have known that circulating the tape to two other people (or copying it, or whatever) would save their own lives. This would force them to make, erm... interesting choices.But the best part of the film has to be the cinematography. It is amazing, the scenes are beautiful, breathtaking and the video itself is disturbing enough to be believable.In general the film is well-paced; the acting is believable, the characterization does not exactly fit; part of the plot that should be explained is not, there are some inconsistencies regarding the first and last victims of the 'horror'; the music is OK; some SFX are overused, but the sound is crisp and clean; there are some very well done, quite disturbing scenes; and maybe you should watch the original instead, unless you generally prefer hollywood-ized versions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really didn't know what to expect when I went to see this film. I had been told that it was worth seeing, but nothing more. The two main reasons behind me wanting to see the movie were :1) It was around Halloween &amp; I wanted to see a scary movie 2) I had seen Mulholland Dr. and really liked Naomi Watts' performanceWith that in mind, I expected the film to be decent.But the film was much more than decent. It was downright creepy. Very creepy. It's important to understand the difference between "scary" and "creepy". Scary can be accomplished in a matter of seconds (someone jumping out from behind a wall with a knife). Creepy is something that takes a while to accomplish in a film. It takes a long time on the part of the director. It requires more attention and time on the part of the viewer. This film managed to accomplish creepy very well. It reminded me of the older generation of horror films, which managed to grab you in a way that was very psychological ("The Omen", "Rosemary's Baby", and of course "The Exorcist"). Those types of horror are the ones that always stick with me. They are the ones that endure. They are the ones that I inevitably have to watch for at least a little bit when I pass them on late night cable even though I have seen them countless times.creepy filmvery well madeone of the best films of 2002</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is without doubt the scariest horror i've seen in recent years, Sixth Sense, The Exorcist, Shining and anything else dont even come close. What I liked best about this film was the fact that it managed to maintain the fear factor right throughout the entire film, unlike other chillers such as Sixth Sense or Jeepers Creepers which were scary for forty minutes before losing themselves in the latter parts. This film is scary right up to the end!The main reason I felt compelled to write however concerns the Ring, Ringu debate. To those who dont know The Ring is actually a remake of a Japanese film Ringu which came out in 1998. The general consensus on here seems to be that the original is much scarier and darker, a view to which I cannot subscribe. I watched Ringu first, about 3 months ago and although I found the story inriguing it wasnt really scary at all until right up to the end,(which was shocking I must admit!). The original Japanese version, obviously made on a low budget had a made for tv feel about it, and the acting wasnt really that good either. I cant honestly belive how anyone watching the two films could say the original is scarier, it just so isnt! Anyway one thing the original did do better however was to flesh out the story. I wont spoil either film by saying what happens but in the original the history of the girl is much better and explains things more. I would recommend watching both films as they both offer something different from the usual teen slasher horrors we seem to get all the time nowadays. The only similar film I can think of is FearDotCom which by the way was terrible, so I would recommend this or the original Ringu to anyone wanting an original, scary horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring - USA - 2002 - Possible Spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I watched The Ring. An extreme disappointment.This film was just never able to envelope you in the way that Hideo Nakata's original could. I never developed any attachment to the characters, and I was never afraid at any point in the film. It was a big mistake to try and Americanize a story that is based upon Japanese myth, legend, and some fact. The "horse" avenue ended in a dead end and it was just stupid to include it ( this is of course a result of trying to put an American spin on a Japanese story ).It lacks the focus, imagination and the "chill" of the original. Even the flash scenes of the victims were a disappointment. The only things I liked about the film were a couple of subtle things that help to further clarify the original story. The reference to there being no "signature time track" on the tape, and the meaning of the 7 day period between watching and dying ( the number of days she survived in the well ).I consider this a misguided and botched attempt to improve on an original film, and the attempt ended in dismal failure.I suggest that if he wants to improve on the original, he should use his money and influence to try and arrange to have the original Japanese Ring dubbed in English, digitally enhanced, and made available on a special edition DVD with region1 encoding in wide screen.This is the only way that the original will be improved upon, and he could have done this for a hell of a lot less money than he spent in screwing up the original. Well, I've said my piece....and I'm sticking by it !!! Later !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PLEASE WATCH THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE VERSION !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I urge anyone who liked this movie ( or found it disappointing ) to PLEASE WATCH THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE VERSION because simply, this remake is not half as scary as the original. Don't get me wrong; I have nothing against the remake, I think it was decently done; but as a someone who appreciates good scare movies I think I should at least let the liked minded know if there's a better one out there - and there is.There are many reasons, technically and in the storyline itself that makes the original stand out. *possible spoilers ahead* Firstly, the music and sound effects were absolutely chilling - written by Kenji Kawai ( who wrote the music for Ghost in the Shell and Patlabor series It was also very Japanese in flavour, which complemented very well with the other Japanese motifs that appeared on and off the movie ( ie, the japanese character Sadako inscribed on her eye, etc ). Secondly, the remake removes important plotlines from the original that strengthens the original story. For example, Sadako's mother ( and later herself ) were born with telekinetic/pyschic powers, which aptly explains why Sadako, even in her afterlife, continue to have devastating powers of curse ( in the form of the tape ). Also, the japanese versions of Noah and Aidan were also psychic, which explains why Aidan was able to communicate well with Sadako. In the original movie, Nanako ( Naomi's character ) becomes increasely desperate and worried for her son with each passing day to the coming of her death, ( in the final moments her love for her son puts her courage and strength to test ) but we see no such worry nor sense of urgency in the remake. Thirdly, THE ORIGNAL JAPANESE FOOTAGE OF THE TAPE SCARES LIKE S***. NO JOKE. There's a lot more I could go on about, but it'd be hard to explain unless you've seen both and did the comparison yourself.So again, if you liked this movie or think you're the kind that can't be scared, get the Japanese version, sit up alone at night, and challenge yourself. You wouldn't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually ended up seeing "The Ring" when the movie we originally went to see, "8 Crazy Nights", wasn't what we expected. The "we" included myself and my two oldest children, ages 13 and 11. I figured it was a PG-13 flick so what the heck. Not long into this thriller, I realized it may not be appropriate for them (or me, I scare easily). But the kids were entranced and it was an early show on New Year's Eve so we stuck it out. With the subplots and the all-around fantastic acting, I would give this movie a very high rating. The ending left you hanging, as do most movies in this category. And parents, be warned ... scenes from this movie (like the mother's memory of the daughter in the closet and the here she comes out of the TV scene) rival that of Linda Blair's spinaroo in "The Exorcist".</fullReview>

I have not been this frightened by a horror movie since I watched my first Friday 13th movie when I as seven years old. The fact that this movie can produce the same level of horror in me fourteen years later is truly remarkable. I've seen my share of horror movies in my day and there is no other movie that even comes close to freaking me out as much as "The Ring" did. Some people said Signs was scary, but compared to the Ring, Signs is as about as scary as Disney's Beauty and the Beast. One person wrote in his review that this movie is definitely not for children, unless you want to seriously screw up their minds for a couple days. I completely agree with that. YES, IT REALLY IS THAT SCARY, and that's exactly why horror fans everywhere are going to love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, this remake is nowhere near as good as the real, japanese, movie. The people who made it apparently never even realised why it was called 'Ring' (or 'Ringu'). It does not have anything to do with the apparent well that is in the movie, it has to do spreading a video tape around, which is almost completely left out of this horrible remake.People die of heart-attacks and look like zombies, and noone suspects that anything is wrong. I hope doctors in the US are not that stupid.If you want to see this movie; don't. See the japanese original instead. Then, when you've seen that, see Ringu 2, and after that Ringu 0. After that you can watch The Ring if you really feel that you have to, but it will only look like a worthless remake, almost as bad as the korean remake 'Ring Virus'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood does it again; botches another remake. Well, almost. If you don't know it already, this is a remake of the Japanese movie Ringu from 1998. And a pointless remake at that. Sure, the effects are better, but that's to be expected as they probably had ten times the budget.The story is simple, yet intriguing. A couple of teenagers have died. Separately, but all at the same day, and at the exact same time. Rachel Keller starts investigating the events and finds out that they had all been in a cabin watching a videotape seven days earlier, and as rumour has it; everyone that watches that tape, dies seven days later.My recommendation is to see the original, Ringu. As least start with that one and watch this afterwards, if you must. I saw Ringu about 2 months ago, and in my opinion it was darker, scarier, and made me think more. The remake does the classic Hollywood thing; they explain too much as if we, the audience, as incapable of independent thought. I like a movie that makes me think, and leaves me wondering a bit. That's always a good reason to see a movie for a second, or third time.But, honestly, I can't be sure what I would have thought if I had seen The Ring before Ringu.Anyway, if you don't have some strange phobia about seeing subtitled movies, try to get hold of Ringu, Ringu 2 and the prequel Ringu 0: Baasudei (Birthday). I gave this movie 5/10, and Ringu 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Evil!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi there! to all of you lovers of the genre, i must say this film is exactly what you were looking for long! the plot's great i must say i've seen the movie twice and still scared me like the first time. Anyway the film's kind of dark, don't expect to leave it in the theatre it goes home with you for a while!ja,ja.(not joking). It is really intense! ** Spoilers ahead ** it starts with this girl who dies after seen a strange videotape with rough images and a doomed call the minute after seeing it!! There's where reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) starts investigating the strange death, she founds the tape and right after she sees it the phone rang and behind the misterious call a voice of a child saying "seven days" wich is the time of life she have left after seeing this tape. So then Rachel must hurry to find out what's it all about along with Noah (Martin Henderson) who also sees the tape a day after Rachel. The mistery clears up little by little and nothing's what it seems believe me, there's even a time when you think its ending hollywood style, but the really scary stuff is yet comming!! I must say i liked the film it's very original, but pay much attention because the plot doesn't give everything directly away, some people whom had seen it stays with plot holes, may be 'cause of the state of fright they're in the moment. I liked the performance of Naomi Watts wich i liked since David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. and the young David Dorfman who plays Rachel's son Aidan. Go see this film you wont regret it!! i give The Ring *** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why people are so enthralled with this movie, it isn't that good. Before watching it, people told me how there were deeper meanings, it was about rings and circles and all sorts of gibberish. Nope, it's not that complex...-====Spoilers====-The movie is about a demonic child that is mysteriously adopted by a couple that raise horses. It is implied that perhaps they made a pact with the devil. The little girl makes everyone's life a living hell, especially her mothers, finally driving her mother to throw the little girl down a well and seal her in, leaving her to die. The little demonic girl exacts her revenge by leaving 'haunted' images on a video tape, anyone watching the tape will die 7 days later, presumably because that is how long the girl lived inside the well. Naturally there is a way to save yourself, but I won't tell how. The ending is way too long and you are left watching the clock wondering how much longer this movie is going to drag on.The movie overall isn't bad and I think it is the general lack of quality horror movies that makes people believe this one is so good. It is worth watching, just don't take it too seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly hate it when I have to stay in the long line when I'm seeing a movie! When I watched the Ring, In the beginning, this man would not shut up because he was showing his **** talent! However, it was a great movie! Man, I can not wait until this movie comes out on DVD &amp; VHS. When it comes out, I'm buying it,&amp; pre-ordering my copy of the the ring, because people would NOT Shut their mouths! Maybe I should not go to theaters at NIGHT! Maybe I'll go in the afternoon! But It wasnt my fault that it was sold out. Or Maybe Its best for me to wait until The Ring comes out at the $$ Theater, It rarely never solds out! Grade for the ring:9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tolerable movie, bad ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The major problem with the movie (other than the ending) was a lack of focus. It wandered all over the place, picking up and dropping subplots without resolving them (particularly in relation to the Morgans). Events occurred inexplicably, only to be forgotten thirty seconds later.The movie's central conceit never made sense - not even in the weird way nightmares make sense. The final ending (as opposed to the first two endings) felt tacked onto the film for shock value; it was disconnected from the rest of the movie and a pointless violation of audience expectation.Had they stopped at the first ending, it would have been an acceptable Halloween movie. As it is, it's a mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching both versions,the original and the USA remake,all i can say is that both are very overrated,im not saying they were bad movies but just to overrated,especially the USA version. Maybe the reason of this could be that,comparing to the other "horror" films of hollywood from the past years,like Hallowen Resurrection,Jason X,Scream,etc,almost anythyng else could be scarier,even seeing a fly pass by,and so the audiences think the Ring is so good just because is not another slasher-teen crap.The film creates a good atmosphere,but trows a lot of irrelevant plot events that made a lot of confussion,and the "scary" moments come more from cheap editing tricks,in a very hollywood style,when they are going to understand that especial effects dont make a movie good?I didnt like the ending,and the ending of both versions are similar,but in the USA version,because of all the unnecesary elements they put it in(horses,bugs,nosebleeding,puting the son of Rachel in a six-sense context,etc) the ending seems more weak that in the japanese version.Also,the face of Samara doesnt scare at all,meanwhile the face of Sadako its complettly more frigthening,and when she crawl out of the TV is more convincing too. Overall,The Ring is not a bad film as its own,but saying that is one of the most spooky movies of the last years,again,just because the other USA horror films from the last years(Scream,Blair Witch,etc) sucks a lot that doesnt neccesarilly make this one the "best" of all,just a little more good from the average,thats all.At first,i gave it 2 stars of 4,but now i really aprecciatte a lil more this version,and after seeing that the Japanese version is not worthy of all the hype(but also not a bad film),i will give it 2 1/2 stars to the USA version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrill ride, not a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people seem to be bashing "The Ring" for its seemingly nonsensical, absurd plot.These are the folks who tried to make sense out of a movie that aspires to be little more than a fun suspense experience and little else.Not that there's anything WRONG with that. For every "Citizen Kane", there must also be a "Charlie Chan", so I'd have to say that apples need to stop being put up to oranges."The Ring" leans very heavily on suspension of disbelief. Yes, the premise is wacky. Yes, there's no rational, empirical reason for some of the events that transpire within it. If there were, it would take longer and probably be laughable. The point is that what is happening on the screen is happening whether you like it or not, so play along and see where it goes. After all, when we sit down to watch "Lord of the Rings", do we complain endlessly that orcs, elves and dwarves don't really exist? When we watch "Silence of the Lambs", do we debate in circles for hours how fast it would take Lecter to skin a man's face off that convincingly?Enjoy the ride while it lasts. Not everything has a grand and glorious deep meaning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*spoilers ahead*I had heard that this movie was scary, and it did freak me out at some bits especially with the creepy music and really fast moving scenes. However after watching it I found myself confused because some of the things didn't make sense.1) After her body was discovered, why couldn't her soul rest?2) If Naomi Watts saw the original, why did Martin Henderson when he saw the exact same thing? I mean so what if you made a copy of the tape, she should have thought of that if she wanted to save him as well3) How the hell would you explain that to her sister, since she wanted to know how her daughter died?It definitely had scare factors in it, probably won't be able to sleep tonight but I think it should have ended with the soul finally able to rest</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie scared the bejeezus out of me.The one point I'll grant is that Blair Witch kinda wigged me a little too, and about 50% of America, it seems, hated that flick. So I don't know where everyone else comes down on the U.S. remake of "The Ring." But, ahem, it scared the bejeezus out of ME.Gore Verbinski is just the Man. "The Mexican" was well-paced and clever (I don't care what you say; the character, tone and script were well-thought out and original, which America abhors next to, say, anything with J.Lo. in it). "Mouse Hunt" was cute, original and visually interesting, for a kids film (which the Harry Potter films were not, history will prove me right). This one, just, wow. The imagery, the pacing, the way he respects silence, the tone, the filmmakers have always got one more surprise in their back pocket, right up until the credits roll...The whole opening scene does it. "AH! She's closing the fridge, is their something behind the door?!" to "WHY is the camera framing the stairs as she walks up them, what are THEY gonna do..?!"Drove me crazy. Had me wound up tighter than a Network Exec during sweeps week. And it will be SO much scarier on video. In fact, I refuse to watch it on video. The phone might ring.The one weak point is Brian Cox. Great character actor, but he's also the most famous face in this film, so I don't buy him for a second as the guy he's supposed to be playing. So the scenes he's in are ruined; the film is not.I shudder to think how the original could be scarier... just to be safe, though, I think I won't watch it. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy stuff!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring is one of a few horror/suspense films that were both wonderfully crafted and genuinely creepy. The acting is very good and the direction (from Gore Verbinski who I was not impressed with since he did The Mexican) is also top notch. I recommend this film to those who can handle stuff like this, definitely not to everyone. I am suprised and quite shocked that The Ring was given a PG-13 rating in the US, I live in Australia and the rating here was MA - only for people 15 years and over unless accompanied by a parent or adult guardian. Some of the scenes in this are graphic and the rest is just plain freaky, with my only criticism being the ending. I won't give anything away of course but I thought it could've finished a few scenes earlier, it just seemed to go on and on. Despite the time issue, the concept of the ending is brilliant - alot of people have commented on how bad the ending is, but I think it's one of the best endings to a thriller I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the handful of reviews i've read so far on here emphasise the suspense "The Ring" creates. i was packing myself every second (and now i can't go to bed). i just wanted to comment on the previous reviewer.*spoilers ahead*The reason why Rachel didn't die was because she kept Samara's "message" going - by making a copy of the tape. at the end, there was the very fast montage which explained this. that's why she made Aiden make a copy, so that he wouldn't die. so, to keep Samara's message going, whoever watched the tape was to make a copy, and that way they wouldn't die. thankyou, that's all i wanted to say.</fullReview>

Not only that it shows a lot of creativity, and Naomi Watts' kid should get just as recognized as Haley Joel Osmond. What most horror movies this year have failed to do is to tell a story that's scary (unlike Jason X and Halloween Resurrection). And for once, special effects in horror movies have FINALLY paid off.

		<shortDescription>Scariest movie ever made! Go see it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring was a pure delight, and quite possibly the scariest filmI've ever seen before. I was totally gripped to my theatre seat forthe entire film, squirming and looking away at stages trying to pickwhere the next scare would come from.I've seen plenty of horror films in my time, but nothing like TheRing. It's just such a great idea. The film wonderfully holds yourfull attention throughout and takes you on a truly 'eerie' journey dueto some great acting, beautiful cinematography and awesomeeffects from Rick Baker.I can't believe some people are criticising some sections of theplot and even the ending (how could they possibly complain aboutthe ending, the best ending to a horror film EVER! I had shiversrunning up and down my spine). Some reviewers taking it tooseriously and are missing what The Ring is about, it's not meantto be Schindlers List....it's a horror film and what it sets out to do ....it does perfectly.You must not miss The Ring, ignore some of the minor negativereviews, focus on all the positive ones. And do yourself a favourwhen it comes out on DVD, pick a really rainy friday night and driveto your local video store and rent it out. Take it home and watch itwith all the lights out in your house, you'll thank me in the end. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly Horrifying (MINOR SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, my friends, is the scariest movie I have ever seen. From the moment it began, I could sense the tension. From that point on, it was a nerve-racking, plot-twisting, mind-bending experience. Even though it was a full theater, and I was surrounded by the "comfort" of my friends, I just about soiled my self at every single turn.This is how the movie begins: Two girls are sitting in a room, watching the TV. We hear of the videotape, a videotape that supposedly has its viewer dead in exactly seven days. One girl has seen it, and from there, strange things happen. And at exactly 10 PM, she's dead, exactly one week after she saw the tape.I have to say this movie works on tension. There are moments in which the tension is built to a maximum. The viewer is anticipating something, something terrible, and then, nothing. It also works on element of surprise, especially the scene with the girl in the closet (probably the freakiest dead body I've seen anywhere). In the end the movie is explained, we find out the mystery of the tape, and everyone lives happily ever after. Oh, how I wish that was the case. Oh sure, we find out about the tape, but there's no happy ending to this film. We find out just how the victims are killed in perhaps the SCARIEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN. What it is, you'll have to see for yourself. Here's a hint, it involves the TV.So, if you want to get away from phony slasher flicks(Valentine, Scream, Jason X), classic horror remakes (or re-FAKES, as I like to put it), or horror/comedies (or movies so stupidly violent, you're actually cheering for more blood and guts), then see this movie. It's the return of a lost art. That is a movie that will make your blood freeze.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was great. I am not much for horror movies but this one was MUCH different than the usual run of the mill Freddy-Jason slasher movies. BEWARE Spoilers below: Someone made a comment about the blurred photos and the horse having nothing to do with the plot. I disagree. The scenes with the horse were very important to the plot. The horse sensed the evil death "spell" that was cast upon Rachel after watching the video. I am not a horse expert but for whatever reason the horses sensed the evil. Remember that Samara cursed her mother the same way. Anna's(the mother) horses started going crazy and were dying/killing themselves. Remember that Anna eventually killed herself as well. It was reported a suicide in the newspaper articles Rachel found, but we now know she probably died the same way both Katie and Noah did. The blurred pictures happened only to those who were "cursed" from watching the video. It doesn't have any HIGHER meaning other than to show that it was one of the symptoms of watching the video. It was creepy nonetheless. The twisted faces of those that died were absolutely FREAKY. I love this movie and watching it a second time gave me more insight to what was really going on. I plan to buy the dvd and can't wait to see it again! Ciao</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the comments about "ignorant Americans". Very tasteful. So I went and downloaded the original Ringu (Japanese version). I mean, I could kinda see why people might think it's a scary movie, but it was really about as scary as Toy Story. Granted, there were no special effects, but there were no special anythings. The plot was worse, the suspense wasn't there. I did think that the American version of the Ring was one of the truly scary movies out there. Horrifying AND suspenseful, and not the traditional "American" ending. Very good movie. But if you must, you can compare it to the Japanese version. But i think you'll find my comparison pretty accurate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the VIEWERS have seen the copy of Samara's video</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm surprised to see that no one has picked up the not-so-subtle meaning of the last scene of the movie where the copy is being made. Rachel's son asks her what would happen to the people who saw the copy, and she it's obvious what she thinks will happen. Then, the white noise on the screen in front of them immediately fills the full frame of the movie, getting louder, and then we are assaulted with a quick succession of flashed, one-frame images and then total blackness, is if the screen suddenly came alive in the theatre.The implication is that we are the people who saw the copy. It was shown in its entirety to we, the viewers, when Rachel sat down to watch it. And, if you noticed, from that point on, we were treated to many single-frame flashes of the ring and other various symbolism from the film. If you recall, everyone who has seen the video, sees the ring in their mind's eye, before they die.We are seeing the flashes of the ring and other symbolism, because we are slowly falling under Samara's spell. And the last scene implies that we are the next victims, while also leaving the producers open to a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could have been done better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thar be spoilers ahead, mateys..This movie has me a bit confused. First of all, I need to say that it was a fabulous idea, and would have been a great movie had it been done better, but there's still the fact that it wasn't. There were a few things that weren't really necessary to the development of the plot and would have better served the movie by not being there.First, the photos. The movie capitalized on the fact that pictures taken of people only become mangled after they see the video... I fail to see how a bunch of blurry vacation photos are important, especially since they make a big deal about it for twenty minutes, then drop it for the rest of the movie and never explain why it happens. Next comes the ferry scene. Completely unnecessary. The fact that a horse bolts and has conniption fits when Rachel comes near has nothing to do with the rest of the movie except that Samara lived on a horse farm. The only other major problem I had was the fact that the movie ended at least three times before it actually finished (finding Samara's body, Rachel telling Aidan it will be okay, etc.).Besides this, it was a halfway decent movie. It did a thorough job of creeping me out, especially at the point where Samara crawls out of Noah's television... that alone had me sleeping with the bathroom light on and music playing for a week afterward. My TV set started shorting out and getting staticky exactly a week after we saw it -- I half expected a drenched, algae-covered girl clad in white to crawl out of the screen. Overall, a decent movie. Not amazing because of the things I've mentioned plus a couple other minor things, but not terrible. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest...Movie...Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ive seen some scary movies in my days. I have nothing againstsome of the older horror pictures (Hitchcock, etc.) They did anamazing job, but don't really cut it these days. Today they arelooked at as good/but not scary FILMS.Anyway, I saw this movie in the theatre and was squirming theENTIRE time, beginning to end. I think this movie pulled off everyscary movie trick. They had the "What's around the corner" trick, the"Don't open the closet door!" trick, the disturbing images, the "OHMY GOD!" sudden jump out trick... this movie scared me in everyway I thought I could be scared.Basically, If you saw Blair Witch Project (and actually thought it wasscary... cause if you didn't this doesn't count) think of that chill thatwent up your spine on the VERY last shot. If you remember theshot and remember that feeling of utter horror... this movie is likethat feeling for 90minutes. NOT 5 seconds...90 MINUTES!One of the girls I saw it with was not impressed. She felt that it wastoo unbelievable. For some reason Red Dragon was the scariestmovie she ever saw. She told me that stuff that CAN'T reallyhappen is not scary. To a degree I get her point. This movie is OUTTHERE...but that's the beauty of it. Another small comment I'd like to make is the fact that the neverexplain what the heck is going on or why. I really thought it was anice treat. They never explained HOW the things happened, youjust believe they do. (Hard to explain without spoiling, but if you'veseen it, you know what I mean).The plot wasn't that great. In fact the movie was a 90 minute hook.It hooked you immediate and never let you go.My beliefs are that if a scary movie makes you afraid of the dark,then it did its job...and I'll tell you, I slept with the lights on thatnight.SEE THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ok, theres 2 things that have been bugging me about the film, and i wanted to know if anyone knew the answers to them, or could just help me to further understand.1) ok... if rachel wasnt going to die, since she made the copy of the tape, why did she continue to go through the symptoms long after noah viewed it? its a bit of a tease, and quite confusing, since everyone thinks shes going to die... i mean, i guess its supposed to 'keep us guessing' until the end, but its almost contradictory since shes being lead on that shes going to die... but then doesnt. just bugged me.AND2) another thing... how did samora get that stuff on tape? they were her thoughts right??? so how did her thoughts transfer onto a tape for everyone to see?... im not so much bothered by the phone calls and her talking from the grave... or the fact that she didnt say anything... and im not even confused by how she killed people... those things all made sense to me. i was just really confused by how she got that stuff on tape.maybe the sequel that is apparently coming out will answer these questions, but that probably wont be for awhile... so if anyone could help me with these, id appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the **** is this ****?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I should have realized that this wasn't going to be a good filming experiance when I saw the Ring...the entire theater was filled to the brim with high school students with the front half of the theater being nothing but teenage girls. Word of advice for all movie goers: NEVER SEE A HORROR MOVIE IN THIS CONDITION! I probably wouldn't have been so frightened by this film if the audiance didn't screem at the top of their lungs at every single little thing that happened on the screen. But enough of that.The film itself was, unfortunately, was a typical mordern Hollywood horror film in that it relied on shock value to scare you. Fortunately, there was little to no gore involved in this shock treatment which was a plus. What ever happened to the old days of horror films where building an atmosphere of terror was more important than shocking the audiance (like in this film when we are shown the end product of the Samara's wrath which is done suddenly without warning and is on screen for only a second). And as I said before, if it weren't for the audiance (mostly highschool girls) screeming at every little thing the shocks in this film wouldn't have been so scary.**WARNING - SPOILERS AHEAD**But the worst and absolutely devistating thing about this film was the ending. I mean, the film would have been decent it actually stopped after they found the girls body and buried her. BUT NO! They had to go on, they had to have the girl coming out of the TV. They had to give the pointless solution to the curse by making a copy of the tape. I mean, this has to be the most pointless and idiotic ending I've ever seen in a horror film.Don't waste your time with this film! Go see something of more redeeming quality than this...like JACKASS: THE MOVIE. (yes, THE RING was that bad).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i thought that this movie was very good movie because it wasnt like the typical horror movie which includes the same individual going around killing people. this movie has a virtually an annonymus killer and that i think adds suspense. another thing thats makes the movie good is the fact thats it also as mystery in it when the main characters try to figure out to destroy the tape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpectedly good....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love to watch horror movies but rarely do I see one that's really well done. It's extremely hard to produce a horror movie that shows intelligence, scares you, and is not cheesy. I believe the Ring did as good of a job as possible.Possible Spoilers...The plot sounds stupid from the outside but it's actually pretty clever. You gradually see the importance of the video tape and the character's roles as the movie progresses. Naomi Watts was impressive and I think David Dorfman (Aidan) could have a bright future. At the beginning, I was afraid Aidan would be just like Haley Joel Osment from the Sixth Sense. Pleasantly, they didn't overuse Aidan's part and it worked well.The movie wasn't that scary, but the way the movie draws you in adds to the scare. The scene where Samara comes out of the t.v. was relatively disturbing. I can only name a handful of horror movies that really impressed me and The Ring is one of them.3.5 out of 4. Must see for horror movie fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't normally get into horror but I liked this. The atmosphere is absolutely creepy. The rainy Northwest is as much a character as the actors. Naomi Watts and David Dorfman are very good as mother and son trying to figure out the mystery. The plot is a bit farfetched but it's horror, you got to go with it. The movie is most interesting as a mystery,the way they get to the reason why is smart and scary. I liked the movie but it would been helped out with a little humor and maybe, just maybe a little sunshine. I been to Seattle the sun does shine a bit. I know what your thinking "sun and light" in horror movie? Really were not all "Goths". Good movie go and see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ringu vs. The Ring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually when I hear the word "American Version/Remake", it just makes me want to grab my hair and tear it off my scalp. I have watched both the original version (Ringu) and the American version (The Ring), and made a conclusion that the original version is MUCH better than the American version. One of the reasons why the Japanese version is better is because it explains more of the situation or plot rather then throwing audiences around in confusion. Yet the American version does try its best to follow the original's plot, even though Hollywood has a bad rep of screwing up original stories from books and video games. For those who didn't know, Ringu (the original Japanese version) is a series that has two sequels and a prequel , followed by tv spin-offs, a Korean remake of the original, and many others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More hype than anything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie isn't even all that scary. I suppose it would be scary for a 14 year old girl perhaps, but for anyone who's seen a lot of movies in their time, there's nothing new here. It was just a bunch of cheap shot scare gags, and horror movie cliches. It seems they were trying to go for the "I don't know what's going on, but it sure is scary!" type of fright, but it didn't work for me. I knew what was going on: The director was trying to scare me. I couldn't lose myself in the movie because the scares were being forced upon me instead of drawing me in.The scariest movies are the kind of movies that show you a dark place and let you wander in of your own accord. This movie just kept sticking stuff in my face and saying "Boo! Scary, huh?"I'm not a 14 year-old girl. That kind of stuff doesn't work on me. Sorry.I probably would have enjoyed this movie more if not for the hype it got. "The scariest movie ever! I couldn't believe it!" I went in expecting too much I guess. If I would have heard nothing about it I could have at least judged it on it's own merits. But hey, whether or not it lives up to the hype is irrelevant. I paid to go and see it. That's all that matters to them in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ringu did it better, and without the Hollywood excess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers maybe.I saw the original Ringu first, so there's no way I can talk about the remake without comparing the two. I really did enjoy the remake, particularly Naomi Watts' performance, but I do think the original is marginally better. In both versions, the tension is extremely tangible and builds slowly, the atmosphere is equally creepy, but the original isn't riddled with Scary PartsT designed to make you jump, which American horror movies just can't seem to leave out. I appreciated that, and because of it, the ending was more effective in the original. Not to mention during the end sequence they didn't need to (but probably didn't have the budget to anyway) use digital effects to make it look "cool".Seriously, the ending of the original is much more well done. And much creepier. As so many great foreign and independent movies have proven, a bigger budget does not necessarily equal a better movie. With a low budget, the movie's not going to be clogged with pointless special effects and filler, but instead concentrate more on telling a story. In that respect, Ringu succeeded marvelously. The remake did as well, it just did it flashier. It tired to impressive its audience with eye candy, instead of just letting this great story tell itself.Also, the video tape sequence is better in the original. When a movie gets Americanized, I always dread what invariably happens--it overexplains things. Such is the case here. I completely got the all the elements of the story in the original, even if the video tape didn't make sense. In the remake, they just felt the need to explain everything, severely detracting from the supernatural mystique of the story (which is at its heart, a traditional ghost story--the best kind of horror story). The original doesn't need to beat you over the head to get your attention, particularly in the case of the subliminal reference to the title, and I appreciate that as well.The remake definitely has better actors going for it, but I don't think it stands up quite as well. Whichever version you see first will probably have the scarier ending though, and thus may appear a consistently better film. I'd give the original 8/10, and the remake 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy mood, too many loose ends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers!! While entertaining with good photography and mood, there were enough holes n the plotting to make me very disappointed with "The Ring." Call me what you want, but here are some questions I have:1) So who made the videotape? 2) Why did the well appear under the motel room floorboards when we clearly see it was out in the field when the mom tried to kill the kid? 3) Why was it necessary to see that the kid had been kept in the room upstairs in the barn? It wasn't necessary to the plot. That's not where the kid spent the rest of her days. That's not where she was murdered. She was probably only there for a short while before her mom took her out to the well and tried to murder her. 4) How come there was no exploration of where the kid was adopted? That may have helped to explain her origins. 5) What's that whole confusing thing at the end about people who make copies can't be killed but those who are give the copy can? What? That's all I can figure out about why at the end she's making another copy with her son and they seem to feel they're not going to be killed, but maybe someone else is. Huh? 6) Do you actually have to pick up the phone and listen to the voice telling you you're going to die in 7 days, or doesn't it matter if you hear the message or not? And how do they get the phone number to call in the first place? 7) Why would a potential victim cause a horse to go crazy?I love horror and sci-fi films, but if they set up a universe where supernatural events occur, they have to follow their own internal logic. It's got to be real for the world the characters live in. Otherwise, it's just a film director throwing things at us like a big cheater and there's no point in understanding anything that goes on. The film just becomes a series of unconnected scenes and strange odd bits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE LAST THING YOU SEE BEFORE YOU DIE IS BAD ACTING.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main problem with the Ring is pacing. What starts out as a fairly creepshow affair turns more and more mundane as the movie progresses. Scenes we are supposed to be shocked or startled by prove to be silly and anticlimactic, and the final scene is very run of the mill. There was hope within this movie for something truly maddening and goosebump-ridden, but the hamfisted acting of the lead female character torpedoes the overall effect.The scene on the ferry is pointless and far too long. Other scenes prove too melodramatic for what happens onscreen to provide any punch - the scene with the girl's father and the bathroom is a prime example.However, some scenes are fairly spooky. The barn setting and the little boy's fugues when he is drawing are effective.But this movie has way too much hype going for it for the payoff you get. Another example of wanting more than Hollywood can deliver.See it if you absolutely have to spend money trying to scare yourself, but dont' be surprised if you find yourself laughing at the screen more than partway through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie for me is not the scariest movie i have ever seen, i think there's just no such a movie that really scares you a lot (it depends on what can make you scare, people always is different so its obvious it doesn't scares everyone).The power of the film is not on the scares, is a horror movie with a complex plot that everything means something, and you have to understand it, the mystery is very interesting to follow, something i highly like is the way they treat the horror.The acting is good, especially Naomi Watts, she can handle a horror film very well, we also see how her character evolves (something not seen in horror movies today).The story here is about the tape, the mystery and the puzzle we have to figure out, the character development is not so great, because the story demands it, of course we see some, but getting to know a lot of the characters just wouldn't fit with the story.The direction and photography are very well done, some visuals are very impressive and intriguing.I'll recommend this movie to horror fans, this movie doesn't compare with Hollywood's recently 'horror' movies, some people will like it, some people don't.Its a great effort of actually do something new with horror movies, i know is a remake, but this is to prove that Japan Cinema is more interesting that the one from Hollywood.Some people just don't like this movies, because they're so unbelievable to them, but the supernatural and the no real things is what interests most of the people.Enjoy the experience of seeing 'The Ring'.9 out of 10</fullReview>

When Samara came out of the TV to kill Noah or for that matter any of the others why did they not try to defend themselves? Or would it have mattered if they did?2. If Noah had a battle axe could he have chopped off Samara's head and killed her or are we to assume since she is already dead and basically a spirit she could not be harmed?3. Why is it a videotape and not simply broadcast over the internet or during half time of the super bowl? If Samara has all these super human powers and wants people to know the truth why doesn't she make this happen?4. Can anyone explain what it might mean if i got a nosebleed during the movie? Am i going to die?I know some will read this and say that womanizer is just being a stupid _______ (insert your own word for me here) but i don't care.

All of the elements were there: the bad acting, lame lines, and the cheesiness of the scene with the two girls just made me cringe. Within minutes this movie rapidly showed its true nature. DO NOT BE FOOLED! This movie is all bite and no bark. Yes, it is formulaic and the acting is sub-par, but that does not mean this is not going to scare you witless. Let me put it to you this way, when they show the tape for the first time, YOU WILL BE SCARED. Even knowing that this would be the breaking point of the film, I was not ready for the tape. The images on the tape are the essence of good horror: reality gone horribly wrong. It has all the artistry of indie films and gothic horror the likes of which Poe and Lovecraft would be proud of. The rest of the movie is just window dressing, but there is nothing wrong with that. This movie shows us how the formula is supposed to work, and that is something worth seeing.</fullReview>

The plot's absolutely brilliant.I'll just get the faults over as quickly as I can:Some stuff just doesn't make sense. There's a fairly good conclusion, but there are a few ropes here and there that just dangle loosely. I heard a rumor that this is part of a trilogy, so maybe I should just shutup and wait hopefully more explanation. But even then, there were occasionaly bits that just didn't really fit with the movie, were a painful attempt to be scary, and just should have been left out.If you can ignore those, however, you will find this a scary and enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...grows more and more absurd.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that really could have been among the greats in the genre like The Exorcist. The Ring establishes one of the best horror atmospheres that I have ever experienced and it even delivers on the scares that it promises. But, aside from all that is everything that is unforgivable. The entire movie just grows more and more absurd; thought I cannot give any specific examples without making this review a big spoiler, the movie either fails to explain the origins and purpose of the tape and all the mystery surrounding it or gives an explanation that is something more than absurd. Still, I concede that atmosphere is probably the most effective element in a horror movie and The Ring succeeds beyond my wildest dreams on that level. There are no showy special effects, but instead subtle little touches like an eerie cabin near a misty and spooky forest, a quiet farming town with an aura of uneasy silence surrounding it, and most importantly, a woman who changes from an everyday news reporter to a tense and fearful person afraid for the lives of everyone she loves.Still, one of the biggest gripes I had with this movie was the videotape itself. There are a lot of people who seem to think that it was creative and extremely frightening; I am not one of those people. Whoever was responsible for the creation of the videotape footage seemed to create a montage by just throwing together a bunch of individually interesting images that had little effect, especially in the long run. When we see some of the objects on the tape in real life, The Ring wants us to say "wow," instead we are left muttering anything but flattery. The tape is the central piece of the movie, something that the audience yearns to see and be frightened by. To me the piecing together of "artsy" images has become a clich and an all too easy way out.Another big problem is the ending, or rather, the lack of a good one. There are a few points before the actual end that I thought the movie should have ended; granted that any of the other ending points would have been more typical, any other ending would have stopped the continual onslaught of brainless explanations and commercially injected meaning. There is one point where Watts says, "I want to go home," where I definitely would have liked to see the movie end. Yes we've seen it before and yes it's the easy way out that I was complaining the tape footage took, but not everything can be original and not everything has to be original. Horror movies and thrillers these days are still all trying to duplicate the huge plot twist of The Sixth Sense, and the eventual monetary success that the film enjoyed. At some point there has to be a concession that Shyamalan's picture was beyond what almost all people in Hollywood are capable of in terms of its shock value.Luckily, making up for the script's flaws is the talent involved in the cast, especially in Naomi Watts. Her performance as Rachael is often the saving grace of this movie. She transforms otherwise painful moments into something emotionally compelling or frightening. At first look, Watts is the typical attractive female that all horror movies like to showcase either in the main character or in one of the side characters. But she transcends the typical female in a horror movie role and shows us her character's depth and emotions. She starts out as reporter investigating her niece's death to a woman with seven days to live and a son and ex-husband with only a day or so more than her.In the end The Ring is similar to one of this weekend's other releases, Abandon. Both show us some elements of brilliance that are rare in movies of their type, both are bad movies in the end. The Ring is a movie that could have offered more than a few scares and a cool look, but alas, the writer failed to write with logic and reason as is often the case in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Riveting, an Improvement on the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's nice to know that occasionally, Hollywood CAN do it right.No doubt about it, THE RING is one of the scariest, most intense horror films I have ever seen. And that's amazing, considering I'd already seen the original Japanese movie it's based on, RINGU, and pretty much knew what was going to happen all through the film and was still on the edge of my seat. The screenplay by Ehren Kruger manages to faithfully retell the original film's story but add just enough new twists to keep you guessing.The story follows reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) on the trail of an urban legend about a cursed videotape. Apparently, as soon as you finish watching the tape, your telephone rings and a whispered voice tells you that you have seven days to live; and at the end of seven days, you die. Rachel is drawn into the mystery of the tape when her sixteen-year-old cousin drops dead, apparently a victim of the curse.Pretty soon Rachel finds the tape itself, and, being the reporter she is, she watches it and, sure enough the phone rings... and suddenly she believes.It's incredible how much more suspenseful this film is than the original, considering that it follows the same basic outline. One way it does this is by adding new texture to each scene; what was eerie in the first film is absolutely frightening in this one. And director Gore Verbinski's visual style keeps the tension building, with an almost total lack of humor (which is interesting in and of itself, considering all of his previous films have been comedies).To sum it all up, this is an amazing film you do NOT want to watch alone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>/* This review MAY include spoilers - depending on what information you deem important. */I gave "The Ring" an objective try Thanksgiving evening.My knowledge of the movie was limited to understanding A) If you watch a specific video tape, you will die in 7 days, B) The movie is a recent addition to the 'scary movie' genre, and C) the movie has been doing quite well at the box office.I do not profess to be some intellectually pompous boob who will critically analyze every detail, both explained and unexplained, to death. However, I have to say on a high level objective viewing of this film, "The Ring" was disappointingly tired.I really liked the film's premise (see A above). Wouldn't it be frightening to know that in 7 days a creepy death will fall upon you? The way in which the main character re analyzed the video a second time (Why not? She's going to die anyway, right?) and discovered clues as to it's origin was fascinating. The video itself was creepy and well done. The young heroine's perseverance to get to the bottom of the video's meaning was riveting. ...and then I got tired, really tired.First off, I am tired of every creepy movie (see: The Shining, Six Sense, et. al.) having some young kid who 'sees inside of the mind of the evil doer.' This movie has the same old clichs: The boy says to mom "She's yelling out to be released," and the boy draws deep disturbing pictures of a far off evil place using his crayons. Of course, when the time comes that mom must figure out a clue or two - she turns to the son and says "What is she trying to say?"This has been done a million times.In lies my potential *spoiler*. This movie has the proverbial person (in this case, a little girl) who 'disappeared' 25 years ago without a trace - she was abused by her parents who wanted a perfect child but became troubled when they discovered their only child had a mental illness. So the child mysteriously 'disappeared.' ...and today, we have a young boy telling his mom "She's yelling out to be released."This has been done a million times. ...and then I got tired, really tired.The visuals and special effects were good. It was a good premise, yet it went so wrong - ESPECIALLY the ending. Wait! Did the movie really end?This movie had all of the traditional clichs of 'catching up with the girl' by the end. The movie should have ended. But no. When mom tells her son "the girl has been released," her son replies "what did you do that for? You shouldn't have done that!"We get 20 more minutes.This movie had all the makings of a good creepy movie with a riveting premise. But, inevitably it got tired with endless flashbacks, child clichs and a plot - not only done a million times - that would not end!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!** When I first saw the Japanese version "Ringu" way back in 1999, I anticipated to be scared out of my wits because I was taken in by all the hype surrounding the film then(in Asia..it was BIG and reports claiming that it made people scream and run out of the theater!). When I actually sat down and watched the movie..I was DISAPPOINTED..It was dull and sleep-inducing..the characters talked in monotonous voices, slow paced but the ending (the GRAND FINALE) spooked me out big time!! It was the way the 'jinx' ('Samara' in the American version) moved and crawled out of the TV that spooked everyone out- BIG TIME!! The 'jinx' had the spookiest 'face' ever on any ghost (actually she doesn't have a face, just hair all over her head but then...again..) and then there's the infamous 'eye'- the very thing that killed people (in the Japanese version). I ended up pretty spooked for a week after that and remember thinking, "IF only Hollywood will make a version of this movie..I'm sure it will be very good"..Imagine my elation when I read that Hollywood was INDEED going to make this movie! Imagine my anticipation and finally when the movie opened..I was one of those first to line up for the tickets...Hmm..now my comments for "The Ring"..aka American version.. In all fairness, I must admit that the American version was much more interesting than 'Ringu'..in the sense that the characters were better acted out (at least the actors did not sit and talk and talk in monotone voices for most of the whole movie and showed their emotions a whole lot better)..faster paced and unlike what some reviewers say..it was NOT confusing at all (try watching 'Ringu', you'll know what 'confusing' means). I actually liked the whole movie until the end..what supposedly to be the scariest part ( the GRAND FINALE ) was actually a major DISAPPOINTMENT! Again I was anticipating to be spooked out of my wits..and again I was disappointed! Somehow the American version was not able to capture the creepiness exuded by the Japanese version . The Japanese was successful in making the 'jinx' aka 'Samara' extremely spooky but this is not the case with the American version...with all the so-called high tech-ed special effects which Hollywood is capable of.."The Ring" just fall flat!...Also another disappointment was the video (the 'culprit' that kills)..in "Ringu"..it was both creepy and mysterious with its unexplainable segments but in "The Ring"..it looked like a music video...*yawn* The conclusion is..IF only they made "The Ring" by copying exactly "Ringu" (esp. at the end) IT will be a very good and SCARY film...too bad..just too bad...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally, I don't like horror movies -- although a thriller like Silence of the Lambs is similar and OK. This one I thought might be a thriller but it turned out to be pure horror. My experience with this genre is limited, because I've always thought I've got plenty of nightmares and problems in my own life. I don't need to spend $10 to see a film that tries to emotionally scar me for life.However, since I did see it -- I must say it was thoughtful and well-done. Unlike films such as Halloween 3 or Poltergeist, where the story is basically "Oh, they're magic so they can pretty much do anything," the mysteries of The Ring are partially explained and the story actually goes somewhere rather than consisting of a lot of running around.The acting, cinematography, were powerful and the film was quite scary. There is only a little gore in the film; it was definitely more cerebral and less hack-n-slash.Who should see this film:-- horror fans only, but it's worth your moneyI'll give this film a 7 out of 10, even though it really deserved an 8, just because it's not my thing personally, and for the ending which worked but created more loose ends than it tied up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watered down ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt this movie was going great, but the end was too explicit, it tookaway all the mystery. Also, it was too watered down, so it wasn'teven scary, it looked as if it came out of Mick Garris' TV Movie "TheShining".Still, I give this movie thumbs up, because it has great directing,and great acting (although the "misterious brilliant kid" thing isgetting so cliched by now, I found it a little annoying). I think Video is the best thing to come to the Horror genre after theScream fever. It has proved to have inmense potential in creatingan intriguing and gut-wrenching effect, by making us feel as if whatwe are experiencing comes out of the screen and into our reality. We can see that in movies such as Blair Witch, The Ring, and LostHighway.I'm really happy to see that it didn't all start and end with BlairWitch, and that there can be lots of different ways to use videocameras to achieve the same intriguing creepy effect Blair Witchdid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hope the obvious sarcasm wasn't wasted on anyone. I ordered a ticket for the "Premier Surprise", which had the tag line, "massive hit in USA", hoping it was 8 Mile a friend and I took the deal.After 5 minutes I wondered if I could get my money back (from the small talk around me, seemingly I wasn't alone in that thought). From the boy, who is a clear "Sixth Sense"-rip-off to the heavily inspired filming and cinematography from Blair Witch, this movie was a huge disappointment. I admit the "Horror-genre" has it tough, it's now easy making one that's critically acclaimed, but I have found out it's all about feel and mood. Films like "The Shining", "The Exorcist", and "The Kingdom" have that great creepy feel, which, even if you don't get scared, just shows the best of genre, and is a joy to watch.The Ring doesn't have it. It made me laugh a couple of times, when being to thick to take serious. I voted it 3, because I have seen worse horror-flicks. But the hopeless copying of other films, and a plot full of holes and errors can't swing it up to more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest Movie of this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring is not the best picture of 2002. It is, however, the most terrifying thing I have experienced in a movie theater, ever. It's a good date movie if you like scaring the heck out of your date. It's also a pretty good movie.I have a hard time giving this film better than 7 out of 10, but it's the case. However, many more films that receive such a rating deserve less. This film is 70% satisfying as a film. As a scary movie, it's a whopping 100% satisfaction rating. So, that's good.Naomi Watts is too pretty for this movie. So is her ex-boyfriend. And her son's role is embarassingly similar to the kid in the Sixth Sense. All those problems are still not enough to not be completely terrified by the premise of this film. Watch the videotape and in seven days you DIE!Cheesy, sure, but scary anyway. And all scary movies have an inherent cheesiness, no matter how classy they feign to be. So this is the best kind of cheese. This film is really scary. By the way, did I say it was scary? And WHAT AN ENDING!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before seeing "The Ring", read this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ring" has acquired a reputation. When you watch the commercials on T.V. with these teenagers wearing the "cool &amp; hip" brands of clothes, that have spiky hair, and that look like clones taken from the legion of main-stream teenagers of America saying: "It's the scariest film I've ever seen!", you should know what "The Ring" really is. This is a remake of the Japanese film entitled "Ringu", released in 1998, so if I counted well, four years ago. And they do a remake. But wait, the word "remake" is not really appropriate here. I would say Amercian version. Americans (in general) are not very opened to difference...and let me tell you that, for those who've seen some, a Japanese film is totally different from an American film...the acting is completely another thing, as well as the directing. Personally, I haven't seen "Ringu", but I don't care. I've seen "The Ring", and that's enough, even though I would have preferred to see "Ringu" instead.Here's a little overview of the movie: A woman investigates on the mysterious death of her niece, who apparently died after watching a video cassette. She watches it, and it contains several successive images that don't really seem to have a meaning. But, going further in her investigation, she discovers the origins of the tape and the meaning of every image. But things get more complicated (and confused!) when she learns that she only has seven days to live after the viewing. So, that gives her seven days to find the solution. Original? A little. Scary? Unfortunately, a little. The only scary part of this film lasts about one minute and a half, and it's the viewing of the tape. It's mysterious, creepy, and great. THAT part was nice, and it somehow gave me shivers. But that's it. Actually, that's the only creepy part because that's the only one where we truly disconnect from reality. The rest of the film keeps a tone that I would describe as too sober for that kind of film. I mean, there are surnatural events, but they are either very ordinary (in horror films) or flawed. (Spoilers) Yes, seeing a woman going out of the television is not such a bad concept, it can be used cleverly and give a good scare, but, first, we saw it many times in other films (and I don't really consider that as a problem, because any idea can be used dozens of times and still be original, it all depends on the way it is delivered) and also, in "The Ring", the directing is not good enough to make it scary. Another thing is the constant use of sound to make the audience jump out of their seats. Okay, you can use it once, or twice, in very special occasions, and it will work...but in "The Ring", they overuse it, I mean, they always put a loud sound effect for any action the character is doing, that's gratuitous. If I hadn't seen it in a theater, it would not have been the same film. Those who will see it at home better have an excellent surround sound system, because in the opposite case, they'll fall asleep. The key of a great and truly scary horror film is the atmosphere. It has to be constantly creepy, to keep the audience in the mood, and that's what I meant by "a sober tone". Yes, one minute you start going in the mood of the film, but the first thing you know is that, thirty seconds later, you come back to reality, and the audience's progress is ruined. The ending tries to mix up reality and the horror, but it seems like the reality tone is stronger, and that ruins the whole potential of the film. Those who want to see the creepiest film ever, and also one of the most brilliant films should definitely watch Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining".The directing by Gore Verbinski is ordinary, except, once again, for that minute and a half of bizarre and creepy images. He seems to like giving us fake scares (like playing a creepy background music and showing the heroin getting near a door and opening it slowly, making us believe that something horrible is hidden behind it and that we're going to jump off our seats when we see what it is (and, just a little comment, these days it's not even the image itself that scares, it's the sudden loud sound) and simply not doing it, so he fools us, creating mild suspense and trying to avoid cliches).The acting is average. The little boy tries to scare us with his constant neutral facial expression, but fails. Usually, a boy of that kind in an horror film is one of the scariest aspects of it, but in this case, he simply doesn't fit, and he simply has no importance. He's not quite Danny Torrance (played by Danny Lloyd, in "The Shining"), let me tell you that. The other actors are okay, there is not much to mention about them.The plot is needlessly complex. It tries to be complicated and everything, and in the end you realize it cannot explain itself. Somebody explain to me the nosebleeds, why the boy can talk to the girl from the tape, the hose jumping off the boat...they put lots of weird things, explain some of them, and try to make us forget the other ones they can't explain. For a good plot in an "horror" film, see Bill Paxton's "Frailty", it is a hundred times better, and it really works! It unfortunately doesn't seem to be the case for "The Ring".I've read the discussion forums for this film on IMDb. One of them was "The Ring is the scariest film of the last twenty years". That's ridiculous. Those who say that have truly been hypnotized by Hollywood. "The Ring" happens to be a very overrated film that a generation of ignorants will find truly scary because they haven't seen anything else and have no cinematic culture...someone that says "The Ring" is the scariest film doesn't know anything about foreign or underground films...they only watch Hollywood blockbuster crap that is to cinema what McDonald's is to food...Last year, there's been a much scarier movie than that, and it IS a Hollywood film, I'm talking about "Frailty", from Bill Paxton...excellent film. Anyone remembers "Bram Stoker's Dracula" from Coppola? That was beautiful and creepy...that was not junk..."Interview With The Vampire", from Neil Jordan, anyone? Yes, it seems that these years (and I mean from 1996 to today) horror films have taken an atrocious turn into the category of SUSPENSE movies, which are a totally different thing....Wes Craven's Scream (an awful film, by the way) is a SUSPENSE, not an horror film! And, again, they had to ruin good things even worse, so they made awful suspense films with monsters or ghosts in them, and they wrapped it with leading actors and actresses with bigger chests than talent, and they've got a Box Office success that every ignorant North-American will find scary...congratulations...Anyone who thinks he or she loves horror movies has to watch "The Shining"...if you don't find it scary, then you don't know what a REAL horror movie is. Before I see "The Ring" again, it will see mine, if you know what I mean.Overall, it is a very ordinary thriller, with some suspense, brief horror scenes, and it is a flawed horror film. At least it really tried to be a horror film, and ruined itself. It is average, deceiving in the thrill factor, but it still has better entertainment value than the majority of today's horror flicks from Hollywood...5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potentially Brilliant, But Somehow Not Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several points in "The Ring" in which the movie almost reaches points of macabre brilliance. The opening scenes are edge-of-your-seat scary and the sadistic twist ending is nothing short of terrifying. Unfortunately, it's the long stretch in between those two points that is so disappointing.The Ring is about a mysterious videotape, the contents of which will kill you. A journalist (Naomi Watts) is on the story, but unfortunately she has seen the tape, which may ensure her death in seven days. Of course a premise like this requires the suspension of disbelief, but this movie never did it for me. The entire time it was obvious to me that I was just watching a movie. I was never absorbed.Which is a shame because The Ring had a big opportunity to really scare me. All the elements of a classic thriller are here, but few are really put to use. It builds atmosphere to be sure, but it does so entirely in cliches. Roll the thunder, cue the lightning, etc. In between the long stretches of expository dialogue and gray storm cloudy backdrops, there are a few very disturbing moments. After viewing this movie, I guarantee you will be wary around television sets, or whenever the phone rings. For a PG-13 movie, there are a lot of disturbing images, too. (Rotting corpses and the like.) Unfortunately, in a nutshell, The Ring is a thriller with all the disturbing elements of a horror film, but none of the thrills. So in the end, we're left with a movie that is nothing more than simply disturbing.(**/****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You like sleep? If yes, then do not see this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the original Ringu, I was watching it in the dark, by myself. I got absolutely no sleep that night, and I am not someone who scares easily. I am a big fan of horror, but have trouble being scared by most modern Hollywood horror movies. This is because most of them have shallow plots and rely on cheap jumps for their scares. To get someone to truly be afraid, you have to draw them into the movie. It's easy to just think, "Oh, this is just a movie, that giant bug isn't real, I'd never get attacked by that." The truly scary horror movie is the one that grabs you, and just won't let go; you can't forget that it's just a movie. That's just what this movie does.I have to compare the original to the American version, because in doing so you see why both are effective. First off, they both have that "grab you" quality. They do this by empathy, both by the familiarity of a story that sounds like an urban legend (the tape that kills you) and by the fact that you actually watch the tape when they do. How better to have someone interested in how the characters are going to save themselves then by convincing the irrational part of the brain that horror caters to that it could happen to them?As far as the actual horror of the movie, I prefer Ringu, as it was more suspenseful, with more Hitchcock like pacing, building of tension and shots. The Ring has quite a few cheap jumps that annoyed me. This can work once, but it's overused and unneccesary, especially because the original is so suspenseful, the American version shouldn't need them. I can see why they would add this, as American audiences tend to have much shorter attention spans, so if you don't shock them once in awhile, you lose them. It still has the suspense of the original, so no great harm is done. The main thing that bothered me with the new version was that it had to change so many things for American audiences. The reason that this bothered me is that the Japanese version made much more sense. The American version, by comparison seemed a little bit slapped together, but it's still very good. Also, the very end of the original was a good bit more chilling than the new one.All that aside, I'm not saying that the new version is without its merits. For one thing, the effects are much better, and there are some that kinda make you go, "Oh my god, that's not supposed to happen," outloud in the theater that aren't in the original. There's also little subtle tricks that work quite well that are unique to the American version.Overall, both are excellent movies. Even though the American version isn't quite as good as the original, it still runs rings (no pun intended) around most of the competition out there. Definitely watch the American version, and it'd be worth your while to track down the original. That is, if you don't mind missing a night's sleep! :^)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film does not seem scary. When you are watching it it's clearly not terrifying or thrill packed in the traditional horror genre way. What it is, is creepy but it builds up to scary and perhaps even terrifying but not till after you leave the theatre.I think it is because the film never gives you that release moment - that moment to let all the tension and suspense out with a good shudder or scream, so you have no chance of processing that tension (which is what, in my opinion, horror movies are for.), it's still there when you leave the cinema, whether you realise it or not.Add to that some very disturbing visuals of a scary looking little girl and I - a hard core horror fan, found myself having nightmares over a film which i left the cinema believing wasn't even remotely nightmare material.This film is interesting on a number of levels, it's like a puzzle your mind still plays with for hours, days maybe even months after watching it. Is this a good thing - i don't know - let's see if I sleep tonight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will say it right now that the Japanese version of Ring is the superior film, but this is a damn fine effort that shouldn't be ignored for that reason.Like the original, the whole point of the film is to take a slow creepy ride towards a climax that will shock you beyond belief. And in that it succeeds. We dont need to know all the details. To those that think a video will kill you in 7 days is preposterous, then leave this alone, as it does not cater to the likes of you (narrow-minded). if however, you take it at face value and enjoy the package that you have, you'll be in for one of the best and scariest horror films in a long time.the music is perfect, the shock scenes are well timed, but the restraint on the REAL Horror until the end is the best aspect of this movie, and one that should not leave you dissapointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonable Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*May Contain Spoilers*The Ring is not an entirely scary film, but there are some scenes which are frightening. The reason I watched The Ring, was because I thought the idea of watching a video, then receiving a phone call telling you you have 'seven days' left to live was interesting. I was especially intrigued to see the explanation of how this came about. However, the supernatural explanation (which I suppose was the only way of justifying the strange events which occurred) was a little bit of a let down. The film leaves a few questions unanswered and there are also plot holes. Having said that, however, the ending is fairly unexpected. (The reason Rachel isn't killed is a bit dubious, although the final scene is rather disturbing). I am interested now however in watching the Japanese version (Ringu) on which this film is based.The single most annoying this about this film, however, is the overacting of the two girls (Amber Tamblyn &amp; Rachael Bella) at the start. Their performances are almost laughable and detracted from the horror of the first scene. I found it incredibly difficult to take this scene seriously. Thankfully the other actors in this film are much more talented. Naomi Watts does a good job as Rachel, the protagonist.Upon reading other reviews on IMDb for this film, I was surprised at how many people commented on how the images stayed with them for a long time after watching The Ring, as I found this was not the case for me. I definitely did not feel afraid of the television set after watching this film - it was only upon reading other reviews that the idea even occurred to me.The Ring was definitely not the scariest horror film I have ever seen (that honour would have to go to The Exorcist). However it was suspenseful and entertaining, overall I would give it 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

Relying more on building atmosphere and paranoia than blood and gore, much like The 6th Sense did in it's own way (a now inferior film to The Ring IMHO).There are only two or three 'jump out of your seat' scenes in The Ring, and trust me your head will hit the roof when they come. Instead it floods you with a constant sense of eerieness that lingers long after you've left the theatre. Topped off with one of the most amazing horror scripts ever written, far surpassing the somewhat shallow story-telling of the original Japanese version. The film also owes a lot of it's 'creep factor' to the cinematography. Images (without giving anything away) of the child "villian" will be in your head every time you close your eyes for days after. And the montage of images on the cursed video tape itself is the most mesmerising piece of cinema since THAT psychedelic trip in 2001: A Space Odyssey.The Ring shatters every "Hollywood Horror" cliche and I congratulate the film-makers for taking a big risk, both with the production and marketing. I'm not sure how it was promoted in the US, but here in Australia all we got were a few TV ads showing a quick 3 second flash of the images on the cursed tape, and then Rachel (Naomi Watts in her 1st post Mullholand Drv role) saying "Before you die you see the ring" nothing but a black poster with a white ring on it advertises it at the cinema. It took a long time to take off, but once word of mouth began, theatres were packed with ppl of all ages, with more or less no idea what they were about to watch.I've seen it twice now and the 2nd time I had the joy of looking around me every now and then at the audience, every set of eyes was pried wide open, people were sinking in to their seats, like children pulling the covers over their head to hide from the boogieman.I want to spill the beans on all the great scenes in this movie, but it's the kind of film you have to go in to knowing as little as possible, and I suggest that be the case. Let's hope this brave new style of horror takes off and we finally see the end of pathetic teen crap like Scream, I Know What You Did... etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved this!! *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie twice, yet I know that there are things that I have missed throughout the whole movie. This no doubt was one of the scariest I've ever seen. Sure, teen horror flicks give you a jump or two, but this one made me traumatized from the TV and closet for quite some time. (Dumb, haha I know...but still. Did YOU not unplug your TV or leave your closet open for a week? no? ok...)The Second time around, I tried studying the Video more closely and caught a few more things than I did the first. But there's one thing I'm confused about. You know how in real life, Rachel would see something from the video? I don't think she saw the severed finger thing. That, I got confused at. but Samara still scared the crap outta me when she attacked Noah at the end. ahh..*chills* anyhow, I hope everyone liked the movie. I loved it.it will definitely go down as one of my favorites, and major props to those who choreographed the storyboard and for the manuscript itself. bravo! :-D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good Movie...But don't forget the others....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I waited a little bit before I was finally able to catch this flick. I did appreciate the fact that this film did scare me...and not like a roller-coaster ride scary, it was like a slow leakage that stayed in my head long after I watched this film. There are many images that are shocking and the Cinematography is very nice, gives the movie the dark image that makes it so creepy. The reason why I say don't forget the others, is that, this is one of many in the past few years that has the potential to set the standard for horror suspense. The Ring, The Sixth Sense, The Others...I really hope that when Hollywood sees the dollar signs that these movies are brining, then maybe we can move away from Horror-Comedy, Hip-Horror or whatever you want to call it, and make a picture that will generally scare the hell out of you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am not easily scared.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I'd like to make a comment about the critique that many people are pointing out in this movie and in every other movie ever made - if you can see the boom mike, it is NOT the cameraman or editor's fault, it's the movie projectionist's. Therefore, if you see the mike in a movie (unless, I mean, it comes halfway down the screen or something), it's the fault of the person up in that little box behind you, OK? Glad I got that out; that really p****d me off...OK, now as for the review. Like I said in the one line summary, I am not easily scared. Exorcist didn't scare me. Silence of the Lambs only scared me in that one scene in the car, which you could probably compare this whole movie to. I went to this movie expecting to jump a little bit and have fun with my friends. Oh, was I ever wrong. My friend, Amy, and I walked in and noticed, "Hey, cool, there are only four other people in here!" Trouble is, they left right after the movie started. During the movie, my eyes were glued to the screen. Amy and I kept telling each other, "I'm watching, you have to watch, don't cover your eyes!" The whole thing was so amazingly mind-boggling. This comes from someone whose favorite movies are Quills, Memento, and Magnolia, so believe me when I tell you. If you complained about the, "plot holes," you didn't watch it right. The fear of the unknown is what it's all about. Also, people that complained about the acting didn't watch the same movie I did. These actors were so incredibly real that I felt like I was watching something taped from real life. Yes, the movie did go for a few easy scares, but it also made /fun/ of them too.You know in ever horror movie, when people creep up behind someone sitting in a chair, and they spin it around to show somebody with their eyes gouged out or something? This was a running inside joke throughout the whole movie. There are tons of those. Anyway, when the movie ended, we planned to sit through the credits like we always do. This movie, however, was so freaking scary that we just wanted to leave. The problem was, our shoes were on the floor and we were afraid to reach down and get them. So we sat. In the dark. Until this horrible, loud agonizing music came on and we started /squealing/! It was awful! You know how when you want to watch the credits to a movie, they always turn the lights on and ruin it? Our person wouldn't turn the lights on, and Amy and I were frozen in our chairs. Finally, we RAN out of the theater and Amy slammed the door and we sat hyperventilating in the bathroom. The guy that saw us run out didn't even look surprised: I suppose a lot of people reacted that way. Suddenly, I realized: I'd left my purse in the theater. Amy wouldn't even come back in with me, so I had to ask this total stranger to come in. And I reiterate /very strongly/, I don't get scared easily at all. I recommend this movie if you're in a good mood and you have a really good friend to clutch onto, or a boyfriend. And please DON'T talk, OK? That just p****s people off...my other friend saw it and didn't get scared at all because there were people giggling through the whole thing and making out. *sighs* Anyway, go see it. You /won't/ believe your eyes. ~*~ FOR ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAW IT - SPOILERS! ~*~ I don't know about you guys, but wasn't the girl's room in the barn totally creepy? That was one of the things that creeped me out the most. Also, some running themes I noticed throughout the movie:*seeing people sitting from behind, like I already mentioned, *fire! *rings...seriously, look, they're everywhere, and they keep flashing them in between frames! Very scary... *horses...OK, I know, duh, but it's surprising how /many/ you see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great premise, but it REALLY needs a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay. So you've seen this movie. Is is a great scary movie or are there so many unanswered questions that it was just too unsatisifying. The answer to both questions is "Yes".This movie was a great date flick. I'm pretty sure that most people understood that the little girl was some "force of death", like the grim reaper. Everyone was at the edge of their seats trying to unravel the mystery of the connection of why the killer's modus operandi was confined to killing only those who saw the tape.There were some other technical questions that went unanswered. Maybe on an artistic level, it is better leaving everything up in the air and allowing the audience to theorize their own explanations. But still, the questions beckon for answers. The only problem is that in the sequel-happy mindset that is Holloywood, most of us know that most sequels somehow cheapen the novelty and artistic integrity of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apparently this was supposed to be scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was supposed to be "the scariest movie since Sixth Sense" ... which I suppose is apt, since neither Sixth Sense nor The Ring is scary.The music was well done--it set a scary mood even though the plot couldn't do so. There were some creepy scenes, and the brief glimpses we got of the scary special effects makeup were creepy... It seemed to me to be more of a mystery than a horror movie. We found ourselves laughing more often than being scared... and it wasn't because the movie wanted to have humorous parts. I also spent a lot of time wondering who punched the kid and gave him two black eyes...Not to say that it wasn't kinda enjoyable, but I am glad I saw a matinee.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie not sure what to expect but this movie creeped me out more than any movie I have seen in a long time. I wont give anything away about this film but I thought about for quite a few days afterwards which says a lot about this film. Naomi Watts does an excellent job carrying this film and it is very apparent that she has great things ahead of her. The direction of this film is very tight and does a great job of keeping you on the edge of your seat without resorting to over the top violence or gore. I highly recommend this film and a lot of credit must be given to the writer of the original Japanese version of this film which I would love to see if it's ever released in the US. 7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** out of ****Naomi Watts stars as a reporter who investigates the mysterious death of her niece and discovers the cause may have been a videotape that kills you seven days after you see it. Plot-wise, that's all you need to know as you should prepare yourself for a gripping, downright terrifying mystery that is easily among the scariest films I've ever seen.Gore Verbinski's wonderfully stylish direction makes up for the minor flaws that exist in Ehrin Kruger's otherwise chilling screenplay. The performances are all very good, with Watts delivering another standout turn.There have been plenty of outstanding genre pictures the past two years, but so far, this is the best. Yes, it's doubtful you'll ever look at your VCR or television the same way again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just recently went to the theater to see "The Ring". While I can't really say that I was disappointed, I just can't understand why everyone thought this movie was so terrifying. True, it did have its moments, and there are a couple of images in it that I don't think I'll ever get out of my head, but this film struck me as more of a dark mystery than true horror. I even got a little bored in the middle as the main characters struggled to develop the plot, which was creepy, but not so much that I couldn't sleep at night. If you have nothing else to do and feel like watching a movie that actually makes you think, then you'll enjoy "The Ring". I give it 3 out of 4 stars for a great plot and some really scary images.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the most boring horror flicks I've ever seen. If you think this was the scariest movie of the last 20 years you are obviously 20 yo or younger. The only thing that even remotley qualified as scary is when you are watching any particularly quiet scene and they go to another with a loud bang of some type. So if you're not in the movie theatre with their sound system that startling part is gone. Psycho and Halloween don't even belong in the same genre of film as they were and are true horror classic. The only thing I think would make this movie scary is if I was forced to watch it again. I'm going to start going to see movies that critics pan because I usually end up seeing a better movie. If you were scared by this movie you must be afraid of your own shadow !!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was not a bad film. A reasonable attempt at old style horror. It does the right thing in implying that there is something nasty out there. That has always been more effective than gore, slash and gross-out. But too many things are left unexplained or not explained enough. The acting was adequate. Even Brian Cox, who is usually excellent, didn't have much to do. Did I see him in the mourning party at the beginning of the film? And if he was there, why?. But the mood and the look of the film did make it better than average. I haven't seen the japanese original and I must look out for it.</fullReview>

NO movie ever has made me stick to the message board or write e mail back and forth or talk to friends about it or made me think about its meaningthat much like this one. NO movie ever has me scared that much that I sat in my chair , tears running down my cheeks, goose bumps all over, willing to look away from thescreen just to make sure I do miss what happens nextNormally a movie has lost its fascination for me when it is over and I start thinking : Why did they do that, that could not happen in reality, impossible... Not with this one. I am trying to get behind the secrets of this movie, what it should express, follow hints that are given to try and get the bigger picture. It freaked me out, scared me to death. A roller coaster ride from the very beginning and you do hope it might end every second. Once finished,exhausted and disturbed, I was glad it was over and I survived... Not that I am not into a good shocker or can't handle the ones I have seen before butthis is something new. A modern gothic horror that leaves many questions unanswered but this exactly makes it worth watching it another time...if youdare to go through all this again... I am burning for to get it on DVD , even though I know what happened and how it ended I don't know anything,want to solve the mystery behind Samaras existence, the reason for what she did, what Rachel's intentions are, what role the Innkeeper played and howwho could have been saved and more victims be avoided... With its special effects, back flashes and "art-student-like" video shots this is something new in the era of horror/thriller films it occupies you from the very first shot until the very last. Even though I felt like I knew what happens next all the time during the movie, it came even worse and more terrifying. But the less you know about this one and the less you expect the better...so get in there, watch it and think about how you feel like the next seven daysonce you've made it... if you'll make it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The Ring yesterday. Pretty scary. I'm glad I hadn't listened to the numerous voices saying it wasn't that great. It wasn't great - at least, not in the same way as a perfect movie like The Sixth Sense, to which this film owes some debt, such as in the creepy-boy-harbingering-evil-spirits department. It was jumbled and contained some story threads that had you analyzing whether the plot truly made sense, or whether it was a product of kitchen-sink horror-moviemaking. And sometimes, you feel a bit like Atlas trying to keep all your disbelief suspended. Like when that creepy midget-boy is talking, and you can't decide whether to be creeped out, or whether the makeup artist should be censured for having put way too much purple blush around his eyes. Still, at its core this is a scary flick which I'm glad I saw. Especially enthralling is the videotape which, according to the plot of the film, causes you to die if you watch it. Modeled after early 20th Century Surrealist films, it definitely grabs. It kinda makes you wish the whole movie were filmed like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere near as scary as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes of movies are often considered to pale in comparison to the original. In this case, The Ring has gone beyond pale. It's practically transparent. Case in point: I gave the original Ringu a 9; this movie I'm giving a 2. To be fair, if I had not watched the original movie before this one, I would probably give it a few more pointsSo where does this movie go wrong? I would say most of the fault lies with the director, Gore Verbinski, and his, well, chosen direction for the movie. He's taken one of the best horror movies out there, and art house-ified it. The result is a movie with luxurious cinematography but horribly inopportune splicing. In virtually every scene that's supposed to build to a scare, the movie ducks out before the payoff. And the montage that's on the cursed video simply looks like a collection of random shots, whereas the original montage looked appropriately like a portent of doom. The screenplay for this movie mirrors the original significantly. Unfortunately, I didn't care for the deviations the writer made. I don't recall too much of Ringu, having watched it years ago, but I'm pretty sure the horses weren't part of it and the boy wasn't psychic. I felt they were diversions that distracted from the main Samara plot. And oh yes, "Samara" doesn't sound half as creepy as "Sadako," not to mention how much creepier Sadako looked too. The only thing I liked about the plot was that it managed to explain the aspects of the curse decently, including stuff I didn't catch in the first movie like the symbolism of the ring.It's terribly frustrating, trying to understand The Ring's appeal, particularly since most of the people who've seen it say it's scary. I reckon that if they ever watched Ringu, they'd have a heart attack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh yes, my friends and I have wanted to see this movie for forever, and we finally went last night. I was surprised the actual videotape didn't have anything really scarey in it, even though the first time they showed it my friends and I watched it through our fingers, waiting for something to jump out. But that woman brushing her hair in the mirror was so creepy! ugh. I also liked how eventually the main character saw all the things from the videotape. Very nice. But the guy in the bathtub was just gross. When the girl crawled out of the TV I started shouting at the screen without realizing it and my friends told me later the whole theater was laughing at me. The fact that they were hitting me should have tipped me off. The long hair in front of Samara's face was very nicely done. Added to the creepiness. I was also thinking after the movie how I had never heard that name before, and it is probabley because they wanted to pick some obscure name so no little girl would think she was evil. I didn't like how the movie felt like it ended after she rescued Samara's body from the well. But then again the real ending was very good. But why was Samara in white, and Anne was in black? That was backwards, I thought. As some other reviewer mentioned what was with the clerk at the cabins, I would like to know that, and about the girlfriend of Noah as well. Why did it show her going up there after he died? Maybe to show that if he would have showed her the tape he would have lived. I really liked the room in the barn. And another reviewer mentioned the sounds, and I noticed throughout it sounded like there was a film projecter at different parts in the movies. Hey, how did they get a horse to swim? THAT was scarey, having a horse chasing you. Alright, this review is so random I better end it.</fullReview>

Makes sense.Then we have flies coming out of TVs. Ok maybe this is from the well - but a little more explanation?How was the video tape made? Why was it made? Who made it?And probably the funniest thing in the whole movie - the blurred faces? Where the hell's the explanation of that? They can't take a photo or video of their face because it's blurred? They used that idea in the first maybe 30 minutes of the movie and then dropped it completely?How was she able to kill them? How did she make their heart stop? Was it her soul? Was she a ghost? Did she have some real life contact who was committing all the murders?! WHAT WAS IT!This movie is so full of plot holes it's not even funny. I laughed at this movie where I should have been scared. It's a joke, The Sixth Sense walks ALL over this movie. They're incomparable.Yet another pathetic teen horror movie. *sigh*</fullReview>

It all comes down to a final 20 minutes that will have you squirming and screaming in your seat.Martin Henderson, Brian Cox, Daveigh Chase, and newcomer David Dorfman give god supporting performances (especially Chase and Henderson).No blood, no big name stars, just atmosphere, dread, and a great film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After recently seeing The Ring, it is not since The Blair Witch Project that I have been scared and freaked out so much by a horror film. After the endless array of horror films that rely on people bumping into each other or the use of orchestral blastings after a period of silence, The Ring creates one of the most unnerving cinematic experiences ever and having none of the latter cheap scare devices.After just seeing the Japanese version, there are few differences between the two but as a gasp to many other horror fans, I do prefer the US version. I thought the screenplay was more in depth and the changes and additions writer Ehren Kruger composed, really added an edge to the original story of The Ring. Although the well scenes were more chilling in the Japanese version, The Ring was a film which really needed a bigger budget and more polished visuals to suck the most juice of of the story's great potential and the US version perfected it without ruining it with the usual loudness, gloss and insubtlety.Never seeing director Gore Verbinsky's previous work, i was extremely impressed. After the 'Scream' influenced opening, I'd have to say it had me on the edge of my seat more than the 3 Scream films combined. His use of little music, unnerving sound effects and the splashes of stylish transitions and shots were very beneficial to create the extremely creepy atmosphere. Along with the help of cinematographer Bojan Bazelli, The film features a very dull and overcast look which in such scenes as the horse sequence, add elements of mystique and coldness.Overall The Ring is an excellent film that creates the atmosphere and genuine scares that horror films have lacked for years. With various complaints of plot holes and seldom explanations for plotlines, it IS a horror film, there will always be plotholes to make the film more entertaining and if people always need plots spoonfed to them, wait for the next wave of Summer blockbusters in 2003. With the jawdropping ending, accomplished acting, It provides a twisting and chilling experience that many of us have waited for in a horror film for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that I am a big fan of horror movies and when such a movie comes along that is done right, it gets really exciting. THE RING is a great thriller that really gets your blood pumping. Each scene is one suspense master after the next.A great thing about this movie is the fact that there is actually some thought in it. The plot advances as the film goes, which is usually unlikely in horror movies and to my surprise this film did not base its scares on gore (for the most part).I have heard some people compare this movie to this years earlier release FEARDOTCOM. This movie is nothing like FEARDOTCOM and to compare it to such a horribly made movie is an insult. THE RING takes the audience and while proving to be an effectively scary movie, it really keeps you interested from start to finish.My only complaint about this movie is that there are a lot of questions that were never answered, or things that just did not make sense. The movie ends with a great compilation scene however, you realize that there are a lot of holes that did not fill. Although, it did make for great discussion on the way home.This movie will definitely be on my to buy list and is quite worth the price of admissionA great horror flick but because of the unanswered points to the movie I give THE RING a 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't terribly impressed by this film. Although it's well produced and surprisingly convincing despite it's overly fantastic premise, there are far too many contrived plot conveniences that the audience is expected to either naively accept or overlook entirely.The story involves a videotape that grants the viewer only 7 days to live after watching it. The origin of this tape is vaguely explained, but the origin of its creator is not. The audience is expected to accept--Deus Ex Machina--that the creator is simply evil, and for all intents and purposes, magic. Why the creator chooses to torment those that watch her tape is not explained. How the creator is able to kill the viewers of the tape is yet another mystery. Indeed, the mysteries build up as the movie progresses (I won't spoil the surprise by revealing these mysteries), but very few are fully explained in the end.Overall, the story is well filmed, and there are some truly unnerving scenes (my favourite involving a horse on a ferry), but there are too many unexplained plot features. Perhaps this is what happens when one builds a story around a somewhat silly premise.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having gone to see "The Ring" on Friday night, I decided to see if other people felt the same I did about the movie, and hoped to find some answers to the many questions I had to ask. I was not disappointed opinion-wise, contrasting and contradictory opinions litter the comments board. But answers I found none. Similar confusion? Plentyful.I was overall both incredibly impressed and slightly disappointed with "The Ring". It disturbed me immensely, more than most horror/thriller films even come close to doing. The cinematography, direction, sound effects, acting and soundtrack were overwhelmingly effective and left me feeling chilled. I got my money's worth of scare factor, that i know for sure. Many people have said that this film bored them, or didn't frighten them, and I have to ask - were they watching the same film, did they have earplugs or am I just easily perturbed?I don't know whether to be impressed or disappointed with the unfinished/unpolished sense I get from the plot of the film. It is a clever marketing ploy that you spend that much time ruminating over the powers of Samara. I, for one, have spent the past few days thinking carefully about why there were so many plotholes that need to be filled. They could so easily have made everything clear, but that would have made the film less powerful, memorable and interesting wouldn't it?I understood the ending perfectly, I think. I cannot see why anyone would be confused by the ending, but maybe I have missed something along the way. I ask myself questions about everything else in the film, but not the conclusion. I do wish it had ended the first time it appeared to, and not the second, but found the real conclusion to be just as satisfying intellectually. I suggest this film if you wish to be frightened and can easily suspend disbelief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring is the scariest movie I have seen, perhaps ever. It was so well made it had me and the rest of the audience to constantly on edge waiting for the next scary thing to happen! The Ring tells the story of a reporter named Rachel (Naomi Watts) who while investigating the strange death of her 16 year old niece discovers a tape she and her 3 friends (who are also dead.) watched a week ago. She watches the tape herself, which contains strange images of a woman, dead horses and a lighthouse to name a few as well as a ring shape. After watching the movie the phone rings telling her she has 7 days to live. Rachel starts on a mission to discover the meaning of the movie and who made it and why before her 7 days are up and she dies. The movie contains so many plot twists and turns after this, delivering up scary and scarier things that leave you completely freaked out and chilled to the bone. The final ending (a HUGE plot twist that turns the ending from a semi-happy one to a terrifying one) had me just horrified. You will never look at a tv set the same way again. This movie is definetly worthy of being called a horror, it relys on the sharp wit of the writers and director to create some very chilling scares rather than gory blood and guts. The pacing of this film was perfect, leaving you on edge almost the entire film. The acting while not excellent was impressive, if you are of a faint heart I don't recomend this movie; it will scare you in a psychological way and trust me it leaves the theatre with you! Excellent horror, SO SCARY!!!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring: 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aren't you glad that they have DVDs now? In Gore Verbinski's The Ring, viewers of a special videotape of seemingly unrelated shots get a phone call saying "seven days", meaning they have seven days to live. That's right. Mr. Budweiser Frogs and Mr. Mouse Hunt made this movie. Quite a transition.Naomi Watts, fresh from Mulholland Drive, plays skeptic newspaper reporter Rachel Keller. She hears about the videotape at a niece's funeral, and decides to investigate. And what does Ms. Smart do? She watches the tape and she gets the phone call. Oy, she'll regret that.The Ring, put in one word, is scary. It checks off the four ills: chills, thrills, spills, and yes, even a few kills. There are many, many tense scenes and scenes that make you jump (or scream, whichever type you are). I'm the jumping type, but in some parts my mouth was open. That's how scary it was. On the downside of the creepiness, Verbinski made too many jump scenes. If he had concentrated on putting on a few more sustained thrills, that would have helped.Watts wasn't super or anything, but she was serviceable. Martin Henderson, as Noah, a partner, was the same, nothing to write home about. Their son Aidan, played David Dorfman, made me think of him as a cross between Haley Joel Osment and a Disney cartoon. He had the look (and at the funeral, was exactly the same way) and he had huge eyes. And speaking of cartoons, I just noticed that Daveigh Chase, from Lilo and Stitch and Spirited Away plays Samara, a very important part of the movie.In a small but important role, Brian Cox plays Richard Morgan, Samara's father. He seemed to do like Donnie Wahlberg did for The Sixth Sense, playing a small part but obviously working hard to perform it. Cox seems to be the hardest working man in showbiz now.The runtime could have been trimmed by a little, but The Ring still kept engrossed me for two hours. It is the type of movie that will either keep you up at night or give you nightmares. Or both.The Ring doesn't really give you any characters to connect with. There aren't many, but some of the time used unnecessarily could have been used with characterization or time to feel for and with the characters.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for scares, violence, ickyness, and some language.</fullReview>

Although there could've been things that could be better there was in fact nothing that could've been better about this film other than the fact that the Japanese original is fantastically much more horrorifying, although American adaptions generally are terrible, this was quite close to the original and was good.Although many may not agree, the most terrifying part was in fact the bit where Sadako, no I mean Samara came out of the television. It was extremely well shot and to be honest with you. the make up on Samara was better than when Sadako came out of the television.It was excellent, and it is my movie now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean that in a good way. I had already heard that this movie was unsettling and I had pictured in my mind a scene similar to a website I saw a few months ago. The image of a trashed and dilapidated room suddenly flickers something unexpected. This movie was even more chilling.I agree that the plot in no way borrows from The Sixth Sense, although the creepy, staticky TV brings back memories of Poltergeist. One thing this movie shares with The Sixth Sense is its timing. Like that movie, the big scares in this movie aren't necessarily from something suddenly jumping out. Instead a mood of horrible anticipation is built and then some slight appearance, perhaps in the background, makes your heart skip a beat. Even the surrealistic movie-within-the-movie conveys a powerful menace without being overtly horrific. I suspect some subsonics for mood enhancement but the haunting cello music track works very well.As far as the plot being incomprehensible, I think things are explained very well. Almost too well. I think the sense of evil would have carried through without the psychically-sensitive boy explaining it all. The "ring" is not what you think.</fullReview>

Overall, the story was well developed, the acting was great and the imagery in the movie was perfect.

		<fullReview>The Ring isn't scary.It's hard to believe Rachel, played by Naomi Watts, is a mother. She's too hot. As she gets dressed for the wake she looks more like a teenage drug-skinny rave veteran than a mother. My mother's dumpier anyway. The director sent mixed messages at any rate. More damning, Naomi's acting faltered in the tender scenes with the child (otherwise a great performance). She seemed more like a timid babysitter - something the director should have known to avoid given the genre. The casting of the little kid was terrible. He looked distractingly NOT like the mother.Cinematically the movie is strong. It had a certain "grownup" balance to it. I don't know how to put it. In painting there is the "figure/ground problem" where ostensibly you're trying to balance the subject and background so that when you look at the painting it's complex in how to determine where to focus the eye - producing a pleasurable coup d' oeil. I don't know if that analogy quite turns the corner, but hay, I'm just a guy with a computer. There was just something very consistent and correct in the look and feel of the cinematography.Ironically, the unexplained loose ends in the plot are too numerous to be considered as detrimental to the movie. I think of it as part of the genre, a poetic license - artistic polysemy.SPOILERSI know it's a remake but ooooooh it would have been great to changed the story. Rachel should have instead used a plastic bag and killed HER kid, passing on that unspeakable evil. To find out firsthand why the mother Morgan killed the little girl "that's all she ever wanted". That would have fixed both the ugly kid and the china doll mother problems. Much like how Brad Pitt was discordant throughout Se7en allowing for a Hemingway-esq black-hat / white-hat swap at the end of the movie. The Ring could have been so over the top brilliant with a twist like that.There were certain I-am-woman-hear-me-roar decisions that were made when making this movie that just didn't work for me. For example, Rachel's untimely fearlessness in the presence of Richard Morgan (the other father) after he had just struck her to the ground. She gets up and blindly charges after the guy. What was that statement? That kind of detached fem-bravado tacked onto a character so often comes across more as a feminist political statement rather than true-blue character development. Or worse yet, a studio's marketing department effort to try and. "penetrate" the tuff-girl market segment. She shouldn't have fallen down with a broken heal either but SOMEONE has to come up with a smarter way to represent fem-heroes.And what's up with the apparent justification, if not glorification, of a single mother with a son that has no relationship with his father - even though the father is ever present. Both mother and father were impersonally called by their first names by the child. Noah (the father) doesn't have a last name in the credits - which means what? That the audience can decide for themselves whether sons/wives should take a father's last name? The whole dynamic between the mother/son/father was just really bad. I hope they had a bunch of scenes that had to be cut or something (i.e. an excuse) because if they were shooting for what they got - Lord help them.It's interesting to note that "Morgan" is the most popular surname for neo-pagan Wiccans - by far. It's a common joke in the community actually. Furthermore, the movie contained many ideas tied to ancient pagan ritual (note squarely I said pagan, not neo-pagan). The sacrifice of a child near/in water is an ancient act. The letting of blood (bloody nose) by the victims is another, particularly of a child. The children's names, Aidan, Samara, and Becca are dark monikers - juxtaposed to Noah and Richard, the two fathers. The apparently obscure reference to a specific tree is yet another pagan reference - as many pagans worshiped in groves. The leaves color signified Fall and a full moon in Autumn is when you might perform a ritual sacrifice. think about it. Why did the mother kill her daughter anyway? Why to better the crops and prevent evil from coming to the island - of course - pagan all the way. The Ring itself signifies a full moon. And the two mothers were clearly "Dianic". This whole paragraph is hooey (my contribution to myth) but it might be interesting to think about.The movie is entertaining, to be sure, BUT anyone who says The Ring is "one of the best movies ever made" probably lives in a covered well - or at any rate is a moviechild that should be ritualistically sacrificed to improve the text crops in the world of IMDB.

		<fullReview>Having seen the impressive "Ringu" first, I was quite against it being remade into an English version because I thought it would not have the same intensity as "Ringu" did. However, as the positive reviews came in, I began to warm to the idea. So, last night, with a friend in tow, I went to see Gore Verbinski's latest cinematic effort... and I was very pleasently surprised with the result.Although it starts off in the style of a teen kill movie, it swiftly takes a left turn and delves into a darker, more intense movie. Verbinski's expert directing and the neat work from the cast really had me compelled throughout the entire movie. Naomi Watts, of the "Mulholland Drive" fame delivers a solid portrayal of a diligent and intelligent journalist Rachel Keller who, at the same time is not exactly the most attentive mother of her son, Aidan (David Dorfman). However, her attitude and priorities change when, investigating the shocking and mysterious death of her niece, she watches a video tape that her niece and her boyfriend watched 7 days prior to their deaths. Rachel is skeptical, but at the same time very curious as to how a video tape can herald the death of anyone who watches it. After watching the notorious and disturbing tape, Rachel recieves a deadly phone call notifying Rachel of imminent death within 7 days. From there, it becomes a race against time for Rachel, and when Aidan and her ex-lover Noah (Martin Henderson) watches the video, her search becomes more frantic. As they piece together the clues as to what the images in the tape mean and how to avert their deaths, Rachel discovers all is not what it seems.I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Although it did not have the EXACT same intensity as "Ringu" this film was chock-a-block full of suspense and did not rely on liberal use of gore, swearing and T&amp;A unlike other "horror" films. The chief characters in this film are nicely fleshed out by their respective actors and actresses that I actually felt for them in the various situations that they encounter.Out of 5, I give "The Ring": ****</fullReview>

Two minutes later I took that back, and sat transfixed to the screen, afraid to watch, afraid to shut my eyes (unlike my companion in the seat next to me, who assumed the feotal possition for 95% of the film).Perhaps the creepiest part was the tape itself, and I walked out with a strong desire to hire the Japanese films on DVD and get the full story, rather than wait for the next film (which there no doubt will be, knowing Hollywood and its ability to ruin a good film in order to get a great franchise). Would you know it? None of my local video stores had the DVDs AT ALL! Which really annoyed me, because I am really intrigued by the whole idea.I liked the reference to rear window, with the man in the cast. To the "constructive criticsm": The plot was easily deciphered. I managed to string together everything 25 minuted before the climax of the film (and I am NOT talking about the ending.) Things neatly fell into place for me.I should like to compare the USA version to the Jap, and the original text, and see if it was realy easy to solve, or if the US version fell short due to writers dumbing down the text so that every Tom Dick and Harry will be able to understand it, even if they have had their eyes poked out and their ears blown off. An above average pyscological thriller could have become a GREAT one, with a much tighter, interlectual script (like "The Usual Suspects" crossed with "The Shining"). But "The Ring" was a fresh idea, with an interesting plot and impressive visuals. It was a nice change from the Hohum prequel to a brilliant thriller of 1992. Worthy use of my $10.50</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was also one of the many who thought this movie would suck, but I was pleasantly wrong in my original thought. The first ten minutes, while poor in acting, give you a sense of fear and wonder as to what the tape and the girls death have to do with each other. Why does this tape make you die? What follows is a great suspense story with a truely unique style that will keep you guessing until the end. Granted, we never do find out who made the tape, but it's cool to see the main characters explore and go deeper into the meaning behind it. There are some great special effects (the girl coming out of the TV was especially freaky) and the ending is truely ambiguous in that you don't really know what to think. I love movies where the good guys win, but the bad guys win too. Watch this film and pray that they make the sequel and prequel as they did with the Japanese version Ringu.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reviews for this movie are hilarious. "Scarier than The Sixth Sense". "Doesn't have any comic relief whatsoever". And the funniest of them all? "It's bad". I don't recall ever being so scared at a movie since I hit the age of maybe 11, and for a PG-13 no less? Not much blood, but amazing sound work and visuals, as well as a superb plot, leave it as one of the best movies of the year. Plus there were the occasional joke that left the audience cracking up. A good portion of the movie I saw through my hat, but I was standing and applauding as it ended. It makes the Sixth Sense look like Purple People Eater (no offense to PPE). 10 outta 10.

And I'm 21 years old. This will probably be considered the scariest movie of all time by many.It seemed so real, and the imagery was so intense.

		<fullReview>Not since "The Omen" has a movie disturbed me as this one did. There was just something about this movie that touched a chord with me. The night I saw this movie, I remember replaying various aspects of it in my head. I definitely did not get as much sleep as I had wanted to. However, I get the sense that this is a love/hate kind of movie, with people very polarized in their view points towards it. This is based not only on the comments posted, but on the fact that my spouse pretty strongly disliked this movie. All I can say is see the movie for yourself, and make your own decision. It's worth it. However, do yourself a favor, and don't see it on VHS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for young children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are one of those parents that insist on bringing young children to the movies, don't bring them to this one, or they will be in your bed at night for about 10 years. This movie is truly scary. I don't often watch horror films, because most of them are garbage. Friday the 13th and Freddie Kruger movies come to mind. However, this one is terrific. When I watched the beginning scene with the 2 teen girls alone at night, I feared I was in for a real letdown. What a great diversionary tactic, because the film uses that clich as a launching pad for a very eerie and creepy 2 hours of pure edge of your seat scares. It didn't have to have someone axed or butchered by Michael Meyers every few minutes. It performs like a true horror movie should. The Ring moves methodically, letting the suspense boil like a pot of water, taking it's time, then bubbling over. The images are nightmarish, but spectacular. I felt like I was on the trip with Rachel the entire time. You will either love or hate THE RING (based on what I have read so far here on IMDB), however, I really enjoyed the film. One question: if I transferred or ripped the tape onto a DVD, and posted it on Kazaa/Morpheous, would it still work? Maybe we should broadcast the `tape' on AL-Jazeera TV in hopes that we could get Bin Laden that way.</fullReview>

The first few minutes into the movie and I see how the movie was carried out, I knew that I will be in for a long boring sleep session. When the girls heard the phone rang and they were spooked to get it and later found out it was her parent, I was about to leave the cinema. The rest of the movie was just a thriller investigation of what 'the ring' is.I have never feel so strong negatively in my opinions towards a movie before, but this is the first one. (Not even towards Eight Legged Freaks) I thought it was really a waste of my time and degrading my intelligence. The only good part of the movie was a few seconds near the end...but of course, the damage was done...it is infact a serious joke this movie is 7.9 HIGHER than The Birds and Rope by Hitchcock. Now that is very scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a few brief thoughts... In my opinion the ORIGINAL Japanese version of this movie (Ringu, 1998) is much better. There is also a Japanese sequel which is equally good (Ringu 2, 1998). The prequel (Ringu 0, 2000) is somewhat more strained although it tries to explain the history of why things happened in the other two movies. The American version of the film is a direct copy of the Japanese one, and not nearly as good. The only hassle with the Japanese version is having to read the sub-titles. Perhaps I will try to learn Japanese before watching it again. :)</fullReview>

The cinematography is quite impressive, and several paranormal scenes give you the chills and will, in fact, get you to squirm in your seat. Watch it with someone because you will need an arm to hold when Samara makes her moves... just thinking about it makes me shiver.Those who "didn't understand" the plot of the movie are not to be paid attention to.

		<fullReview>The PG-13 rating got me thinking the film was going to be another awful teen slasher flick, and for the first 30 mins. that's what I though I was in for. However, after the first time the audience sees what "The Ring" (i.e.video) can do, my expectations were raised, as was my attention. The editing is wonderful; fast-paced, cutting, almost violent. The film relies on this among other excellent methods of filmmaking. The film's use of dak color allows for a macabre, creepy, morose, and unsettling feel. The fluidity of motion sustains the high level suspense. What you think is just another ferry ride turns into a first rate chase scene featuring a horse gone mad from an unknown, but malevolent force. This is why the filmmakers could get away with a PG-13 rating. The film is sophistcated; a cut above the rest of other low-grade horror movies because it doesn't need obligatory, bloody, body gashing scenes to provide the audience with a scare factor. The "video tape" is itself a wonderful example of filmmaking. It has an edgy, artsy feel to it. In fact, some of the images in the video aren't fully explained. Some of the images are simply weird and disturbing, but because the images are so striking, they deny need for full explantion. There are a few aspects of The Ring that aren't explained at all, but because they are so visually appealing and shocking, the need for detailed explanation is often not necessary. What I thought was most powerful about the film was the antagonist. It is truly evil, and evil for so many reasons including the fact that the evil is almost omnipotent in nature. It knows where to get you. Victims are killed mercilessly not because they are torn apart or cut in half by some hockey mask wearing man, but because death is the only thing that's certain when the onslaught of The Ring's power is unleashed. The victim is faced with a raw, merciless, and ugly death. And because the origin of the evil is not explained, this adds to the omnious enviroment the film is saturated with. This film is disturbing, and that is where the film's power comes from. Watch The Ring for the adrenalin rush; don't try to make sense out of it. Let it take you where it will, and you will enjoy it much more. The Ring stirs the senses, making us supremely aware of all the things in our world we can't explain. And what we have no explantion for, we are often at the mercy of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt it is a scary movie but then what else are the horror movies suppose to do ? The end of the movie is quite abrupt and the director of the movie has left it to the imagination of audiences to keep guessing what was really behind all the suspense. The end of the movie is still not clear to me.If anyone can explain it to me I would be grateful :) but then I am ready to debate. At one point of time, around 15 minutes before the movie actually ends, I thought that the movie was over and appeared to make somewhat sense but then everything became confusing afterwards, thanks to the non-sense imagination of the director.I went with two other friends to see it and each one of us had a different opinion regarding the plot of the movie.You will certainly be engrossed in it throughout but then the end will make you kinda upset.It's upto an individual to decide whether to see it or not.Certainly not to my expectations as I feel it is much more hyped than what it actually is.--Rajat Tripathi</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not the Lord of the Ring or the Beethoven classic but actually more like the one around the rosie, but I'm getting way ahead of the story. This well-conceived and -executed film is worth a bowl of popcorn on a stormy night which gives away my sentiment that "The Ring" would be more effective as a video than a feature film. The "killer VCR" theme demands it.Terrifying death has been visited on several teens who dare to view an avant-garde tape of mysterious origins. The deaths are sudden and mysterious to pique the interest of a local tabloid journalist (Naomi Watts) who happens to be the aunt of one of the "scared-to-deaths." This explains her initial curiosity but the clues are sufficient to elicit a dogged pursuit of the story. This is a scary story that engages the audience as you see the clues and the race against the curse that promises to kill our fair investigative journalist before she solves it. And if the screams of the teens in the theater are any gauge, it is effective."The Ring" may have had the makings of a cult thriller, but its commercial success has already ruined that status. The premise is suited to an indie whose notoriety is developed by word-of-mouth and slipped to the next viewer who is cautioned to watch it at his/her own risk. But that would screw up all those royalties. So don't feel bad if you miss this as a first-run flick. "The Ring" will improve with age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, better than Ringu, does NOT ripoff Sixth, etc</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked The Ring. It wasn't as scary as I was expecting, with the good thrills only in the beginning and the last 20 minutes. Most of the middle was fairly slow. I also watched Ringu yesterday. My impression of Ringu is that, in comparison, it's a rawer, unfinished work. The Ring is a better movie. Ringu offers nothing extra in scares or story, and The Ring seems to pull the mystical elements together better, and benefits from higher production values and effects. Ringu was dull in one place it shouldn't have been - when they get to the well. Oh, boy, 10 minutes of them hoisting buckets of water out. The Ring was much more effective. As for those here and in the media that claim The Ring rips off other movies such as The Sixth Sense (1999) and Blair Witch (also 1999), note that RINGU was made in 1998, predating both of those, so the mystical kid and the grainy video were not copied from those movies. Many of the key images, such as of the well, and Samara walking towards &amp; out of the TV, are right from RINGU. And, watching some of the best parts of The Ring again today, I got to say that Naomi Watts has one of THE BEST screams in movie history!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring plays out like a movie written by a computer that was fed the plots of the top-grossing horror movies of the last 5 years and from those details randomly generated a "story": the boy who communicates with dead people from The Sixth Sense; the videotape from The Blair Witch Project; the dying teens and prying reporter of Scream; the murderous mother of The Others: stick it all in a blender, run on high for 60 seconds, and the mush left at the bottom is The Ring.This is a film that, when done, simply doesn't make any sense. Some movies leave you scratching your head, but The Ring only leaves you scratching your derriere. This is such an helter-skelter exercise in everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink screenwriting that you've quit trying to make sense of things long before the credits roll. I'm tempted to call the writing adolescent, but that's a disservice to the adolescents in the audience whom I saw the film with: they were snickering at this ludicrous movie long before the adults caught on to what a stinker we were in for.Somebody poured a lot of money into this silly mess, though, and it shows on the screen. The film is crafted with the care of overwrought appetizers served at an uptown art opening. Every beam of light is in place, and the camera adopts stylish angles, almost none of which are relevant to the storytelling, but which fill the viewer with the same vulgar pleasure as watching a well-made beer commercial.It isn't all bad, though. The dripping, creepy images -- centipedes, drowned children, and more -- can't help but effect you on a visceral level. It's just not storytelling. It's cinema as a series of moody vignettes with the story as an afterthought to try to justify the endeavor according to classical moviemaking tenets. The Ring is the horror movie equivalent of softcore: a guilty pleasure that isn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie having only seen the previews for it, and had no idea that this was a remake of a Japanese movie (no, I am not Japanese). I am a huge horror/suspense fan and am not rattled by much. As the movie opened, the whole time limit on when one was going to die reminded me of Feardotcom, which I thought was incredibly stupid. So I thought that it would be sort of like that, and it was. Hear about a movie that kills people, try to make it so that it doesn't. I was not prepared for what was on the movie, nor the journey that the main character would have to take to make it right. The main character was very strong, and, being a female in a horror flick, did do some of the typical female things (i.e., watching the movie). But I was pretty amazed by this movie. I definitely wasn't prepared for the ending. By the end of it, my heart was racing and I was scared to go home alone. And the subliminal images (yes, there were subliminals) were a good touch. I saw one of them, and none of the three people I was with did. I felt that the movie did a great job with the story. Even though there were holes, it didn't hurt it. I left trying to figure a few things out. It really made me wonder, and I like that about a scary movie. I haven't had real nightmares from a movie since Candyman came out (I was 12). I still haven't been around a T.V. alone.</fullReview>

(And was as much fun seeing the second time).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is easily the most over-hyped piece of cinema I have ever seen. I went in expecting to have the holy popcorn scared out of me, like a reviewer said. Did I? Nope. Yes, the tape was kind of creepy, and the noise that played during the tape, but pretty much everything else about it sucked. The acting was good, though, and so was the plot. However, they don't explain a damn thing. For instance: Who made the tape? Who calls you when you watch the tape? Why hasn't anyone in the movie ever heard of star-six-nine? *SPOLIER, I SUPPOSE* And when Rachel says, "What did I do that he didn't?", she comes to the conclusion that she made a copy. Well, yeah, AND you went down in the well and held the girl's corpse. And anyway, it's impossible to see a ring of light when you push a lid onto a well AFTER you see the half-moon shape. I'm warning you, don't waste your time. 4/10, and I'm feeling generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so excited when I heard about The Ring, and that Gore Verbinski was the director to it. I went into the theater expecting to see a tight suspenseful film, on the lines of Sixth Sense and What Lies Beneath. Instead I was left with an empty feeling and a 'so-what' attitude towards the film. The film is full of holes and unanswered questions, it left me unimpressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what a scary movie should do to you..."Its a videotape of someones nightmare"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>None of us likes to admit to being scared. Maybe a little uneasy, maybe a little tens, but not scared, not grown up me. The truth is, we all experience fear, embracing that fact is what makes the Ring so enjoyable.In my view the best scary movies are the ones that really start to get scary after the credits have rolled.The ones that are at their most frightening in that last moment before you turn the bedside light off... That are at their most frightening when you walk down the darkened hallway to your bedroom after turning the lights off... That are at their most scary when you wake to a noise in the night KNOWING its just the house cooling... That are at their most frightening when their memories come to you in the moments before dawn. Images that take only a few seconds to pass on big screen but have the time to stir languidly in our dreams, making us toss and turn.The ring may not be a scarefest, nor gory, not lighthearted. But it is un-nerving, a rare treat in this age of the feel good flicks. The kind of movie children should not watch, for it will give them nightmares. The kind of movie that will raise the hair on you back from time to time as another frightening scene is recalled (especially the video of "the nightmare").As with all great movies there is passionate discussion as to its value, but only a dullard could see no value in the well directed and ultimately disturbing and frightening piece of work.Spoiler: One point many critics have touched on is the supposed scariness of the tape and why the child would even make a tape. I implore you to watch the film again and listen to what she has to say in her interrogation, and note who her only "friend" in the barn loft is alluded to being. This film does make certain sense, and that is what is all the more frightening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very scary, but leaves you with lots of unanswered questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without doubt, I can call this movie the scariest to hit the theaters this year. A must-watch if you're a fan of horror movies. Or even if you're a viewer like me that goes in to watch the movie not knowing the genre, and ends up watching the movie holding onto the person that came with you because you're freaked out.The direction is great, and unlike some other gory and scary movies *cough*Ghost Ship*cough*, there is actually a plausible story...one that should have ended 10 minutes before it actually did though. Those last ten minutes in the movie changed the rating I gave it from a 9 to a 7. Those last 10 minutes without which the movie would have a near great ending.Walking out of the movie with a heartbeat that slowly returns to almost-normal, you think back about the images that the movie left you with in your head that will haunt you for a couple more days, and all the unanswered questions that you hear everyone around you ask. Where did that videotape come from? Who shot it? Who is the little girl? How did the old man know about the tape? How does the little boy know everything? Why did they decide to call the movie 'the ring'? Why didn't they use pictures of David Hasselhoff to create some of the scary party in the movie? Why do the Germans love him so much?A strong 7.5/10. If you plan to go to dinner after the movie, forget it. If you ate dinner before the movie, carry a brown bag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring is a pretty solid idea, reminiscent of The Changeling with George C. Scott, and the story keeps you interested. The acting was fine, given the rather poor, at times, dialogue the actors had to work with. It just fell short on actually scaring the audience, unlike the Changeling, and wasn't able to convince me how terribly frightening such a situation would be, if indeed ghosts were real and cared to scare anybody. Other than that it was a fine movie and worth a shot, but I do have a problem with Hollywood's insistence that it pours when it rains here in Seattle. It doesn't pour here, it just drizzles mostly, or softly rains.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment Rings Loudly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've given up on seeing widely distributed Horror genre films in the first few weekends because frankly the theaters are crammed with the types of people that ruin the movie going experience (talkers, cell phone ringers, teenagers). So I gave it a few weeks to catch "The Ring". Unfortunately my trip was ill timed to correspond with the release of "8 Mile" which, with its numerous sellouts, forced the same type of people into a second choice, my first choice "The Ring". I enjoyed Verbinski's "The Mexican", though I seemed to be in the minority of people who liked it, and now I'm apparently in the minority of people who didn't like this film. I probably suffered from the over hype that many of my friends have given this movie, and went in expecting something creepy, a cross between Sixth Sense and Seven and all the other disturbing movies that stick with you long after the credits roll. However "The Ring" is neither of those films, nor is it on the level of "Urban Legend" or other schlock spook fests. Instead it falls somewhere in between- an art film trying to make it mainstream. Too bad it failed for me miserably. Emily Watts was very wonderful playing the reporter trying to unravel the puzzle of the videotape of death (which I always thought was "Showgirls"). But beyond her performance there was little else for the film to hang its hat on besides some forced eerie footage on the evil tape, and some moody cinematography (which is the only real reason to see the film) with a nice homage to Hitchcock tucked neatly inside. I found the story rather weak, though it didn't completely leave me disinterested (again mainly due to Watts being very alluring). I don't mind a slow paced film either; in fact I rather enjoy it when it adds to the story. However, I thought the pacing was all over the place here. We have a story that should take place over 7 days (or at least the part post-teaser...it did in some respects feel like episodic television after all), yet it's not pace evenly. Either building slowly, with the later days stretching longer, or moving faster to place emphasis on the running out of time would, I think, help.With all this said, I'd still recommend the film for Watts and for the lushness of the cinematography. Beyond that, if you want to see a well crafted narrative that builds suspense without tricks, check out "Insomnia" instead.</fullReview>

The interesting thing about this movie is that everytime something scary happens it is accompanied by loud percussion, or some weird musical sound. Inotherwords, the scary sounds come before a calamity. I think the editors could have done a better job; showing us the priorities in time sequence; not in back clips. This is not a movie for kids under 12!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, the original "Ringu" is good, but COME ON!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm ridiculously exhausted from people referring everyone else to see the original because it's "so much better" and "way scarier". I have seen both films, and I really gotta say that the bastardized American version of "The Ring" is a better all-around flick.Not that "Ringu" is a bad movie, not at all. Despite a few changes, the basic story (even the pacing of the film) remain intact, almost identical altogether (see the opening scene with the two teenage girls in the beginning of both films). "Ringu" is still a good thrill ride.I think the US version of "The Ring" fills in a couple holes that original left maybe a bit too open-ended. More of the story behind Samara/Sadako is revealed; instead of wishing for the little girl to remain dead, you feel sorry for her and understand her reasons for doing what she does. Not only this but I think a bigger budget really helped out in the US version. The exaggerated deaths, creepier video, and surreal Samara/Sadako add quite a bit to the film (I don't think inverting the colors on the screen are a convincing way to show someone dying...).So see both movies, you'll like them both - but there's no way the US version takes away from "Ringu" - it's better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie ... but intensely terrifying?? I think not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw "The Ring" and I loved it ... the video itself was extremely disturbing as were several other scenes. And the overall atmosphere was extremely creepy, mostly due to the use of music and sound effects. But the film is nowhere near "intensely terrifying" or "the best horror film ever." I'd give it an 8, but there are many horror films that are much better ("The Shining," "Jacob's Ladder,"The Exorcist" "Last House on the Left") Who know's, maybe I've just seen too many horror movies to really be scared anymore. I just wasn't completely terrified. It's an excellent film, but not all it's hyped up to be. Maybe all that hype is what left me a little disappointed at the end. All I know is that I won't be scared everytime the phone rings or the TV shows static, like someone I know told me they were when they went home after seeing the movie. And by the way, to clear up another misconception, "Blair Witch Project" was not scary.</fullReview>

I thought by the end of the movie they would atleast tie the plot that made no sense up. Instead they just made it even more confusing. From what it looks they are going to try to make a sequel to the movie. if i had it over i wouldnt have wasted my money to see the first one. No matter how many times you watch the movie you wont ever figure it out. Movies are fine that leave it open for you to make up the connections or to figure out but good luck on this one. No one can explain this one. This movie should be classified as weird and freaky. I dont reccomend it if you haven't figured it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are not many cases in anything that where a copy/remake is as good as the original. The main reason I think is that the original gives you an experience that you never had before. That is why I would be tainted haven seen the original Ring. Ebay rules! (Don't get me started on Battle Royale.) The thrill is gone, somewhat. I will say this about this American version. I was suprised that it stayed with the slow buildup of the original movie. It did not try to get really exciting until it was necessary. I think it is hard to get an audience to stay with a film when it has such a buildup, especially post slasher quick fright films, like Halloween,Friday 13th, Nightmare.. Scream etc. The 10's are reserved for the Rosemary's Babys, Exorcist and the like. This movie is not in that category. But there are 2 aspects that are. 1. Rick Baker is a bitch. The little that you saw of his work in this movie substantiates his title as best in horror make up. 2. The music by Hans Zimmer was mesmorizing. It was in the same league as Tubular Bells of the Exorcist. It was so good, I stayed, as I usually do anyway until the end of the credits, just to hear the music; I mean that was just f**king scary. I will be buying the soundtrack</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a HUGE fan of the Japanese original version, so I was very skeptical as to whether the US remake could fill its shoes. While I'll admit the remake has some reasonably good moments, it seems that all the logic, intelligence and darkness of the original are sadly removed. The fact that the formerly clever title has been dumbed down to include a physical 'ring' within the film saddens me, and shows how condescending studios can be. The only part of the movie where I felt that sense of dread from the original was "that scene" towards the end. That was quite well done, but again didn't stand up to its predecessor. It was interesting to see that elements of 'Ring 2' were used in the film (the psychiatric hospital scene).Conclusion -- the main reason I felt compelled to write this is to urge anyone planning on seeing this to PLEASE see the original first! You'll be thankful you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rachel Keller is a single mother and journalist with a promising future until her entire world is flipped upside down by a videotape filled with disquieting images.After her niece, Katie, dies under mysterious circumstances, Keller (Naomi Watts in a stellar performance) begins to examine Katie and the final days of her life more closely. Only to stumble upon a legend involving a videotape which, after viewing, leads to a mysterious phone call where the recipient of the call is told he/she has seven days to live.Keller discovers the video, watches, and receives the phone call. Now she has seven days to unravel the mystery before death claims her life and the lives of those around her.As I mentioned before Watts as Keller delivers a superb performance. She carries the film effortlessly on her shoulders. But this I expected from the critically-acclaimed actress of "Mullholland Drive." What I did not expect, however, were the astonishing performances from the supporting cast. Especially the performances delivered by Martin Henderson as Noah, Rachel's ex-husband, and the underage talents David Dorfman and Daveigh Chase.Is "The Ring" an excellent film? Yes (One of the best I've seen in quite sometime). Will everyone who views it enjoy it? Probably not. Will it disturb you in some way? Most likely. But, like the videotape featured within the film, "The Ring" is much more than a series of disturbing images. It is something that can not be explained. Something unremarkably simple and, at the same time, utterly terrifying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw THE RING late last night at an Advance Screening, and I must say that I have never been so terrified. That's hard to admit - coming from an 18 year old male. I was shaking for the entire 107 minutes of film time, then all through the credits. I found my breathing patterns had slowed down, returned to normal, when I woke up this morning.I am quite a fan of the thriller/horror genre. SCREAM is one of my favourite movies. But I must say, no movie has ever really frightened me, and I was proud to admit that. I mean, JEEPERS CREEPERS was slightly creepy for a selected few moments, but the feeling passes quickly - and it was hardly there, anyway.I'm not going to give you a plot summary, an indepth analysis of the story. Those who are interested will go and see the movie. But I will say, the direction was fantastic. Gore Verbinski (The Mexican) did a fantastic job. Australian, Naomi Watts was nothing short of flawless. And that little creepy kid, Aidan, was very good, too.I have rated more than 300 movies on this website, but this is only the second time I have left a comment - I was THAT impressed with it.If you don't like horror films, you should still find this as a well-made piece of cinema. THE RING is still more than a 'dumb old horror flick'. It's clever, sharp, and just downright scary.Thankyou for your time.THE RING (2002) 10/10</fullReview>

Anyway, how did the evil girl work her bad magic while she was down the well. She really didn't have to be set free. Not scared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have to go see it again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So...I saw it, hoping for at LEAST a slight scare. To be honest, after spending a whole last semester and summer watching almost all "scary" movies in our video stores there were only a few SCENES in which I giggled nervously.So the ring: I was planning on seeing the Japanese version this summer, but decided to wait till the Hollywood version came out (mainly cause our video store doesnt have japanese subtitled movies) I brought a couple friends (its easier to NOT be scared with people you know around) Not that I really worried, but I didnt want to see it alone.Needless to say, I missed half the movie. After the first scene I began to learn that when a TV was in the room and I didnt want to get too freaked out I should close my eyes. (bad mistake) but it was impulse and I wish so bad I could have been a little less freaked out.In any case I came home SO excited. I had finally found a movie that gave me the shivers, though Ill HAVE to see it again seems how I missed so much. I would recomend it highly to anyone looking for a good thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring is the best horror movie ever! I loved it! I think it was great because it kept you guessing the whole{is that the right whole?} time and because it stayed on track. You know in movies you ALWAYS have to have romance? I hate that! And in this movie, it didn't happen. The movie was focused on its main point and I liked that. Plus I got a few screams in! But for those who are looking for a semi-scary movie, I don't think this is the one for you. I mean don't get me wrong, I probably wouldn't scream at all my second time seeing it. But anyway, it's a GREAT movie and I'm going to see it again. I just loved the ending!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, despite the bigger production budget this one really did not out do the original Japanese movie. The effects were not uncommon among Hollywood's productions these days. I feel that the ambience of the original story is missing. This played a very important role in the success of the original. The way the Japanese movie was filmed was relatively simple but very effective in overall effects.Don't get me wrong, the prequel and sequel of the Japanese "The Ring" did not strike me as being better in any way to the original. Of the 4 films I would probably place this one 2nd, but it definitely lacks what the riginal had.</fullReview>

The vagueness of the movie on specific subjects is what scares like for instance the actual tape that kills; it never shows how the ladder is standing up by itself or how the girl's image is in the mirror but no-one is actually there.

		<shortDescription>Very frightening - excellent atmosphere &amp; symbolism (some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I read another member's comments, which basically reduced The Ring to a series of cheap shots or 'jump out and scare you' moments. Nothing could be further from the truth. I found it to be lastingly frightening - independent of those few adrenaline moments. (I saw it on Saturday and I'm still counting my seven days!)A few 'scare you' moments -are- part the film, but they don't carry it. They're entirely appropriate and consistent with plot elements. The last major one (with the TV) is completely earned and still gives me chills when I think about it.The real success of this film is in its repetition of symbolic elements, its soundtrack and its use of lighting. These build an atmosphere of dread and hopelessness not unlike that found in films such as 8mm or Industrial Symphony No. 5, or even in an H. P. Lovecraft story. Visually, it could be compared to some of Wyeth's darker paintings, or to one of Robert Rauschenburg's moodier "combines".In terms of plot, the film had set me up for a very serious disappointment in its first few scenes -- starting off with all the polished teen gloss of a Wes Craven type flick. However, it diverged from that path rather quickly, leading instead to a storyline that used elements of, but completely subverted, the now thoroughly worn out 'heros put the ghost to rest' theme. It's about time that someone did so, and did so well, in a major film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I read some of the comments that are posted I notice all the negative comments about character development and plot holes and not understanding the story. Did it ever occur though that perhaps the movie is exactly doing to some of the viewers what it was supposed to, baffle you.*****SPOILERS**** If some of you are having a hard time trying to understand the plot I will break it down simple for you. The little girl herself is not evil, she is a manifestation of evil. She knows what she has done and continues to do is wrong and she says she is sorry but cannot stop as this is also explained by Aiden when he informs his mother she will not stop, she cannot sleep. A lot of you wonder why Rachel lives, its not because she heard the story fully, or because the little girl touched her. No its more simple than that. The little girl has designed the tape as recordings of her mind and that is why there is no tracking #. It is simply a chain letter effect that keeps Rachel alive as is revealed in the last seen. She wonders what she did different and realizes, she made a copy and showed it to someone else. Therefore she makes her son touch the buttons to make a recording and show it to someone. In that case the someone is us at the end as it goes full screen. Also the director has hidden several ring flashes in the movie. Perhaps the most effective is a large ring in the middle of the screen that flashes for about a tenth of a second right after the horse over the boat scene. Watch carefully.Overall there have been too many in depth opinions about this movie. It is an excellent suspense film. It was not supposed to be a drama or romance film so don't try to over critic it as such. I recommend this to only those who truly believe they can handle an intense movie and will expect nothing more than a great suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as creepy as The Blair Witch Project</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, talk about a movie where you want to cover your face half the time because of the insane pyscho crap happening on the screen. The Ring has one of those great moody plots that is never resolved and is filled to the brim with dark images, shriek-inducing scares, and almost no time to breathe. It revolves around a reporter who investigates a VHS tape that kills anyone who watches it after 7 days prior to the viewing. The actual tape makes no sense the first time you watch it in the movie, with avant-garde shots of a ladder, a woman brushing her hair in a mirror, and much more. But as the mystery unfolds everything starts to fall into place, but will our heroine have time to uncover the biggest secret of all before her 7 days run out? Tension is raised with some help from a 'cinema cooking timer' of sorts that tells you how many days she has left. The only thing I have to say about this movie, and it isn't really negative, is that it tries to be a lot like The Sixth Sense. Think about it. It has a somber, depressed tone where everything is a dark black or blue, an eerie little boy who hears voices, and an ending that tries to be shocking by revealing the clues we might have missed. I think The Sixth Sense definitely had a better ending, since The Ring confused me somewhat before the credits finally rolled, but it still succeeded in making me think twice about shadows in the corner or strange sights at the corner of my eye. It doesn't take much to creep me out, and The Ring sufficiently scared the bejeezus out of me. I give it 4/4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disturbing "American" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that leading up to my viewing of "The Ring", I was intrigued with the concept. I wasn't aware that it was an "Americanization" of a Japanese film. So I went in with pretty much no ready made prejudices other than the fact that I am a huge horror fan and have been starving for something to push the envelope.What I got with "The Ring" was an inkling of what current horror filmakers can do. I have a glimmer of hope that the old standard "boos" will take a backseat to truly nightmarish and disturbing visuals. Yes the story is lacking a little (which I understand is explained a bit more in the Japanese sequels), but I think that revealing all to dummy it up for the audience is also insulting. So to all the snobs out there who are so willing to bash something because it has been "Americanized", I think that you should look at it as a plus for those of us who may may not have heard of or seen the original, at least it is a start. To the rest of us enjoy something that will get under you skin and stay in your head for a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, some real horror films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actual horror has become a lost art lately, probably drowned in the flood of teen slasher flicks with pop soundtracks. It's become the norm that horror movies are out to make you laugh rather than scare you, as if the filmmakers don't want to be seen taking it seriously. As happened when it was time to save the American action film, Hollywood looked to Asia, and here we have a remake of a Japanese film which has already seen a remake in Korea.I'd seen the other two before walking in on this version, so perhaps I'm not qualified to talk about whether the plot is inventive or surprising, being intimately familiar with the story already. What I can say is that this version stacks up very favorably. Whether consciously or not, it has taken some of the most interesting elements of both version, and added in a few little twists of its own. The backstory has been fleshed out a bit more extensively as well. The look of the film is excellent, using a washed-out, desaturated color pallette to create an oppressive tone (admittedly not difficult in Seattle in the winter). Director Verbinski (director of MOUSEHUNT?!) does excellent work, allowing scenes to play out slowly, refusing to generate false excitement with jarring editing tricks like most modern horror directors.The bottom line, of course, is "Is it scary?". Well, I knew every turn of the plot right up to the end, and it still had me nervous, creeped out, and on the edge of my seat. This is a perfect horror film, a thing we see all too little of these days. If you have any fondness for the genre, you must see this film, and let Hollywood know that this is how it should be done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apparently a lot of people scare very easily</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am on a quest: to find a movie that will truely frighten me- what does a girl have to see to scare the pants off of her? With all the hype surrounding this movie, which so many have called "the scariest movie ever" I was hoping to have found a truely scary movie. I did not.My conclusion from watching this movie is a lot of people are very easily frightened. What on Earth did people find so very frightening about this movie? It doesn't have a more than mildly frightening scene in it up until the last 15 minutes. Personally, I wouldn't rank it in the top 20 scariest movie, never mind *the* scariest. I should have know better than to expect it to be scary when one of the ads compared it to Rosemary's Baby, which is about as scary as 3-day-old leftovers- you know, before they go all green and moldy.However, if people thought The Ring was really scary, they should see Session 9, another non-scary horror movie that has a similar "feel" to it, which seems to scare some people, anyway.Don't get me wrong, though, the Ring is a pretty good movie, I'd give it a 7.5 or 8 out of 10, but it's just not very scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, yet vague</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT****While I found this film to have a few disturbing images (i.e. the fact that Samara'a victims all looked as though they had died alone and forgotten in a well), there was simply too much disjointed symbolism to satisfy me, the best examples of such being Samara's sudden manifestation with the Morgans, Aiden's seeming powers of clairvoyance/precognition, and why Anna Morgan went mad to begin with. The film hinted, of course, that Samara was responsible for all of the madness, after all, if she can make pictures appear on x-ray film, then why couldn't she have driven her mother to madness? As an intelligent adult, I don't feel the need to be spoon-fed every little detail, however, I left the theatre with the distinct impression that I wasn't seeing the bigger picture. I am more interesed in obtaining a close translation of the novel (being a firm believer that no matter how good the movie, the book is always richer), than I am in seeing Ringu, the Japanese predecessor.Of course it is entirely possible that I missed some of the crucial clues as a result of the overwhelming numbers of teenyboppers that filled the theatre. Not only did I have to deal with juevinille shrieks every time the scene changed, but then there would be a good 5 minute discussion about "Omigod! I am like soooo freaked out!" afterward. My friends and I all agreed that it should have received an R rating, if only to keep the 14 year olds out.At the end of the movie, I admit to being more than a little haunted by the imagery (Samara climbing out of the well at the end of the tape right before Noah bites it is a chilling image), but I just can't help feeling that there were too many loose-ends and not a strong enough plot to induce me to spend any more money trying to figure them out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really really good and really really scary!!! It's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, and also one of the best. It's not like "The Exorsist", which is more gruesome and gory than scary. This is the real thing, a REAL scary movie. I was going to go see "Abandon", but I saw this instead, and I'm really glad I did. "Abandon" is probably really good, but this movie was definately worth my time. I actually screamed twice in the theater!! I highly recommend going to see this movie.At first, it's just freaky, but as the movie goes on, the pieces start to fall together until you understand everything that was in the video. There's alot of stuff in this movie that, when it happens, makes you jump.. or scream. And just when you think the movie is over and everything is resolved, something happens that completely surprises you, and the movie goes on a little longer. This movie is really good, so if you like really scary movies and/or mysteries, you should go see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie 4 different times and I can sincerely say, that for me, it held up each time and kept me captivated. Obviously, the more you see it, the more likely you are to catch things that you may have missed the first time you viewed it. While it isn't as scary after the first time, I found this movie to be full of suspense and disturbing and the sort of movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you thinking. If you don't like to think when watching a movie, you won't enjoy The Ring. It is an intelligent horror movie that will leave you guessing.

		<fullReview>At this last year's Seattle International Film festival I saw "Honogurai mizu no soko kara" (Dark Water) which was written by the same author of Ringu (The Ring), Kji Suzuki. Often called the Japanese equivalent to Stephen King, he masterfully delivers a stunning story through eerie visualization and plot twists. Verbinski brought his vision to the screen masterfully, and though I've heard it falls short of the Japanese original, I hesitate to say it falls short at all! In fact the mood and cinematography he brings to the story makes it that much more scary. When I saw "Dark Water" this last summer, I was moved for days by the story. I saw "The Ring" on a whim, saw the similarities to "Dark Water" and wondered...I confirmed when I got home and did some research on the internet that Kji Suzuki did write it! I hope that the USA takes hold of Kji Suzuki's refreshing take on horror and follows up with many more of his books being made into movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching both the american version and the Japanese version, I was much surprised that i overall enjoyed the newest one the most. But I highly suggest seeing both to get the full experience out of The Ring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as creepy as The Blair Witch Project</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, talk about a movie where you want to cover your face half the time because of the insane pyscho crap happening on the screen. The Ring has one of those great moody plots that is never resolved and is filled to the brim with dark images, shriek-inducing scares, and almost no time to breathe. It revolves around a reporter who investigates a VHS tape that kills anyone who watches it after 7 days prior to the viewing. The actual tape makes no sense the first time you watch it in the movie, with avant-garde shots of a ladder, a woman brushing her hair in a mirror, and much more. But as the mystery unfolds everything starts to fall into place, but will our heroine have time to uncover the biggest secret of all before her 7 days run out? Tension is raised with some help from a 'cinema cooking timer' of sorts that tells you how many days she has left. The only thing I have to say about this movie, and it isn't really negative, is that it tries to be a lot like The Sixth Sense. Think about it. It has a somber, depressed tone where everything is a dark black or blue, an eerie little boy who hears voices, and an ending that tries to be shocking by revealing the clues we might have missed. I think The Sixth Sense definitely had a better ending, since The Ring confused me somewhat before the credits finally rolled, but it still succeeded in making me think twice about shadows in the corner or strange sights at the corner of my eye. It doesn't take much to creep me out, and The Ring sufficiently scared the bejeezus out of me. I give it 4/4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disturbing "American" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that leading up to my viewing of "The Ring", I was intrigued with the concept. I wasn't aware that it was an "Americanization" of a Japanese film. So I went in with pretty much no ready made prejudices other than the fact that I am a huge horror fan and have been starving for something to push the envelope.What I got with "The Ring" was an inkling of what current horror filmakers can do. I have a glimmer of hope that the old standard "boos" will take a backseat to truly nightmarish and disturbing visuals. Yes the story is lacking a little (which I understand is explained a bit more in the Japanese sequels), but I think that revealing all to dummy it up for the audience is also insulting. So to all the snobs out there who are so willing to bash something because it has been "Americanized", I think that you should look at it as a plus for those of us who may may not have heard of or seen the original, at least it is a start. To the rest of us enjoy something that will get under you skin and stay in your head for a bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actual horror has become a lost art lately, probably drowned in the flood of teen slasher flicks with pop soundtracks. It's become the norm that horror movies are out to make you laugh rather than scare you, as if the filmmakers don't want to be seen taking it seriously. As happened when it was time to save the American action film, Hollywood looked to Asia, and here we have a remake of a Japanese film which has already seen a remake in Korea.I'd seen the other two before walking in on this version, so perhaps I'm not qualified to talk about whether the plot is inventive or surprising, being intimately familiar with the story already. What I can say is that this version stacks up very favorably. Whether consciously or not, it has taken some of the most interesting elements of both version, and added in a few little twists of its own. The backstory has been fleshed out a bit more extensively as well. The look of the film is excellent, using a washed-out, desaturated color pallette to create an oppressive tone (admittedly not difficult in Seattle in the winter). Director Verbinski (director of MOUSEHUNT?!) does excellent work, allowing scenes to play out slowly, refusing to generate false excitement with jarring editing tricks like most modern horror directors.The bottom line, of course, is "Is it scary?". Well, I knew every turn of the plot right up to the end, and it still had me nervous, creeped out, and on the edge of my seat. This is a perfect horror film, a thing we see all too little of these days. If you have any fondness for the genre, you must see this film, and let Hollywood know that this is how it should be done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only on my narcolepsy meter does this movie get a 10. It's a snoozer, running about 20 or 30 minutes too long and unintellible no matter how long its running time. But since when does a movie have to make sense to please its audience? This film was heartily endorsed by dildo-headed colleague at work."It's terrifying," he claimed. After a promising start, The Ring tries to becomes baffling, moronic. There is a telephone call that makes no sense, a weird video film filled with Bunuel-esque montages with no explanation offered as to where this tape originated. The movie at various times resembles a parody of Blair Witch, Sixth Sense and 100 lesser movies that play on the late show every night. It's a decent candidate for the late show. It sure ain't a good candidate for $11 and a fun night out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was OK at best and received a rating of "2" from my wife and I. It is amazing to me how so many people can get caught up into the "hype" that they actually beleive it. This movie was not scary in any way! Remember the hype of the Blair Witch?? Remember how fast it died and was forgotten? The same will happen here. There is nothing of "long lasting rememberance" in this movie. Really a total disappointment. This kind of hype must be started by the movie studios in order to sell tickets. There are people that will beleive anything you tell them even after they see first hand otherwise!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been searching for years for a horror movie that would scare me. This may have been it if it wasn't for all the patched together scenes that did not make sense The character of Aidan was seriously underdeveoloped and reminded me of a rip off of Cole from "The Sixth Sense", only much less believable. I suppose this is one of those old movies that is supposed to make you guess what happens for yourself. What really happens is an assortment of scenes that are added only to make the movie scarier but have no meaning.I'd like to know the answer to the following questions: ***SPOILERS*** If the kid knew this girl was evil, why didn't he keep his mother from helping her? What was the point of showing Noah's girlfriend, she did absolutely nothing to contribute to the movie. In the day of cameras built into cell phones, why didn't anyone have an answering machine? If the tape was that bad, why didn't Rachel hide it from her young child instead of leaving it in the VCR? What was the deal with Aidain looking at that stranger on the street, it had nothing to do with the movie. Why did Mr Morgan wait 20 years to commit suicide, in front of Rachel, and why did he decide to plug every appliance in the house into the BATHROOM? Was the girl evil or a product of evil? Why did the mother kill her daughter? To protect her or to get rid of her? Why didn't the psychologist on the island NOT see images? What was the point of showing her autistic grandson? Why show Rachel in the shower with blood swirling down the drain, where did the blood come from? How did she get an electrode in her throat? Why did she keep focusing in on that stupid fly, even in scenes before she pulled it out of the screen? Why did all the dead people (who only died of heart failure but looked like they were decomposed) look exactly like Linda Blair in the Exorcist? The horse sub-plot was completely goofy as well. Who made the tape? The end of the movie I didn't even care anymore, I just wanted it to end because it didn't make sense. It seemed like they just threw together a bunch of scenes to try to be scary and said "We'll bill this as one of those movies you have to figure out yourself" so we won't have waste time wrapping anything up. A few strange scenes, but overall not as good as I thought it would be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "The Ring" expecting this grandios production of horror. Unfortunately for me, the horror in "The Ring" was the fact that there was no horror if you took out the loud noises. Any film will be scary if you slap in a loud bang after the entire theatre has gone dark and silent. It's a trick movie folks like to use to make it seem like you jumped at something frightening when all it was was someone tapping another person on the back. Someday soon I hope someone produces a film that's ACTUALLY scary. Until then, I guess "The Ring" will have to do. Once again, it was an all right movie but with the great story that it did have, it could've been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Video Tape and Antagonist just don't fit...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Honestly, how can anyone be scared watching a movie that's antagonist is a video tape?Now, I will agree, there were a couple of parts that, although they didn't scare me, I was somewhat frightened, but my God!!! This movie was horrible! So many things were wrong in this movie.First, when you make a horror film, or one that is intended to scare the viewer, you need to put something in the movie that will leave the viewer something to think about when they leave the theater; a plot hole needs to be left in. Take Signs, for example. It never says why the little girl was having disturbing dreams, leaving the viewer something to think about when he/she has finished the movie. The Ring did not FAIL to do this, but somewhat abused it: the whole movie was one big plot hole! I agree that it should not be done for all parts of the movie, but nothing in the movie was really explained. Why was she killing people? It never says, or even hints at it. The closest conclusion one can draw is from the fact that her mother murders here (or attempts to) and leaves her in the well, and that her father kept her secluded from society, amongst other things. Plot holes are to be used for minor, minute details, not the bulk of the entire plot line.Second, it's a videotape! My Lord! What significance does this have? It never explains why Samara uses a video tape to KILL people, or even how she made it. That just leaves another plot hole open. In addition, the sequence of screen shots on the actual "killer" video was too predictable, in a sense that it was going to contribute to the eventual discovery of either the girl, her death, or both.The movie as a whole was too predictable. Everyone had to have known that the video was going to lead to the eventual discovery of something, giving our protagonist a book of clues (so to speak), which in turn led to WAY too much foreshadowing. By half way through the movie, the audience is bored with every scene being mapped out by the video, which lead to a ho-hum film.One thing I did like in the movie was the ever present fly on the video, as well as the screen. This is a good plot hole to leave in. The best conclusion I can come to is that it foreshadows that the video kills its viewer by coming to life.Overall, I think it is safe to say that this movie should be skipped, if one is given the opportunity to watch it. I suppose if you had a whole lot of time on your hands, and absolutely nothing to do, then THAT would be the appropriate time to view this film. But let's be honest: who has that much time on their hands?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected a lot from this movie but it was a huge let down. There are merely no well known actors in this film. Naomi Watts does a mediocre performance in her lead role in this movie. The acting is sub par. The scenes in this movie where it's supposed to be scary are weak. Some scenes are scary and I do mean some, but the overall movie was weak. The plot of how she has to do research and the tv video tape thing is lame it is all lame and it gets boring and dry during the movie as well. The pace was bad about going to die in 7 days after watching the video tape. I mean it was just weak. If I were you I would avoid it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! This movie scared the crap outta me! I loved it! The entire theater was on the edge of their seat. I have to say that this might be the best movie I've seen all year.It started out like a typical horror movie, with two teenage girls discussing a tape, after you watch it you receive a call saying you have 7 days to live. The tape is filled with weird images, described as "your worst nightmare" One of the girls die, and the other is sent to a psychiatric home because of what she saw. I don't wanna ruin it for anyone else who sees it. Lets just say, it was a very good movie. Worth seeing again.</fullReview>

Naomi Watts held my interest through out the movie, she did a good job, trying not to lose her mind with her spooky kid. I don't want to give the whole movie away, but just when you think everything is all right with the world, WRONG!! something changes, and throws you off, BIG TIME!!

		<fullReview>With images that remind me of both Nosferatu and rotten.com, this film has the ability to stick in your brain like the corpse you saw on the side of the highway when you drove past a fresh wreck. This is not a kind film. It does not want to reassure you. The imagery alone is reason to see this movie, but it also is supported by a well paced mystery-plot and solidly scared acting. The filmmaker obviously has some background in psychology, as this work twangs at that black cord inside you, giving you the most uncomfortable vibrations from scenes like a child drawing the same frantic circle over and over again, to the movement of a pen, to the sun filtering through leaves. Even the way the movie starts...i didn't realize til later...its very sudden, like putting in a videotape that hasn't been fully rewound - a subtle touch. I have not seen Ringu, the original Japanese film that this is based on, but i now plan to. I would put this in my top 5 horror films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie the night after Halloween and couldn't help but laugh every time i heard the screams of my fellow movie goers. (which happened to be about every ten minutes)This film has lots of good things going for it. It is scary enough in unique ways although of course it relies on the conventional "scary methods" as well. And since I am from Seattle I am biased in that respect as well.The main problem I had with the movie is that it doesn't really make sense. AND I happened to watch "Psycho" the night before and i noticed that "The Ring" contains a shot where water is going down the drain and the shot is almost an exact duplicate of a similar shot in "Psycho" after Janet Leigh is murdered.My advice: If you are a guy, watch this movie with a girl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must-see for scary movie lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a definite must-see for scary movie lovers. "The Ring" has tons of twists and turns. When you think you've finally figured something out, another curve ball is thrown at you. This is absolutely the freakiest movie I've ever seen. The actors and actresses in the movie have done smaller parts and less popular movies, for the most part, but I believe this could be a big break for some of them. I think it could have helped the movie to have a big name or two, but if you go for the horror aspect, you won't be disappointed. I have never seen such a scary movie, which is also a comedy. The whole theater will be laughing throughout, as well as screaming and jumping! This is a thoroughly enjoyable film, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a great horror film. If you aren't good with scary movies, however, this won't be your favorite film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My thoughts on this great movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, this movie was splendid. Some previews related it to Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist, but it some ways, I find it better than both. Soon after seeing The Ring, I rented Rosemary's Baby, expecting the same level of frightening plot and scenery, but it stunk. Not half as scary, nor half as smart. And The Exorcist, while about as scary, got most of its screams and such with gross-out tactics. The Ring is smart, scary, and has a story you can actually get into. Add this to a great twist ending, and its a must-see. The only people who may not like it are the dim-witted and those who cant follow a story for more than the length of a Saturday morning cartoon. See it. Disregard the harsh words of America's stupid. It's worth your cash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen The Ring couple of days ago and was badly surprised. I were waiting for the same Japanese Ringu (1998) but I realised that it's not exactly remake, it's more like a copy with different actors, sum plot bugs fixed and really s****y SFX.I remember myself seeing Ringu for the very first time and afterwords being afraid to turn off the light in my room, but since The Ring I have a feeling that this movie is made way worst then it was original.I don't know why the rating is so high and reviews are so good, but I were really sad about the movie itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected a lot from this movie but it was a huge let down. There are merely no well known actors in this film. Naomi Watts does a mediocre performance in her lead role in this movie. The acting is sub par. The scenes in this movie where it's supposed to be scary are weak. Some scenes are scary and I do mean some, but the overall movie was weak. The plot of how she has to do research and the tv video tape thing is lame it is all lame and it gets boring and dry during the movie as well. The pace was bad about going to die in 7 days after watching the video tape. I mean it was just weak. If I were you I would avoid it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. I'm always on the lookout for a good, truly scary movie. Y'all, this one fits the bill. I put The Ring way up there on the list of scary movies, right alongside The Shining, Poltergeist, and The Exorcist. In fact, I had not experienced such a room-filling sense of deep dread and fear in a theater since I saw the recent re-release of The Exorcist. The nightmarish imagery was very unsettling and the peak moments of horror were very well timed. It wasn't perfect, though. The non-scary parts didn't come off nearly as well as the scary parts. Not the greatest acting during the "straight" parts of the movie, and some of the dialogue was pretty weak. But when the scary parts were on screen (which, fortunately, was most of the time) it made up for the little deficiencies, and then some.From seeing the very-creepy trailer, I had high hopes for The Ring. But I didn't expect what I got. This movie will stick with you, folks. And if you're a horror fan, that's a good thing.Why can't more horror movies have this kind of impact?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately a Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring has a great look and a terrific performance from the beautiful Naomi Watts. However The Ring strains the boundaries of credibility. I saw this film in a crowded theater in Times Square on Halloween; at many points during the film the audience wasn't sure whether to be frightened or just laugh (I am aware this can be a defense mechanism against feelings of fright, however some of the plot is truly laughable). The film also leaves many unanswered questions. The ending (the best part of the film) goes on too long trying to tie all these loose ends, and eventually I stopped caring. Some on this board have said this is the scariest film they have seen in years. Perhaps the horror genre doesn't work for me much anymore, but I just wasn't very frightened. The setup of The Ring seems to promise chills galore, but I found them to be few and far between. This is a better horror film than most made these days (that's not saying much), but could have been a lot better. The Ring would make a good DVD or VHS tape rental (no pun intended).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It DOES receive a "ringing" endorsement...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After spending Halloween night with the Scream trilogy (again) in my college dorm, a friend and I decided we were looking for something better, so we tried The Ring. It was a purely impulse movie choice--we'd heard some good things but knew little about it. My recommendation to you: Go See It.The film's basis is a video tape that brings about the death of its viewers within 7 days. It's a decent enough scary movie idea--you know that right away the main character is going to watch the video tape and then have 7 days (or 2 hours of film time) to solve the mystery of why the tape is so deadly. So it's already granted that not everything in this film will be a surprise to you--sometimes the people you expect to die do, and the bad things you expect to happen do. But don't be fooled into thinking you've got it all figured out--it's more likely than not that you don't, and there are no false climaxes--there's really only one.The plot is well constructed--my friend and I who both delight in finding plot holes and poorly constructed scripts tried very hard to be disappointed with the film, or catch something the editors missed, but we couldn't. It's a good mystery, and halfway through the film you will want to stay solely to figure out all the pieces of the puzzle. While, on the surface, the killer and the victims may not seem connected, the storyline actually does draw a line between the two, the video being the vehicle. It's all explained, it's all there on film--the movie AND the movie within the movie.Technically, it's a beautiful movie. Landscape shots are very well planned out, and it (thankfully) lacks in cheap special effects, dripping blood and gore (total gore time likely comprises 1/64 of the film), and poorly done computer miracles. The Pacific Northwest was beautifully utilized, the sets were well done, the cinematography was excellent...I could go on and on.This is not your average Halloween slasher-pic scary movie. It's Hitchcockian in nature in that it's based more on suspense and solving the mystery than on teenagers in ghost masks jumping out with large knives. For the Hitchcock fan, check out the in-film homage to Rear Window.The Ring is a well-thought out, beautifully filmed, intellectual, scary movie. Definitely give it a watch, it's worth spending the evening afraid to turn on your television.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Complex, Multi-layered Chiller (the simple-minded need not apply)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It appears only time will redeem The Ring. The response to it reminds me of the hoopla surrounding Blair Witch Project: mixed reviews from critics, a pleased audience, followed by a swift and bitter backlash.Like Blair Witch, film history will no doubt be more fair, since again we find audiences going into a movie expecting an American horror film, like I did, and coming out with something rich and layered.Unfortunately for an audience used to simplistic, straightforward stories, The Ring becomes something much more complex. It's not a linear, Aristotelian story. It's very Eastern in its use of circular time, of yin-and-yang. Everything is not neatly wrapped-up at the end. It leaves you with a myriad of questions and a bad taste in your mouth.That bad taste is why it took my friends and I multiple viewings and several discussions to decide if we liked The Ring or not. It begs for -- and holds up under -- multiple viewings. This is a movie for careful viewers. Important details and lines are delivered only once, and even then they are mysterious. Certain elements have double- and sometimes even triple-meanings. Your understanding of it hinges on being able to interpret symbols.In other words: there's a lot of figuring out to do. What critics are calling plot holes I call vagueness. A plot hole means that the explanation is just not there: it's a goof. In The Ring, it's all there, it's just not all-spelled-out. There's a difference.If you're the type of person who likes your movies wrapped in pretty paper and handed to you in a bow, do not bother investing time in The Ring. This is not a cheap horror movie. The horror may be choppy, jumpy, maybe even old. But the meanings are very subtle, and the meanings are where the meat of this movie lie.And to be fair to the movie, lots of it is damn scary, too.I don't think anything like this has been seen on the American screen before. This is a higher level of film-making. Bojan Bazelli's cinematography, which does not deserve to be an afterthought here, is masterful...this is one of the best movies ever made. 10/10.</fullReview>

If it wasn't for that and a few other things that distracted me that were mentioned in previous posts I would have enjoyed the movie more. That being said I give them credit for making a movie that tries to be more than a typical slasher-type film. It attempts to put together a somewhat involved plot, and to a degree pulls it off. There were some images during the film that I thought were effective, and are still in my mind the next day.

		<shortDescription>Scary film that utilizes wonderful techniques</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations for this movie and they were fulfilled. The trailer itself represented what the film would be: a montage of dark, creepy, dreadful events filmed and portrayed in a dark, creepy, dreadful way. The fact that a videotape kills people a week after they watch it is not what makes this film scary; if that were so then the ridiculous Feardotcom would have also been scary. The Ring is scary because of the way it is filmed and presented. As others have said, there is a feeling of dread constantly present and as the plot unravels, the dread takes over you until finally when Samara emerges with climactic terror you realize exactly why Verbinski wanted you to feel so much dread. I saw this movie the first time in a packed theater and the second time in a less-than-half-full crowded, and obviously the first time my experience was enhanced. The second time allowed me to go back and review things I didn't notice the first time, such as the reason victims scribble out faces of people in pictures with a black pen is to represent Samara and her black hair covering her face after being in the well; and the reason the horse on the boat went crazy is because it was nearing Moesko Island, where all horses were put on a spell by Samara to drown themselves. I noticed other little things that made the movie seem that much better. Naomi Watts's superb acting, as well as good supporting acting by Martin Henderson, is extremely successful. Cast is important; someone like, say Keanu Reeves, for the role of Noah would have been disastrous. Kudos also to Rick Baker for creating a horrifying appearance for Samara's victims.While I've yet to see Ringu (I have to find a place where I can order it) and therefore cannot compare the two, I admit that The Ring is a fantastic film and contains everything I look for in a true horror film. The lack of blood and guts and special effects and men running around with ghost masks and steak knives, and the ability for Verbinski to scare audiences with just plot, acting, camerawork, lighting, editing, and direction is what makes this one of my favorite horror films. Soon I will see Nakata's version and will be able to truly appreciate it all. But for now, I rate The Ring ten out of ten.</fullReview>

I was hoping it all would come together in the end... nope, never did. It left me with quite a collection of unanswered and unanswerable questions such as... Who made the tape? Where did the tape come from? Why did Mr.Morgan wait 20-something years to kill himself? Why did he find in necessary to plug every appliance in the house into one socket in the bathroom? Wouldn't have sitting in a tub with a toaster done the same thing? Why did the horse go crazy on the boat? What did that scene have to do with the rest of the movie? Why, if her daughter was "all she ever wanted," did Anna Morgan throw a bag over her head and toss her into a well? What was the deal with the nosebleeds? Why was this considered a horror movie? By the time the creepy little girl (whom they pulled straight from "The Exorcist") crawled out of the TV, I had to laugh. The girl sitting next to me called everything before it happened. It was the most predictable, boring piece of {expletive deleted here} I have ever had the misfortune of viewing. And the thing that still nags me about it is the well. The Morgans lived on the island all their lives, and Anna Morgan killed her daughter there. Therefore, one would assume the well was on that island. It shows the main character driving back from the island to that log cabin in the woods ON THE MAINLAND and then they find the well under one of those cabins... did the well migrate? Apparently so. Or were the editors just too dumb to catch such a mistake? This movie ripped off three other horror movies (that I counted). The little girl from "The Exorcist", the little creepy genius boy from "The Omen" and the fingernails in the well (from the girl trying to climb out), they didn't even bother change anything about that. It was ripped STRAIGHT from "Silence of the Lambs". Hmm, interesting... all the movies they stole from were REAL horror movies. The only thing that was relied on to hold this movie together was the jump-out-at-you parts. Even those didn't make me jump... I dunno, maybe I'm just not easily scared. Oh, and another thing? Why did the little boy lay into his mother about "helping" the little girl? He was going on and on about how she's going to keep killing people now. Wasn't she gonna keep killing anyway? What difference would it make if she was "free"? And what was the deal with the fly? Can we say "desperate attempt to try and make this movie have some sort of creepy element so maybe the viewers will overlook the lack of plot"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very well made film that I enjoyed greatly. Scarier (if it is possible) than The Shining and Psycho. Creates a tremendous atmosphere of intensity and fright. Do not go alone. One fault, if it can be called one, is the lack of levity to release built up tension, but if you let yourself be scared, you will have a lot more fun. It also has a rather good ending for a horror/thriller movie. Altogether a wonderful experience, rating a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't plan on spoiling this for anyone, so please read on. This movie was a thriller to the core. It did exactly what it was intended to do, scare the audience. It will freak out the audience if the atmosphere is right, and believe me it was when I watched it. Some guys will try and be tough guys and say the movie sucked, but that is simply not the case. The Ring is a truly unique scary movie that deserves to be watched with an open mind. There is a part when you think the movie is over, don't leave just yet. About 6 people got up and left out of the audience I watched it with. They sure did miss out. At the end of the movie you will truly understand why the movie is titled The Ring. The movie is indeed, a ring. Like most scary movies not everything added up, but I won't get into that. Great movie of the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never expect anything from a horror movie. The "scares" are rarely based on anything truly horrific and instead rely on jump cuts, obscenely loud sounds, quick gross-out shots, and other cinematic devices. In my view, this is much less a sign of great filmmaking and more a sign of a gullible and unintelligent audience.With that said, The Ring tries. Ultimately, however, all the common editing tricks used in other horror movies are used in The Ring.The story itself is confusing and leaves a lot unexplained. Sometimes in films, like in Memento or Last Year at Marienbad, this is a good thing. In The Ring, it's a very bad thing. What is unexplained can not really be interpreted and is left too open-ended to satisfy.And am I the only one that expected the little boy to look at his index finger and mutter "Redrum"?6/10 - Naomi Watts was good. The concept is good. The execution is flawed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring, not to be mistaken with Lord of the Rings, was definitely a scary movie considering its premise was based on receiving an untimely death within seven days after watching 60 seconds of an unedited homemade video. I honestly walked out of the movie with a hint of cynicism as well as doubt. Although the premise seemed hokey the movie was believable. And even though I received the privilege of watching it on the big screen I'd have to say during certain parts of the movie I was just plain scared so much so I couldn't apprehend what was going on. Fresh faces constituted for most of the acting in the movie. Most notably Naomi Watts who plays Rachael Keller a journalist and mother of Aidan Keller played by David Dorfman who is reminiscent of Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new classic film telling a story that everyone should experience and learn from: accept children for who they are and listen to them, or else!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was wonderfully thrilling. I have not seen its like since Psycho, Jaws, or Alien. Genuinely creepy with believable dark tones and still a twisted sort of happy ending: like any good "classic" fairy tale. Many a Homage to many a classic thriller and/or scary film with the most obvious being Psycho (you will notice without me saying). It has it all the "must haves" of a stereo typical "thriller" including the car chase; the damsel in distress (and getting herself out with minimal assistance), and people looking for trouble and walking into certain death. Oh yeah, and the obligatory up the stairwell shot. None of this detracts from the film however, it only adds texture and flavor! The cinematography is lush and only makes the pacing taste even richer. My favorite spice in this endeavor however was the sound and music which are outstanding and as integral to the scare and fun as they were in Psycho and Jaws. Zimmer bows to Herman all over the place. I will say no more for you shouldn't know to much before you see it, else you might not have as much fun. All I will say is if you love movies and all the "little touches" that can be put in, sit through ALL the credits, all of them and listen carefully to the little song being sung at the end, it is the icing on the cake!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1999-2000, I spent a year in Korea teaching English. While there, I had a very surreal experience. Before the summer of 1999, all Japanese imports, including films, were banned in Korea. Beginning that summer, the moratorium on Japanese cultural imports was lifted. One of the first Japanese films released in Korea at this time was "Ringu." However, since it needed to be captioned into Korean, it was released six months after it's initial release in Japan, just in time to be in theaters with the Korean remake, "Ring." (Apparently this is why the American remake was called "The Ring.") My surreal experience was going to see the Japanese version in a multiplex also showing the Korean "Ring" at the same time, with all the Koreans panning the Korean version and flocking to the Japanese version.Back to the topic at hand, I liked the American version better than the Japanese version. The Japanese "Ringu" was basically what I call a "yap" movie, where the there's so much story that all the characters can do is basically make discoveries and discuss it with each other. The American version has much more action, and is much faster-moving than the original.However, a copy is still a copy. The final scene where the "monster" is revealed is much more effective in the original, just because to me, it's the 2nd time I've seen it. Others who watch the remake first may disagree. (What interests me, however, is that I think the American version used the exact same clip and/or technique as the original version. Close viewing of the "monster" scene shows that it was filmed in reverse and played forward, just like the original.)But, the American version didn't just copy the copy of the original, but threw in a whole bunch of other modern themes as well, such as the creepy little girl (The Others), the little quasi-psychic boy (The Sixth Sense), the quest for a father theme (The Rookie,) and female protagonist not dying (I know what you did last summer, Scream, Halloween, too many others to count.)Overall, the highest complement I can give this film is that I didn't feel ripped off, which is pretty high praise nowadays.</fullReview>

The cinematography is some of the gloomiest I have ever seen. You feel thatthe characters are in danger pretty much every minute because of the excellent lensing. I won't be able to say much else about the film for fear of givingsomething away but if you want to see a well-made, scary little film thisHalloween, look no further than this American remake of THE RING.

		<shortDescription>Pop shock.. not that frightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin this review, it must be said that I'm not easily frightened by movies, so bear that in mind. The movie begins with a very pop-horror style setting, reminiscent of the Urban Legends films. I find that too much time was spent on trying to generate all this suspense through the story of an abused child.. which DOES add to the twist at the end of the flick. BUT, it seems there was a good amount of filler in this film. I could have handled a little more gore. Granted, leaving things to one's imagination can be powerful if delivered with the proper techniques. But making this move a pg-13 was a bad move for the audience's sake. Personally, I went to see this flick with my girlfriend hoping for a good scare. The result was a theatre full of screaming little girls that was louder than the THX surround in the theatre. I wish film producers would realize that kids can see movies like this when they come out on DVD/Video. I could only imagine seeing Event Horizon if it was PG-13, I would have been the one saying "Liberate Me Ex Inferis." The hell of the screaming 14 yr olds. Thank god the creators of that film didn't pull any punches. The movie overall was decent, but the plot was weak, and the scares were few and far between. VERY in your face though. Hope you all like it more than i did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good start, but a poor adaptation of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>********************WARNING:SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!************************Well, after putting it off all week I finally got around to seeing the RING and I must say, they did far better than I thought, but still managed to make the film laughably mediocre compared to the original. First off, the lineage and many of the characters most interesting quirks were dropped in the American version in favor of dumbing down for the typically less attentive audiences, but they sure never had a problem dropping all the artsy rubbish which was totally and unbelievably unnecessary instead of building pain, dread and suffering. I swear to god, the continual showing of the tree was about to drive me mad! The film had no issues with showing alot of Arthouse CGI crap, nor did it have problems using loud noises to illicit a response from the crowd... things that in many ways hurt it in my eyes. You see, the original Hideo Nakata Ring had so much dread and a foreboding sense of doom by the end you almost felt like crawling in a well yourself, but this version seems to come and go in how it approaches the subject. Naomi Watts sense of death crawling to her seems almost lost in many scenes, much as if she turns it off and on by command, or quite frankly didn't care. Brian Cox's character also suffers much in the American version because unlike his counterpart in the Nippon version you never really get an idea of just why Samara/Sadako is such a monster and why she had to be dealt with... he was truly disturbed and hiding demons, the DreamWorks version makes him too vague to matter and its a shame. Noah is by far the most maligned character of all, and is totally stripped of all his psychic ability and made a non factor and totally uninteresting, whereas Ryuji was mysterious and played an important part. Thankfully Daveigh Chase does a wonderful job recreating Sadako for the American audience, she is far and away one of the films true saving graces. Onto the production. Not too bad, but more emphsis was placed on how the people and film looked than the content. The cursed videotape itself was a joke as well compared to the original, as it looked like a second rate MTV video some Mallcore band would produce. The original had almost a `snuff' quality and captured all the rage and mysterious hatred Sadako had for humanity and due to its low production and dark feel was very, very creepy unlike the glossy, overproduced and sorely overdone DreamWorks one. Perhaps DreamWorks didn't give the audience, afterall it was laid out like connect the dots and was so pronounced that it lost all the effectiveness of its Asian counterpart. I did however like the ending better than the `Sarah Conner' ending of the original, but even so it did little to make up for the mishmash that occurred to get you to that point. Samaras inevitable (and greatly looked forward to by me) emergence was also very nice, as was the added addition of her room and the horse going mad. The film also seemed to borrow lightly from another Nakata film, the magnificent Dark Water which is not a bad thing, but just another shot at the lack of originality in American filmmaking and how instead of real minds like Nakata giving us real horror we get stuck with second rate trash like Scream and Wes Craven productions. All in all I give it a 5.5 out of 10, if you can seek out the original as it is far superior in almost every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great package of scares--and some lifted shots from Hitchcock classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers I have to admit that "The Ring" scared me. Plot holes and all it was very well shot with great directing, excellent camera shots, a disturbing mood, and above-average acting. Without discussing the plot in any detail I must say that I am surprised that of the reviews I read of this movie, not a single person noticed the several camera shots lifted from other movies, especially Hitchcock films. First, the scene where the boy's mother scans the neighboring apartment complex observing the various lives of her neighbors she visually moves from window to window observing the scenes inside several different apartments. This scene was directly taken from "Rear Window" and as a humorous nod to Hitchcock, one of the neighbors even had a broken leg and is confined to wheelchair, just like Jimmy Stewart was in "Rear Window." However in "The Ring" we see him from another neighbor's vantage point. Two other shots were clear references to "Vertigo." The sudden and unexpected suicide jump of Kim Novak into the San Francisco Bay is copied as the girl's mother suddenly, and unexpectedly jumps from the cliff in "The Ring." Also, when the video expert is in his room and the female lead decides to forgo the elevator and race up the stairs, the shot is also right out of "Vertigo" as Jimmy Stewart races up the stairs of the bell tower. The stairs wind around in a dizzying spiral and the camera is even positioned in the same spot for both shots. Another shot taken from Hitch was when the female lead is showering and her dirt is washing down the drain. The camera zooms in on the drain following the rinsed-off dirt as it disappears, exactly as Hitchcock did in "Psycho" during Janet Leigh's shower scene. Another shot lifted from "Psycho" was when the female lead approaches the video expert's chair from behind calling out his name towards the end of the movie. She touches his chair and it slowly turns around to reveal his face--exactly as it does at the end of "Psycho" when Vera Miles learns the truth about Norman's "mother." That many shots from Hitchcock movies does take away a bit from the originality of "The Ring", but a good shot is a good shot even if used more than once. Additionally, the scene where the fingernail is found in the walls of the well could not have been more clearly lifted from "Silence of the Lambs." While each movie had their own plot and reasons for each shot, it is interesting to note how blatantly some shots were stolen from the masters. Otherwise, I greatly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to any who are tired of ridiculous attempts at horror such as "Scream," "I Know What You Did Last Summer," and "13 Ghosts."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You never realized watching a David Lynch short would be so deadly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers below.I'm not sure exactly what I expected with "The Ring" beyond what the preview lays out for you. It's a horror film. It has some twist about a video tape that kills people. It's edgy and uses those nifty effects that horror directors use these days to make things seem creepy.I suppose the thing I expected most out of "The Ring" was to be scared. Or at least, recognize an attempt to frighten the audience. Sadly, too much of the film relies on BIG LOUD BURSTS OF SOUND to cause the audience to jump. In the theatre I was in, this was the most common way that the audience got "scared" and that's a real s****y sign in a horror movie. The overall "scary" plot wasn't bad, but ultimately didn't hit home as being anything special, even though the director desperately wanted it to be.The film stars Naomi Watts as the young, less-perky-than-in-Mullholand-Drive investigative reporter who decides to follow up on a rumor/legend after her niece dies. The film gets a little unclear at this point, partly to keep the audience guessing but also I suspect because the writer didn't have a clear idea of where he wanted to go with the plot. Watts discovers that her niece and three other teens watched a video tape and all died seven days later. While her niece was found in a weird mummified state following a sudden heart stoppage, the other teens had died in a car crash and committed suicide. The ways they die aren't really thought of as important however, because we know that it was really watching the tape that killed them.Watts tracks down the tape and promptly watches it. The tape was supposed to be disturbing, but I found myself wondering how much they paid David Lynch to use part of Eraserhead. Watts gets a phone call telling her that she only has seven days left. She then discovers that her face won't appear right on film. Freaked out, she promptly shows the tape to her son's father, then leaves a copy laying around so her son can see it too. Spooked but determined to use her investigative skills to track down a solution to her mess, she digs deeper into the mystery of the tape and why it kills people. This leads Watts on a merry chase through Pacific Northwest charm until she discovers that a young girl was drowned by her mother in a well and that by diving in and holding her as she crumbles the "curse" is lifted. Everyone is happy. except this was all just a big bait and switch, and now the dead girl is free to run amuck and kills her boyfriend. Luckily, Watts doesn't have to worry about getting killed because she made a copy of the tape and showed it to someone else, thus lifting the curse from her.Of course, this makes little sense. Burn marks appear on her arm. She is still having problems with bleeding noses and ears and other strange things. Presumably she should have been free from the "curse" the second she made a copy of the tape and showed it to someone else. But, whatever. Horror films aren't keen on logic, and this one is no exception. which is a shame since it wanted to be more unique. But ultimately the film relies on the standard horror elements to see it through:* Loud jarring music to spook the audience * Creepy looking kids * Girl in distress and various states of undress * Twist endingWatching the film may give you the impression that you've seen it before. You have. The film is a remake, and the original ("Ringu") is far spookier. This DreamWorks adaptation isn't quite the bomb that "The Haunting" was, but it is a pale copy of the original. Part of the key of making a good horror film is getting the audience to care about the characters getting axed. In this case, you just don't care and wait for the inevitable gore to take place. When the film (rated PG-13) doesn't bother delivering even that...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "The Ring" made in America yesterday. I have watched the original Ring in Japanese too.American re-make "The Ring" keeps Japanese taste with slight modifications for people here to enjoy the movie beyond the cultural differences. For example, a very long black hair girl with white clothes appears in the movie. Why not short hair? Why not blond? Why not red clothes? There is a reason. I am glad the re-make honors the original concept. Several meaningful items(to scare you) in the original are dropped in the American Ring. I guess it's because non-Japanese don't associate them with anything. Only Japanese do? Maybe so.The plot is little weak though. It is not clear why the girl is not ordinary. The Japanese one explains why. Also, the ending is much more scary in the original. That's why I don't want to watch the original one again....I will not be able to go to the restroom at night.Overall, you will enjoy the re-make one, but watch the original if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hype Vs. Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Ring' arrives after months of discussion about its making. Fans of horror films have long been talking about the original Japanese flick, `Ringu', especially about how it's supposed to be one of the scariest horror films ever made (or something like that). So it's only natural that the Hollywood remake of `The Ring' should have its own built-in hype. After all, it's basically the same story, and that one was one of the scariest horror films ever blah blah blah.After finally seeing `The Ring', I'm wondering what all the fuss was about.Naomi Watts stars as Rachel Keller, a journalist who is drawn into the mysterious circumstances of her niece's death. In the opening sequence, we learn of a videotape that supposedly spells death for anybody who views it (no, not `Armageddon'-something worse, OK?). The rumor goes, you watch the tape, then you get an ominous phone call that informs you that you will die in seven days. The niece has watched it, of course, and the prophecy has come true, so aunt Rachel makes the case her newest scoop. After she traces the video to a remote mountain inn, she naturally watches it, and she soon finds she's similarly marked for death. In the next logical move, she gets her ex-boyfriend to watch the videotape of doom (ha, ha), although after the phone call from beyond comes, I was wondering why nobody bothered to check the caller ID.Rachel's precocious young son (David Dorfman, doing his best `I See Dead People') also gets in on the action, drawing pictures of dead people and other troublesome things. Rachel really gets upset when he, too, watches the damned video (you'd think you would want to put something like that where the kids couldn't reach it, for crying out loud).So Rachel's only course of action is to figure out what the heck the video is before they all become bug-eyed corpses, and she soon uncovers ghostly goings-on in gothic locations. This gives the director the opportunity to regurgitate a number of horror-movie clichs. I noticed blatant references to `The Changeling', `Ghost Story', and `Poltergeist', as well as a shot ripped off from the still-warm `Signs'. There are obvious links to Cronenberg's `Videodrome', `The Sixth Sense,' and the recent `feardotcom', although the latter is probably more derivative of this film's source material. It's hard to keep up with who's stealing what from whom these days.Aside from the derivative aspects of `The Ring', it's got to be said that the worst thing the movie has going for it is its own pre-release buildup. The dreaded videotape of the film's mythos is revealed to us in full, and it's not really all that disturbing. Several reviewers have accurately described it as a Nine Inch Nails video knockoff. It also closely resembles somebody's student film project, as one of the cast members even quips. Ha, ha.`The Ring' has got attitude in spades, although in terms of actual plot developments, it's rather boring. There aren't many truly scary things that happen in the film, and one of the most thrilling sequences turns out to be the scene of a bolting horse on a ferry, although it has little to do with anything. Rather, it seems like it was fabricated to pad out the film. The conclusion seems just as forced, and the movie provides us with several different false climaxes before the thing finally just ends.Although `The Ring' has some impressive cinematography, a good beginning, and an undeniably creepy atmosphere, it seems overly sanitized after all is said and done. The biggest audience reaction when I saw the film was when the credits finally came up and everybody groaned in disbelief. There was an overwhelming feeling of.'That's it???'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies usually don't scare me. Even the ones that are supposed to. This one did. Yes, you have to get past the plot line full of holes and suspend your disbelief, but how many horror movies actually make sense? This film is stylish with great cinematography and images that will haunt you for a while. It is quiet unbelievable that it is only rated PG-13 because it would scare the bejesus out of any more or less impressionable child (more on that later). It scared the bejesus out of an impressionable adult - me. I am pretty sure that this film made me jump and say "sh@t" more then any that I have seen in a while. I would highly recommend not going to see it by yourself and have someone to sleep with after. In my case that would be my girlfriend. We sat in the theater grabbing onto each other and were sure glad we didn't have to come home alone. The characters are not deeply developed and like I have said the story is ludicrous when you actually think about it. But if you forget all that for a moment and remember why you came (to get scared) this movie is one of the best horror films to come out in a few years. It simply works. Yes, it might not be incredibly original in what devices it uses to make your skin crawl, but the skin crawling effect definitely happens. It never lets go and keeps your senses tuned in. The story ties itself more or less well at the end, perhaps leaving more then a possibility for a sequel. I have no qualms recommending it. Definitely not a waste of your money and one to see at the theater as it would lose a lot of its luster on video. One more thing. Someone at our viewing took what looked like a five or six years old girl to it. Please check your head and do not create more psychos that are already floating around in this world! That poor little girl will have nightmares for the next 10 years and someday many of her phobias and weird behavior could be traced back to her moronic older sister taking her to see a film like this. Adults need to remember that children are hundreds of times more impressionable and have no reference points or experience to control their fears. This movie is very scary for a well balanced adult. I can't even imagine what impact the elaborately created, incredibly creepy visions that stick in one's mind would have on a little child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A better-than-expected adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll leave the symbolic analyses of this film to more lettered critics of cinema, and get to the meat of the matter: this film, for all its' Hollywoodized flaws is still miles ahead of anything else in the pack so far this year. Director Verbinski had the wit to adapt as much as he could from the original Japanese version, "Ringu", thereby letting the sheer momentum of the story's corner-of-your-eye horrors herd the viewer into an inescapable nightmare. It accomplishes the neat trick of (mostly) sidestepping all of our "here-it-comes" expectations and coming out of left field to deliver something even more horrible. It reminded me of Stephen King's comment twenty years ago, when he said that he thinks books are better at conveying horror than movies because with books you can get the audience alone, one at a time. "The Ring" came closer for me than most other American films(exceptions being the 1963 version of "The Haunting" and "Wait Until Dark") at doing just that. When I saw it recently in a packed theater, the audience laughed nervously every time the expected scare made them jump; about two-thirds of the way in, nobody was laughing, and we were all pulling for Naomi Watts' heroine to solve this horrifying riddle of the fatal video tape and save herself and her loved ones. It really conjured up a modern-day horror to address modern alienation, and its attendant ills. By the way, in addressing another reviewer's canard on this site: yes, Verbinski's insistance on using overly loud "whooomph!" sound effects was fairly annoying, but that failed to kill the mood this film conjured up for me and millions of others. If you want a REALLY annoying example of intrusive music and "BOOGA-BOOGA!" foley effects, catch "Ghost Story". I saw that turkey when it came out in '81, and it was all I could do not to throw my large-size Coke Classic at the screen. A small editorial note: any and all critics who didn't find this film even a little spooky obviously suffer the "auteur disease": if it's made in America,it's automatically crap; if it's made in France, they'll kiss it's ass no matter how bad it is.

		<shortDescription>Hype Vs. Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Ring' arrives after months of discussion about its making. Fans of horror films have long been talking about the original Japanese flick, `Ringu', especially about how it's supposed to be one of the scariest horror films ever made (or something like that). So it's only natural that the Hollywood remake of `The Ring' should have its own built-in hype. After all, it's basically the same story, and that one was one of the scariest horror films ever blah blah blah.After finally seeing `The Ring', I'm wondering what all the fuss was about.Naomi Watts stars as Rachel Keller, a journalist who is drawn into the mysterious circumstances of her niece's death. In the opening sequence, we learn of a videotape that supposedly spells death for anybody who views it (no, not `Armageddon'-something worse, OK?). The rumor goes, you watch the tape, then you get an ominous phone call that informs you that you will die in seven days. The niece has watched it, of course, and the prophecy has come true, so aunt Rachel makes the case her newest scoop. After she traces the video to a remote mountain inn, she naturally watches it, and she soon finds she's similarly marked for death. In the next logical move, she gets her ex-boyfriend to watch the videotape of doom (ha, ha), although after the phone call from beyond comes, I was wondering why nobody bothered to check the caller ID.Rachel's precocious young son (David Dorfman, doing his best `I See Dead People') also gets in on the action, drawing pictures of dead people and other troublesome things. Rachel really gets upset when he, too, watches the damned video (you'd think you would want to put something like that where the kids couldn't reach it, for crying out loud).So Rachel's only course of action is to figure out what the heck the video is before they all become bug-eyed corpses, and she soon uncovers ghostly goings-on in gothic locations. This gives the director the opportunity to regurgitate a number of horror-movie clichs. I noticed blatant references to `The Changeling', `Ghost Story', and `Poltergeist', as well as a shot ripped off from the still-warm `Signs'. There are obvious links to Cronenberg's `Videodrome', `The Sixth Sense,' and the recent `feardotcom', although the latter is probably more derivative of this film's source material. It's hard to keep up with who's stealing what from whom these days.Aside from the derivative aspects of `The Ring', it's got to be said that the worst thing the movie has going for it is its own pre-release buildup. The dreaded videotape of the film's mythos is revealed to us in full, and it's not really all that disturbing. Several reviewers have accurately described it as a Nine Inch Nails video knockoff. It also closely resembles somebody's student film project, as one of the cast members even quips. Ha, ha.`The Ring' has got attitude in spades, although in terms of actual plot developments, it's rather boring. There aren't many truly scary things that happen in the film, and one of the most thrilling sequences turns out to be the scene of a bolting horse on a ferry, although it has little to do with anything. Rather, it seems like it was fabricated to pad out the film. The conclusion seems just as forced, and the movie provides us with several different false climaxes before the thing finally just ends.Although `The Ring' has some impressive cinematography, a good beginning, and an undeniably creepy atmosphere, it seems overly sanitized after all is said and done. The biggest audience reaction when I saw the film was when the credits finally came up and everybody groaned in disbelief. There was an overwhelming feeling of.'That's it???'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a 48 year-old male, who is a former football player- tough-guy, and this film scared the he** out of me!Great story development that carries things along well, without the need for a bunch of special effects. The ending made me squirm so far down in my seat, that I had to wipe the popcorn and sticky goo from the floor off of my knees, when I left the theatre.I am not a big fan of slasher movies, or movies that rely on overblown soundtracks to get you moving. In this movie, the visuals and the sound were icing on the cake. The story is one of those great "urban myth" "campfire stories" that leaves you crawling with "what if..."My other two favorite movies of this ilk are "Ghost Story" and The Changeling." Both had similar themes, but "The Ring" took things to a new level of "creepy."I will be sure and send my friends blank videos for Christmas... then call them and whisper "7 days..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film expecting to be disappointed, considering the low quality of horror films lately. The Ring is well made, and decently acted, but like The Cell, the 'look' of the film is what is most appealing.After seeing it I saw the original Japanese film from 1998. The Japanese version (Ringu) told a similar story but without some of the touches Gore Verbinski used to appeal to Western audiences. Ringu was much more subtle about revealing the secrets of the tape while Ring is a little more blatant about some things, like the 'seven days' revelation near the end. I thought it was a very disturbing and original film. The people who think The Ring is stealing ideas from Feardotcom or some PS2 game obviously don't realize where the concept started.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes. Naomi Watts, whom I loved in Mulholland Dr., and a wonderful premise about being doomed after viewing a video recording, had me hooked.Then I saw it. A conventional slasher-style opening, but I was willing to forgive it for that. And I will admit, when we do see the video, it is wonderfully cryptic and eerily surreal, and that's always a selling point for me.But right after that, it all goes downhill. The characters get dumber, the jump-scenes louder, and the story line far too conventional. The filmmakers answer all the wrong questions and ignore the right ones; they try to be cryptic, but still dumb it down for standard acceptance. And the ending was about twenty minutes longer than it should have been, and a sad attempt to make this above the typical "ghost" story. They take a nice, eerie, atmospherical set up and turn it into a special effects "here's what we haven't been showing you!" horror show, quite reminiscent of House on Haunted Hill (1999) or The Haunting (1999 as well). And that blasted ring that keeps popping up is quite headache-inducing.I did like the idea of the video, I did like the video itself (very "Lynchian" touch--a nod to Watts' last job, perhaps), but beyond that, it's typical Hollywood horror fare, which taxes the suspension of disbelief just a bit too much, and which, quite frankly, we're getting too much of.Most people I know said it was creepy. But the rest, who have been exposed to a wider range of far-better films, concur: when you see the Ring, you will crave Tylenol.I've seen worse, but I've also seen a helluva lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great horror, room for a possible (American) sequel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to hide it, I love this movie. But it isn't going to love you back, as you are going to exit the theater with major goosebumps.For those who don't want too many spoilers: It's creepy, it'll get to you, you'll want to analyze it to death afterwards. Now go see it.(spoilers ahead) The Ring is a remake of the Japanese blockbuster Ringu. The only thing that the American version has extra in it is the relation to horses.The Japanese Ringu already has several sequels. But now with the relation to horses and with the scenes at the asylum with the x-rays of the horses, along with several other scenes in the movie, an intresting conclusion might lead to a very creepy sequel.Since Samara's mother (Anna) was not able to conceive a child, perhaps Richard Morgan wanted to give her the greatest gift of all, a child. And in his desperation to give them the only thing needed to reach perfect happiness was through invitro. Only, he impregnated not a human carrier, but a mare (female horse). Noone knew until the mare gave birth. Anna found out, went bananas and threw herself off a cliff. And obviously Samara wasn't all 1+1 either. She turned out to have special powers, alongside a twisted personality. And those powers only grew ripe when she got killed.Put together (day)dreams, horses and a monster. What do you get?Incubus/succubus: A demon; a fiend; a lascivious spirit, supposed to have sexual intercourse with women by night.(male form) The devils who appeared in the female form were generally called succubi; those who appeared like men incubi, though this distinction was not always preserved. They were also known to evoke TERRIFYING DREAMS. In other words: -nightmares-.Here is where American bases screenwriters can take off and leave the original scrips behind, and make it worthwhile to have made a remake of the first Ringu.Would be nice to see a 'The Ring' meets 'Exorcist' meets 'Nightmare on Elm Street'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Ring" is a modern day avant garde thriller that plays on subconscious and psychological levels of the audience. One should not view the film literally or otherwise sacrifice its shock value. Many parallel imagery is made throughout the movie that gives it a certain look and feel. Keep in mind that it's a remake of a Japanese film and no comparisons should be made to "Sixth Sense", "Feardotcom" or any contemporary thrillers.</fullReview>

I wasn't scared ONCE throughout the movie's entirety. I didn't find the plot to be intriguing, and I felt it left a lot of questions that remained unanswered. Certain potentially scary elements were thrown at the audience and never returned to. The Sixth Sense was far scarier. I don't know though, because everyone in the theater and everyone else who saw it aside from my friend and I thought it was extremely scary.

		<fullReview>WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADWell, after putting it off all week I finally got around to seeing the RING and I must say, they did far better than I thought, but still managed to make the film laughably mediocre compared to the original. First off, the lineage and many of the characters most interesting quirks were dropped in the American version in favor of dumbing down for the typically less attentive american audiences, but they sure never had a problem dropping all the artsy bulls**t which was totally and unbelievably unnecessary instead of building pain, dread and suffering. I swear to god, the continual showing of the tree was about to drive me mad! The film had no issues with showing alot of Arthouse CGI crap, nor did it have problems using loud noises to illicit a response from the crowd... things that in many ways hurt it in my eyes. You see, the original Hideo Nakata Ring had so much dread and a foreboding sense of doom by the end you almost felt like crawling in a well yourself, but this version seems to come and go in how it approaches the subject. Naomi Watts sense of death crawling to her seems almost lost in many scenes, much as if she turns it off and on by command, or quite frankly didn't care. Brian Cox's character also suffers much in the American version because unlike his counterpart in the Nippon version you never really get an idea of just why Samara/Sadako is such a monster and why she had to be dealt with... he was truly disturbed and hiding demons, the DreamWorks version makes him too vague to matter and its a shame. Noah is by far the most ruined character of all, and is totally stripped of all his psychic ability and made a non factor and totally uninteresting, whereas Ryuji was mysterious and played an important part. Thankfully Daveigh Chase does a wonderful job recreating Sadako for the American audience, she is far and away one of the films true saving graces. Onto the production. Not too bad, but more emphsis was placed on how the people and film looked than the content. The cursed videotape itself was a joke as well compared to the original, as it looked like a second rate MTV video some Mallcore band would produce. The original had almost a `snuff' quality and captured all the rage and mysterious hatred Sadako had for humanity and due to its low production and dark feel was very, very creepy unlike the glossy, overproduced and sorely overdone DreamWorks one. Perhaps DreamWorks felt the audience was too dumb to understand it, afterall it was laid out like connect the dots and was so pronounced that it lost all the effectiveness of its Asian counterpart. I did however like the ending better than the `Sarah Conner' ending of the original, but even so it did little to make up for the mishmash that occurred to get you to that point. Samaras inevitable (and greatly looked forward to by me) emergence was also very nice, as was the added addition of her room and the horse going mad. The film also seemed to borrow lightly from another Nakata film, the magnificent Dark Water which is not a bad thing, but just another shot at the lack of originality in American filmmaking and how instead of real minds like Nakata giving us real horror we get stuck with second rate trash like Scream and pretty much anything Wes Craven produces. All in all I give it a 5.5 out of 10, if you can seek out the original as it is far superior in almost every way. Hopefully though, the outright theft of great ideas from Japan like this will light a fire under what is a pathetic and dead genre in the US, and maybe move us towards films that care more about fright than selling merchandise or hocking the latest Compilation album of Eminem and Slipnot...</fullReview>

I'm interested to see the original and make comparisons.The horse scence on the ferry was quite well done, but didn't add much to the movie as a whole. Things are a little fuzzy at times, but that's life. Not everything is clean cut.Every review I've read so far has stated there were unanswered questions, the ending didn't make sense. Sure it did. The key is that Samara wanted to be heard. The tape was a form of chain letter. Pass it on or die. Everyone hears her and she'll go away.Not a top ten film, but not a waste of money either. And there are a couple of homages to Hitchcock films as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, there were some plot holes in this movie, but a perfect picture is a rare thing.The acting was okay, and the suspense was good at times, but could have been better. I'm interested to see the original and make comparisons.The horse scence on the ferry was quite well done, but didn't add much to the movie as a whole. Things are a little fuzzy at times, but that's life. Not everything is clean cut.Every review I've read so far has stated there were unanswered questions, the ending didn't make sense. Sure it did. The key is that Samara wanted to be heard. The tape was a form of chain letter. Pass it on or die. Everyone hears her and she'll go away.Not a top ten film, but not a waste of money either. And there are a couple of homages to Hitchcock films as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film expecting to be disappointed, considering the low quality of horror films lately. The Ring is well made, and decently acted, but like The Cell, the 'look' of the film is what is most appealing.After seeing it I saw the original Japanese film from 1998. The Japanese version (Ringu) told a similar story but without some of the touches Gore Verbinski used to appeal to Western audiences. Ringu was much more subtle about revealing the secrets of the tape while Ring is a little more blatant about some things, like the 'seven days' revelation near the end. I thought it was a very disturbing and original film. The people who think The Ring is stealing ideas from Feardotcom or some PS2 game obviously don't realize where the concept started.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, I had never heard of the original Ringu before this, but I was interested when someone at work brought me 'the tape' and I watched it. At first I thought it was going to be another Scream clone, but I soon found myself completely, and thoroughly freaked out. The opening sequence was somewhat predictable (scary, but predictable), but for me, that was where the film took a very dark turn. I have been a horror movie fan for years, and have NEVER covered my eyes, or looked away from a horror film EVER. This film scared me. There were several parts where I was unable to look directly at the screen. I actually COVERED my eyes. The spliced in frames of 'the ring' flashing on the screen stayed with me for the entire next day. It didn't have that great of a script, but I thought the actors did well with what they had. I was alittle disappointed with the ending, but overall I was so affected by this that I almost had nightmares. My wife thought it was so funny that I was scared that she set up a little joke to play on me right before I was about to fall asleep. She chose a blank channel on the tv in our bedroom (yes, snow and white noise) and hid the remote under her pillow, turning on the tv as I was just drifting off. Funny, right? Anyway, even with the so-so script, and the hollywood anding, it was still the scariest film I have ever seen. Ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the original, but not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many reviews I've read have put this down SERIOUSLY in comparison to it's original. Harsh reviews make this out to seem like a movie the likes of Blood Lake, The Sandman, or Jack-O (sad to say I've seen). It's NOT at all that bad, in fact, I rather enjoyed it. Let's go over a few things, shall we? Be prepared for lite spoilers.Okay, it's true, this has more shock value and less suspense than the original, yes, it's an American remake, but that doesn't make it absolute and total crap (one person suggested waiting till it went to the dollar movies... what the hell were they watching?). There is still a good deal of suspense. The shocks even, I venture to say, add some scare value during the movie that the original lacked, yet it still builds suspense (though not as much as the original, as said).Fine performances are put on by all, and the little boy didn't annoy me as much as I thought he would have. However, the character of Noah (played by someone I don't remember) was a weak link in the chain. He had no specific personality, in fact, he was rather dull, and wished for Takayama Ryuji to suddenly appear and help Rachel. Rachel, Naomi Watts, it shows that the chick in the movie CAN do something other than look up a few things (okay, okay, Reiko went in the well in the end, but she did little else). She I prefered to the original Asakawa Reiko. If only Noah were more like Ryuji... Our two children are interesting and creepy. But why did they cut Samara's greatest line ("Everyone will suffer.")? Sigh.Contrary to popular belief, not EVERYTHING is explained from the video (fingers in box, maggots) and not all is explained regarding the little girl (Why DID the horses die? WAS it her?) among other things (why were they at the mountain place with the horses, and when? We KNOW Ikuma took Sadako there after the suicide. Wait... something explained in RING but not in THE RING. AGH!).The ending... okay, the very end was SO much better in the original. However, the tv ending... well, certain things are creepier in the remake. And also, the deaths are much more interesting (and easier to explain, it's not a virus here... ugh, the virus idea... a point where THE RING is better).Overall, see this movie, it's really damn good. Watch the original too. Sure, it's better, but this is not bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring is based on an earlier Japanese that was probably better than this. It follows a woman who comes into the possession of a tape that's viewers die after seven days. She then goes on a quest to find the origins of the tape before it kills again. Oooh. The storyline sounds like a bad TV movie on the Sci-Fi channel The American version is full of loud noises at the beginning of a scene that is supposed to be scary. There are parts where a bunch of people in the audience jump and i didn't even blink. There were some creepy shots and some intentional and unintentional funny moments which saved it from being a total loss. Still, i would recommend Red Dragon instead. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Idea, B Movie Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Figures that this is a remake of a movie with a great premise. Unfortunately it is butchered into a B-movie execution. The acting is weak, the editing is weaker, and the plot holes, some ridiculous dialogue and unrealistic events keep it well within B-movie status. It is entertaining but you'll be left unsatisfied at the end of the movie, feeling like too much was left out and that the whole script and movie was a sloppy effort.The premise in this movie is enough to radiate fear. But from there everything goes downhill although there are one or two nicely done scares. But this is a not great movie, nor even a very good one. That doesn't mean it isn't entertaining but it is instantly forgettable. The audience had a few shriekers and a lot of laughers because of some silliness in the film. I'm looking forward to seeing the Japanese version.The biggest crime in the creation of this movie is the total lack of depth to the script or reasons behind what goes on. Things happen just "because." It's so silly that at the end you say "well why did that happen? Most good horror movies give you the reasons and answers but this one leaves you with questions, namely, how in the world did this movie get made with such open holes? I can answer the high ratings here -- major ballot box stuffing must have gone on at the IMDB. This movie is nothing more than a 6 at best. Great idea. Truly. Poor execution. See the Japanese version first...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to get into the whole thing about it being a remake and all of that. If you're a smart person working a job and looking for a good scare, see this movie. I grew up watching Freddy and Jason and every episode of "Faces of Death" hundreds of times. I've seen all of the classic horror films from "Night of the Living Dead" to "Exorcist." I even watched the original "Ringu" as well as "Ring", the Korean remake of "Ringu." But this movie scared and disturbed me more than anything I've ever seen or read.Maybe it was the theater environment or maybe even the mood I was in, but this movie freaked me out. Driving home wasn't easy and I'll have to see how I do going to sleep tonight. And like I say, I grew up on gore and violence so it's not like I'm sensitive or anything. Get some friends, head to this movie and watch grown men scream along side thirteen year-old girls. It's a lot of fun. 9/10.PS: Notice how many people are more disturbed by what happens in the ferry scene with the horse than the fact that four teenagers died. You can waste all of the humans you want, but don't mess with the animals. I love Americans.</fullReview>

Okay, so you watch this well directed (Bjork type) vhs that have all these "hidden secrets", you a get a phone call (from who, because it never says) &amp; then you die in seven days. I anticipated so much fear in this film &amp; was given about a 10% scare. No, this was not the worst movie in history nor the next "classic." The film is full of suspence that builds up to nothing but a dry yet witty, plain yet intense, boring yet mysterious 99cents video rental. Sorry, but the RING is exactly what it is in the film, a "well"-deep hole or shaft drilled into the ground to store water or oil. Exciting? I think not. 1-10 (3) Z.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>forget the plot holes, this is an instant-classic chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring is not a horror movie or even a thriller. This is definitely a "chiller," an emerging genre which seems to be blossoming after the success of The Blair Witch Project. Like other movies of it's ilk, it combines the sometimes sickening fright value of horror movies with the thrillers' unique way of packing a suspenseful detective story into a ticking-clock ("i hope they make it...i hope the make it..."). It's a distinctly non-Hollywood kind of filmmaking, I can't think of any of the popular chillers of the past few years that has been particularly satisfying for an American audience so used to nice, neat endings. The one that came closest to tying everything up, The Sixth Sense, is also the most celebrated, interestingly enough. Yes, a lot goes answered at the end -- some of it is deliberately ambiguous, some of it begs questions that actually SHOULD have been answered, and a lot of it can't make any sense. This movie's biggest flaw is asking questions that it never even attempts to address, let alone answer.But plot is not the strength of this film. It's strength is an impending sense of dread -- the waiting for the horror to happen -- and this movie is so great for making you feel that dread almost constantly. There are great stretches in the film when nearly nothing "scary" in the traditional sense happens, but looking around in the theater at all the covered faces, you would think somebody was getting knocked-off every three minutes.Kudos to the director and the cinematographer Bozen Bazelli for creating what I think is the most visually-arresting movie since Requiem for a Dream. I recently saw a preview of the director's upcoming project Butterfly, which, despite being a science-fiction melodrama, is just as hard on an audience as The Ring. It's what you see and how it is shot that frightens you, rather than you what know. Zimmerman's score is incredible -- I just bought it today, and I saw the movie last night. There's nothing here to challenge last summer's The Others as the best of the new chillers, neither will this film keep you up at night (like Blair Witch did if you saw it before the hoax was exposed). But it is a feast for the senses, and well-worth the money, which is true of few movies these days. Ignore the plot holes, and just LOOK.</fullReview>

My Take: 10/10My MPAA rating: PG-13 for intense horrific terror content including disturbing images, and for some non-relevent language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VERY SCARY!!! but the images they show, are so disturbing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie, alot, but what they showed, when was on that tape, was so disturbing. Not so much the tape, but the whole concept of the tape. How the person dies. Sahara was one freaky chick. when she comes out of the television. The way she comes out of the well. I was so disturbed by the images and the fact that the mother kills her daughter while saying, You'll All I Ever Wanted. That kid who played Aiden is going to be a huge Hollywood star one day. I usually don't get scared that easily and horror movies are kind of watered down for me, but as my sister was hiding behind a jacket, I was covering my eyes durring the freaky parts. If you like horror and being scared, you will LOVE The Ring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was excellent!!! I recommend this movie to all of you who read my comment but do not go and see this alone. That is not a good idea!!! Go see this with a group of friends. That will be better for this kind of a movie. This movie is very scary as well!!! Not many movies make it on my five stars out of five stars list (*****/*****) but this one along with Lord of the Rings is one of the few. Of all the horror films I have seen, this one even meets the scariness of the Exorcist. That is hard to do!!! This film has several different turns and twists and if you dont pay attention to the entire film, you will be lost in the first half hour!!! Have fun and see a great movie with 'The Ring'!!! (P.S. Very Very entertaining yet all the pictures of the film stay in your mind for a very very long time!!!)!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>borrowed tricks, unsatisfactory end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I thought to myself after seeing this movie, wow I am kinda scared! And yet, I feel unsatisfied with my experience. Hmm. Why could that be?The Ring (I have not seen the original Japanese version 'Ringu', but want to) steals terror tricks from every good horror movie I have ever seen. It steals the wonderfully frightening and macabre TV scenes from Poltergeist; it steals the backwoods myth/underground rumor fears from Blair Witch Project; it steals the loud animal (horse in this case) noises from everything I have ever seen from Cujo to The Omen to the hospital machines in The Exorcist; and most importantly it steals its visuals from Hitchcock (Rope, Psycho and North by Northwest come to mind). On top of all this, The Ring uses BUGS to creep us out. Yes, I am not kidding, centipedes and flies are used in this film to frighten us. Even this element is reminiscent of another film, Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom. Lastly, The Ring uses a run-of-the-mill Hollywood-hook punchline to grab us at the film's end. Who would have thunk it? Who could possibly have guessed it? Yes indeed, this entire time we the audience have been watching the very film that will curse us with a grueling and miserable week preceding our untimely demise! (In all fairness, despite the fact that this hook was so obvious to most intelligent viewers, it was still scary.)I once heard that all good art is borrowed, and all great art is stolen. The Ring is indeed borrowed, and from a film I hear is far better. The acting is decent, the pacing is good, the effects are passable, and the horror tricks are well used. The film will scare you, this is true. But if you logically criticize the film, you will be left confused and unfulfilled. If you see the movie ask yourself this, at the end what are you really left with? An inexplicably evil video tape monster? Huh, I see scarier stuff on a daily basis in the Chicago Tribune's headlines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On it's own, a great looking film with a worthwhile payoff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was dragged to this movie kicking and screaming. I had heard the buzz on the internet (mostly negative) bashing this film in comparison to the original. I was so unprepared for a movie I would enjoy and it made this experience all the more thrilling.The Ring is not a grand piece of cinema. If I were to make a short list of movies my favorite thrillers it would include... The Haunting (w/ Vincent Price), The Shining, my first viewing of Poltergiest, the Exorcist, and Eraserhead. These movies creeped me out because the atmosphere, backstories and characters played on our primal fears... things which we can't control. Other films recent films like The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Others and examples of clever storytelling with the spooky payoff at the end. The "Ring" succeeds less on telling it's story and more on imagery that conveying the feeling of dread. Like the first grainy images of Nosferatu... or the reverse speaking dwarf in Twin Peaks", the videotape in "The Ring" leaves you with an uneasy cold, dark feeling. It's what you see in our nightmares, images that neither make sense nor are relevant. The next day you try to piece together what you dreamed but it doesn't make any sense... but those images may stay with you a lifetime.The acting is effective. Naomi Watt does a great job at playing the conformed believer. Martin Henderson looks great and does a solid job with limited matieral. Director Gore Verbinski does a fine job with the borrowed matieral, keeping the pace and balance of the film (mystery and horror) from getting sunk in the mud. His crisp direction, active camera work and use of imagery make this a feast for the eyes... even if you want them shut at times. He's also smart enough to give suitable reigns to his support staff and post production team. The standout elements are the great cinemtography, Rick Baker's all too brief makeup effect work and Han Zimmer's haunting score. Of course there's the ending which was worth the price of admission. See The Ring with an open mind and prepare to be entertained.7 out of 10-Grant Poughkeepsie, NY</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lemme Break this on down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeez, I went and saw the ring the other day, and I gotta tell you, I was pretty impressed with it. It is one of the very few enjoyable horror films I have seen in the last several months, and I think this is due to a couple of different reasons.First of all, I have never seen the original movie. I genuinely want to, but haven't had the opportunity to do so yet. Also, I really, really want to enjoy horror movies. Call me retarded, but I'm keeping the faith that sooner or later, really good horror movies are going to get made again.There are a couple things, however, that I would like to bring up before letting The Ring go without suffering at least a little bit of my wrath. First of all, the beginning, with the two school girls talking about the tape, was utter crap. Now, I'm not sure if this scene was a part of the original, but if it was, I hope it was executed a little better than it was here. It all seemed a bit too "I know what you did last summer" for me. Which brings me to my next point.If I were Gore Verbinski, and I were directing this movie, I would make DAMN Sure that Ehren Kruger's name was nowhere near it! Not to take away from Ehren Krugers ability as a writer, because I'm sure it's formidable, but wasn't this the person that wrote Scream 3? If you ask me, there is a certain stigma attached to the scream movies that makes me want to run away screaming from anyone involved. When I drop my hard earned wompum down on the theater counter, I want to know that I am supporting TRUE horror, not sappy, bubble gummy, I still know what I caught you doing last summer, horror. If the Scream movies were a living breathing entity, that could be reckoned with, I would wait until it was taking a crap and shank it with a homemade knife. That would be a crime worth doing time over. Imagine the respect I would get in prison!Guard: Hey, have you seen the new guy?Guard 2: Yeah I heard he killed scream!Prisoners United: HOOORAY!!!I would have more ho's than Suge Night!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just came back from seeing The Ring with my 12 y/o son. We both thought it was entertaining, not the best horror film we've ever seen, but definitely creepy enough to linger in your head. I just had to post because I kept reading others post and ask "How did the images get on the videotape?". Well, we inferred that when the kids were there, trying to tape a football game on the tv, as they were directly *over* where Samara was, she magnetically transferred them with her mind. They were her memories! Duh!(Ok, she's a ghost, but she had that power when she was alive.... remember the xray -looking things in her file, and when she was talking to the psychologist? That was the same stuff that videotape is made of, folks!) Rachael was a horrible mother, I really felt very little for her.All in all, since it didn't end when I thought it would, I give it credit for not going the cheesy, happy Hollywood ending route. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE Best Scary Movie...Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm an avid horror/suspense/thriller fan and this flick blew me away! First off with the vagueness of the trailers you really don't know what to expect and I tried not to find out too much about the movie ahead of time--my usual practice with scary movies because lately the movies seemed ruined by the detailed trailers. So going into this movie all I was thinking was "When you see the ring, you die."The suspense was terrific! The shock/surprise of the first scary image (if you've seen the movie you know what I'm referring to) was awesome. And then of course from their it just builds and builds until THE scariest movie scene I've ever watched (to date, that I can remember). I definitely give this film two thumbs up! Don't read too much about it, if you can, it'll increase the fear factor.And a bonus was you didn't figure the whole story out 15 minutes into the movie. I'm notorious for guessing the entire plot and then sitting for an hour and a half waiting for it to play itself out. Not with this movie. About halfway through I even turned to my sister and said "I don't know where they're going with this...I am confused." LOL it was great. So definitely give this movie a view or two. And thanks to the creators for restoring my faith in the scary movie makers ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an assault on your senses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Be careful with this one! It accomplishes exactly what it wants to. The acting is excellent, and the plot is quite intriguing and mysterious. You will leave the theatre thinking about what actually happened and trying to put all the links together, while at the same time not feeling lost. That said, this is not your typical scary movie. This does not use foreshadowing and suspense music in the traditional way. Most horror films will build the suspense with foreshadowing, but this also allows you to be prepared when the freaky stuff shows up. In the ring, you have no clue when its gonna hit you.....that is combined with the fact that the scenes are more gruesome and brutal than any ive ever seen. It can be a bit much. The scenes don't really make you jump so much as cringe deep down inside, with a hellascious spine tingle to boot. This is the kind of movie that will give you nightmares for a long time if you are prone to that sort of thing. It assaults you in a more subliminal way, in a way you have never experienced before, and the effect is much more lasting and powerful.The screen is usually filled with terrible images, and you should keep this in mind before you enter the theatre. Be in the mood for a chill, and you'll love this one. If you are looking for a "scream" type thriller look else where. The is no quirky fun here.</fullReview>

I would have liked to have more explanation about Samara's powers. I thought it was a bit of a cop out that the viewer was told little about what made her into what she became. Also, if samara was causing all that trouble while dead in the well, then what does it mean when the little boy asks his mom, "you didnt let her out did you?" She was causing just as much havic inside, so whats the difference? It was holes like these in the ring that dissappointed me a bit.

		<shortDescription>Impressed, but prefer the Japanese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched the original first; my first view of the new one prompt me to compare automatically. I liked how some scares worked in the film but really showed that they were a forced effort. The Japanese version was more subtle in the horror, and has a stinging ambience. I could tell you a few things that really made the transition a staggering one to watch. First of all, the opening scene, which everyone doubts the "Scream" opener, was quite ridiculous. The attitude in the girls' faces screamed how lame horror movies can be. That scene wasn't bad but it was like parodized a good horror movie. Naomi Watts was "all right" in her role, but she didn't really feel how her character felt. A big chunk of the original concept of Japanese version was stripped away and was filled in with the story of horses. The video itself was so overdone, it could of passed off as an art film more than a video with scary images. The Japanese version was simple, the images was gritty, and dark, but distortions really evoked eerie images in our minds. The infamous ending, however, was creepy and had me on the edge. But then again, it was really forced. Overall, the film was intended to introduce a new intense psychological thriller to audiences, to get them squirming in their chair. The music, and some scenes were quite memorable, but the film references (i.e. Rear Window)and opening scene was laughable. If you never seen the original, the plot is now more confused than its predecessor.</fullReview>

Normally any movie above 8.0 on IMDB with over 100 voters is guaranteed to be great. I was expecting big things. I could not believe how bad the acting was right off the bat - it looked like a horror comedy. It was so bad the audience was pretending to scream and then laughing because the scene was so phoney. There were a couple of good scenes in it that were impressive like the horse falling off the ferry but there were so many bad ones and the story was so unexplained - that it was a relief when the movie ended. I am utterly astounded at the rating of this movie - I think it must have been a conspiracy to pump up the ratings because I cannot explain how about 1400 people could give it an 8.2 rating - that means 35% of the voters gave it a 10 out of 10. Are they insane? My confidence in this rating scheme has been shattered...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ever play Fatal Frame?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie a lot, which says a lot because I don't like much. Very critical. This movie had a great story line, great cast and near perfect pop-outs. The only complaint on those is that they were CONSTANT. EVERY scene change started with a loud (yet innocent) bang that became redundant and annoying. Some parts were very predictable, some were not. You'd better hope they ALL are because when the big ones come, they will DISTURB you. The images will stay with you as the last thing you see before you fall asleep. But that's what makes a horror movie great! I'm asked if it was scary and all I can say is yes, but in my defense of not sounding like a COMPLETE coward, it's a fun scary for you macho guys. You'll get scared no matter who you are, but you'll like it. Bring someone with you, or the ride home will be pretty rough all by yourself.The spoilers end so keep scrolling. S P O I L E R S !The ending was somewhat lacking. She makes a copy and the curse is lifted? Didn't do much for me. I won't argue that Samara coming out of the TV wasn't arguably the most terrifying scene in the movie, but I think Rachel holding Samara's corpse and somewhat "setting the spirit free" was a good ending.Fatal Frame is a game for PS2 based on real events that happened in a mansion in Japan. For those that have played it, there's a scene at the end of the game when Kirie comes out of a mirror. Kirie is a long, dark-haired Japanese ghost who wears a white kimono. (See the similarities?) So the TV ending didn't do as much to me as it could've.END S P O I L E R S Whether you've mastered Fatal Frame, are known as fearless, or cower at the sight of a spider, The Ring will be tons of fun and keep you jumping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is scary, there is no denying that. Gore verbinski does a great job of giving the audience a little of everything you could want from a scary/horror movie; dark, dank settings, creepy kids, a gloomy storyline, plenty of "jump" moments, and an overall plot that keeps you guessing. The characters do a good job not overacting, which is so often the norm in movies like this, and Naomi Watts is an absolute treat to watch on the screen not only because of her absolutely breathtaking beauty but also because of her obvious talent. There is no all looks and no talent, or as I like to call it Julia Roberts syndrom here. The girl can act. So if you are looking for a recommendation it is simple; GO AND SEE IT!!!!! It will creep you out, at least a little bit, and around Halloween time, as we all parade around to haunted house after haunted house, isn't that what it is all about?But for those of you who did see it, doesn't the movie lose a bit by leaving so many questions unanswered? When I say questions I mean questions about plot holes which, after a night of thinking on it, there seem to be a plethera of. SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!First, why does it seem that the video tape is, on one hand a documented recording of Samara's memory, and at other times it appears it is fortelling the future for the characters? At one point, upon leaving a building, Watt's character walks under a ladder and remembers the ladder from the video. Fortelling the future. But why does the video do nothing of the sort for the rest of movie? Wouldn't it have been better if it were simply a recorded memory?Second, why is the father still alive? He obviously knows of the tape, has even seen it, knows what it can do, knows what his daughter does through the tape, and we know that Samara hated her father. So why does he live until he takes his own life? Why not go after him? Why not kill him?Third, this is less of a plot hole then just an absolutely assinine thing, but why, when she goes up to the horse and it freaks out does she continue to stay near it/try and calm it down? Wouldn't you get the sense after, I don't know, the second full body convulsion the horse has that maybe you are not a horse person? Maybe you would walk away at that point but Watt's character keeps going as if some magic combination of "Shhsh" and "calm down boy" would put the horse into a deep sleep. Yes, we get it, the horses hated Samara because she hated them and killed them so they can sense her presence. We don't need a completely insane moment to prove it.Fourth, why wouldn't Watts have picked up on the fact that the doctor asks Samara on the tape if she still wants to hurt people? How could she just gloss over that? It was pretty clear, doctor on the other side of a glass sheet, first bad indicator right there, asking a very creepy looking girl whether she wanted to hurt her mother anymore and very creepy girl answering no but she can't help it. Boy, not something I would soon forget. You would think that would have been a clue that the girl was just a bit off and that maybe it wasn't just about a mean old man making her live in a barn all the time.Fifth, why does the father hit her? He doesn't try and kill her, she isn't taking evidence that could lead to some sort of harmful event for him, and she recovers pretty easily from it just to watch him kill himself. Why hit her? He was just pissed she used the VCR without asking? He decided it was either that or put off killing himself and heat up some coffee? Doesn't make much sense.Sixth, if the kid, who gets all huffy when he finds out his parents helped out the girl, knew that Samara was evil and should not be helped or aided in any way, why not tell his mom? Why does he just sit back, draw some horrible painting, the kid has no talent, and make it seem as if the girl is a nice little ghost who comes to visit him? Why not have the " oh by the way, that girl that comes to me and shows me things, you know the girl who said she is gonna kill you, well she is pretty damn evil so be careful and for Goidsakes don't help her" conversation? That never crossed the kids mind?Seventh, what is the point of finding out, so late in the game, that the guy, the random VCR geek guy, is in fact the father of the kid? Why are we told this in the middle of the movie? Why is this information so shocking that it requires a sudden, poignant moment of it's own in the MIDDLE of the movie? Does anyone really believe that people would have left thinking "Boy that was good, but I really wish they would have saved who the kids father was until right in the middle of the flick. That would have made it an Oscar contender."Finally, what the hell good does it do the creepy evil girl to have been released from her well? Instead of killing people through the TV she now comes out of the TV and kills people. Wow, big freakin Wow. She still has to wait I guess, she still has to go through the tape, and she still, I assume, has to wait 7 days or she would have killed the guy that same day as when she was released. And in the end Watts and the kid beat the system by making copies and showing it to people. So thats all you have to do I guess, make a copy and sho it to someone else and your off. So why is thise so damn bad? Tell that person to make a copy, the next person the same, and on and on and on until poor little creepy evil girl can't kill anyone cause their all making copies. Of course she would have a huge comeback when VCR's are all replaced by DVDs and no one can make a copy anymore, but until then she is kinda up the creek. And this after doing so much to get herself freed from the well, she still has to live/kill by the same rules. Kinda kills the whole plot at the end, doesn't it.But funny thing is I still recommend this movie. Go see it and don't think till you get out of the theatre. Then you can rip it to shreads of the course of a few days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not the best thriller ever, but highly effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ring" has something going for it that most thrillers today do not. It's interesting. Never mind what people say about it not making sense, because it makes pretty good sense if you pay attention to the movie. I'm not saying that "the ring" doesn't have it's flaws, but if you're looking for the next "exorcist", stay home and wait. But if you're like me, and just looking for a thriller that actually thrills, and isn't carbon copy of modern-day crappy excuses for thrillers, check out "the ring" it'll leave you entertained and talking about it for plenty of time after you leave the theater. Naomi watts, fresh off a great performance in last year's surprisingly intriguing "mulholland drive", has to down-play this character a bit, but she still delivers a strong performance that carries the audience through this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A drab script,but phenom production and refreshing ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a quick warning, possible spoiler here. Just got out of this drenched flic last night, and I loved it. Yes, it had its faults. The scripting was a little ramshackle, but overall a very refreshing and genuinely creepy li'l pic. Production design was appropriately water-logged--everything from Morgan's death to the psychiatric hospital records room felt distinctly wet. Acting was descent at worst, with some genuinely good moments.As far as the overall movie, very stylishly done. Verbinski and the DoP's subliminal-quick scattering of images from the Tape were very well executed, setting the viewer a bit more on edge. Daveigh Chase's performance as Samara was downright chilling. Very nice to see elements for the original "Ringu" in the film as well: spatterings of japanese imagery, and Samara's final emergence to kill Noah was straight out of Nakata's minor masterpiece.As far as the ending, I didn't find it a false end in the least. The "first" ending was pretty much a carbon copy of every tripe-tossed modern ghost story--"the horribly wronged, murderous ghost does all it's horribly wrong murders just to get someone to solve the mystery of its horribly wrong death"....which is, overall, horribly wrong. It then turns that sucker on it's ear with one line from little Aidan: "You helped her?". Just a bit of a jab at all the feel-good happy endings infecting modern horror. It's a bit of a stretch to convince me that an already disturbed child left for dead )for a week before dying) at the bottom of a well by her mother would be satisfied by someone simply finding her body. An experience like that would leave anyone just a little bit damaged.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got home from seeing The Ring. OMG This is one of the most unique and freaky movies I have ever watched, to talk about it in depth would give away the plot so I won't do that but this is one of the most enjoyable movie going experiences I have had in a long time.No big name actors, no over the top gore, no predictable plot that has been done 100x before, I was 100% entertained.

		<shortDescription>My review--10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers contained) It seems to me that most complaints about this movie can be grouped into one of two categories. The first group are from people who have seen the Japanese original and won't give the remake a chance, either because it's a remake or because it's American. The second group of complaints come from audience members who have been spoon fed so many plot lines over the years that they can't figure the vague elements out on their own.I saw this movie two days ago and I honestly don't know when it will stop being so fresh in my mind. Horror movies don't usually bother me at all but this one kept me up the night I saw it. I'll admit that I have NOT seen the original. I think it will be a long time before I could watch either version again.My typical nightmare tends to be a series of random pictures that are intrinsically creepy for no good reason. You can see why the video had me freaked out. My only complaint with that part is that there was very little buildup and suspense with regard to the video. We are shown it (almost immediately) when Rachel watches, then shots of it over and over as Noah watches, the kid watches, the copy is made, etc. It started to feel as familiar as my home movies by the end.Naomi Watts did a great job in the lead. I hadn't seen a performance of hers before and I was impressed. Martin Henderson as the ex-whoever did fine, although he just really had to look cute and help out. Rachel's son was the one character that got on my nerves. The kid playing him wasn't at fault but he telepathically explained many plot points that could have been discovered in a much more interesting way.The actors weren't given an opportunity to get really scared. Most of us would be having a meltdown if given seven days to live. Instead they plod on through the investigation rather detached from it.The corpses in particular were so horrifying that I literally flinched from the screen, especially when the closet door was opened. Then there's the part with the horse.I'm glad that the movie didn't stop with the fake ending. It made you feel like the movie was going to get tedious at first, but the real ending is absolutely worth it. I have read some reviews that would have preferred the stock Hollywood happy ending, but some of us want a different story told once in a while.Some people say that too much is explained to the audience and I tend to agree. If Samara's face had been totally obscured by that stringy black hair at the climax (which happens in Ringu I'm told) it would have been that much more terrifying. Ditto with the explanations of every shot in the video. We didn't need to see a centipede on Rachel to see that they're creepy.It sounds like I have a lot of complaints, and I'm sure that a couple of things could have been resolved differently. I wanted to point those out to show that I see the film's flaws, yet I count it among the scariest I have ever seen. I have much more good than bad things to say about it.The fear seemed to be coming off the screen during the horse on the ferry scene. It was effective in showing how Samara probably got along with the horses on her father's farm.As I mentioned before, the faces of the victims killed by the freakazoid tape look scared, drowned, and decomposed all at the same time. The flashes of these faces on the screen is effective because of their shock, and you think, "did I see that right?" How exactly does Samara kill her victims? By telepathically projecting her disturbing images into their heads at lightning speed and scaring them to death. Although this sounds ridiculous, those of us with a vivid imagination are probably disturbed by the implications of this. Trying to imagine what must be that bad is impossible, but who would want to anyway?To me, the things that aren't explained are the scariest. And what's worse than being scared literally to death?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although, I haven't seen the original movie, I have seen this one. I am obviously not the only person to review it and I'm sure you will take my words with a grain of salt. Regardless, I still feel obligated to say my peace. I will not go into the specific details as to whether you should see it or not. I don't know your tastes. All I can say is I enjoyed it thoroughly. It made the hair stand up on my neck in many instances, and regardless of any plot holes, that's essentially the point of horror movies. How often do horror movies have an air tight script? Does that add to the joy and campiness of scary movies? Perfection is a feat rarely achieved regardless of any genre. I will not reveal anything, just don't attempt to make the movie something it isn't. Just go to get creeped out and realize that senseless scare tactics are often thrown only to assist the plot at moving along. This movie has an intensity and creepiness about it and it's the idea that really matters. I also loved how this movie didn't crap itself out at the end like most new horror movies. Yes, the middle ran drab and gave you a sense of deceiving finality, but it ripped that from our hands and redeemed itself with a genuine classic ending. This movie was consistent straight through. Yes, it had it's problems, but so does every movie and if you pick apart this movie; or any for that reason. I can't imagine what you deem as good. If you like horror movies (this is a statement only for the truest fans) then you should enjoy this movie. Don't expect much and don't tear it apart and you should be pleased to relax and let the atmosphere drag you in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't particularly enjoy wasting my time, especially in a movie theater. That is why I put the two potentially-squandered hours I spent watching this movie to good use. From the cliche beginning to the stupid ending of this film, I found myself thinking of better ways I could have spent my $8 admission money.I found it pretty funny that most of the audience members got up shaking their heads and laughing at the end of this movie. They were probably thinking the same thing as me.(*Potential Spoiler???*)The scene on the ferry was almost laughable. Why, after the horse spooked, did she spend so much time trying to calm the big animal down instead of getting the hell away from it? It would have made the movie better if she had climbed on the horses back. Maybe then the horse could have carried her over the railing as it jumped to its doom.Do I sound bitter to you?How many of you who watched this film laughed out loud when the girl crawled out of the television set near the end? How many of you did not see such a stupid ending coming? Here's a better way the characters could survive when their week was up- stay the hell away from all TV sets! Make a copy, indeed.Another way this film could have been better would be if the whispering voice on the phone had said, "One weak-ass movie". If they had shown that during the TV spots and trailers for this film, I wouldn't feel so cheated now.2.5 out of 10 Only because that kid gave me the willies.</fullReview>

No one really expects there to be anything new under the sun in horror or sci-fi and the intelligent film maker will devise STRONG twists on stuff that was perfected by Pabst/Browning/Whale/ Lewton/Hitchcock/Corman/Bava/Carpenter. Don't be so weak in plot development and don't deceive or insult your more intelligent viewers because you can't decide if the boogie man will get you or a Holmesian conclusion based on logical insights will be reached.

Yes, it had it's problems, but so does every movie and if you pick apart this movie; or any for that reason. I can't imagine what you deem as good. If you like horror movies (this is a statement only for the truest fans) then you should enjoy this movie. Don't expect much and don't tear it apart and you should be pleased to relax and let the atmosphere drag you in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally...a great comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This light-hearted comedy had me laughing the whole time. The plot was marvelous and hit me right to the heart. I am so glad that they finally made a spoof on horror movies. My favorite scene was when they PURPOSEFULLY showed the mic they were recording the voices with...2 TIMES. I loved how they started the movie like scream and how they even had a scene just like signs. I have a question though...if a kid can make pictures with their mind why do they come out w/ black marker on overhead sheets? And if you like this movie I hope that you get "No Mercy, No Remorse" by RBX MWHAHA HAHAHA. X FILES.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't particularly enjoy wasting my time, especially in a movie theater. That is why I put the two potentially-squandered hours I spent watching this movie to good use. From the cliche beginning to the stupid ending of this film, I found myself thinking of better ways I could have spent my $8 admission money.I found it pretty funny that most of the audience members got up shaking their heads and laughing at the end of this movie. They were probably thinking the same thing as me.(*Potential Spoiler???*)The scene on the ferry was almost laughable. Why, after the horse spooked, did she spend so much time trying to calm the big animal down instead of getting the hell away from it? It would have made the movie better if she had climbed on the horses back. Maybe then the horse could have carried her over the railing as it jumped to its doom.Do I sound bitter to you?How many of you who watched this film laughed out loud when the girl crawled out of the television set near the end? How many of you did not see such a stupid ending coming? Here's a better way the characters could survive when their week was up- stay the hell away from all TV sets! Make a copy, indeed.Another way this film could have been better would be if the whispering voice on the phone had said, "One weak-ass movie". If they had shown that during the TV spots and trailers for this film, I wouldn't feel so cheated now.2.5 out of 10 Only because that kid gave me the willies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, forget a detailed review of the plot and all the film's elements and all that crap. None of that is important. What really matters is the fact that bottom line, there is no denying how ridiculously scary this movie was, and I'm not talking about cheap little "jump up in you seat a couple times" scary, I'm talking about "I got out of the movie a half hour ago and I may not get to sleep tonight, my life is in ruin, and I'm seeing rings everywhere I look and what not" scary. I'm not even sure that I would tell people to go see this movie. Do they really want to deal with this kind of horror? While it's true that the movie could have ended earlier and probably retained some more dignity, it doesn't matter. The last 5 minutes of the movie left you with something that was not a happy ending. It left you with an actual fear implanted in your head. As a matter of fact, don't see this movie, seriously. You'll probably be better off mentally.</fullReview>

Please do not listen to those who talk bad about this movie because they obviously do not know their a** from a hole in the ground. This movie was frightening from beginning to end. Yes it leaves you with questions, but it is good thing, trust me. The people who say that "The Ring" has loose ends,is not scary, and it is boring definitely have a screw loose. I highly reccommend this movie to anybody and everybody. I give it a 10 out of 10!P.S. Do not see this one alone and do not go home alone after seeing it.!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a film critic or any type of artistic expert. I am just the average girl, not a big movie buff, untrained in anything cinema. I judge a movie by only one thing: how long I continue thinking about it after I leave the theatre. Whether it made me laugh, cry, scream, or just plain THINK, if I continue to think about it for hours, or in this case days on end, it is a fantastic movie.I thought this movie was nothing short of amazing, the most frightening and psychologically disturbing I have ever seen. I don't believe in hyping up movies, it usually disappoints people. This movie, however, deserves the hype. I was expecting a crappy excuse for a "horror" film. The last one I saw was Thirteen Ghosts. After seeing this movie I gave up on the whole horror genre; I was sure apocalypse was upon us if someone couldn't think of a better friggin' ending to a movie.So, I saw this movie three days ago and I am still thinking of it constantly. I am not the jumpy type, and so-called scary movies do not ever scare me. This movie scared me to the point of being frightened of the letter O. Unless you have a weak heart, see this movie just to experience the freakiness of it.I've heard a few complaints about the movie. The first being holes in the plot. Yes, it will leave you wondering, but afterwards you will think about it a while (perhaps too much) and it will all fall together. If not, read some of the interpretations on the discussion boards here after you watch the movie. There are many interesting ideas.I have also heard complaints about the microphones in the picture. I'm sure this really detracted from the experience of the people who saw this- whatever creepiness in those scenes had to have been ruined. In the theatre I went to, I couldn't see the microphones at all.I think some people seem to be over-analyzing the movie as well. If you go into the movie with the mind set of "that could never happen," well, you're going to think the whole movie is stupid. Before you see it, accept this thought: "A person, during life or after death, can possess supernatural powers." This can make the entire movie more believable and easier to understand. If you keep this in mind, the movie can admittedly seem extremely real. I think this is why it freaked so many people out.Also, the artsy fartsy sections of the movie... again, I am not an art expert, but I can really tell the sound and imagery are well done.Kudos to the makers of "The Ring", I am finally satisfied with a horror film. Thanks for this, but I must say I am too frightened to watch it a second time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review - Warning MAJOR SPOILERS here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin, I want to make it clear that I've never reviewed a movie before, so this is completely outside the realm of what I am used to. I review music. That is what I do. I'm not going to go do my homework on IMDB and every Naomi Watts fan site to reference facts here. Oh, and let it just be known that I could care less about box office figures, (although they kicked ass this weekend) nor do I care about what those who call themselves movie critics say. These things have never, ever dictated my choice in moviegoing. This is merely MY opinion of this movie. Period. I've not seen the original, and I know nothing about this movie other than what I saw on Saturday night, capice?That said, all you purists out there who pride themselves on the fact on how you have "read the book", or those who have seen the Japanese version and hate the US version and those who get their underwear all twisted up about the motives of a director and dialogue and the way certain scenes are shot in such and such film - more power to you, but please, give a sister a break, aight?Again- DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE. There are probably going to be some spoilers that will ruin it for you. Last chance....Cast/Acting: No matter what we would like to believe about ourselves or about what "real" people look like, eye candy is a love/hate thing. Naomi Watts stars in this movie as Seattle newspaper reporter and mother to 6-year old son, Rachel Keller. Watts not only played her part well as did everyone else, but she did so with class and a subtle style that didn't seem overly immersed in the fact that she's gorgeous. Newcomer (I guess?) Martin Hendersen plays Noah, the father of Rachel's son Aidan (acted with well-done intensity by a young David Dorfman) with rugged good looks and gorgeous blue eyes who partners with her in trying to unravel the mystery behind the videotape.Otherworldly gorgeous Rachel Bella (Becca) and willowy Amber Tamblyn (Katie) are the ill-fated teenagers who kick off the first body count scene. Their friends are equally sublime in the looks department, as we later find out when Rachel not-so-casually smokes a cigarette with them outside, while looking for some answers during Katie's wake. This is the one time I was most distracted by the eye candy. One would think all teenagers were supermodels. At least the ones in this flick were. Even Daveigh Chase, who played the evil little girl, Samara, was stunning.Casting was well constructed and the acting jobs, although not Oscar caliber (and what horror flick other than Silence of the Lambs is ever recognized by the Academy anyway, really) were solid.Plot: A videotape containing disturbing "footage" that literally frightens it's viewers to death 7 days after they view it. The sudden and unexplained deaths of several teenagers including her niece and the desperate pleas of her sister who has lost her daughter and is still searching for answers sends a young mother/reporter on a mission to find out the cause.The story itself is a good one for a horror movie. Basic, urban legend-type stuff. But there were a LOT of loose ends that were never tied. It was as if there were things added at an attempt to add some depth to a not-so-deep movie. Horses going mad and becoming suicidal, stuff about the relationship between Rachel and Noah that the viewer is never given, unanswered questions about who actually put the footage on the tape, how it got there, and how it originated, etc. Is the fly real? Is the girl actually inside the videotape? Lots of preposterous fantasy stuff only movies can get away with, of course. But the entire layout is a bit of a mind****, which, in a sense is good. However, there are large holes, which don't usually sit well with me.Location/Sets: Seattle has my heart in so many ways. I really enjoyed the gloom and the rain, which is to a scary movie as flour is to a cake. The sets were done very well. A big spooky barn, lots of water, not an overabundance of long, dark hallways or creaky staircases that usually up the cheese factor. Pretty straightforward, realistic and believable. Although the apartment building Rachel lives in with her son made me feel very claustrophobic and dizzy. Not much else to say here.Fear Factor: On a scale of 1-10, I'd give this movie a solid 8. There were several cheap shots where the scene would be very quiet and then suddenly a loud BANG! or a scene change would startle you, but the most frightening element was the tension and the waiting, I think. Everyone was waiting to see what would happen on the 7th day...Best Scene: Definitely, without a doubt, the best and most terrifying scene is the grand finale. This is the most climactic scene, which takes place in Noah's loft. He's still trying to sort out the details and come to terms with things when his television set mysteriously turns itself on, and that foreboding static fills the screen. On the screen, he sees Samara climbing slowly out of the stone well where he and "Rachel" assumed was her final resting place. Her hair is hanging in wet, swollen tangles over her face, and her shoulders crack and she lurches forward like a bloodthirsty zombie in her dripping, filthy dress. He can't move from his chair or tear his eyes from the television screen as it begins to flood the floor with water. He lunges to get away but stumbles backwards, smashing into some shelves and onto the floor.At some point, Noah scrambles back into the chair, still watching with eyes wide open, his body frozen in fear. Slowly and deliberately, Samara's arm comes through the screen and stretches to the floor as the rest of her hideous limbs come through and take form. The mere sight of her becoming life-size before him and then finally the horrifying vision of her sends him into a full-scale panic attack, literally scaring him to death. This scene was chilling beyond description and it's definitely what you remember most when you leave the theater... as well as when you try to fall asleep that night.Details/Moments Noted: Katie's face in the closet. The horse on the ferry that leapt to it's drowning death - very disturbing. The electrocution scene. The discovery of the Samara's loft in the barn. The endless entrail-like organ coming out of the screaming throat. The videotape sequence itself. And, of course, the scene with Samara emerging from the well - creep city.One part of the movie that did stand out in my mind was a particular scene in which Rachel is standing on her balcony. She somewhat voyeuristically scans the interiors of several apartments and their residents as life goes on inside each living space. She notices how many televisions are in the homes of these people, and how they are being used. One woman sneaks outside to her balcony to smoke while her child sits in front of the television. Someone confined to a wheelchair eats his dinner in front of his television. Another person has a television on his bureau, near his bed. It's as though the message here is that television is the enemy, and not the videotape or the deaths that are resulting from the footage therein. Interesting metaphor, anyway, although I'm not sure who was trying to make the point or why.Recap: Good stuff. Worth the ridiculous price of movies these days, I suppose. Better in the theater than on video for the fun of sharing the screams and chills with others. Although I guess I can almost go with the PG-13 rating, I didn't see one kid under 16 in that theater and I have to agree, I think it's a little too much for kids under 16.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw it tonight. Wasn't as creepy as The Sixth Sense, but of its genre, excellent point-of-view camera work and story-telling puts it in the same league. It has a lot going for it. An inventive "urban legend" kind of tale, a creepy little kid (stolen, I'd say from the aforementioned picture), a well-written mystery/detective story and a frightening denouement. The methodical unraveling of the tape's meaning makes you forget there is a time element in this movie until the end. It's one of the best movies I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**The ring is easily the scariest film ive seen since the original psycho. the mood was perfect. the script and acting great. and the special effects were really to notch. *Small Spoiler* : some people on this sight say they wanted to know where the tape came from. 1st of all these are probably the same people who loved not knowing what was in the briefcase in pulp fiction (i am one of those people). what they fail to realize is if you pay attention they say. the pictures that the girl makes in the asylum are described as pictures from her mind. she didn't draw them in the standard sense. her mind made them. same with the tape. *end spoiler* there were not 2 minutes that i wasnt on the edge of my seat in this one. after seeing this i saw the original japenese version, ringu. another horrifying movie, but not as good as the remake. the video of death in the new version is much, much scarier and the u.s. director does a much better job of keeping you constantly on the edge of your seat. he does a great job of drawing a scary scene out as long as he can, and he has a great sense of when to end a scene. And the ending was perfect.Easily 10/10</fullReview>

The images that you will see will not go away when the lights come up and will haunt you for days to come.The visual effects and sound editing are the best that we have seen in a horror or psychotic thriller in a long time and should garner some award(s).I will own this movie when it comes to DVD, but I highly reccomend you see it in the theatre first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that I wasn't expecting much from this film. I think I was misled by the previews or just knew too little to have much expectations. The movie turns out to be remarkably fresh and clever in it's story telling. The cinematics are done so well and the themes are kept true throughout the film. It's not a masterpiece in the acting department but Naomi Watts is turning out to be one to watch and the acting from David Dorman (the child) left chills running down my spine. Everything from the soundtrack to the sound effects were all top notch. I honestly don't think I've ever seen so many people jump from such simple, yet well-placed, well-timed sound effects. As far as the plot of the movie goes, it's up there with some of the greats in the same genre (Sixth Sense, Dark City and Memento). I actually enjoyed the entire story and believe that the producer of the film did an excellent job bringing it to the big screen. I've been recommending this film to many of my family and friends for it's a fitting late October release. If you enjoy thrillers even a little or are looking for something different from your typical slash-horror films, go see this film as soon as you can.</fullReview>

Is the girl actually inside the videotape? Lots of preposterous fantasy stuff only movies can get away with, of course. But the entire layout is a bit of a mind****, which, in a sense is good. However, there are large holes, which don't usually sit well with me.Location/Sets: Seattle has my heart in so many ways. I really enjoyed the gloom and the rain, which is to a scary movie as flour is to a cake. The sets were done very well. A big spooky barn, lots of water, not an overabundance of long, dark hallways or creaky staircases that usually up the cheese factor. Pretty straightforward, realistic and believable. Although the apartment building Rachel lives in with her son made me feel very claustrophobic and dizzy. Not much else to say here.Fear Factor: On a scale of 1-10, I'd give this movie a solid 8. There were several cheap shots where the scene would be very quiet and then suddenly a loud BANG! or a scene change would startle you, but the most frightening element was the tension and the waiting, I think. Everyone was waiting to see what would happen on the 7th day...Best Scene: Definitely, without a doubt, the best and most terrifying scene is the grand finale. This is the most climactic scene, which takes place in Noah's loft. He's still trying to sort out the details and come to terms with things when his television set mysteriously turns itself on, and that foreboding static fills the screen. On the screen, he sees Samara climbing slowly out of the stone well where he and "Rachel" assumed was her final resting place. Her hair is hanging in wet, swollen tangles over her face, and her shoulders crack and she lurches forward like a bloodthirsty zombie in her dripping, filthy dress. He can't move from his chair or tear his eyes from the television screen as it begins to flood the floor with water. He lunges to get away but stumbles backwards, smashing into some shelves and onto the floor.At some point, Noah scrambles back into the chair, still watching with eyes wide open, his body frozen in fear. Slowly and deliberately, Samara's arm comes through the screen and stretches to the floor as the rest of her hideous limbs come through and take form. The mere sight of her becoming life-size before him and then finally the horrifying vision of her sends him into a full-scale panic attack, literally scaring him to death. This scene was chilling beyond description and it's definitely what you remember most when you leave the theater... as well as when you try to fall asleep that night.Details/Moments Noted: Katie's face in the closet. The horse on the ferry that leapt to it's drowning death - very disturbing. The electrocution scene. The discovery of the Samara's loft in the barn. The endless entrail-like organ coming out of the screaming throat. The videotape sequence itself. And, of course, the scene with Samara emerging from the well - creep city.One part of the movie that did stand out in my mind was a particular scene in which Rachel is standing on her balcony. She somewhat voyeuristically scans the interiors of several apartments and their residents as life goes on inside each living space. She notices how many televisions are in the homes of these people, and how they are being used. One woman sneaks outside to her balcony to smoke while her child sits in front of the television. Someone confined to a wheelchair eats his dinner in front of his television. Another person has a television on his bureau, near his bed. It's as though the message here is that television is the enemy, and not the videotape or the deaths that are resulting from the footage therein. Interesting metaphor, anyway, although I'm not sure who was trying to make the point or why.Recap: Good stuff. Worth the ridiculous price of movies these days, I suppose. Better in the theater than on video for the fun of sharing the screams and chills with others. Although I guess I can almost go with the PG-13 rating, I didn't see one kid under 16 in that theater and I have to agree, I think it's a little too much for kids under 16.</fullReview>

The important thing in a horror movie is not the special effects and monsters that look fake, its the story and the background that surround the characters, if the director creates and mix right the ingredients he or she has a hit, I haven't seen the original I hope to see it later. Please don't bring kids to the theater, and I recommend don't drink any beverage with caffeine that day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***spoilers - don't look if you don't wanna see it***I feel I should write this to help should anyone out there be relying on any previous posts if they didn't get this movie.Let me start by pointing out that The Morgans didn't give birth to Samara. She was adopted and no one knows from where. It's never indicated Samara has "carrie-like" abilities. She's a really creepy girl. She doesn't move things with her mind, she screws with people's heads in a bad, bad way. The closest she gets to carry is creating pictures out of thin air. She's not telekinetic though.Anna is not obsessed with Samara's problems. She is afraid of Samara. The girl is driving her insane, which is why the father puts the girl in the barn, to keep her away. It is here she has horses and TV, two things she clearly comes to hate.Samara's institution scenes indicate no love for anyone, especially when they are replayed at the very end. The tone of her voice is slightly changed, as is the inflection. It was clear to me that she was saying she knows she hurts people and she will not stop. She was a bad little girl.The "I made a copy" bit that kept Rachel alive is a direct reference to the tape. Why? Because it spreads the little girl's evil. Make a copy and show it to someone, and that person will die. It's what the girl wants. Aidan can't be a reincarnation of Samara because her spirit still exists, quite obviously. If he was one, the writers had an odd vision of how reincarnation works.Samara was not the "unproperly put to rest" ghost. That was what the false ending of the movie was trying to make you believe. It was some nice trickery on the part of the filmmaker. However, when Aiden says "why would you help her?" you know that something is amiss. If you hadn't figured it out there, when Samara crawls out of Noah's TV and kills him, that should drive the point home. Rachel didn't save a good spirit and put it to rest, she freed and evil one and let it loose. This movie has a sequel in Japan, and will obviously have one here. Hence the killing and bad news will continue</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the scariest PG-13 movie I've ever seen, and quite disturbing. Beautiful to look at, with a horrifying twist ending that is unusual for Hollywood. My only two complaints ***SPOILERS*** are 1) that the annoying psychic kid didn't mention that he knew what his mom and dad were supposed to do, so of course, they screwed up and (understandably) did the wrong thing, making you think it was a typical "lay your bones to rest" type ghost story, when in fact it was infinitely more sinister; and 2) that the real reason everyone hated and feared the ghost girl was never really explained. Otherwise, this is a perfect movie. Parents should avoid taking young children to see this (2 such families got up and walked out halfway through when I saw it, LOL), because the kids will have nightmares for weeks or months after seeing this film! I'm an adult and a horror movie junkie, but even I got a little nervous around bedtime, because I couldn't get some of those sick images from the movie out of my head and was afraid I'd have a bad dream! THE RING is one of the most successful chiller-thrillers ever committed to celluloid, but don't give Dreamworks all the credit---it was originally a 1998 Japanese movie mega-hit that SKG remade for American audiences. I have not seen the Japanese version, but am going to track it down (especially if I can find a copy with English subtitles). If you want to be scared, go see THE RING!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as the first, but just.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As scary movies go, it's not bad in spite of taking a very creepytheme - death by videotape - and making it PG-13 material. Whichmakes me want to rant on WHY this one made a PG-13 rating inspite of its thematic content and yet a light romantic comedy likeKissing Jessica Stein received an R?. but I'll abstain.Comparatively, this version is more engrossing than the Japaneseoriginal (1997) and although it does flesh the original script out abit, it still fails to live up to its creepy theme - that a supernaturalpresence is killing people by having them watch a videotapedpicture puzzle riddle. The Japanese version depended too heavilyon the metaphysical and internal struggle of its heroine (and herclairvoyant ex-husband) and as a result it doesn't pack much of anemotional punch. The American version brings more of that innerturmoil to the surface and we are able to follow along as she tripsand stumbles and figures her way through this nightmare.The production values are all good, particularly with re: to thevideotape itself and the collective imagery it holds. It's a well-shotmovie, and the DOP deserves kudos for a job well done. The performances are all fine, and the story is full of possibility, butthe delivery is lacking and could have been much better. I blamethe director, Gore Verbinski, who has failed to live up to hispotential before (The Mexican, Mouse Hunt). In what otherprofession can a man make millions by being mediocre? Naomi Watts deserves better material than this, as does theunder-used Jane Alexander, who makes an appearance here asan island doctor who may or may not have a clue to what's goingon. I think, in greater hands, this might have been an excellent filmgoing experience. As it is, I can recommend it on a matinee if youreally want to spend the money, or on rental if you are smarterthan, and have a greater depth of patience than, the averagePG-13 consumer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've Never Been More Scared</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now the fact is, I'm reasonably easy to scare. I come out of scary movies and usually don't sleep well that night. So some would say that would make me a poor judge of the fear factor(not a reference to the mindless show of the same name)of The Ring. However, quite the opposite is true. If I've been scared before, then the odds of something on the same level scaring me are unlikely. Now, I can most easily compare this movie to Red Dragon, while the two are almost nothing alike, they are both meant to elicit a response of fear. Red Dragon frightens on a far more visceral, primal level than does The Ring, which goes for a more psychological fear, but yet also on a very primal level. The images presented in the cassette that kills are very frightening, but we're not sure why. Certainly the strange background noise helps, but it is, in essence, a collection of random images. So why are they so disturbing? Because they have certain meanings that are ingrained in our psyche, all of which have negative connotations. A mirror reflecting something that isn't there, a little girl in darkness, a ladder(walking under one), a woman jumping from a cliff, a millipede and more are all images that are disturbing by their very nature. On with the review! The cinematography was amazing, with camera angles that captured everything that needed to be seen and also clued the more observant in the audience(of which I am certainly not one of!) into what was going on before the movie even said it. The sound was the other best "tool." It was amazing, every single noise meant to elecit a response and every single noise doing so. It contains one of the most terrifying scenes I have ever witnessed, but revealing what would ruin it, but trust me, you'll know when you see it. All in all, a movie that doesn't even strike until you're lying in bed trying to fall asleep and all the images flash in your mind. Very, very well done and scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the scariest movie that I have ever seen in my lifetime. This movie is a must-see for anybody who has ever watched a scary movie. I have seen hundreds of horror movies (literally) and this just might be the scariest one yet. I have rated this movie a ten because it is very scary and has a great plot. Also its not all gore and you have to think about it and there are many interpretations on what different things in the movie might mean. It had the perfect mix of scary moments and plot twists. Everything tied together so perfectly that whoever wrote the script is deserves much praise and awards. If you like scary movies and great plot twists watch The Ring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie has been over-hyped. I guess to a generation used to slasher teenie movies, this appears to be a deep, dark, forbidding, psychological thriller. Personally, I found it very contrived, and while some of the images were disturbing, some of them were so badly done as to be near comical. I don't think I'll have any problem sleeping tonight, unlike most of the reviewers here, for whatever reason they have for not sleeping.I suggest waiting for the DVD and saving your 8 bucks, unless you just have to jump on the "latest movie" bandwagon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!!!!!I just got done seeing the movie, so I'm still a little on edge, so please forgive any mistakes I might make. I think this is an incredible movie, not only of the crazy freakyness of it, but for the amazing message right there inside it. The reporter saves herself (and her son) by perpetuating the circle. She lives by making someone else die, which in end of the movie, is all of us. The boy's father's quote, something like, you media, you take one person's tragedy and force us all to live it; Think about it. Look at all the use of TVs in the movie. Now turn on your TV to one of the 24 hour newsstations. You got a sniper in DC who's killing people for attention, the media covers it, he gets more attention, keeps on killing, perpetuating the circle. The girl is evil and wants her message spread. The reporter does this for her. For me at least, this movie really makes you stop and think about some serious issues regaurding the media and where we are going. Well, we only got 7 days, but I'm sure the 24 hour news cycle will give us 168 straight hours of coverage of our demise. Gore Verbinski better win some major awards, this guy is for real.

		<fullReview>Well, as for any scary movie this one had a lot of flaws in the story. Anything that was added to the original (Japanese version) movie was completely unrelated to the subject. And WHAT THE HELL is up with those sudden noises directors put after a silent seen? I use the number of these scenes to measure how un-talented the director is. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie scared the hell out of me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been scared by horror movies. I thought the Shining, though well done, was boring. Suspenseful, yes, but never scary. So I'm not the biggest fan of horror. After having watched the Ring, I must say it's the greatest horror film I've ever seen (guess I should go watch more =) ). I was genuinely frightened throughout the entire length of the film. I will go see this film again at least twice, and I suggest you do, too. The ending is also incredible - for a second I thought this movie ripped off a film done a few years ago (not the Sixth Sense), but then it twisted its way into a thrilling conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very scary but unresolved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read that this movie combines elements of horror and mystery, and I couldn't agree more. But while films like "Dead Ringers" and "Seven" very capably bridge the gap between mystery and horror, this movie doesn't entirely do so.This is not to say it wasn't captivating, scary, interesting or well- filmed. It was most definitely all these. But it presented many complications- physical, psychological and (particularly) supernatural, ( to its credit, a massive number of complications) and then all but seemed to forget about them in the end. Then, it appeared to use the explanation that it was a horror flick to back out of any need to provide true explanations of the many issues it originally raised(it does provide only one, and that one is inadequate to resolve the movie).Nonetheless, it was very enjoyable to watch. It was suspenseful, downright scary, and extremely disturbing. But do not expect that well, the expectations the movie sets up in the first third of the movie will actually be resolved, as they won't.Finally, this movie is rated PG-13, which I found awfully disturbing. I wouldn't let your nine year old go by him or herself; place the emphasis on the parental guidance part of this rating.**.5 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've Never Been More Scared</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now the fact is, I'm reasonably easy to scare. I come out of scary movies and usually don't sleep well that night. So some would say that would make me a poor judge of the fear factor(not a reference to the mindless show of the same name)of The Ring. However, quite the opposite is true. If I've been scared before, then the odds of something on the same level scaring me are unlikely. Now, I can most easily compare this movie to Red Dragon, while the two are almost nothing alike, they are both meant to elicit a response of fear. Red Dragon frightens on a far more visceral, primal level than does The Ring, which goes for a more psychological fear, but yet also on a very primal level. The images presented in the cassette that kills are very frightening, but we're not sure why. Certainly the strange background noise helps, but it is, in essence, a collection of random images. So why are they so disturbing? Because they have certain meanings that are ingrained in our psyche, all of which have negative connotations. A mirror reflecting something that isn't there, a little girl in darkness, a ladder(walking under one), a woman jumping from a cliff, a millipede and more are all images that are disturbing by their very nature. On with the review! The cinematography was amazing, with camera angles that captured everything that needed to be seen and also clued the more observant in the audience(of which I am certainly not one of!) into what was going on before the movie even said it. The sound was the other best "tool." It was amazing, every single noise meant to elecit a response and every single noise doing so. It contains one of the most terrifying scenes I have ever witnessed, but revealing what would ruin it, but trust me, you'll know when you see it. All in all, a movie that doesn't even strike until you're lying in bed trying to fall asleep and all the images flash in your mind. Very, very well done and scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the scariest movie that I have ever seen in my lifetime. This movie is a must-see for anybody who has ever watched a scary movie. I have seen hundreds of horror movies (literally) and this just might be the scariest one yet. I have rated this movie a ten because it is very scary and has a great plot. Also its not all gore and you have to think about it and there are many interpretations on what different things in the movie might mean. It had the perfect mix of scary moments and plot twists. Everything tied together so perfectly that whoever wrote the script is deserves much praise and awards. If you like scary movies and great plot twists watch The Ring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best horror movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a major film fan and amateur critic, I had become extremely cynical about a movie's ability to chill me - until I saw "The Ring" this weekend. I have not seen the Japanese original or sequels, but the American version ranks as the best horror movie ever for me. Lacking the cheese and stupidity of gore-filled slasher flicks, but packing the serious punch of terror that even good suspense/thrillers miss, "The Ring" breaks new ground in western cinema. While a few of the plot details may be puzzling, watching this film is such a powerful visceral experience that you can't and won't be bothered by them. I found "The Ring" to be completely engrossing and ultra-creepy, and I left the theater feeling totally impressed and a little out of breath. Not since I watched "The Exorcist" on TV at a far too young age has a movie so effectively gotten under my skin. Hats off to Gore Verbinski for a rare achievement. A must-see for all fans of the genre and anyone else who can handle it.</fullReview>

The direction is great, (it mirrors Kubrick's direction of The Shining), the acting is awesome, and is wonderfully crafted into a climax that is one of the most memorable moments on film. I haven't seen the original, however I do feel that all the people complaining, and criticizing it because of the fact that it is a remake should grow up, and realize that new movies can be commended. The Ring shows a type of horror few movies can pull off... Psychological terror. This movie should make tons at the box office, because of word of mouth alone, despite all the mediocre reviews its getting from the critics... only because its a remake. I wish people could realize the brilliance of this movie. I also wish people who feel important criticizing a movie could grow up and admit they were scared.

		<shortDescription>As far as modern horror thrillers go, this one is pretty damn good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a schlocky Hollywoodized piece of mass marketed horror, "The Ring" is shockingly competent, effective, and artistic. The director, Gore Verbinski (of "Mouse Hunt" fame) is by all means a hack, but a pretty astute and artistic hack who lays on plenty of stunning and haunting imagery that makes the film seem more important and artistic than it really is. The star, Naomi Watts, anchors the film with a performance that gets better as the film moves along (in fact, the whole film seems to get better as it moves along and almost entirely hinges on her performance) and shows that her award-winning turn in "Mulholland Drive" was no fluke. If the film is a hit, this should catapult her into the A-list of fine actresses.The first fifteen minutes of the film play like a "Scream" knock-off, but don't let that discourage you. That is merely a savvy ploy (great marketing but bad film-making) to lure in the teen-age crowd that grew up with Wes Craven's craptacular "Scream" films as their main reference for great horror. Judging by the shrieks I heard from the teeny-boppers in the audience, this film should get a lot of repeat business from them and I suspect could become this generation's "Poltergeist." Rest assured, that mature audience who grew up with "The Exorcist," "Rosemary's Baby," and "The Changeling," will be rewarded in the end with a highly competent horror/mystery film that is much closer in relation to those great 1970's horror films than anything Wes Craven ever made us suffer through. I also appreciate how in the end, the movie could've easily turned into a melodramatic knock-off of the "Sixth-Sense," but proudly stuck to it's genre guns and creeped us out with one last blast.Granted, many of the artistic shots are taken straight from "The Shining" (with rain replacing the snow), and there are many other "homages" to be found...everything from "Psycho" to "The Blair Witch Project." This could make the film fun for some film buffs (I especially like the cursed videotape that played like a German expressionist film) while infuriating others. Take this review then with a grain of salt, for I have not seen the Japanese original, and I am also one who thought Neil Jordan's poorly received "In Dreams" was a great horror thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After leaving "The Ring," I couldn't help but feel completely disappointed. This film looked incredibly promising in its television commercials, but really amounted to nothing by the end.This movie attempts to be an artsy, elegant, and stylish thriller, but really turns out to be all smoke and mirrors. The events are outrageously unrealistic and I guarantee that you will leave with a lot of questions unanswered.Two aspects of this film were impressive, however. Naomi Watts sizzles and gives a performance as equally impressive as her previous effort in "Mulholland Drive." The cinematography is also fairly impressive.In "The Ring," the plot seems to move almost mechanically and doesn't have any conflict. There is really no climax, but instead, a number of overly-built up cheap thrills. If you see "The Ring," you probably will die, of either boredom, or most likely disappointment.</fullReview>

The star, Naomi Watts, anchors the film with a performance that gets better as the film moves along (in fact, the whole film seems to get better as it moves along and almost entirely hinges on her performance) and shows that her award-winning turn in "Mulholland Drive" was no fluke. If the film is a hit, this should catapult her into the A-list of fine actresses.The first fifteen minutes of the film play like a "Scream" knock-off, but don't let that discourage you. That is merely a savvy ploy (great marketing but bad film-making) to lure in the teen-age crowd that grew up with Wes Craven's craptacular "Scream" films as their main reference for great horror. Judging by the shrieks I heard from the teeny-boppers in the audience, this film should get a lot of repeat business from them and I suspect could become this generation's "Poltergeist." Rest assured, that mature audience who grew up with "The Exorcist," "Rosemary's Baby," and "The Changeling," will be rewarded in the end with a highly competent horror/mystery film that is much closer in relation to those great 1970's horror films than anything Wes Craven ever made us suffer through. I also appreciate how in the end, the movie could've easily turned into a melodramatic knock-off of the "Sixth-Sense," but proudly stuck to it's genre guns and creeped us out with one last blast.Granted, many of the artistic shots are taken straight from "The Shining" (with rain replacing the snow), and there are many other "homages" to be found...everything from "Psycho" to "The Blair Witch Project." This could make the film fun for some film buffs (I especially like the cursed videotape that played like a German expressionist film) while infuriating others. Take this review then with a grain of salt, for I have not seen the Japanese original, and I am also one who thought Neil Jordan's poorly received "In Dreams" was a great horror thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Americanized remake of the Japanese horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the original Japanese "Ring" (aka "Ringu," as per the Japanese phonetic) two years ago. It was a very freaky film, to say the least. So when I learned that a remake of the film was being released here in the States, I had to see it. I was curious to know if the American filmmakers were going to improve upon the original, or totally screw it up by "Americanizing" it.Well, I'm glad to say that they mostly succeeded. After the opening sequence which was a virtual carbon copy of the Japanese original, the movie improved upon the original in many ways. There were some plot changes, but most had to do with Americanizing the characters, their relations, and their background. The writers did a great job of only Americanizing the setting while keeping the core plot elements and themes intact. (Personally, I really enjoyed the Seattle apartment complex which Naomi Watt's character lives in because the buildings looked decidedly more Japanese than American. :D ) Furthermore, there were some additional scenes and freaky stuff that I don't remember seeing in the Japanese original. Those new stuff and the Hollywood production value did a good job of improving the movie. The acting was pretty good too. Definitely more compelling than the Japanese version, IMHO.Unfortunately, I was let down by the climactic ending of the movie. Naturally, I will not spoil the movie for you by going into details. But let me just say that I found the Japanese ending to be ten times more freaky (and memorable!) than the American one. In terms of the plot, the endings are practically the same, but how the scene was executed was different. I feel that the Japanese ending was more tightly directed and more freaky as a result, compared to the slightly self-indulgent "ooh, isn't this scary" American rendition of the same scene.But apparently, I felt that way only because I had watched the original. There were plenty of girls screaming and guys yelling "Holy $#!+" in the theater, and my cousin (who had not watched the Japanese original) was very freaked out too. I was definitely among the minority.All in all, I think "The Ring" is a great remake of the Japanese original. Even though I personally feel that they somewhat botched the ending (probably only because I'm comparing it to the Japanese original, which most people probably haven't even heard of anyways), the American version successfully brings the feel of the Japanese occult and horror to the American moviegoers. It definitely ain't your usual hack-and-slash cheese-and-sleaze gore-horror flick. It's a great, great movie for the Halloween season, and I expect it to enjoy a long, happy life at the box office.Oh, as a side note, while watching David Letterman the other night, I learned that Naomi Watts (the leading actress) went to the same high school with Nicole Kidman in Australia. Maybe that's why Naomi has same facial expression things going on as Nicole. I thought it was very interesting. I wonder if I'm the only one who saw that. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Focus on the minor details to appreciate a general perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think before judging it, one should focus on the minor details to appreciate a general perfection: -----LOTS OF SPOILERS: READ THEM AFTER YOU WATCH THE MOVIE----- If you get these spoilers while watching, it is indeed a great movie: 1) After watching the video tape, all the victims turn into Samarra Morgan. In that sense, they live the very last week of Samarra she lived in the well. The coolest part is that the victims' images in cameras and pictures appear blurry and shaky because they are in water in the well, and that is how someone looks like when in water. And that is how Samarra looked like in the water before she died. Another fact that they turn into Samarra is that all the victims draw randomly with pencils on faces of themselves of other victims (Remember the journal of the first victims, all the faces were drawn on). This is in fact Samarra with her hair covering up her face. They become Samarra with the fact that Samarra's hair covers their faces in these pencil-drawings.Therefore, they have only 1 week to get out of the well and to tell what happened (that Samarra's mom killed her as she did not have any other chance) to other people if they want to survive (As in one point of the movie, Rachel clearly states that one can only survive a week in a well, and that is the time Samarra survived before dying in the well)As they become Samarra, the last thing they see would be the ring before they die after 1 week, as in the case of Samarra. And all the victims saw the ring just before they die. Another cool trick: Look at the faces of both the victims after they die (The first girl and Rachel's ex-husband at the end): They are drowned in the well, and that is why their hearts stop to beat. Their faces are blue as in the case of someone drowned in the water. And that is exactly what happened to Samarra. Remember before they die, water starts to appear in the rooms. 2) What we see in the video is everything what happened after Samarra died. Basically after she died in a week, her ghost comes out of the well and goes back to the island (and we see that in the video that the picture is first approaching the lighthouse from a distance that she is coming back). Then she brought pest to all the horses of his dad and here mom started to see her images and she commits suicide by jumping from the cliffs. The mirror image of her mom in the video is in fact looking into the camera at one point in horror, as in fact the mom sees (or notices) Samarra's ghost at that point around her. Her presence back at the island farm can also be seen in the tree carving in her barn-room. Again at one point in the movie, it was stated that in perpendicular shots towards the mirror, the camera does not appear. Basically, all these shots are what Samarra's ghost sees after she dies back in the farm. 3) The reason why she cannot sleep (the little boy repeats it continously) has also that explanation: Because she simply is in the well with water and if she sleeps, she will die. 4) Most importantly, maybe, whether Rachel and her husband uncover the truth about Samarra changed anything. My interpretation is it did not: That is exactly how the first girl died (water on the floor before she died) and that is how the ex-husband dies at the end. In both cases, they drown and in both cases Samarra walks out of the image (but the first one when the girl dies we do not see). Actually, that is also how the first other 3 victims died but when they tried to escape from that image they committed suicide.The fact is that Samarra walking out of the well happened anyway because her ghost traveled back to the island. Even though, Rachel and the ex-husband had not uncovered the truth, the ex-husband would have died the exactly the same way as it happened. ---As a non-American, I think that this movie was a great movie because of these reasons. I am not sure what you guys look in a great movie but I think if you find out the small great details after watching, the movie becomes perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that this film utterly frightened me. I saw it with a friend and she had to stay over at my house because we were both so afraid to be alone. The thing that made this movie the scariest was the twists. Not your average "Sixth Sense" kinda twists, buttwists you would never have imagined. When you think you've finally figured it out, they go and reveal something that makes you go "okay...maybe not..." The finally twist is one to make you gasp out loud. And the worst part of the movie (which I won't ruin) is a scene that will haunt you for days. This movie, although is may start out a bit slow and familiar, is peppered with scares and thrills that feel fresh and new. i would reccomend this movie if you aren't easily scared because trust me it will scare you. And the wicked twist of an ending is enough to make up for the fact that you had to pay 8 bucks to get in.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the current point in time of todays society and movies, one might say the horror genre has taken a turn for the worse and is a dieing breed. I would agree with you up until tonight when I went to see "The Ring" with my friends; one word, wow! This movie was amazing from start to finish. I don't remember the last time I left a movie complex so pleased. The only complaint I have heard about this movie, is the fact that is a remake. To that, I say who gives a damn. This movie is saving the horror genre and if more directors and people in Hollywood followed this film as a model, we would have much more to look forward too. This was a movie that tied up all ends of the story perfectly without leaving you wondering how is that possible and what happened to that person, etc. The ending, is just so amazing and well done, you really need to see it instead of me trying to explain it here (one of the scariest parts of the movie too). With all those dumb cheap teen horror flicks out there, its good to see there are some people who can still make great movies that will make you THINK and who don't have to lower themselves to cheap thrills with lots of blood or killings. If you want to see an amazing (rare) scary movie with a great twisted ending and story, "The Ring" is for you. I promise you will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't read about this film anymore-if you have not seen this movie yet-get out some money, get your car keys, and get down to the theatre....and make sure you visit the restroom BEFORE you see this movie. It seems to me that scary movies just don't exist anymore-people make good attempts, but nothing really plays with our minds anymore. This movie actually had me scared both physically and mentally. It was like i could not move or anything. I just got back from the theatre and i have to say that i am still scared-ya i don't think I'm going to fall asleep anytime soon. I would love to make all kinds of comments, but the best thing for you to do is watch it yourself and be your own judge. I don't think I have ever been affected by a movie like this-i mean there are part of the movie that are still running through my mind and I am really tense right now. I know some of you will read this and say, "that movie wasn't scary," but am spooked and my two friends both agreed that is was scary throughout. I give it 10 out of 10-so go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the creepiest movies I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting for this movie ever since I heard about the original Japanese version back in 1998. I heard that it broke box office records in Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore and also won awards at film festivals in the US. When I heard that, I automatically knew that it would be great and one of the creepiest movies I had ever seen. When I finally got to see the US release, I was soooo shocked at just how much I loved this movie. I really didn't think that I would get that creeped out, but the whole time I was shivering and so tense that I thought I was just gonna freak out in the theater. When I left the theater, my heart was pounding and I couldn't stop thinking about it for days!! This movie is a definite for all movie fans!!! If you haven't seen this movie, you better go out and see it right away. I give it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before you die, please see THE RING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If nothing else, THE RING is a firm indication that Naomi Watt's mesmerizing performance in last year's MULHOLLAND DRIVE was no fluke. Even her most stringent critics cannot deny the brazen sexuality she radiated in last year's David Lynch freakfest, especially in the audition scene. And let's not forget those two memorable lesbian sex scenes, which Lynch was wise enough to make sensual instead of having his two actresses perform like endurance champions. Anyway, back to THE RING. Like last year's THE OTHERS, the film's emphasis is on suspense and creepy thrills rather than blood and gore. Some of the images are quite chilling and effective and remain with you long after the film has ended. The sound effects were expert as well, some of the best I've ever heard in a horror film. They establish the tone of the film and really do enhance the experience. My only quibble is that by the end, the mystery of the ring has not been cleared up in its entirety, and one cannot help but wonder if the filmmakers lacked the conviction to resolve the film in a satisfying manner. Anyway, for those who lack the attention span to try and unearth the mystery, there's always white-hot Aussie Naomi Watts in a wet T-shirt. Grade: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best...thriller...in years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll cut right to the chase: The Ring is the most spine-tingling, stylish, suspenseful and satisfying horror film of AT LEAST the past decade. Or perhaps, at least out of the so-called "thrillers" I've seen in the past 10 years. Superbly filmed and paced, the movie clutches you from the opening scene and doesn't let go until the credits roll.Pros: - The Fincher-esque noirish cinematography is beautiful to behold, while creating an enveloping sense of dread and paranoia...never has the Pacific Northwest been so terrifying. - Naomi Watts's screen presence keeps your eyes glued to the screen even when Verbinski backs off on the scares (which isn't often). Plus, she is in her undies at one point. Yummy. - Like any psychological thriller worth its salt, The Ring never resorts to gore or cheap scares, although the few instances of FX use are extremely tasteful and will chill you to the bone (There is no asinine CGI use here that would spoil the film, as it did in the recent "Signs"). Everyday objects such as ladders, chairs and especially televisions are imbued with ominous weight. The cursed video itself looks like a student film collaboration between Trent Reznor and Salvador Dali, and is creepier in and of itself than most of the "thrillers" that have come out recently (*cough*feardotcom*cough*halloweenresurrection*cough*). - A scene involving a mad horse on a ferry is one of the most intense and riveting pieces of cinema I've seen in my life. It's worth the price of admission alone. The tension in the film is almost unbearable at times, which is fantastic...and there's always a payoff.- BRIAN COX! BRIAN COX! BRIAN COX! - Didn't you always think wells were pretty creepy? Yeah, so did I. After seeing this, you won't want to travel within 10 miles of one.Cons: - A couple of the twists are pretty predictable. - The screenplay insists on overexplaining certain aspects...perhaps they would have been more effective if left more ambiguous? - Certain aspects of the ending could've been presented a little more clearly...as opposed to other things which could've been better if more vague, I thought the ending could've come together a little better. Don't worry though, it makes perfect sense after thinking about it for a few minutes.Overall: As you can see, my quibbles with the film are very minor. As a whole, The Ring is a stunning visceral thriller, overflowing with the kind of nightmarish psychological content that will stay with you for weeks after seeing it. Anyone looking for the kind of unsettling "smart-horror" most recently espoused in films like "The Sixth Sense", "Session 9", and "The Others" will be in for a delightfully macabre treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and I've seen my share. It wasn't even the scares themselves--it was the lead-up to those scares, the sheer dread the movie made you feel, that made the payoffs so awful. I've read a lot of people complaining about plot holes, or things "not being explained," but I felt like the movie operated on its own sort of nightmare logic. That's why the supernatural things that happened were scary, and that's why the characters are in such a panic--and at such a loss--to explain or solve them. ***1/2 out of ****, and I'm definitely going back to see it again.</fullReview>

With all those dumb cheap teen horror flicks out there, its good to see there are some people who can still make great movies that will make you THINK and who don't have to lower themselves to cheap thrills with lots of blood or killings. If you want to see an amazing (rare) scary movie with a great twisted ending and story, "The Ring" is for you. I promise you will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>get to the movie theatre now!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't read about this film anymore-if you have not seen this movie yet-get out some money, get your car keys, and get down to the theatre....and make sure you visit the restroom BEFORE you see this movie. It seems to me that scary movies just don't exist anymore-people make good attempts, but nothing really plays with our minds anymore. This movie actually had me scared both physically and mentally. It was like i could not move or anything. I just got back from the theatre and i have to say that i am still scared-ya i don't think I'm going to fall asleep anytime soon. I would love to make all kinds of comments, but the best thing for you to do is watch it yourself and be your own judge. I don't think I have ever been affected by a movie like this-i mean there are part of the movie that are still running through my mind and I am really tense right now. I know some of you will read this and say, "that movie wasn't scary," but am spooked and my two friends both agreed that is was scary throughout. I give it 10 out of 10-so go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the creepiest movies I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting for this movie ever since I heard about the original Japanese version back in 1998. I heard that it broke box office records in Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore and also won awards at film festivals in the US. When I heard that, I automatically knew that it would be great and one of the creepiest movies I had ever seen. When I finally got to see the US release, I was soooo shocked at just how much I loved this movie. I really didn't think that I would get that creeped out, but the whole time I was shivering and so tense that I thought I was just gonna freak out in the theater. When I left the theater, my heart was pounding and I couldn't stop thinking about it for days!! This movie is a definite for all movie fans!!! If you haven't seen this movie, you better go out and see it right away. I give it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before you die, please see THE RING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If nothing else, THE RING is a firm indication that Naomi Watt's mesmerizing performance in last year's MULHOLLAND DRIVE was no fluke. Even her most stringent critics cannot deny the brazen sexuality she radiated in last year's David Lynch freakfest, especially in the audition scene. And let's not forget those two memorable lesbian sex scenes, which Lynch was wise enough to make sensual instead of having his two actresses perform like endurance champions. Anyway, back to THE RING. Like last year's THE OTHERS, the film's emphasis is on suspense and creepy thrills rather than blood and gore. Some of the images are quite chilling and effective and remain with you long after the film has ended. The sound effects were expert as well, some of the best I've ever heard in a horror film. They establish the tone of the film and really do enhance the experience. My only quibble is that by the end, the mystery of the ring has not been cleared up in its entirety, and one cannot help but wonder if the filmmakers lacked the conviction to resolve the film in a satisfying manner. Anyway, for those who lack the attention span to try and unearth the mystery, there's always white-hot Aussie Naomi Watts in a wet T-shirt. Grade: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm Fairly disgusted by the rampant comparisons to david lynch twin peaks or blair witch.... First off before u go callin this movie a knockoff of cult classics , you must first come to understand , THIS IS A CULT CLASSIC. 'Ringu' was one if not the most crafty movie in its genre. Not for its camera work ( tho im a big fan of the over use of the color grey in this movie ) but for its script, both original and spooky in our tv generation the boogieman if u will for the x geners (and about as far off as u can imagine from twin peaks where if you had actualy saw the show or have ever seen any other david lynch movie uses his script to let out angers he has deep down inside him, thus making a tale about a videotape that has a curse from a witch i hardly see relating to bob and the gang from twin peaks .. good try thoo.) If anything this is a knockoff of another genre classic 'VideoDrome' by david chronenberg. In Ring you are taken on the ride from the first frame and you dont feel safe untill you hear everyone let out the big sigh when the credits role. It is a mistake to compare ring to the other crafty thriller 'signs' . 'Signs' was a reawakening of the use of imagination which we lack so much in movies theese days with the over use of special effects. Ring follows in this pattern , but not in the fashion where u realy dont get a good look at the shadow till the end, in ring you have a tape the same everytime u watch it, and thats the point. Ring is an old fashioned movie where u have the same situation thru the whole movie but the more information you get the more creepy it gets. Rebirth to the cool crafty horror movies of old??? I think not, but at least whe have mnight to hold us over. Now if you wana see more than just a movie to zone out to for 2 hours... punch drunk love is for you .. how can he use his camera like that!?!</fullReview>

This movie is not one of your blood and gore movie, it is very refreshing to have Hollywood to make a horror movie that doesn't have sex or violence in mind. This movie is a thinking man's of a horror movie which requires one to put some efforts into figuring out what the movie is about and not have to spell it out for you. The Ring is not one of the best horror movie out there, but it is not one of the worst either. Different people, different taste I must say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a tremendous movie, a compelling, thrilling, chilling piece of work. I'd watched the Japanese original (well, not exactly the "original" but the 1998 version of a film now seeing its fourth remake) twice this past week and what makes Ringu (and now, absolutely, The Ring in its US manifestation) is the way in which it renders ordinary objects in mundane life- especially the telephone and the television of course- malevolent and, frankly, terrifying. I myself have always found a television in an empty room -- a television turned off especially -- to be frightening, something with a potential life of its own, and The Ring speaks to that primordial fear and exploits it. If you have no imagination and you need your horror more literal, then avoid The Ring. I am crazy about this film and actually prefer it to the Japanese version.</fullReview>

The Ring, a remake of a popular Japanese horror film, is about a mother/reporter who looks into the mysterious death of her young cousin and four of her friends. Their deaths are rumored to be because they watched a video tape, after which they had seven days to live. Following their tracks, Rachel (played by Naomi Watts), comes upon the tape, and after watching it, begins to believe in its myth. Now she has seven days to solve the mystery behind the tape, before it claims her life.There's more to it than this, of course. Rachel has a son who seems to have some semi-telepathic abilities. She also gets help from Noah, a photographer, and father of her child. Other than that, I don't want to give away any of the movie's secrets.The Ring is quite good at making you jump.

The days seem to fly by so fast, you're really counting the time left when suddenly the next freaky thing occurs and makes you shift in your seat. At several points, I covered my eyes because, I knew I was going to jump, and I really didn't need more nightmares tonight. I haven't covered my eyes for a movie in a long time.So, is it as good as the original? I think so. I love the original, but at the same time, there's just something cleaner about this version. Things not explained in the original are clarified here. The ending is not as creepy, but it is creepy in its own different sense. Go see it if you liked the original.

I loved the feeling of this movie as it plays with your mind as the cleverly conceived plot unfolds. The film isn't afraid to slowly release detail after detail very slowly and methodically. A lot of films these days tend to bash us over the head with a shock-ending or gross-fest but this film is too clever for either movie invention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally have never seen the original of this movie, nor after seeing this movie do I plan to. Why? because I think i'm already emotionally scarred for eternity.The plot summary of there being a video tape where if you watch it, in seven days you will die simply doesn't scratch the surface of this movie. From 5 minutes into the movie to the time you see the ring right before the credits you will be taken to a world that creates itself right before your eyes.Was it scary? Sure, but it was something more than that...What? I have no idea, but what I can tell you is I had to actually remember to close my wide-open jaw once the credits started rolling.Realistic movie? No way, but lets face it, what good horror flick is. People who write a bad review of any kind(which you'll notice by the VERY high rating not many people have) have absolutely no imagination or fun in their life and should just call it quits now..go crawl in hole and wither away...Let me put it this way. Our theater, which is one of the newer "super deluxe cinemas" was pretty full, and after the movie was over from getting up out of our seat ALL THE WAY to our cars not one person spoke a word...noone. I didn't hear a peep from a single person from that theater....I think they were all in the state I was in...absolute awe.All I can say if you go see this film(which if you do not go see it you are nuts!) is good luck...Rating: 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not silly. -Horrifying and psychological.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to disagree strongly with the previous critique. The film, The Ring, was definitely not silly and was actually the most adult horror film I have seen in years. Forget the teen slasher films that keep pouring out of the studios, like this year's Fear.com. Check this one out. If it doesn't become as popular as Blair Witch Project, than there is something wrong with the audiences (although to compare this one to Blair Witch is blasphemous, given how bad the Blair Witch Project was). The film does, however, copy a great deal from the great 1980s horror film, The Changeling, starring George C. Scott. In fact, I am greatly surprised that it hasn't been labeled a remake!! I can't believe the film, or the original book, ripped off the Changeling in such a blatant way! However, this aside, the film is not just horrifying, it's psychologically scarring. It has learned a lot from The Shining, another film which has had a great influence on this one. Either way, after you watch "The Changeling," check this film out for a seriously damaging thrill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting concept, ultimately flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a very intriguing concept behind it, but it's ultimately flawed pretty badly. The main problem is that most of the characters and situations are forced to the point where they simply can't seem realistic or natural at all.For one, take the kid in this movie. Not only is his character completely unbelievable in the way he acts and talks just like an adult and expresses zero emotion, but he really wasn't even a neccessary part of the movie. He's not the exception either: Hardly anybody in this movie is really a believable character. First there's the mother who seems rather callous towards her son and is always never-too-flustered that she is going to die in a matter of days after watching the videotape. Then there's Richard who seems to react to strangers in a completely random and unexplainable fashion. And then there's Anna and Samara who seem like they're pulled straight out of a German fairy tale or something. In fact...the only character that seems somewhat realistic is Noah.The ending of the movie leaves a lot to be desired too. Yes there's a plot twist, but it comes off as more of a cop-out than any attempt to seriously explain anything or bring closure. It creates more plot holes than it fixes actually.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Spoilers Ahoy!***Fill in the blanks: Our film begins when _________ mysteriously dies as a result of having accidentally stumbled onto a _________ with strange supernatural powers. It turns out that when the characters see the ________, a female voice then tells them that they have ______ days to live, after which a creepy little girl shows up to usher in their untimely deaths. The only real way to solve the mystery is to have the main character subject him/herself to the ________, thus putting them in harm's way and the ____ day countdown begins. At the very last minute, our hero discovers that the cause of all the commotion is because the creepy girl was murdered by ________ and just wants her soul set free.Is this the plot line for 'Feardotcom' or for 'The Ring?' Unfortunately, it's both. 'The Ring' is by far the better of the two films, with superior acting, pacing, effects, and script. It also tacks on a pretty interesting twist to the "little girl done wrong" story, which I presume is what will ultimately set this film apart from its cinematic doppelganger. However the backbone of 'The Ring' is so strikingly similar to 'Feardotcom', that I ultimately felt like I had already seen this flick before, and it sucked. Very, very disappointing.I also felt that the film-makers chose their path too early on. Four teenagers die in the opening sequence (almost entirely off-screen) as a result of having seen "the tape" (as it comes to be known). After some sleuthing, our main character Naomi Watts discovers the tape, watches it, and begins the countdown to her demise lest she solve the mystery. At this point, we can assume that either she will succeed and live (very probable), or will fail and die, leaving the peripheral characters to pick up the slack (not very probable-this IS American cinema after all). And that's just it. We know that if anyone is going to die on screen, it has to be Naomi Watts first, and I just didn't believe that was going to happen. Now, there is the now-obligatory twist at the end, so the audience doesn't go home completely unsatisfied, but the explanation is sketchy and it's too little, way too late. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not average slasher-teen-horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ring is a rather morbid movie with a simple yet original concept: An unmarked video tape that kills whoever watches it.Naomi Watts plays a reporter who(urged by her sister) investigates the sudden death of her niece. After snooping around a little, the clues lead her to a sinister tape viewed by the teens in a remote cabin. After watching the tape, she receives a warning that she has only "7 days" to live. As the countdown begins, the cynical reporter begins to believe in the curse of the tape and tries her best to break the curse.Though I've not seen the original Japanese version, I think this remake has the potential to draw in a lot of fans in the U.S. The story keeps the tension level up well enough as it takes you on a journey to discover the origin and meaning of the tape. However, the most important aspect of the story is that you never expect what will happen next and it leaves lot to your imagination. It isn't gory nor revolting but it does prove itself to be a horror flick that deserves some attention in the midst of the many teen-angst-slasher-horror movies that are so common these days. Kudos to Daveigh Chase, the best child character actor to come out of Hollywood since Haley Joel Osment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love movies that force me to play detective, and this movie does it for me. From the beginning of the movie you are left hanging with one question..... "What the hell?"The movie opens with a couple of girls talking about a seemingly urban legend about a video tape than when watched, causes the death of the viewer in seven days. Of course the two girls build on skepticism shared by the audience until one of the girls dies--apparently she saw the video seven days ago.From that point, you are taken on a journey of disturbing images, unanswered questions, and unlikely revelations.The protagonist played by the beautiful Naomi Watts (Mulholland Dr.), a journalist who was related to the girl who got killed in the beginning of the movie stumbles across evidence about the videotape. Unfortunately she ends up finding the video and watching it (Dumb idiot). Ultimately believing that she has 7 days to live, she goes to great lengths to solve the mystery, and we are right behind her.This movie puts evidence and disturbing images in front of you and lets you analyze what they mean and how it pertains to the whole mystery. And in the end, when you think everything is resolved, the mystery continues. It's a rollercoaster ride of tension and horror. This is probably the scariest movie I've seen since Event Horizon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`The Ring' is an eerie supernatural thriller that is just in time for Halloween. It raises a scary barrage of questions that had me on the edge of my seat through most of the movie. The ending floored me -- but not in a good way. This is another one of those films that takes your expectations to the heights and then drops you with a sudden thud at the end. In the final analysis, the movie never explains nearly enough to satisfy. It doesn't even try. I am weary of movies without an adequate conclusion. What's left, after the credits roll, is an audience that feels cheated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun screening, but not a great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a special screening of "The Ring" tonight here in Bloomington, IN. The promos for the film have looked promising for the genre. The movie does not hide a bad story behind star power and hokey gimmicks; the plot is clear from the get go: After watching a videotape a person dies after seven days.The film starts with a 16-year girl (who appears older) admitting to her friend that she went away for the weekend with another couple and her secret boyfriend. At a small "resort" the girl and friends view a videotape full of creepy, seemingly meaningless images -- including, you guessed it--A RING! After the tape was done playing, the girl explains that she received a phone call stating that she will die in "seven days." The event occured a week ago, and, well...I'm sure you can predict what happens. That's right! The girl, along with the other friends who viewed the tape, die at 10 p.m.Then Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), the protagonist, is introduced. Rachel is the first victim's aunt, a newspaper writer. Rachel is introduced as a bad mother, often forgetting about her son, Aidan (David Dorfman), who was very close to his cousin (the girl who died). Rachel finds out about the videotape, watches it herself, and sets off on a quest to find the tape's origin. She receives help from her ex-lover, and Aidan's dad, Noah (Martin Henderson). The film goes from there. Go see it to find out what happens.Watts' acting is extremely one-dimensional, especially at the beginning of the film. Her character is depicted as a cynical mom who really doesn't care for much--including her niece's death until she starts finding clues. Her sudden interest was not consistent with what is first presented -- bad character development.Henderson played the stereotypical dad who isn't there for his kid, but wants to get involved. His love for his ex-lover is rekindled as he tries to solve the mystery with her...I didn't see that coming. His acting was the best in the film.Dorfman, the creepy kid, was portraying a 40-year-old man in an 8-year old body. He ties his own tie, ponders death, overpronounces every word, and calls his mom by her real name. The kid also sees creepy images and draws pictures of them atop his Magna-Doodle (r) and yes, he sees dead people. The character is never fully developed over the course of the film. A twisted take off "The Sixth Sense."The movie is directed by Gore Verbinski, who does a nice job. Verbinski tries desperately, at times, to use abstract shots (no, I don't mean the abstract images that are seen on the video tape). Many extended shots are used, leaving, in my opinion, the symbolism per shot ratio a little too high. Every time an item from the tape is shown, Verbinski uses a flashback to identify exactly where the object was in the haunting video. Personally, I thought they were a little too much. I expected, from the previews, a Fight Club-esque directing style, also (remember, from the preview, the camera "journeys into" the video cassette, showing what's inside), but I was wrong.Overall, this movie beats out "horror" films from the past decade by leaps and bounds. It's not a masterpiece, but it's worth the $8.00. Go see it -- it doesn't end when you think it does!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very good twist on some horror-thriller conventions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a surprisingly good horror film. Very creepy.This is not a typical slasher film and cheap thrills horror movie. The plot makes sense and moves along and you get to know why the characters are acting as they do. One of the best parts is that it turns several cliche scenes around and doesnt present them in the same way. In an early scene a female charecter opens a a fridge door and pours a drink, the scene is set up for something to happen to her right then as a lesser directer would have, however here it just serves to build tension. The are several nice twists and turns in the movie following this, and a nice surprise ending, following following a very nicely done false finish.The movie is shot were every scene has a sort of griminess and darkness to it, which really raises the creepyness of the plot to a new level. My only complaint is that the actress in the opening scenes did not seem to really mesh. I also got the feeling somewhere that this movie was Rosemary's Baby 2. but maybe that is just me. The acting in my opinion, especially of the star Naomi Watts, really improves as the movie rolls along.Overall very well done and far better than most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw THE RING last week at an advance screening. My reasons for attending were Naomi Watts (who radiated brazen sexuality in a mesmerizing performance in last year's MULHOLLAND DRIVE) and the trailers, which actually did not reveal the whole plot. I have to say I was quite impressed. The acting was top-notch and the visuals really remain with you afterwards, including the videotape, which you get to see in its entirety. The sound effects were equally impressive, some of the best I have ever heard in a horror film. They really set the creepy tone. Plot-wise, you get as wrapped-up in the mystery as Watts' reporter does, and my only quibble is that the film leaves a bit too much unexplained. Still, the very last scene ends a very mysterious film in a very cryptic and mysterious way. I urge you to watch it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Just a Good Horror Movie, but A Great Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, Hollywood has either had a difficult time getting horror movies right through the 1990's or reality for some of us has become much more frightening. Some of the more recognizable films such as the "Scream" and the "I Know What You Did Last Summer" films failed to scare me like "The Exorcist" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street" did, due mainly to predictability. I find it ironic that in this time period, when most of us are still shaken by recent events, that we are given two of the scariest movies in awhile; "Signs" and "The Ring". "The Ring" is beautifully rendered film. The cinematography and attention to detail is first rate, clearly the cast and crew had a lot of respect for the story since the film didn't look as though it was just rushed for Halloween. The actual video that is killing off people in the film has got to be the scariest short film that I've ever seen. The combination of the visuals and the sound effects are something you don't want in you head when walking down a poorly lit street at night alone. Creating this kind of fear in a film isn't easy, especially without blood, gore and excessive violence, none of which are in the film. I thought the story was pretty original. A journalist (Naomi Watts) has seven days to figure out how a videotape is killing off those who watch it before she and her son, both of whom have already watched it, are killed. One of the best things about the plot and the way that it unfolds is that, unlike a lot of Hollywood films, it doesn't spell everything out for the viewer. It allows room for the viewer to figure out certain things for him/herself without leaving massive plotholes or ending up the result of lazy writing. Like a sculpture or a painting, everyone who sees this will have their own interpretation of how certain events occurred in the film, thus making the audience think and keeping the film in their heads for awhile. One element that will determine how much people will enjoy or be frightened by this film are their beliefs. Some of my friends didn't enjoy Signs because it dealt with two things that they didn't believe in, aliens and religion. The Ring deals somewhat with the afterlife. I might be wrong in assuming this, but I think that if you're an individual who only believes in things that you can physically interact with as opposed to an person who believes in things that you can't see or hear, then some of the subject matter in both films may seem laughable. The subject matter may also seem funny if reality for you is, or has been, more frightening than the film itself. Regardless of the above, The Ring isn't just a good horror movie, but a great film. I do get the impression that we may see a R Rated version on DVD next year as it appeared to look as though they were holding back a little on the gore. I might be wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sensationally scary and ultimate suspenser about a news reporter (Naomi Watts) who is trying to find the cause of the death of four teenagers who were killed exactly seven days after watching a video clip of disturbing images. Her son is psychologically connected to the mysterious secrets behind the killings. Problem starts when Watts watches the video and a thrilling countdown of seven days ignites to unravel the mystery. To reveal more about the plot will ruin the incredible thrills and chills. The editing is choppy but the script is carefully controlled and Watts is nothing short of amazing in the lead. Everybody does a fine job, but Watts is the driving force in the movie. The story is so interesting and told with such visual flair, one becomes a reporter like Watts in this mysterious and hypnotic caper. One of the most outrageous and courageous psychological horror films in recent years. Truly heart-stopping and exciting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Naomi Watts is excellent as always, but unfortunately she does not have an original story to back up her great performance. What we are left with is a very formulaic thriller that offers nothing new to the genre. Even though THE RING has elements from every recent horror film from THE SIXTH SENSE to SESSION 9 to 13 GHOSTS, it still manages to keep the audience entertained and on the edge of their seat. As is typical with these films, the best moment is in the last minute of the film and there is a lot of the BOO!!! scares that seem to come out of left field, but you know they are coming. In a slow week at the megaplex, this should pass the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this at a sneak preview yesterday and I'm afraid to admit I have some very frightening images permanently stapled to my brain because of it. I haven't seen the original Japanese version but I'm pretty sure Blockbuster will get a copy now; this movie is definitely going places. This is also by far my favorite new movie. Isn't it funny though how the scariest movies are only PG-13 or less. "The 6th Sense," "Signs," "Psycho," "What Lies Beneath," and a plethora ofothers. I personally would like to see something at least as scary as this but an R rated version with plenty of gore. I mean sure, gore's not scary, but it can periodically enhance the "shock factor" for a movie. 100 / 100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror film to come along in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After enduring horror film after horror film from the 90's that paraded senseless violence and vacuous plots, I was severely concerned about the health of the genre. From the late 90's until today, it's been even worse: we have films like _The Sixth Sense_ and _Frailty_ which purport to be intelligent but are little more than cheap cinematic jack-in-the-boxes that shout "Boo!" at the end. Keeping that in mind, my standards for a horror film these days have been correspondingly low. Now, along comes _The Ring_, and all that is blown away.Not only does this film have a fantastic story (for once, EVER, we have a ghost story that EXPLAINS the ghost's activity), but the acting is first rate. The casting of Watts, whose intensity was integral to the success of _Mullholland Drive_, is nothing short of genius. Such talent in a horror film is risky, but pays off in the emotional punch and urgency of Watt's performance.And of course, this movie would be almost laughable without the right look. Every person involved with the visuals audio here took the utmost care to get it in sync with the emotional tone of the film. The result is that unlike _Rosemary's Baby_ or similar films, you never get a break from the mounting tension and sense of doom surrounding Rachel Keller. Very effective.This should be a lesson to everyone involved with _Scream_, _The Sixth Sense_, _Frailty_, _I Know What You Did Last Summer_, and all that other crap: WE ARE ADULTS IN THE AUDIENCE. WE CAN HANDLE IT IF YOU MAKE A FILM THAT IS ARTFUL AND REQUIRES THOUGHT. Of course, this one has a surprising ending too, but (horror of horrors) it actually makes sense and clears up some earlier ambiguities in the movie that the movie goer had thought resolved (which, Mr. M. Night, is how surprise endings are supposed to work.)If you like scary movies, this is a must-see. One thing though: don't go to the theater and then scream like a little girl every time something scary happens. Being an adult, you can control your reactions, and it's very annoying to the rest of us that have to listen to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The Ring last night at a preview screening...and it was great!! I had seen the original Japanese version and it truly creeped me out. I love movies, scary, thrillers, gore, I love them all. I would say I'm pretty jaded with scary movies and don't get scared easily anymore, but I still watch them for the fun. I rented Ringu and watched it alone one night. And it creeped the hell out of me. Since then, I've recommended it to everyone I know. It's not at every video store, so you'll have to search for it. In SF, it's at LeVideo. Anyway, I was excited about the remake, esp. since it was starring one of my new favorite actresses, Naomi Watts. I was kind of upset of the PG13 rating. Well, I can tell you...it was still creepy, very faithful, and a job well done. I hope it becomes a huge hit, it deserves to be seen by a lot of people, and that it doesn't get ignored. The filmmakers should be very proud. As in the original, there is no blood, no gore, just images and trippy visuals that will make you look in awe and mezmerize you. You're involved right away in this tape and you want to know what it's all about. Not all remakes are good at all, this one is really really good. I hope you all see it. But if you want a real creep out, find the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more better than the original, methinks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring was a movie of suspense, thrill, and psychological disturbance. Even if LOTR: TT or HP: COS comes out, I predict that this movie will create more gross!Many people know that this movie was actually originated from the Japanese movie "Ringu", which was based on a novel series (Also named "Ringu") In 1999, Korea made a re-make of this thriller "Ring" I watched Ringu at least 4 times and Ring 2 times, and I find that The Ring is much more scarier. I'm not trying to be degrading anyone, but I think that the original wasn't really as creepy as the Korean version. The Korean version was also really crappy. And after that, Ringu 2, Ringu o: Bassudai, and Ring: Rasen was also a chilling series that left me out cold. I don't know, but in my opinion, Asian countries (Well I AM Korean myself, so I'm just referring to our wrongs) try to make it TOO terrifying. But the American Version is sooo much more honest and believable.If The Ring was this good, I can't wait for its sequel (The Ring 2), prequel (The Ring 0: Birthday) and its epilogue (The Ring Rasen/Loop) America made some crappy horror movies, but The Ring... just try not to get a heart attack!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is a brief guide to viewing this movie:1) Do not watch it alone 2) See it in a crowded theater 3) Bring a camera. You will want to take a picture of yourself before and after you see it. 4) Do not see it with loved ones 5) Do not travel aloneThis is the most frightening film I have ever experienced. I saw this film with a small group of film fanatics. When the movie ended, we emerged from the theater pale and breathless. No one dared to walk to their cars alone.We then departed our separate ways and spent the night awake. Graphic images from the experience haunted our minds and made us restless.This film does not contain a lot of blood or gore, but delves deep into your Psyche. Experience this film and you will be restless too.*Spoiler Warning* Anything you read about this movie is a potential spoiler. Do not read any review if you do not want your experience spoiled!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Japanese version-- no good! The American version-- don't know</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen 3 of the Japanese version of this movie "Ring", which aren't good at all. I fell in sleep in each of this three time. Totally not scary. The scene that considered a bit scarier than "today world" in this movie is that when the ghost crawls out of the television screen [don't know if the US version includes that scene as well]. Hopefully, the US version will be more scary, and it should be better than the Japanese one, since you don't have to catch the subtitle all the time and miss all the scary parts should there be any. But come to think, Japan is leading the trend of entertainment around the world in the past decade: Playstation 1 &amp; 2, Nintendo, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, etc. Now they are "invading" the traditional US dominated movie market. Thus I predict that this movie will gain a big load in the box office. But not all people will like it, since sushi isn't tasty for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a screening of this last night, and while it wasn't a bad movie, I am not sure if I would spend the $8 to see it at a theater, over waiting for the DVD to come out.Beware of Spoilers: There were too many loose plot points for me. The most significant was the fact that the son got so upset when his mother (Naomi Watts) released Samara. She apparently didn't need to 'be released' to kill before, and she still killed afterward. What was the point of that, especially since they made such a big deal of that scene? (It occurs at the point of the gotcha ending).Also, she makes the comment of what she did differently and concludes it must have been making a copy, but she also spent time in the well. it is possible that is what saved her, and the son making copies would not do any good.Finally, since Samara apparently kills by coming out of the TV, how did she kill the 2 friends who were in the car? I guess it is possible that they had a TV in the car for her to come out of, but that still seems unlikely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers!My wife and a friend of ours went to see it last night at a preview. About 30-40 minutes into the movie I was thinking "Stir of Echoes". (They have to find out what happened to the little girl and find her body in order to save themselves).Yes, I wrong about that in the end, but it seemed so obvious to me that I was not interested, as I should have been about what was going on.I could follow the movie just fine. I just did not really care. They should have kept me guessing more. Was it the mom? Was it the little girl? Is something else going on?The little twist at the end was great. The "video" was very cool. The special effects and how they showed the two dead people were very good too.I am fine with not knowing exactly what was going on. I love the ending with the "conundrum" (making a copy of the video saves you but it will kill more).But I don't think the average moviegoer will be ok with the limited explanation of why the girl was killing people.I give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it really that scary? Nah~</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the original Japanese film. The ideas are intriguing. But I still don't understand why it became so popular in Asia as the scariest film. Maybe the atmosphere and sound effect (mostly silent) in the film were too much for people to take. Personally I don't get the fear it supposedly presents, and surely it was not that memorizing. So, maybe you watch this film in midnight; and then suddenly the phone rings... so what?! Afraid of someone climb out your TV set and take your life?! Then the ring series came out, still the same, paid more attention to the story than the fear. And now there is a remake version of it? with similar story? Come on, I don't see how it will get any better (maybe to the first-timers. But that is.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Final Destination meets Begotten meets Sixth Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this on apple, I was astounded Dreamworks would be releasing this. At first glimpse, it looks to be this profoundly existential subconscious head trip. Later previews would reveal more of the 'mainstream' parts. I got to see this remake of the Japanese cult hit 'Ringu' recently. Call it Final Destination meets Begotten meets the Sixth Sense with a cryptic blend of ornate visuals, The Ring starts off oddly enough like something straight out of Scream. This alone could make quite a few film buffs gasp. And yes, for the first 15 minutes there is this sort of Urban LEgends feel, with angsty high schoolers talking of the suspected tape as if it was out of a Wes Craven film. However, soon after the movie begins to unfold into a starkly different direction, a woven fabric of unstelling images, blue tones, and effectively shuddering ambience.Namoi Watts, fresh off her find muck duties on David Lynch's brilliant Mulholland Drive, sinks into this one with an almighty honestness.Throughout the movie a lot of comparisons will automatically pop in your head. The kid from Sixth Sense, along with a lot of 'havent we heard this before' dialogue. But it is what you havent seen before thats really unsettling.A really great film will explain a certain technology most of the viewing public doesnt know about. One Hour Photo delved deep into the inner working of a photo lab. Red Violin explained the sound detective aspect of musical restoration. And here we get a peak into the world of audio visual exploration. And boy is it effective. The tape in question might not be all that scary in a general sense...but more in that finding a video casste on the side of the road in a Barstow truck stop kind of way...that David Lynch creepiness that hits ya a few days later.As the film develops, we get more a feel of dread than any sort of happy revelation, somthing that expands to great effect later on. All I'll say is that top of the barn small room scene has to be one of the most effective use of ornate cisuals since the tapestry sequence in The Cell. This to me is also the most unnerving film Ive seen since Twin Peaks fire Walk With Me. Some may feel the ending gets a bit too outlandish, but within the perimeters of the film it works wonders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from an advanced screening of "The Ring". If there was a point to this movie, I would honestly be surprised. Although I didn't find the story line all too intriguing, I did find the acting, direction, cinematography, editing and sound design to be quite good. Throughout the whole film I felt like I was waiting for something, ANYTHING to happen, but it kind of left me high and dry towards the end. There are a lot of great moments where I nearly p***ed myself, so I can't really call this a BAD movie. Aren't films made to entertain?Great cinematography and believable acting kept me engaged, but I couldn't recommend this film to anyone who looks for a deep meaning when they make a trip to the theatre. If you want to be scared sporadically over the course of 90 minutes, then this is the film for you. I rate this film a 6/10... By the way, don't let the PG-13 rating steer you in the wrong direction, because this film was one of the most disturbing things I've seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, possibly one of the best remakes i've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off saying that Ringu (original japanese version) itself was a great movie. It was very original in plot and suspense. I was fortunate to see Ringu before being blessed with a prescreening.The Ring is a GREAT movie. The beginning one thinks is slow at first, but then thats for about three minutes. The movie's story differs from that of the Japanese version in many ways, mainly because every other person in the original was a psychic; that wouldn't fly with the American audience much. Despite changes in the story they have kept the drama and expanded parts in the original to really freak you out. I just hope they don't change much in the two weeks before the movie comes out.I like this movie because at both times they were subtle things to scare ya, you didn't get to see too much, but then what you did see gave you the creeps. I slept well with Ringu and The Ring, but my friends had a hard time sleeping with The Ring. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a joke. This film was so bad, I had to jumped into another theatre just to get my money back. The very plot of the film should be enough to keep people away. " You watch a video and 7 days later, you die." This sounds like a reject script from the X-files. None of the character seem believable or real. The scene where the women is screaming but you hear a buzzing sound was probably their film instructor who saw one of their student films. They should have sent everyone who made this film back to film school 101 and sue their teachers for every having graduated them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad remake but not near as good as the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring is an American remake of the Japanese 'classic' Ring (no "the") that was one of the highest box-office draws ever in that country when it was released in 1998. It was widely referred to as "the Japanese Blair Witch" even though it had nothing to do content-wise with that film. This comparison was due to the deliberate 'novice' appearance of the film and it's surprising success with the movie-going populace.The film concerns a bootleg poor-quality video tape that is being circulated hand-to-hand amongst teenagers as a thrill game. The story goes that anyone who views the tape will die exactly seven days later. To give you ANY more of the plot would be an enormous disservice. This film is most potent when viewed without knowing any more than that.First off, let me state that the original version is FAR better than this remake. If you wish to see Ring and can get a hold of the region 3 import DVD and don't mind watching a film with subtitles, see the original. The original is not only better than the American remake but it is ten times as creepy and disturbing and fifty times as scary.That is not to say the American remake is a bad film. It's not. If I had not previously seen the original I would likely be raving over the American version. It has some clever plot rewrites that actually improve upon the original (and unfortunately a few deletions that equally detract from it). The cinematography is excellent and quite enthralling in it's 'non-Hollywood' presentation. The lack of opening credits and poor sound quality at the beginning are a masterful addition by the production team (you won't "get it" until after you have seen the film). The film's antagonist is GREATLY watered down (no pun intended) from the original but still remains quite terrifying. I never will understand why Hollywood feels the need to 'tone down' foreign remakes for American releases. It really won't sell more tickets since more people would likely go see a scarier better movie.The actors and actresses are largely unknowns (with a few familiar faces) but they all turn in outstanding performances. Some of the non-traditional storytelling elements are truly inspired. Unfortunately I cannot reveal them without giving away parts of the story, but they are very well-done and very clever in the way they are presented.No blood. No nudity. No profanity. Just some very disturbing imagery and a truly scary story. I would not recommend this film for pre-teens, but anyone older will likely enjoy it (or at least be scared and somewhat disturbed). It's sad that this film is not getting more of a marketing push. Even though it's a remake, it's FAR better than any of Hollywood's recent pre-packaged aimed-at-teenagers supposed-to-be-scary efforts. It also is gambling on it's ability to attract audiences by word-of-mouth. Don't be fooled into believing that a poor box-office showing on opening weekend is any indication of a film's quality (go rent "Zero Effect" for another good example).If you like horror films, this movie should be on your 'must-see' list. It's a fairly faithful re-make of the film that the recent Feardotcom plagiarized for most of it's ideas. This version of the film is a great treat for casual horror fans and people looking for a good fright film who would never see the original under normal circumstances. True horror afficionados should really seek out the original. The Ring is a great film, but the original Ring (and to a great extent it's sequel, Ring 2) is a genre landmark and should not be missed by scary movie fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let us never forget that a movie is supposed to entertain peopl. I'm really tired of people who tend to forget that and make some sort of big fraudian psycho babble thing out of anything. I bet some people out there probably looked at the Oddysian message of Pokemon the movie.So let's not forget that this movie is a movie...it's not real and its not going to make any significance to the world in any way. It may just give a bunch of teens that snuck in to watch it the heebee geebees and a fear of televisions for a while. Man, dont even start thinking about how you'll never look at a closet, tape, or tv the same way again. This movie was that scary! I believe it actually was a great translation from the original. To be able to make a film that was in another language into one that Americans will actually be talking about for a long time (they will too) is really a hard thing to do.I saw a test screening of it and I believe that they should not change a thing...forget about the negative remarks or any suggestions on changing the ending. This version is the closest you'll ever get to the utter dread and sheer horror of the japanese original.Watch this movie with someone you love...because they'll be the only one to understand why you're screaming like a newlymade castrato.</fullReview>

It's been a long time since a movie has kept me on the edge of my seat and this film should become a classic.

		<shortDescription>Most suspenseful, least bloody horror movie since the original Halloween</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring is, in my opinion, the most suspenseful, least bloody horror movie since the original Halloween. Quick synopsis: a journalist's niece dies and in the course of trying to find out what killed her, discovers a videotape that, once viewed, seems to cause the death of the viewer one week to the moment of viewing. The journalist (of course) views the tape, and then has 7 days to discover the origins of the tape and end the "curse." From the hair raising opening when the niece's friend tells the "urban legend" of the tape to just about the end, this movie is very well put together, leading us from one discovery to the other, and leaving no unanswered questions that I noticed. My only quibble is with the last two seconds of the movie. I thought they were cheesy. Overall, a really good movie. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got a chance to a screener of this last night( I work at an AMC theatre) and I must say I was really impressed. The movie starts off like a typical teen slasher flick, but you soon see it's nothing like that at all. It's a mystery, but the truly frightening elements to the story are the unknown. As the mystery unravels it does get more intense. And I might add that the disturbing imagery is exactly that, this movie should be rated R. If you are looking for the type, think of it as a cross between "the 6th sense" "stir of echoes" and the recent "feardotcom".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring: taking it off the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now let me just start my saying this: Most people walked out of the screening this thursday confused, unfulfilled, disappointed. All too often people want to leave a movie theater unaffected and with a lucid mind. The Ring isn't the movie for you if you want to leave the cineplex with the exact attitude in which you've entered. I won't give anything away but, you will see the contents of the video and what exactly the ring is. This movie delivers high class chills without indulging in excessive gore. Unlike the Sixth Sense formula, The Ring doesn't promise any surprise ending or spell-binding twists. Instead, this film delivers a visual tilt-a-whirl of images from the moment it begins. Director Gore Verbinski has absolutely grown as a filmmaker and The Ring is a testament to this, with it's crisp, often dazzling imagery. Naomi Watts, fresh off her amazing performance in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, creates a vivid heroine, yet we never really see her desperation enough. When the details of the movie are revealed, you'll probably agree. Although the performances in the film are at times campy, the film provides an intricate storyline that will have you going "What the hell was that?" or "What's going on?" It's a very high concept for a commercial film, which is refreshing after all of the Triple X's and Scorpion King's of the summer: a settling movie to enter Autumn with. Just sit back and be prepared for a flim you could never imagine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on a sneak preview and was not expecting much. After the first 10 minutes I thought i was sitting and watching another crappy teen horror movie, but i was very wrong. This movie was perhaps one of the most well done suspenseful movies in recent memory. I never get scared during crappy horror movies, but this one had me on the edge of my seat. There was some disturbing imagery, and had scenes that were stuck in my head for days to follow. It rivals "Signs" as one of great suspense movies as of late, and i think even surpasses "Signs" in that regard. The tension is great, added even more so by a countdown of sorts.

		<fullReview>Astounding terror movie about a vengeful specter that kills everybody hear a surrealist videotape . This frightening movie displays thrills , chills , hard-edged drama and ghastly images . This is the American version directed by Gore Verbinski whose argument copies exactly the Japan original movie without many surprises . Adolescents watch a videotape which supposedly causes the spectator to die. Afterwards the horrible death of some adolescents and her niece , the journalist named Rachel (Naomi Watts) begins to investigate rumors about a videotape that causes the strange murders , she finds out the truth about the tape and its origins at Shelter Mountain Inn . As she discovers that whenever a teenager spontaneously dies with a horrifying look on his face after hearing a supposedly killing videotape and one time the phone rings ,telling he had only one week to live . The reporter shows up to investigate these deeds and the happenings lead a mysterious woman named Anna Morgan who lived in Moesko island where exists a strange lighthouse . Rachel is helped by his ex-husband (Martin Henderson) and later they face a race to save their lives from spooky creature , an eerie phantom . Rachel tries to get the bottom of mystery and discovers the secrets of life of Samara and her father (Brian Cox) . Besides mysterious events are happening at home her ex-husband and both of them are caught up by ominous Samara , a spectre of pale complexion and large hair .This horror film provides great load of screams, grisly killings and scary atmosphere which becomes pretty sinister with the Sadako appearing . The picture is a sleek production with passable budget and packs genuine chills , suspense, tension , and shocks , it's a terror-thriller very exciting . Good performance of Noami Watts as intrepid newspaper reporter determined to find out the amazing events . The film is paced with intelligent edition, special use of color and slick utilization of shock images . While the look is suitable atmospheric and creepy , the argument stretches plausibility to the breaking point. This is an acceptable adaptation of the novel and movie that took successfully Japan and based on original Japanese novel by Koji Suzuki that was a real success in the Asian cinemas and all around the world . The movie has some excellent special effects describing series of weird and otherworldly happenings and a magnificent make-up specially reflected on the hair-raising countenance of dead . Eerie musical score by the prestigious Hans Zimmer who also composed the following . Tenebrous cinematography by Bazzelli with the TV surrealist images filmed in 35 mm and in super 8 style . The motion picture is well written by Kruger and professionally realized by Gore Verbinski in similar style to original directed by Hideo Nakata , an expert on horror cinema who directed its following Ringu 2 (1999) ; furthermore he filmed US version , the inferior Ring 2 also with Naomi Watts and his son played by David Dorfman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrifying film, though not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be made quite well and quite terrifying. There were lots of jumpy scenes. The opening scene for this movie was done very well. The part where the main character pulls out the hair from her mouth was also done very well. This is the remake of the original film. Though I found this remake to be quite entertaining. There were a few flaws that made it not as good as the original. The opening scene to me in this movie seemed to be the scariest part in the entire film, in fact it was probably even scarier than the scene where the ghost comes out of the TV set. I have read some of the reviews about the wonderful opening scene in this movie, and I agree. However, this whole movie definitely was not as good as the original. Because the scary scene where the ghost comes out from the TV set in the original was much scarier.The storyline of this film is about the same as the original. Here's a comparison between the original and the remake. Original - The man was working on his newspaper articles in a typical house, when the TV showed a picture of a well.You could already see the terror and fear on the man's face. Sadako slowly crawls out of the well and crawls out of the TV maintaining her scary crawling position. She then stands up, with her hair still covered over her face. Her face was not shown. She slowly moves towards the man. The man was shocked and frightened as you could see from his expression. He struggles. Just as you thought that Sadako would move towards the man. No. Sadako twitches her eye and stares at the man. Just as you thought Sadako would move towards him. No, the man faces Sadako, his mouth was forced opened, his heart stopped beating and fell onto the floor with his mouth opened wide.I could not sleep after I watched it Remake- The man was also working on his newspaper articles, when the TV seems to be on, he turns off the TV. He did not look as terrified as the man in the original ringu version. The man even stupidly moves towards the TV. Samumara comes out of the well.(The atmosphere around the well was not dark unlike ringu) Samumara slowly comes out of the TV set. Strange, but the coincidence of the main character trying to call the man to warn him what was about to happen, reduces the tension and fear of that scene. Samumara slowly comes out of the TV set, her hair was still covering her face. She slowly walks towards the man. The man seem to trip over some shelf. The shelf fell onto the ground with a crashing sound.This part reduces even more tension and fear of that scene. The camera angle was then not right. The scene then shows Samumara's feet walking towards the man.(also reduces tension) The man then tries to hide. Up to here , the scene was still very scary. What comes next became a disappointment to me in comparison to the original. Sadako slowly raises her head, with anger, her entire face was shown(Sadako's hair was still covering her face in the original version).Then some crappy special effects occurred without even mentioning what happened to the man unlike the original. The ending for the remake was also disappointing compared to the original.there were a few plot holes in the movie. Firstly, the video which the main character watched left many questions in my mind. What has the centipede got to do with the plot for this movie? What has the ladder even got to do with the movie? What has the finger piercing the nail or even the housefly has got to do with the movie? I personally think the special effects were overly done in that video for the remake. Some parts like the mother pushing Samumara down the well was pretty unexpected. I love that twist, because all the while I thought the father was the one who did it. This twist was not used in the original. I love the creepy atmosphere being used throughout the entire movie. I love the tension and fear that builds up in this movie. I love the characters being used in this movie, Samumara really looked scary. I love the character development and the storyline used in this movie. I thought there were lots of character development. Base on cultural interest, the original has done a much better job than the remake. Overall, I found this to be quite a nice movie, but the original was three times better than this. This movie is still recommended, but I highly recommend one to see the original first before you see the remake. My scores for the ring series so far would be: Japanese version of ringu- 9/10 Japanese version of ringu 2- 7/10 The ring(remake)-7.7/10 The ring two(remake)-7.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why is it scary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are no words with which I can describe this movie. Maybe "amazing" or "brilliant". The Ring is an absolutely perfect film about the "invisible" which makes you scared. I think it has had a part in the movie-history with its innovation after the bloody horrors and own atmosphere which is the most depressing I have ever seen. Because you're afraid of something you cannot see.I was just 12 when I saw it the first time - everybody spoke about this film, how scary it is, and that it's a story about a tape which kills you when you watch it - and it was a memorable day for me. I had thought I would be afraid of it, but then I wouldn't. It was something else. With its blue-green hues and fantastic music has ever composed to a thriller, I just felt sadness and depress. And yeah, it was scary in an other way. But not in the word's normal meaning. It created such a kind of atmosphere that no movies have ever did and I think they won't. That's why it is a perfect creation. And this film is gonna be the movie like the X-Files which everybody saw and made them scared in their childhood.Having watched it I heard that it's a remake and years later I watched the original version. But I realized I don't care it's a remake. Who cares? The Ring is an excellent movie and to tell you the truth I didn't find the original film good. It was very different than the American version. It wasn't bad but the director understands the message in an other way than The Ring's. And Ringu is also based on a novel so it can be announced as a "remake" too. Two film, two messages.The most interesting thing about The Ring is that actually you cannot explain what you afraid of. Are you afraid of a tape? A simple object? Ridiculous. But it is the truth. A tape makes you scared. With its disturbing pictures, noises, sounds and elements. I think that this short movie is a kind of art work. Fantastic how the director can transform everyday happenings into disturbing elements. It could have won an Oscar.I like the actors playing. I think David Dorfman acts very well as a child, and I don't think we have to discuss anything about Naomi Watts. She is perfect too. Nothing overacting. And when I watched it years later when I became older I found another message about The Ring.I found it sad. It is a sad story. A mother kills her daughter. Why? Because the horses bear themselves nervous? That's not enough. It is a sad story because a mum cannot stand her kid and she feels the only way to be quit of is death. And then she commits suicide. A series of deaths. Because of a little girl. Lots of unexplainable happenings. And with them I've told almost nothing about the movie.And why is it scary? I have no answer. Complicated, original, unexplainable, brilliant. The Ring itself is the answer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Naomi Watts and a morbid curiosity carry this art school horror remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot revolves around a particular urban myth about the results of viewing a certain unmarked short video tape. We see the dark film (and a nightmare producing young girl) early. Where did this damning video and girl come from? These questions are investigated by Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) when the movie is accidentally viewed by creepy son Aiden (David Dorfman) and his father (now her ex) as the whole estranged family is on a race against death! Watts deftly exudes her characters' many roles while the other two give one dimensional performances as she tries to save her son from the heart stopping fate in dreary Seattle. My morbid curiosity proved this isn't just another teenage urban legend flick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this alone, at night, and it was a bad idea. The movie was meant to scare, and it did an excellent job. From the opening scene to the horrifying finale, I was absolutely, 100% terrified. The movie starts off innocently enough, with two girls, Katie and Rebecca, watching TV and talking aimlessly. However, the conversation soon turns to the "cursed" tape that Katie had seen last weekend. Both girls laugh it off, but there is still a heavy tension in the air. A series of disturbing things begin happening, such as the TV downstairs turning on and off by itself. Katie is killed, and Rebecca, after witnessing the horrible death, is sent to a mental hospital. The rest of the movie goes on show how Rachel, Katie's aunt, unravels the mystery behind the strange tape.The plot line is interesting, and the scares were genuine.I have never seen the original Ringu, so I can't compare it to that, but all on its own, this movie was pretty good. Just don't watch it alone at night!Overall, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of a modern classic of Japanese cinema.The Hollywood version is, as usual, with remakes far more commercial and glossy. Those who have not seen the original will enjoy it. Those of us lucky enough to have enjoyed, or should that be scared senseless, by the camera-work which gave the very disturbing movement will be disappointed but unsurprised by this film.The story is about a tape and a mysterious figure who returns whenever the tape is played. The legend quickly surrounds the tape and yet people keep seeing it; maybe they don't believe what they've been told.But I was left with a sense of disappointment. See the American version first then the Japanese original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To remake a 'cult' classic it seems, is to incur the wrath of those who loved the original so much that any thought of remaking it is blasphemy. This, it seems, is despite the imperfections of the original. For a horror film to be truly effective, however, never have the 'imperfections' been so important. For a horror film to work properly, you actually have to be scared. It has to be like the ghost stories older kids told you when you were kids (not the censored version your parents told you).I think in terms of the 'The Ring' I was lucky in that I got to see the American version first. As a result, I didn't know the story and so seeing this version of the story as my first view of the tale had the same effect on me (no doubt) as people who saw the Japanese original for the first time.I often believe that an original is better than it's remake ('The Vanishing', 'Yojimbo', 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' to name many). Let's not even bring 'The hitcher' into this discussion. In this case, however, the far superiour production values of the original make for a much scarier film than the original. I watched this version - the hairs stood up on my legs as I was watching it. I saw the original afterwards and it didn't have anyway near the same effect. Sure - you say - you knew what was coming! That's true - but then I watched this version again I had almost exactly the same sensation as when i watched it the first time.Why? That's easy. For a film to work you need to be willling to suspend your disbelief. For a horror film to be scary, this is even more important. The superior production values of the remake make it much easier to suspend your disbelief and therefore it is more effective as a horror piece. Compare one directly to the other and you;ll see that the story is in no way compromised - but that the characters are richer, the acting is better, the effects are way, way ,way, way better and the tension is even more drawn out.Simply put THIS is EXACTLY how to take an original film that used story to scare the bejesus out of you and then make a better film that has the same fundamental psychological effect. Those working on the "A Nightmare on Elm Street' remake please, please, PLEASE take note.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a patch on the Japanese version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I might have liked this film more if I hadn't seen the Japanese version first. I found the digressions from the original plot in this version irritating in the extreme. The business about the horses is spooky, but not really anything to do with the main plot. The same goes for the stuff about the barn. The director appears to have thrown in stuff from Ringu 2, without any regard for whether it belongs in this film or not.Then there was the child actor who played Aiden. His performance wasn't as convincing as that of Takashi Yamamura as Yoichi in the original, and I really couldn't bring myself to care too much what happened to him, which killed the suspense.SPOILER WARNING I also found it puzzling how after Richard electrocutes himself in the bathtub (in a shocking, but gratuitous scene) Noah suddenly arrives virtually out of nowhere, then they seem to make it back to the cabin on the mainland in an unreasonably short length of time.Rachel's choice of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang as a tape to replace with the cursed video seems pointlessly nasty. Why put it in a children's video, and not, say, an 'adult' film which a child would be unlikely to see? Is it okay for children to be cursed to die as long as they're not HER children?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly brilliant and gripping film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring is a brilliant and gripping film which thriller fans will adore.The story begins after Rachel Keller's (Naomi Watts) niece is found dead, with no explanation for the death. It would appear that her heart just stopped. But the girl's mother asks Rachel, who is a journalist, to try and figure out why she really died. What Rachel discovers is that her niece, along with the three other friends of hers, watched a video tape exactly seven days prior to when they all died simultaneously.The Ring has a rating of MA15+, and it earned it. This is a very scary film that will have you on tenterhooks the whole way through its many twists and turns, but is not exceptionally gory, nor are things jumping out at the central characters every few minutes. The film is scary because of the creepy way it goes about things, letting you only have another piece of the puzzle that Rachel is presented. But the frightening imagery that the film uses makes it creepier then the story would have been. The scenes that stay with you especially are Rachel's encounter with a horse, her final meeting with Richard Morgan, the owner of a horse ranch on Moesko Island, and the gripping finale.But, the powerful imagery doesn't only come in the forms of scares. Certain scenes, like one simple scene where Rachel stands on her apartment's balcony and looks out at other people's lives gives us a snapshot into other people's lives, just showing that everyone you see has a tale to tell, something different from the last, and that people always have secrets.This film for me doesn't come under the "horror" category, but rather the "thriller" category, even though it is a very frightening piece of cinema. It is a classic, and even though it's a very scary piece of film, it's easily recommendable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Suspense and Horror should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched the film I was incapable of sitting and watching the whole thing the beginning had scared me so bad. A couple months had gone by and hearing everyone continue to talk about how good the movie was, I decided to give it another shot. I now own the movie, once I was able to get past the parts that terrified me, I was able to observe the film for what it was and the elements used in the film that made the scary parts of the film truly scary.The outline of the story surrounds the "urban legend" if you will, of a tape that was made that if you watch it, exactly seven days later you die. Naomi Watts plays a news reporter looking into this story after a group of teens all die at the same night and time after visiting Shelter Mountain a week earlier. She does her investigating and uncovers more and more about "The Tape" and realizes that is more to it than she originally thought.A well paced movie, with great acting, good tension build-ups and good "Jump" moments. The music does a great bit of help in the film, without Hans Zimmer's quiet, creepy music, the film wouldn't have been anywhere near as dark without it. It helped carry the flow of the movie all the way to the climax where you might as well be chewing on the edge of the couch because of the thrill it gives with its twist ending.Great horror film with no gore or blood which is how horror films should be made, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, obviously quite a few people love this film, but I'm not sure why. I found the whole "cursed video" laughable, and was never able to figure out why a girl who was kept in a barn and drowned in a well would choose a videotape as her vehicle of revenge. For that matter, exactly how creepy is a wet 12 year old with stringy hair supposed to be? The point of killing random strangers seemed a bit strained as well. Overall, I found the cinematography disappointing and the acting never rose to the level of mildly convincing. Perhaps many of these elements made more sense in the context of the Japanese movie -- Ringu -- on which "The Ring is based; I have no idea, since nothing I saw in this movie would make me want to watch the original.</fullReview>

But this movie showed me wrong, but also made me wish I didn't watch it because of one very gross scene that I don't want to describe.This movie has many plot twists, so it's very difficult to explain the plot, but I will attempt to do so anyways. Well, there's a video that if you watch it, you will get a phone call with some whisper saying, "seven days". This whole movie is about two people and a child who helps a little try to stop the girl from killing them, but when it seems like they won, they failed. That's what makes me angry about this movie.Overall, this movie is a great movie. But has scenes that are very, very disturbing. I mean, very disturbing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some Friday night.We decided to go watch a movie at our local theater.Without much option left , we decided to take a risk and we picked THE RING.When the movie started , none of us was expecting much.The movie was recent and we're not the kind of peaple to read critic and review before.The Movie started and like everyone . We had already prejudice before the first image.Thinking it's was again some kind of movie with a lot of nudity mixed with blood and scream(don't forget the cat).I'm not a fan of horror movie , because horror movie are the close parent of porn movie.Most of the time empty of storyline.The first scene give you already the cill , even if you expect her fates to happens , you don't expect the way she die.Curiously there's no blood.Just a tortured face of a teenager.Tortured by Fear.The reaction of her parents give you the chill.THinking to ourself , what she have seen?The first image was enough to make me tremble . Have we discovered a horror movie actually giving us reel horror and not surtaxing us with blood and scream?This movie from the first scene to the last build up the fear of knowing what these peaple must see before dying.Watching this movie at 00:00 alones at home really could scare the more brave viril man.It's not about believing or not.It's really about giving you the feel of what horror could really be.So far we've seen a load of movie trying to copy the RING.But they failed.Also . Tortured Kid and demoniac children really work on us Adult.GIvinh us fear and chill.Children are the symbol of innocence.When they start acting the opposite , we really start pissing in your pants.The Ring with The first Exorcist are really the movie that i would classify into HORROR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>spooky and surprisingly well done....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard mixed reviews about the film, with a silly premise about a videotape that kills you after you watch it. Hahahha...yeah that sounds real clever. However, this film isn't really a horror film in the first half, more of a psychological thriller. I found the story quite interesting about Samara, the disturbed girl with strange powers. All the performances are pretty good, especially from Naomi Watts. The cinematography is perfect, with a cold greyish tone for the film. I did feel that this deliberately made the film look like a horror flick - there was barely any real daylight in the film. I mean, even in horror films, you can have some sunny days, even though the characters are obviously trapped in a nightmare.Its the ending that will scare you, especially when Samara comes out of the TV. The curse never ends, so you have to show the tape to someone in order for them to pay the price for the curse. The ending is a little bit unsatisfying, but luckily the sequel (though nowhere near as good as this) will solve most of your answers.I think the Japanese version captures more of the scary elements, cuz they know how to do horror better -its in their culture in a way. So see the japenese one first if you want to.</fullReview>

People always told me that they had no plots and everyone acted as morons. And critics didn't like them either. But 1 day, I decided I was brave enough to go rent a horror movie. So I went and took The Ring. It was pretty darn good. I had brought some covers to hide if I was scared, and I did hide 5 or 6 times. But I wasn't brave at that time. I even slept with the night light, and I woke 2 to 3 times a day.

		<fullReview>When I first saw The Ring, I had yet to see other films of that type, such as the original Japanese films, The Grudge and Dark Water.For me, the film introduced the creepy, malevolent water child with jet black hair. Just the way the thing crawled around was frightening, and I had goosebumps throughout the film, which I saw on TV.Although I grew up in Seattle, it was hard to recognize the dark, Gothic locations, particularly the island where the child grew up. I knew where it was, but I never associated that island with anything that dark and foreboding.This film is truly scary, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good non-slasher type of horror film. Its one of the few horror films that I have seen in recent years that I would go back and watch a second time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm scared.........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are three main types of horror in the film world - gory horror, jump-out-of-your-seat horror and just plain weird horror. Though The Ring contains elements of all these three, the reason why it's so scary is because it's just so weird! I mean, even the tape alone had me freaked out - and when Rachel watches it in an empty cabin on an old TV on her own, it really builds up an atmosphere of true terror that no amount of disfigured corpses can do. Some scenes from this film are so strange and disturbing that they'll linger in your mind for the rest of your life. This was the film that inspired me to sleep with my bedroom door closed - creaking doors in the dark are the most haunting things horror has offered us. Samara is one of horror's most unorthodox villains - the bit where she comes out of the TV at the end is scary. And the ring left by the cup of tea on the newspaper - everything starts to come together. I personally found the conclusion hard to understand - I don't see how it brought everything together, and the sequel didn't exactly do a great deal of justice to any of it either. It is evident that some scenes were just put in the film for fright-factor rather than any real use in the plot, but this is one of the main problems of horror films. And as long as you've got a horror film with an original premise (a tape that kills you a week after watching it) and a few genuine frights (or, in The Ring's case, a lot), you've got an interested audience. There are some disfigured corpses and jump-out-of-your-seat frights, but The Ring is best in the sense that it is just spooky. And, in spite of what I said earlier, everything DOES kind of make sense - everything we see on the tape is later revisited. And when you see those places again, it feels very strange indeed... 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was extremely impressed with this movie. It has a big concept, a good balance of things and some good scares. It is very different and has weird parts to make it scary, like no other horror movie does. Everything seems to move very fast, which is on the edge-of-you-seat kind of style which is great. I like the cast and the acting. I like the use of light, an camera angles. I like the way at the end of each scary scene, it flicks through all of the images on the cursed tape very quickly (it does this 3 times throughout the movie). The suspense build-up causes fearful tension, and gives a sense of creepiness down you spine. I think this should be given a go to watch, even if horror movies scare the living daylights outta you. It's not THAT scary, it's very very well put together, and overall one of the best movies I have ever seen. Fantastic, give it a go!!!</fullReview>

Naomie Watts gives a good performance, very equal to her Japanese counter-part Nanoko Matsushima from Ringu. This is a adaption from a novel by Koji Suzuki, who wrote the novel Dark Water which is a hit Japanese and American film. Martin Henderson and David Dorfman give an outstanding performance also! There is another good performance from Donnie Darko's Deveigh Chase. This is the one best horror films I have seen.

		<fullReview>This movie scared the bujeezus out of me. That's saying a lot for someone like me, who has been watching horror movies since childhood. A lot of people may be disappointed that there is so little gore, but honestly, that is the very reason this movie is so great. This movie utilizes suspense and fear of the unknown in a way that I've never seen before. The basis of the story goes as follows: A teenage girl is found dead, huddled in her closet. The friend who was with her that night is sent to a mental health facility. No one can explain what happened to either of the girls, so the grieving mother asks her sister Rachel, a reporter, to investigate for some answers. Rachel slowly pieces together the last few days of the dead girl's life and discovers that she and her friends all watched a mysterious videotape. She finds the tape and watches it herself. The video makes little sense and is mostly a series of frightening imagery and curious music. Immediately after she is finished watching, the phone rings. The voice on the other end whispers, "Seven days." For the next seven days, Rachel is subject to horrifying visions and physical anomalies, all while trying to uncover the truth behind "the videotape that kills you when you watch it". It's a race against time to save herself and her young son from a mysterious yet certain death. The film utilizes suspense to frighten the audience. It's not immediately clear exactly what fate awaits those who've watched the tape, aside from the fact that after seven days, you will die. Visually, the movie uses subtle colors, causing the foreboding mood to nearly swallow the viewers whole. Imagery from the cursed video is reiterated throughout the movie in sometimes subtle, other times obvious ways. Fear of the unknown is the movie's weapon of choice. Gore is nearly non-existent; one of the images in the cursed video depicts a fingernail being torn from it's base, but it is shown in black and white and for less than a second. The only other time blood is used to terrify happens when a horse falls from a barge and is sucked into the spinning blades of the engine. Even this is not all that hard to watch, as all you can see is the water behind the vessel turning crimson a few moments after the horse goes under. If you are tired of the same old Texas Chainsaw Massacres and Cabin Feveresque movies, check out The Ring. Psychological terror is far more disturbing than any limb-ripping bloodfest could be. You won't be able to sleep tonight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and gloomy horror,imported(in story)from the LandoftheRisingSun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the niece of investigative reporter Rachel Keller(Naomi Watts,beautiful and intriguing as always)dies under strange circumstances related to a video cassette and her quiet,shy grad school-age son(David Dorfman)seems to know more about the situation than he should,she decides to investigate what at first seems to be an urban myth.What she uncovers is something of a dark and disturbing riddle that traces to a small island community off the coast of Washington state involving a horse stable owner(Bryan Cox),his wife and his other-worldly daughter,now both deceased. With her ex-husband (Martin Freeman)in tow,Rachel tries to stop whatever it is that's been cursing the video tape before it goes for it's next victims:namely,her ex,her son and herself. This is supposed to be a shot-for-shot American remake of the Japanese horror success Ringu,but since I've yet to see the original,I can only truly judge this film for its own merits. Director Gore Verbiski(spelling?),who would follow this late fall of 2002 hit with another pay-dirt movie in Pirates of the Caribbean,Curse of the Black Pearl,is very good about keeping the scenery and images as gray,rainy and gloomy as possible throughout much of the film(Setting it in Seattle and near Vancouver was a very deft move). This film never strays too far from the concept of imminent peril hanging over anyone unwise enough to mess with the tape. I'd suppose that my problems with this movie mostly stem from the ending,which I will not spoil to you here,only to say that it seems to not tie together the questions of the movie as it would like. In other words,it,to me,seemed to only open up more plot gaps and questions as it sewed up. I will say that might have had to do with the producers wanting to leave room for a sequel,but somehow it feels like that could've been done more cleverly than it was.Still,a good watch for someone who appreciates the more visceral side of scary,tense,compelling movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary, Mysterious, and Flawed, but Interesting and Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good scary movie if you like stuff like "The Twilight Zone" or "The Mothman Prophecies". Everyone knows the plot, as this movie has become quite famous, but i'll tell it anyway: A reporter investigates the circumstances surrounding a videotape that causes your death in seven days if you watch it.This is a very entertaining and well-made movie, but there are a few problems.1. The dialogue in the first scene has to be some of the WORST dialogue I have ever heard in a movie in my life. It is lousy, unrealistic, and just plain atrocious. Luckily along came "Scary Movie 3" to make fun of it.2. There are some parts during the movie where the dialogue is also a little weak, although not as week as the absolutely dreadful first scene.3. There are some parts where Naomi Watts' character acts so dumb that its unrealistic. I mean, the character acts really stupid for no reason. I am keeping this review absolutely spoiler-free so I won't reveal any of those moments.That's about it. Other than those problems, the movie is quite fascinating. The acting is top-notch, its interesting, there are very entertaining elements, and its just plain fun to watch. Its also one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and not get sick of (well, for a while at least). In fact, the movie is so entertaining and good that it automatically makes up for all the flaws.ALso, the directing by Gore Verbinski is outstanding. Best part of the film.I said it once and i'll say it again, if you like Twilight Zone or Mothman Prophecies or anything like that, then this is the movie for you. If not, then this is still the movie for you.Its a scary, fun, interesting, and outstanding ride.I give it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

As far as the scariness factor goes, this movie has it all. Creepy story about a dead girl's ghost seeking revenge, very disturbing special effects that make you want to crawl and hide under your blanket, split-second shock effects that will bring you close to cardiac arrest... and an overall mood that is very dark and eerie.Never mind the plot holes that some reviewers here have pointed out, this film has already become a modern classic for its unique attempt to leave the beaten path and try something not substantially new, but innovative enough.At least I'll never look the same again at white noise on a TV screen late at night.. who knows what's gonna come crawling out? ...you'll know what I mean once you've watched it.

		<fullReview>To be honest, this is the first horror movie I've ever seen in my life. But I adored it. I watched The Ring with my friend yesterday, and was shocked at the beautifully horrible sadness and despair to the whole thing. Samara's history is heart wrenching and horrible, and so surreal. Even though the story is based around something as modern as television, it has an old Gothic feel. One scene I quite liked was Samara as a pale, yet living child, about to be thrown in the well by her troubled mother, singing: "Here we go, world is spinning. When it stops, it's just the beginning. Sun comes up, we all laugh. Sun goes down, we all die..." And then she's a lank, slimy creature clotted with blood, killing everybody who is forced to know of her. See this movie at all costs, and for Gods sake, buy a DVD player. :)And now that you've read this review, you have 7 days...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally something that is actually scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of horror movies make three very common mistakes.Mistake #1: The suspenseful approach.With this approach, the filmmakers basically have a character- or characters- wander around in a decidedly "creepy" location. The location is made "creepy" by various, mysterious sounds, poor lighting, and ominous music. The ominous music and creepy sounds all slowly rise in volume until they reach a climax. We sit on the edge of our seats, waiting for something to happen. They tease us a little, having the character(s) jump at harmless shadows for a little while. Finally, the "evil thing" comes out and gets somebody.The problem with this approach, is that they're not really scaring us. By forcing us to wait so long to see "the evil thing" and by taking advantage of the natural reactions that occur in our brains when we hear certain sounds, they make us "edgy." Edginess does not constitute fear.Mistake #2: "Let's startle them." I guess some filmmakers started realizing that several viewers are now able to tell the difference between suspense and fear, so they've decided to try and startle us in the theaters. They cut the music, the lighting and the jumping at shadows. Now, they just have things pop out at us with nearly no warning.The entire audience gasps, and you might even hear a few shrieks here and there. I can almost see the filmmakers smiling triumphantly.The problem with this approach? Again, that's not fear- it's a natural human reaction to react violently at sudden, loud noises. So for a few minutes, we actually believe we are in danger, drawing us into the film- but then, soon enough the feeling vanishes.Mistake #3: They try to gross us out.This is an ages old mistake, and still hasn't been remedied. When all else fails, the filmmakers load their movie down with blood and gore.Too bad more of us aren't afflicted with hemophobia.Oh, and let's not forget the hideous, misshapen, occasionally-vomitting creatures. We turn away in horrified disgust. Of course, because I don't want to see some slimy, decaying thing ripping the head off a screaming victim I must be just terrified by your movie.That's not the only problem with that, though. It- like the first approach- has become predictable, as the more disgusting things they show us the more desensitized we become....Now you -probably- want to know what my whole point was, besides that I am immune to "fear" so incorrectly named. My point really was that one movie rose above the sea of monotony and crowned itself king in the world of horror.That movie was The Ring.The movie starts off with showing us "the film." The film itself, instead of being overly gruesome, is instead rather mysterious, disturbing, and strange. This film inadvertently causes the death of Rachel (played by Naomi Watts)'s young niece. Yet even that death was done nicely. Though we do understand something ominous is going to happen, we don't understand what or why. This gives a sense of eeriness to the film that would not have been possible otherwise. In fact, they don't even actually show the young girl's death. They skip straight to the funeral, where we're given clues of the horror of the whole thing- yet we still have no idea what's going on.A favorite author said, "There is nothing more powerful as what is left to the imagination." The Ring proves this with increasing cleverness as the film goes on. Journalistic Rachel tries to discover what happened to the young girl. The only one who witnessed her death was confined in a mental institution- but we see that later.Meanwhile, Rachel goes to the place where her niece was the week before her death, after discovering that all of her friends that had been there died in the exact moment that she did. Rachel had heard about "the film" from two acquaintances of her niece at the funeral, and decided to go to the cabin where it was located and watch it.After she watches it, she is visibly frightened. Then she receives that ominous phone call around which the film is based."You have 7 days left to live." So that is the core of the movie. Rachel tries to find out what the movie is about and what it is, at the same time trying to save her own life. Eerily, one the scenes in the movie become manifested in reality for everyday that passes. First, Rachel walks under a ladder. Next, as she's making a copy of the film for study purposes, the fly from the film becomes real. Next, nosebleeds- and it goes on and on.This is meanwhile building suspense as well as mystery, without utilizing the "characters jumping at shadows" stereotype. To our surprise, also, it starts to frighten us.Fear...that ominous pain that fills our stomachs at the thought of the unknown; that shiver in your skin. For me, it's not manifested by seeing hideous things, perhaps more suited to scaring a young child than a well-informed adult (or adolescent). For me, it is an intellectual experience. The more the fear makes sense or feels "real" the more afraid we feel inside. The Ring forces us to use our imagination again, to think beyond what we are used to experiencing. It touches the fear inside us all.In order for a movie to feel scary, it must haunt me long after the pictures have finished showing. The Ring does that excellently, by forcing us to watch the movie Rachel does before the actual movie starts. We see what she has seen, and so, we fear that what she has feared may come upon us.To this day, when a fly flies near any electronic screen- whether computer or television- I cannot suppress a shudder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Embarrassing and washed out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky to watch the original movie "Ringu" before I decided to watch this. After hearing lots of good comments about this movie, I thought it was worth a shot, and I really did give it a chance.Assuming that everyone hasn't seen the real movie Ringu, I have to point out the great difference that makes the original film a great horror flick, and this movie nothing but another American mistake.Ringu is a disturbing movie with gritty images, a dark documentary feel and almost realistic effects.The Ring is a well lit American movie, starring your regular American actors, interfering every scary moment with ugly special effects and stripping down the dark mysterious movie to another bland American remake. I can only rate this movie for what has been made, and thats just re-shooting a good movie and earning money in the process. Nothing new was added, except some pointless new scenes that had nothing to do with the original film. If you're planning on watching this movie, see the original first, so you can decide whether or not you want to spend one and a half hour feeling embarrassed watching a poor attempt of improvement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrifying masterpiece of modern horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To date, The Ring is the only film that has truly frightened me. No, it didn't frighten me, it mortified me. It petrified me. It almost made me walk out of the theater I was so scared. I haven't seen the original, but if they can make a REMAKE of a horror cult classic this good, then it must be quite the film.So basically the film is about a video tape that kills people a week after they see it. Okay, simple enough. I'm sure to many it sounds like B-horror trash, but it is horror perfection. Literally the first half hour alone had me covering my eyes I was so scared. This film is done so perfectly...the acting, the score, and don't even get me started on the images. Some of those have stuck with me to this day. The finale is great, except for that it lead the The Ring Two. Don't even get me started on the crappiness that is The Ring Two...you can read my review.Anyway, The Ring proved to be one of the scariest movies in decades, and I don't think I will ever see another film like it. DO NOT MISS IT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow this movie was so scary! I couldn't believe the difference between this one and the ring 2! I first saw the ring 2 and I thought it was OK, but this one was excellent! The story too was a lot better then the sequel. I was literally hiding behind the covers. Now that I've seen the ring, I think the ring 2 isn't very good. I wouldn't go to see the ring 2, the ring is so good it explains everything. The story is about a 16 year old girl who dies mysteriously after seeing a tape. There are rumors about the tape, if you watch it you'll die after 7 days. All of the girls friends who watched die too. The girls mother asks Rachel Keller a reporter and family member to investigate her daughters death. Rachel watches the tape and gets more and more convinced the tape really kills people after watching the tape. Rachel has to race against the time to prevent herself, her child and her ex from dying!Any way I would really recommend watching this movies, it's really good and you'll really be creaped out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film quite odd. Horror movies are actually meant to make you scared, nervous, that sort of thing. This just didn't do it for me. Sure, the beginning and conclusion were great to watch, but not scary. The suspense at the beginning was well performed though, however, the movie is too predictable, typical horror film really. It also has a very strange storyline, and very unrealistic. I mean, if you watch a video tape, 7 days later a girl comes out your television and kills you, yeah, like that would ever happen in real life. Other horror films are more realistic, even if they're not scary (eg Scream, not so scary but you could be brutally murdered by a serial killer, can't you?) I give this a 5 out of 10, nice to watch, but not scary enough.</fullReview>

I enjoyed working out the puzzles, &amp; Glues to unlocking the ring, and it fits together really well, great performances, esp from Naomi Watts, One of the best of her career, also 1 of her Best movies No Doubt about it.Martin Henderson plays her EX-boyfriend, helping to unlock the evilness that surrounds the ring, and also save their son, from the evilness that will kill them if they don't find out the answer to the ring in 7 days. if your wondering what the ring is, It's a video tape, and only if you watch it, the movie will haunt you and kill you in 7 days, but Naomi Watts will try and break the haunting secrets surrounding it! but will she succeed, It started like "Just another Urban Legend" but is it?

This has to be the best horror movie I've ever seen. It was scary, believable, and very well written, it was not boring in any way and didn't leave out any details. As the movie goes along, it's just like a confusing puzzle, and as it moves closer to the end, everything begins to fall into place for you, and it's fantastic how Verbinski can do it with such power. Chase's performance is breath-taking, and it angers me how they replaced her in the sequel. This is an excellent movie for all horror fans and makes an excellent edition to any horror collection.

		<shortDescription>The best horror movie ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best horror movie of all time. I mean there's something very hair raising about a little girl who walks limping toward you. I don't mean this in a ironic way. That girl put me under the blanket many times. And that happened when I wasn't watching the movie. I saw the movie 9 times and I know it like I know my pockets. I am very found of horror movies and then, in 2002, there wasn't any good horror movie on the market. I hate monster horror movies like vampire movies or other mystical creature movie. I heard of The Ring and I said: "Lets see what they can do now!". I took 2 friends and started the movie. From the first scene, there is not one minute when you can rest and not being in constant fear that something bad will happen, and that's great. That's how a horror movie should be. Naomi Watts is excellent (actress and woman), she gives you the filling that she's doing this to save you, because you saw the tape to and in the same time as she. David Dorfman...made my eyes leak when he said "mummy, she never sleeps!"; so an A+ for David. Brian Cox brings the mystery surrounding Samara. Daveigh Chase (my favorite U15 actress) makes this a very spooky movie. Whenever she appears the screen, my skin goes crazy. She's so spooky and scary that no one can stay undistracted. All the actors are excellent even if I don't mention them because this is a comment and not the story of the movie.Oh, I almost forgot about Mr. Gore Verbinski. He is one of the best directors in Hollywood. Thankyou very much Mr. Verbinski for what you've done with an overused Japanese myth.Thankyou DreamWorks! Keep it up!</fullReview>

OK, so I don't exactly know how the little girl projected herself onto tape. but does that really matter? the rules are set up in the beginning and for the most part the story sticks to them. ie, you watch a tape. get a phone call. in 7 days your dead. deal with it. the little boy was perfectly cast and the lead actress does a fine job in a role where she could've went over the top. I haven't seen the sequel yet, but I'm hoping it's as half as good as this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gore Verbinski never lets 'The Ring' breathe on its own like Hideo Nakata did with the original, which leaves the film floundering in a well of largely wasted potential...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring Rachel Keller (a decent Naomi Watts) is a reporter who, while working on an article about an urban legend involving a videotape that kills whomever watches it, starts to investigate the unexplained sudden death of her niece, Katie (Amber Tamblyn). Rachel is understandably reluctant to buy into the rumour, and as soon as she finds the tape down at a holiday cabin where Katie and her friends stayed a week before they all died, she watches it without hesitation. But then the phone rings, and Rachel discovers just how much truth there is behind the talk after all. Now, she has just seven days to live, and with the help of her ex-husband, Noah (Martin Henderson, acting far too cocky), Rachel must delve deep into the mysterious origins of the tape, before it threatens to destroy her.Considering how many previous incarnations of Kji Suzuki's 'Ring' universe there are, it's quite surprising that America didn't try to pull off their own adaptation of this story earlier. The very first part of this saga was originally brought to the big screen in 1998's 'Ring'. Directed by then-unknown Japanese filmmaker Hideo Nakata, 'Ring' was a masterpiece of the horror genre, and its runaway box office success helped to set a trend for the dozens of slow-burning thrillers to come out of Asia in the last few years, including its own remake from Korea ('Ring Virus'). So, with the benefit of hindsight, Hollywood producers have also cleverly chosen to translate Nakata's take on 'Ring' for native multiplex audiences. Their choice of director, however, is not as sharp, as they have recruited Gore Verbinski to replicate Nakata's subtle hand. But, as the presence of 'Mousehunt' on his filmography shows, "subtle" is not a word that first comes to mind when thinking about this inexperienced filmmaker.Verbinski, a former director of music videos and commercials (I'll refrain from using the word "hack"), is by no means a complete lost cause in the world of 'The Ring'. Armed with tens of millions of dollars, Verbinski is free to design the film's visual and sound schemes with impressive precision, even more so than Nakata did with the original. Every frame of this film has something to keep itself moving along, with the omnipresent greyish green tones adding an interesting flare to the opening sequence. But they remain on the screen throughout the whole running time, and only serve to distract the audience from Rachel's Nancy Drew-style investigations in and around dreary Seattle. There's also some unneeded editing tricks (such as brief flashes of "the ring" between scenes) that really do recall Verbinski's music video past, and, disappointingly, a couple of equally cheap "boo" moments, which siphon off much of the tension and pace that 'The Ring' should have been made of, and that the original had in spades. Granted, Nakata could easily be accused of some of these tactics, but at least he used them in all the right places. Verbinski never lets 'The Ring' breathe on its own like Nakata did, which leaves the film floundering in a well of largely wasted potential.Even worse, some parts of the film are touched up with expensive special effects in place of the grimy, practical realness of the original. It's never a good thing when CGI draws attention to itself, particularly during the film's climax, which was so unrelentingly terrifying in the original, but here feels forcibly rushed and artificial. In fact, everything about 'The Ring' is far too dressed up with Hollywood production values, when simplicity was the key to making the first 'Ring' so unsettling. Call me a purist of the original if you must, but whose idea was it to give 'The Ring' to a man whose only truly inventive moment was when he created the Budweiser frogs? The script, by Ehren Kruger ('Scream 3'), shows as much promise, but this goes down the drain with the direction. Kruger elects to completely revise the background of Sadako (renamed Samara for this remake), and I welcomed these tweaks, as they would keep the unfolding mystery interesting even for those who already knew how things would turn out. The downside comes when Kruger feels the need to explain everything, from what the film's title means, to why the tape waits seven days to kill. There are even some small lines of "comic" relief present in 'The Ring', which seem entirely out of place considering the mood the film is trying to muster. Kruger is far too concerned with catering to western audiences, and never takes that crucial step away from the genre rules to really make a mark.I'm tempted to applaud the makers of 'The Ring' for not dumbing down the material too much, and preserving just a little of the original's integrity. But on the other hand, I'm also annoyed that the sheer creepiness and ambiguity of Hideo Nakata's film has been watered down so much for easier consumption. 'The Ring' was an apt opportunity to blend the potency of the original with Western horror traditions, but Verbinski and Kruger just aren't up to the task, and this remake has ended up as what the original never once was: a mess. If producers ever decide to create a sequel (the twist ending has been retained), hiring a director and writer with some genuine prowess in horror film-making would be much desired.~ 6/10 ~</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, let me tell you guys who have NOT seen The Ring, don't even think to go and see The Ring Two. No this is not a negative message, it is just a friendly advise that you might lose the opportunity to enjoy the first installment to its fullest pleasure.First of all, if you are looking for a gory type of horror movie, this is not it and i would recommend picking up House on Haunted Hills or any of the Jason Vorhees franchise (except for Jason X because it sucked).I'll just cut my self right to the point here. You have to stay and be patient to the end of the movie to actually get freaked out. I'd have to say that during the whole investigation shindigs, i was about to be bored out my mind thinking "Great, not another one of those M Night Shyamalan's Oooo here comes the twist or Six Sense wannabe". The ending of the movie is actually the real core of the story.I'm not going to tell you guys anything else if you haven't seen it. Yo just need to see the ending to appreciate the whole movie.

		<fullReview>Morose color schemes, oddball characters and lots of rain apparently make a popular and successful film. While the Ring is an interesting view (once) if you look too closely at this film you'll realize that it's a huge pile of codswhallop that will never add up no matter how much you force it. Let's disassemble...A girl is born to a stray woman but possessed with the soul of a vengeful spirit in need of love and a mother but never in need of sleep. The child is named Samara and adopted by horse breeders Mr. and Mrs. Morgan. But because Samara is cursed with freakyness the horses go crazy and commit suicide while others fail to breed. As punishment for being this way the Morgans trap her in a big attic in a barn. Not content with this they smack her on the back of the head with a rock and chuck her down a well. Their suicides soon follow.Many years later Samara, using her freaky powers at the bottom of the well, somehow brings into existence a video tape featuring a freaky student film of imagery of her freaky life. Anyone who watches this tape dies 7 days later. Which doesn't make sense either as the first person who watched it wouldn't know they were going to die. And neither would the second. So how the urban legend surrounding it got started is a mystery. And why 7 days? Why not right away? Does she want the tape to be deciphered and to be found? A journalist called Rachel investigates the tape, luckily making a copy-ridding herself of the 7-day curse and unravels Samara's freaky life. Her body is found and laid to rest properly. BUT THIS IS A BAD THING! Somehow. It's never really explained why it is but other than the uttering of cryptic dialogue such as 'You let the dead get in'.But bad things don't really happen after this anyway, other than more people watching the video tape. And then everything's okay right? We might as well fade out now...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confirming what we all knew - VHS is evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring follows the story of a journalist ,who, while investigating the death of her niece stumbles across a cursed video which kills its viewers in seven days.The Ring is based on a series of Japanese books which in turn were translated to film in Hideo Nakata's original film "Ring". Sometimes its impossible to talk about either film - the Japanese version or the US remake without comparing them such is the division of opinion. Taking The Ring on its own merits though it is a chilling and seriously creepy film.However if you have watched the Japanese version then some parts of the Ring will frustrate you. Such as the insistence US film makers have you holding your hand and explaining everything to you every step of the way. What ever happened to less is more? A big reason why Ring was so scary is that you knew next to nothing about the female apparition Sadako and this lent her an air of mystery. Here in The Ring we see her as a little girl sitting up and talking in bed. Not very scary. Also the main part - the video itself is just too well done in the US Ring. It looks more like a student art house film then a manifestation of evil. The Japanese version was darker, dirtier and plain freakier. As was the music.Don't get me wrong. The US Ring is still a fantastic horror film which improves on the Japanese version is some areas - just not overall. because of that its kind of impossible to say which was actually better. I personally prefer the original for the reasons I listed, but each to their own.After promising myself I wouldn't spend this comment comparing the two its obvious I need to go punish myself in some way. Perhaps I'll rent Halloween 3 again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very well executed remake it took on its own visual style which was completely different from the Ringu series. It was atmospheric and quite chilling in its various scenes especially in one of the first scenes where the dead girl is shown in the cupboard all rotted. It is up there along with the Shining as a good horror film there are not many about for example 'cabin fever' this film was so bad it was hilarious but I think it was supposed to be though. if you haven't seen it rush out and rent borrow or buy it, it is well worth it just for the wee evil girl climbing out of a well and walking jitterly up to the TV screen then coming straight at you I also liked what lies beneath</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler free, no specific actions or character details givenThe Ring will entertain you fully and you will have no unanswered questions if you accept anything that is thrown at you and never stop to ponder even the simplest details.Okay, there's a videotape that kills people after they watch it. A little girl is involved. We know that, but there's unanswered questions. Well, the movie does give you answers, which are satisfying as long as you don't ask a single follow-up question. If I want to know why some angry kid went on a shooting spree at school, the local news will give me the answers why. Instead, "The Ring" IS that troubled kid. For any question I ask, be it "how did this happen?" or "why?", the answer is a basic, uninspired "uhh, because". He may even give me an answer that he thinks makes perfect sense such as "I want to kill people so I got a gun and did". And of course, if that's all you ever heard of the case, and no other explanation were given for the series of questions that would follow, you'd be completely satisfied, right? Well, not for most people, but then here you have the Ring which pulls that crap with almost every important question you'd have. Yes, you learn how this video kills people, as demonstrated in one of the two "big reveals" of the film that is so powerful and scary that I think "Oh," and shrug. The other big reveal a is red herring near the end that's just a bit of dialog - basically "Uh oh, what we thought was the case really isn't, and now it's actually worse!" The film ruins this too, giving no explanation, reasoning or motive whatsoever for what was just explained. Savin' it for the sequel I guess.The end made me realize that, more than anything, I could have summed up this film in one sentence and saved myself a lot of time and letdown. Yes there's a little girl, a well, and a mysterious video that kills people. But why, how, and what do they all have to do with each other? Well, the big "why" is revealed without much more than "well, uh, because". "How" isn't answered at all- not in any logical, explainable way unless you just accept the very silly and ostensibly MEGA CHILLING super payoff that I think I was supposed to have seen. Of course, after seeing what I saw, I'd still like to know "how" that event, upon which this movie's very premise hangs, is possible. No explanation attempted. You just buy it, 'cuz it makes the story super neato, you know?As for "what do they all have to do with each other?" Well, the movie goes on for an eternity trying to make this the big mystery. In fact, if I gave you the answers to what happens, then went into detail of how this is visually represented, you'd probably think there'd have to be SOMETHING more going on, and probably say "oh, that's what happens? How? Why? (there's those troublesome words again).Nope, there ain't much of a story here. It's a concept that, when stripped down, comes down to a special effect, one that has different motives than what we were led to believe. Huh, pretty powerful I guess, or so I'm supposed to think based on the Sixth Sense "slowly zoom in on the character as they reveal the 'big twist'" shot. I mean, sure I know that the movie's last ten minutes are supposed to be pretty profound and I'm not supposed to question it. I suppose it's just the natural learner in me that says "Gee, now I know the big secret. The video kills people by doing what I just saw. What again is the motive for this, how again does it work through a plastic videotape, and why does it take 100 minutes of buildup for the basic or nonexistent answers I received? Huh, what? Distract me with the end credits and release a couple answers on a special edition DVD released in time for the sequel? Sure, sounds great.To make matters worse, no one in the movie is appealing. The protagonist is a pest and a (expletive). In addition to other annoyances, she's rude enough to walk up to someone's horse, let it out of its cage, and watch its resultant gory death as its little girl owner cries in horror, all without a word of apology or explanation. I can also ponder credibility leaps like how she can be holding a dessicated corpse while up to her waist in putrid water and not think too much of it.Of course I'll get a personal message ridiculing my stupidity. How dare I try to find logic in a film that, as a horror film, shouldn't apply to logic? It's simple. I got the film, got the message. But you know, after two hours and all that praise, I expected a better ending than that, or at least some explanation beyond "it's just magical. Accept it." Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a horror film too, but Leatherface didn't kill people by popping out of a tree and making his chainsaw hover at his victims. If a movie isn't going to bother being realistic, it should at least give a better explanation than this film did.But hey, this movie is the perfect conformist's exercise. Everyone else loves it, so surely I must be stupid if I don't. I guess I need to just watch it and accept it, not asking any questions or pointing out flaws in the story since that's clearly what everyone else has done. Then once I'm done with that I can go and love Blair Witch instead of actually wondering what it was on the screen that I was supposed to be terrified of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior to Ringu on every level - A disgrace to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am amazed that nobody has posted a thread saying one bad word against this film. If you want to appreciate the remake of a film, see the original first. As with music, if you are going to remake or remix something, you must add something to it that gives it a different style but still appeals to people that liked the original. As far as i can see, this remake has failed to do this by a mile, and furthermore, is an insult to the effort of the craft and collaboration between Koji Suzuki and Hideo Nakata that went into making the original a genuinely original and revolutionary horror film.The plot is so much more unnecessarily complicated than the original. Half of the original plot twists from the original, and even aspects of the narrative, are removed and replaced with totally convoluted and unbelievable ones. What was all this business about the barn that Samara allegedly stayed in? What was all the excess nonsense about the lighthouse? What was all that confusing and unnecessary crap about mother in the papers and hospital records that ultimately leads to nothing? We find out that Samara was killed by her mother. Not only was this contrary to the father performing the act in the original, but also we never know why. Fair enough, you do not know why in the original unless you see Ring 0 but in the original, Dr Ikuma was not given anywhere enough attention for the viewer to actually worry about not knowing. In comparison, the remake focuses a lot on revealing about the past of Samara's mother, but does not give any hint as to why should would have any motive for killing her daughter. This leaves the viewer frustrated and confused. I agree that the unexplained is frightening, but this has to be taken to a lesser degree when concerning the fate of pivotal characters. Clearly, the director has not paid any attention to these problems and this puts a stain on the genius of the original, which found the perfect balance.The character's were far less believable in this version, and is a further insult to the believability of the original. None of the leads were particularly outstanding. The innocence of Yoichi in the original, with sensible dialogue to convey his emotion and confusion of being wrapped up in the essence of the tape's curse, is replaced in the remake by a bad-mouthed, precocious little brat that contributes nothing to the film either in terms of the constant eerie aura that sweeps through the film that Nakata masterfully conveys, nor the sympathy you extend to Yoichi, again through the lack of believable dialogue, which makes him sound like a spoilt little runt, rather than an innocent caught up in the curse. Because of this, the very child's presence in this remake irritated me and I had no concern for his feelings in the film, what little there were of them (which were unconvincingly portrayed anyhow), which ultimately further lacks the constant mix of horror and anxiety that every character in Ring represents to the viewer. Yet again, such flaws are insult to the sure-handiness of the original.There are characters that are introduced, turns in the plot, and objects, which are left unresolved. For example, the friend of the first victim from the beginning of the film does not appear in the original. We are given the feeling of her importance to the film and yet by the end we do not know of, nor care, for her fate. It gives the impression that her role in the film was merely a red herring device to confuse the audience, as if by two thirds of the way through we are not confused enough already. You are left asking the question 'Why?' with a sense of immense frustration rather than anxious pleasure.Finally, we are plagued with CGI to convey horror. A big reason that Hideo Nakata's original was so appealing was that it was simplistic in its conveyance of terror, and therefore terrifyingly effective. I am referring to Ringu's ending, whereby we are greeted with the chilling realisation of Sadako's wrath. In the original, this scene was so successful because a real human being crawled from the TV set, thereby conveying the horror of the most unbelievable thing in most realistic way possible. You can't help but feel cheated when CGI is used. This is a clear case of where the more advanced most certainly does not equate to the most effective. The director has gone so far in making Samara unreal, that there is no physically real aspect to her at all ? instead, she is some kind of digital ghost without any real presence. Adding flickers to the edge of her character as if a flickering TV screen unfortunately clearly shows where the film's priorities lie. As such, I felt little fear in comparison to the total body muscular tension I experienced in the scene from the original Ringu.Overall, this film has failed on every level compared to Ringu. Rather than honouring Ringu's history with a modern horror in the spirit of Japanese film making while adding more, it has instead tarnished it with unnecessary, unbelievable, and incomplete plot twists and characters that typically reflect the abuse of a comparatively massive Hollywood budget.It is sad that the genius of the original will always be associated with this. I can only hope that Japanese cinema gets the credit it deserves so that more people will be more likely and more inclined to see the original foreign version of a film first. Until then, when the word Ring appears in film-talk, this inferior remake will be the first that comes to mind and the brilliance of the superior original will be overlooked. A shame. A real shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this Movie worked for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring is a chilling, disturbing, story of a long dead girl whose evil curse lingers in the form of a chilling tape that kills you in seven days if you watch it. The plot isn't particularly realistic of course and there are some plot holes. However this movie is less about the actual race against time that the main characters have to solve the mystery of this tape before their time runs out and more about using their story to provide for extremely effective atmosphere and chills.The "shock scenes" are so effective because unlike in "slasher" films, it is easy to predict where and when the scares are coming from. For example, the music races and the killer is in the house...wait for it.... Not The Ring, with several exceptions, the tone and pace for the movie is methodical and beauitfully calm, it almost lulls you into this creepy world and then BAM! the horrifying girl dead in the closet. You are completely unaware up until the second before it happens.If I may get back to the atmosphere the movie provides, although the shock scenes can surely make certain your popcorn ends up on your date's lap, the atmosphere wraps itself around you and this is the stuff the makes you unplug your TV before you go to bed. It is subtle and does require concentration when watching it- you can't be more concerned with trying to cop a feel with Susie Cheerleader than the movie, however if you are able to get into it, and it shouldn't be hard, you become trapped in the chilling world of The Ring and ultimately feel like it is you that is racing against the clock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far From Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lots of people had been hyping this and I was excited and anxious to rent it to see what all of the fuss was about and when I finally got to rent it (this was one or two years ago, I believe) I was expecting The Exorcist level of scary because that's what lots of people I knew had been hyping it to be.Wow, I sure was surprised! I found it far from scary! It's OK/decent movie wise but as far as horror movies go I think I'd rank this more as mystery but I didn't find it scary one bit.Maybe it's because I had seen the commercials for Scary Movie 3 parodying it...I dunno but I didn't find it scary one bit.I think it'll be awhile before we see an actual scary (good) horror movie (an original one too...not an imported remake from Asia or a crappy remake that butchers an original from the 1970s!) Though, maybe I'm pushing a bit...a horror movie that's actually scary and good would be real nice. (For a change!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never underestimate the ability of the most boring, to just plain bad, films to become big franchises. Now, I've seen 'Ringu', 'Ringu 2', 'Ring 0', and 'Rasen', and the only one I thought to be worthwhile was 'Ring 0: Basudei'. The others ranged from boring to just plain silly (I'm thinking 'Rasen' in particular here). I was apprehensive in watching 'The Ring', and thinking about how most remakes seem doomed to failure, what could 'The Ring' offer in entertainment value? In the end, it wasn't that bad. Of course, it wasn't that good either. It ended up being an amalgamation of 'Ringu', 'Ringu 2', with various Hitchcock moments thrown in and a sub-plot about horses thrown in, which leads me to: THE HORSES! WON'T SOMEONE PLEASE THINK OF THE HORSES. I'm sorry, I just couldn't resist.So, apart from the sub-plot about the horses, 'The Ring' is just another journalist investigating a cursed tape. I can't think of any other movie series that involves a cursed tape, so originality points would go there if there hadn't been five different versions of 'Ring' in Japan already. If I wanted to curse everyone with a tape, I'd just project onto the large-screens you see in city centres, allowing for maximum curse-age.Apart from the lack of any scares for most of the movie, my biggest problem with 'The Ring' was the character of Aidan. You know who he reminds me of? The kid from 'The Sixth Sense', and a bunch of other kids just like that kid. I really hate any movie-kid like Aidan. I would gladly trade him for Homer Simpson's talking-pie or killer robot driving instructor who travels back in time for some reason, if only there were no more kids with super-natural powers, or kids who seem to know everything about the occult.'The Ring' isn't that scary - it didn't even improve on 'Ringu', which wasn't very frightening either - and ended up disappointing and boring - 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sophisticated cousin of a large family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I saw The Ring. I stayed at my friends house, drinking coffee in her kitchen and talking about the movie, until 2am. I went home and slept with the light on. My curiosity, however, was piqued. My friend and I then rented Ring and Ring 2 to see how the Japanese versions stacked up. We watched them in her lounge room, alone, with the lights turned off, yet neither movie elicited in either of us the same response as the American version. To my, perhaps overly westernised view, each contained only one truly scary scene, in the first, the 'Sadako leaves the TV' scene, and in the second a scene where Anna appears as an oblivious ghost, but then turns around and looks at the main character.I then read all the information I could find on the net, and then one day in Borders I saw the book had finally been translated and published here. It was a great read, very different from the movies, and, apart from being incredibly sexist (all the women in it are either evil or insipid, the Rachel Character is, of course, a man) one of the best contemporary stories I have ever read.However, it opened my eyes to a plot hole I had ignored in the movies, which is; if Sadako/Samara wants everyone to know her pain and spread it like a sickness, why would she not SAY SO? In the book, the video is like a chain letter, featuring a "If you do not pass this on within 7 days, you will die" type warning, however, that part has been taped over by the teenagers as a prank. Apart from that, and the odd inclusion of horses, and the fact that the DVD has a trailer of Catch Me If You Can as a Special Feature, it is a very scary, well done movie with brilliant sound and lighting, and a breath-takingly chilling performance by Daveigh Chase. Some of the story changes, such as Samara's mother being the one who put her in the well, and of Samara being killed when she was still a child, were good choices for this film. Someone said here that the end is a disappointing sequel chaser, which is missing the whole point of any of the movies, and certainly of the original story- which was that "it won't stop". It will spread throughout the world like a virus, replicating a re-replicating itself until everyone has experienced the horror of Sadako.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FINALLY!! Brilliant and dark!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when I thought that the talent for "seeing" horror had died with Stanley Kubrick along comes Gore Verbinski and brings it back to refreshing life! At first I was skeptical about the teen element being involved (usually a cymbal crashing cue for long holds on tight shirts, tons of unnecessary screaming--not to mention screaming while "running" in high heels, and the most unabashed use of one-liners dredged up from every horror flick since the 70's), but thankfully that wasn't the case at all. The Ring was a truly edgy experience! The sound effects alone had me twitching, and I LOVED the puzzle of the video, its solution, and of course Samara's special effects most of all. The cinematography also gets an A+, beautiful work!As far as the acting, Brian Cox was OUTSTANDING (as usual); Naomi Watts was really believable (especially as an angry/frazzled single mom); Martin Henderson was INCREDIBLY hot.Now I realize that the only reason this film exists at all is because of the Japanese original (and of course the book) but what I don't understand is how anybody even thought that the original was "scary/terrifying/astonishing/blah blahblah". There weren't any special effects except for those annoying close ups and the screen changing colors (which is sooooo late 60's Hammer I can't even begin to go there). Sudako's "death face" had me on the floor laughing every time. If I'm watching a horror movie that is supposed to be legendary for scares, then I want to be scared; If I want to be stupidly amused I'll watch Freddy, Jason and Michael. I LOVE films that have plots that make you think and Japan has a ton of them, especially in horror, they're just not directed in a way that I find terrifying. Now the Japanese manga (comic books) based on The Ring series, THOSE are scary.The American version of The Ring is creepy as hell, and far above its original source.</fullReview>

Much scarier, atmospheric, and interesting for me. The Ring has been a success in the US, and people keep saying, "It was so scary!", and "How did they come up with such a great idea?". In reality, the people at Dreamworks had no idea where to get a new idea for a movie, so they ripped off an excellent Japense smash hit and repeated the success. Unfairly, in my opinion. People should remember the original film, because the story, atmosphere, and tension was ten times greater than this crap. 2/10 :)</fullReview>

Very good storyline, creepy little girl (they always freak me out), incredible Naomi Watts but not scary. Except one or two scenes near the end nothing else made me scared. But that is just me!

		<fullReview>One of the few PG-13 flicks that actually managed to get under my skin! Adapted from Koji Suzuki's novel, a female reporter investigates the origins of a tape that supposedly kills you one week after watching it after her niece is the last supposed victim of the tape's deadly curse. This one is way better than its Japanese original, "Ringu", of which it was a remake of. For one thing, it's pace isn't as deathly boring and Verbinski directs the movie with more visual flair than his Japanese counterpart. There are some truly scary "jump moments" thrown in here and there that caught me completely off guard and the imagery in this film is top notch. The killer tape in this one actually IS unsettling, unlike the one in "Ringu", and Samara is 10 times scarier than her Japanese alter-ego Sadako. It's best to think of this as a supernatural detective story and I enjoyed not being able to predict where the movie was going, I was along for the whole ride, right down to terrific "twist" ending that is only one of few in recent memory that I didn't manage to see coming a mile away. An oppressed, dreadful and genuinely creepy atmosphere prevails throughout and is possibly the film's strongest asset...this one will get under your skin. Naomi Watts is excellent as well as everyone else involved in this. Often suffers from corniness however and the plot hits it's ups and downs along the way, but there is enough here to make up for it. Watch it...and be prepared to move the TV out of your bedroom before going to sleep at night!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring - New Definition of Horror (Minor Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you want to see a horror movie filled with gore, blood, sex, and swearing!? Well ... don't watch this movie. This movie amazed me because of it's originality. While other movies are coming out like "Freddy vs. Jason" and "Jeepers Creepers" which are partially scary only because of their gore content, "The Ring" probably took a risk by coming out in the midst of these movies. The basis of the movie revolves around an urban legend about a video tape that kills you seven days after you watch it. The video is a mix of horrifying clips of various things -- a woman jumping off of a cliff, a nail through the finger, dead animals -- and as soon as the video ends you get a mysterious phone call. "Seven days," the person says at the other end, and soon enough, at the end of the seventh day, you unexplainably die. A newspaper reporter's niece suddenly dies and rumors are going around it's because of this "killer video tape". She tries to unravel this mystery and ends up watching the tape herself. She tries to figure out how to undo the video tape's "curse". As the movie goes along there are very scary parts, and overall the movie has a spooky feel to it. 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's minute after ponderous minute, stretching into hours, followed by perhaps 3 to 5 minutes of true creepiness near the very end. And I do mean creepy. But that's a long wait for the few minutes you get out of it. Lots of plot holes you can fly a Boeing through, lots of things set up and then never resolved or even slightly explained, heavy on unexplained symbolism...The list goes on and on. In the end, I was bored and confused, and one creepy scene just isn't enough to justify the string of clichs and 'atmosphere' you have to sit through. I'm glad I rented it because I'd have been highly annoyed to have shelled out the full price of a theater ticket for this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know how to write a story, craft a tale, create images and immerse people into other worlds. I know the beats, cadences and standards of storytelling, and while I haven't written a 'scary story' I'm familiar with the process. Further, I have studied fear from both a psychological aspect and a mythological aspect.I watched this movie on cable, over a year after its release, in the fullness of the afternoon sunshine streaming into my eleventh floor, three bedroom apartment.And I was scared.This was a brilliant film, so brilliant in its terror inducing imagery and story that I would recommend anyone with an overactive imagination or a low-tolerance for fear, avoid this movie at all costs. It's that good.Technically speaking (directing, acting, scripting, cinematography, lighting, score, et al) the film is highly proficient in all areas. There may have been flaws, but none that I observed on first viewing. In that regard, you could do much less rewarding things instead of sitting down and watching this movie. It was engaging, enthralling and unabashedly creepy.Be aware as I repeat myself: If disturbing imagery or scary tales are too much for you to handle DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. There is very little in the way of gore, and the mortality rate is low for this genre. But the movie is definitely going to make a lot of people's skin crawl.ESPECIALLY when they watch it at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classy horror film!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while you come across films that leave a lasting imprint on your mind. 'The Ring' is most certainly one of these films that have started a new trend in horror movies! It almost makes it into the category of 'The Exorcist'. I did not move from start to the end just to find out what or who was killing the people who watched the video...and along the way I was taken on a roller coaster ride with many twists and turns in the story. And I can tell you honestly that when that moment arrived---the final scene---I was quite disturbed and terrified for a few hours after that!! However, at the end of the movie there were a few questions unanswered....I hope they are answered in the sequel due in 2005. After reading the other comments, it seems almost mandatory to watch the original Japanese version....but at least this time round I will know whats coming!!! If I was to rate this movie....it would be a perfect score just for its imagination and genuine horror!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're like me and are scared by thrillers other than slasher-movies than this one's for you. Scariest movie based around the television since Poltergeist. The movie left some questions unanswered but I guess that helps set up a sequel which I see is coming out Spring of 2005. There's a lot of detail to the story-line so it might help to watch a couple of times to follow every detail. The extra footage on the DVD was confusing to watch right after the movie, think of it as deleted scenes and alternate endings. The characters are likable. The scenery is fun. There's a twist towards the end of the movie that wasn't expected. The effects are good. Good movie to watch with the lights out, even though I did not!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never seen the ORIGINAL of this film. I never even knew it was a REMAKE. People I know that have seen this rendition of this film kept telling me how good and quite scary this is.... So , I rented it and was very enthralled in it. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. I'll say it is fairly good , decently interesting and much different than anything I have ever seen. The only thing that I did not care for in this was the ending , I was quite disappointed in that. But this has some spooky parts and for that - and the story itself , I liked this. I mean , just think of this film as a realistic happening - in that aspect - this is quite scary... But you know - there is a lot more SCIFI here than spook.I like HORROR better than SCIFI - but I still enjoyed this. Pretty kool.... :) PEACE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It amazes me that movies like these get critically acclaimed. This movie was so freakin' stupid!! I don't even know why I'm commenting on this movie a year and a half after I seen it. Anyway, I had heard about all the buzz this movie was getting so I said "Hey, let me try it out." So I watched it, and I was utterly disappointed. The plot is soooo stupid. POSSIBLE SPOILERS. You watch a videotape and seven days later you die. What the heck! I know this film is a remake of a Japanese film, but couldn't they have come up with something more original than that? It surprises me that this movie received good reviews but "Freddy vs. Jason" gets critically panned. That premise was way more interesting and thought provoking as this. I hope people will see this film for the uber-trash it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>odd movie, though I really like the dark mood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can honestly say that -- even though I could understand the plot -- I was still utterly confused. The mood was set very well and the lighting helped a great deal.The acting, all around, was very well. Naomi Watts does very well in her part even when the movie is at it's creepiest. The rest of the cast is equally good in the movie. The story is great.....Like I said, even though I could understand it, I was still confused around the end. There probably is no reason to be confused when the plot is all layed out. But I could not help being confused. Go figure. Onto the video. It was very cool, very creepy, very strange.....I loved it. Some many different things are comprised into one video, and it works very well. I was expecting to get a call right after viewing the video.The Ring is one of the few movies that really doesn't feel like a movie at all. It feels like real life. None of the camera angles, tricks, and lighting, have been used too much before. And all of these really set a true-to-life feel for The Ring. the DVD features are strange in that you can't jump to a scene. the whole movie is just one long scene. The strange semi-featurette is well...strange. Showing a couple of deleted/extended scenes and some more of the video. That is pretty much it for features, but it really just fits along with the movie. If you love good, creepy, thriller movies, you will love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched The Ring two years ago and it still gives me the creeps. I loved it though. It was a great movie for wanting to be scared to death. It worked on my dad who is never seeming to be afraid of anything. I'm afraid to be in a room by myself, like I am right now. The Ring rocks. Samara rocks, although she scares the living crap out of me. Now, every night, I have to sleep with the door open. My friends think I'm crazy doing that and I'm like, "what if something really does happen and I need to get out quickly?" very very scary. I wouldn't recommend it for people younger than 12 because, well duh, its PG-13, but my little bro, who is 5 saw it, and he has had nightmares since. He actually drew 8 pictures of Samara last night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It just wasn't all it should have been (***SPOILERS***)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to a good many people, The Ring is one of the best horror movies ever made. I haven't seen a lot of horror movies, but I don't see how that could possibly be good news for the genre. My chief complaint with the movie is that it left far too many plot holes. I appreciate the thought-provoking open-endedness of REALLY GOOD FILMS, but when I find myself trying to stuff the cracks in the script as the credits are rolling, I think there's something wrong. Here are some, but not all, of the questions that should have been answered (spoilers):1. What did the images in the video actually represent, other than as a means to let Rachel find out the story? Why was Anna brushing her hair in the mirror? Why the lighthouse? Why the bugs? I understand the hair theme and the water theme, but doesn't that seem to be st-re-tch-ing things a bit far?2. How did Aidan know what was going to happen to his cousin? At the beginning of the movie, he was drawing pictures that predicted it. Shouldn't he just have been an innocent little kid at that point? And how did he find out all about Samara in order to make his smart little comments at the end of the film? Surely Rachel didn't tell him? Incidentally, another complaint I have is that the climax was far too weak. I completely missed the fact that it WAS the climax (when Samara kills Noah). In fact, I was sure that Aidan WAS Samara and that THAT was how the movie would end. That would have given the scriptwriters a chance to explain some things that they left out.3. Why did Anna go crazy? Because the horses went crazy? Why did THEY go crazy???? This was never even TOUCHED upon. I don't even see why there were horses in the movie at all, except as some sort of filler, and there's nothing I hate more than a movie that has to resort to fillers.4. What was Richard Morgan's role in the movie? Anna killed Samara, they were kind enough to show us that, but then why did Richard act like HE was responsible? Why did he kill himself?5. How did Samara make the video? Why a video at all, for that matter? To give this movie some sort of PLOT? Couldn't somebody somewhere have come up with SOME explanation before they starting shooting?6. Who was Becca? She was with Katie when she died, but there's no explanation for what happens to her afterward and why she ends up in a psych ward. She knew what would happen. Was SHE somehow Samara? They had the same color hair. I've already suggested how Aidan could have become Samara, but they couldn't both have been. And if Becca WAS Samara, why wasn't that pointed out cohesively in the movie? And if she was, that opens up the plot to even MORE holes than it had without that explanation. They're pretty self-evident, so I won't point them out.7. Conceivably, every single other one of my questions could be left to the viewer's imagination to figure out, but there is one (at least, that I'VE thought of) gigantic glaring plot hole that simply can't be overlooked: Where did the tape of Samara in the psychiatrist's office come from? Not specifically where did it come from, but how did it even exist? Samara is talking about the things that she's doing, the pictures that just appeared and blah blah blah. Shouldn't she be dying in a well at that point? Or, if the psych tape was made before she was killed, why was she so bitter already? Did she know her mother would kill her? Was she just plain evil? In that case, why did the video include images from the well, specifically THE RING? Maybe I could sit here and invent an explanation, but as I said earlier, if I'm going to have to write the script myself I at least want my name to go in the credits.In conclusion, The Ring is not a bad movie, just a tad misguided. There were things that could have been done and ought to have been done to eliminate at least some of the holes in the plot, and made a better movie. I give it 4 points for actually being scary (I'm not sure how well I'll sleep tonight) and 2 points for stringing a few plot elements together to come up with something. Some movies have no plot whatsoever and thankfully, this wasn't one of them. I really wanted to like the movie, but it just wasn't what it should have been. .............6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scary movie not to miss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie was playing in the theaters, I was too chickened out to go and see it. All of my friends had nightmares for days! But a few months ago, when it came out on HBO (or Starz, I forget which) I grabbed a bowl of popcorn and decided to watch. I personally loved it!! It's really such a scary movie but you can't get yourself to leave. Sometimes, I'd been grabbing onto my pillow and crying a little because I was so scared but there was no way I could go away and not watch it anymore. The acting is amazing and totally believable. And the story is very creative and is realistic and not at the same time. I mean, it's very unlikely for such a thing to happen, but at the same time...it could. There's no magic or monsters but rather videotapes and phone calls, which, when you're watching the movie, makes it all the more scary. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good time, but be warned, you'll definitely have nightmares for a few days afterwards!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this was a pretty good movie. It had an intriguing idea. I think the use of the videotape was pretty creative. However, there did not seem to be much fulfillment at the end of the movie. The film was pretty suspenseful and not boring. I think it was a pretty good film. The film was quite imaginative but not realistic. You could not watch a videotape and die. I think that the images in the videotape and the story that explained the images was well done. I think it is better than many other horror films. The young boy, Aidan, in the film was pretty good. I think that after seeing it you might feel that something creepy will happen to you and this feeling might last for awhile.I think that it was a pretty good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike any other horror I've seen. Seen it first time in front row of cinema. More disturbing than scary (especially the tape). You need to think pretty hard when watching this film (well I did!) The second time I watched it, I noticed weird things that I didn't notice the first time I seen it. Even though I didn't think it was very frightening....I still worried at night that a girl with long hair over her face would walk into my room, or my TV at the end of my bed might just happen to switch on, or the phone might ring. It wasn't till all that I just mentioned ran through my mind, I then began to think...."well, maybe that film was a bit scary!". Not one to miss though.</fullReview>

It couldn't happen but ... neither could Frankenstein recreate human life. At places it seemed a bit "campy" but that may well be a result of my age and the difference between my age and that of the principal characters in the movie. However, I was able to look past these short burst of "camp factor" and enjoy a really scary flick. I judge a movie and its power to impress me based on, what I call, the "chill" factor. This movie gave me big time CHILLS. My flesh was crawling all over the place as I watched the "monster chick" climb out of the well. I'll bet it does the same thing to you ... over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MIGHT INCLUDE SPOILERS It's been a long time since a decent horror film with this style of plot has been created. Most horror movies today try to scare you with special effects or idiots with chainsaws. The Ring is what horror movies should be: a taut psychological thriller that builds to a fevered pitch and then lets loose with both guns. However, the movie does not know where to end. After the discovery of the well, the movie should have ended there. In fact, it might just as be best to stop the movie at the shower scene ten minutes from the end because the rest makes no scene and in fact leaves more questions. For one, not all the images in the video are explained and two, any boy who sleeps with his mother is going to grow up messed up. In all, the movie is worth a watch toward a point and then after that, you start wondering, "What the heck was that ending about?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbearably tense and creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this in theaters with my friends for my fifteenth birthday. I hadn't seen "Ringu" and I still haven't. The whole time I was watching it, I thought, "Man, this is creepy!"There are several jump scenes and an overall sense of dread throughout the film. It's dark and filled with disturbing imagery. (Possible spoiler) When the teenage girl was found in her closet, the collective audience screamed and talked for several minutes afterward. When Rachel was in the well near the end, the tension was almost unbearable. It was horrifying. When Samara came out of the TV, I wasn't shocked, because I had read about it before, but it was fun watching people around me shrink back into their seats and fling their hands in front of their faces. (end spoiler)When I walked out, I thought, "Wow, that wasn't scary at all. Just creepy."I expected to be terrified when I got home late at night, but I didn't think about it. Sometimes the images would pop into my head in the shower or at night, but that's about it. What I'm trying to say in this crappy review is that it's worth watching, for it certainly has an effect on the viewer. It might not terrify you, but I'm sure you'll remember it.</fullReview>

Even long after the movie is over, you cannot rid your mind of the images that have just been displayed on your TV. In the dark you will keep thinking about everything that you have seen. I will end my comments with this, you will never look at your TV the same way again. Rent this one today, if you haven't seen it already. You won't regret it! :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Horror Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So you're disgusted with today's horror spinoffs of previous spinoffs, which are still as pathetic as some of their predecessors, only the director has add a few topless girls and some flesh eating to try and gross you out. It you are a true horror fan of any kind you will agree that this just does not cut it. We want to be scared. And how can you take a film seriously when you have a mutant alligator eating the villagers, hmmm...? Anyway, The Ring manages to achieve what others horror flicks have not - to scared the ghost out of you.Based on the Japanese film, Ringu, The Ring spins a modern-day equivalent to the Exorcist, with the whole demonic girl idea. What it does that The Exorcist did not (despite Exorcist being a better horror), was that The Ring developed the story beyond demonic possession into a mysterious and macabre down-the-rabbit hole investigation of how, Samara (the demonic girl), came to be.I have loved horror films since a tot and through the years have only seen a few that were truly frightening or horrifically disturbing. I can easily say that this film is the only horror that comes to mind in the past 5-10 years that was a good fright. I highly recommend seeing it and as a test of how brave you are, watch the film alone one night with the lights off. Then go to be later that night and see if you don't hide under the covers. :)</fullReview>

That is kinda creepy.The movie in whole was scary, especially the peoples faces after they "saw the ring". It was like a giant jigsaw puzzle that needed to be pieced together. When you finally figured one part out, another sub-plot came into place and totally mixed up what you had put together. That was frustrating. But, after watching it twice, I found I finally understood it.I thought it was interesting, Rachel and Aiden's relationship. Aiden never called Rachel "mom" or "mommy" or whatever a young kid would call his parent, which I thought was kind of creepy, but showed independance.Overall, The Ring was a fabulous horror movie without stupid, funny parts that ruin the whole setting of the movie.

I don't scare easily, so it's hard for me to say this was scary, but I can say it was definitely very eerie and suspenseful. The plot was very well done and mysterious, it kind of leaves you wondering, but not in a "the directors didn't cover it" kind of way. More of a "it's supposed to be like that" kind of way. The acting was great, especially from David Dorfman who played Aidan, Rachel's son. He was an aloof, mysterious young boy whom, I think brought a lot of the eerieness onto the film.

		<fullReview>...watch Ringu instead, the Japanese original.This version is only good if you can't read english, but then you wont be reading this either. The ring is nicely executed and has some shocking moments. I also like the lead actress, but all in all it's not that very good. It has a lot of inconsistancies, stuff that doesn't really make the most sense and are only there to kinda make the movie look a bit more exciting. When I watched it, it was pretty ok, but when I started thinking about it I found more and more illogical things and other stuff that didn't really have to do with anything but which were cramped into this movie anyway. I had a hard time following The rings storyline, because some things arn't explained but just happen. That is not the case in Ringu. In that movie you'll understand everything sooner or later!Ringu is much more tight, there is a lot more suspence, the story is almost completely logical and it is not overdone like The ring is. So if you have the choice, go for Ringu and skip The ring completely!The ring 6/10 Ringu 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gore Verbinski and Ehren Kruger simply do not know what to do with a horror story (in Kruger's case, that was apparent since Scream 3). Sadly, it proves what I've always believed: no matter how good the original story is, the final product will still be less than great in the hands of mediocre talent (see also Brett Ratner and Ted Tally's Red Dragon, they totally missed the heart of the story. Hint: The heart wasn't Lecter's conversations with an FBI investigator in the asylum-like it was in Silence of the Lambs, and it wasn't ALL Dolarhyde, OR the investigation...)The movie is overpraised by people (I think such praises reaches its nadir in the review that's currently on the main page for this movie. The guy sounds like a publicist, with delusions about the power of film. Sorry to break it you, but you don't hover above the masses, and the masses aren't stupid enough to throw away their VCR'S after watching, what is afterall-A MOVIE, and not a very scary one at that), but it does have its merits (however I give Gore Verbinski very little credit, even if he feels he's made the story he's own. Sorry, director boy, you OWE EVERYTHING to the original story. Try NOT making a movie that's a "sure sell" like the horrible movie "The Mexican", and that isn't reverently faithful to something which is pretty good to begin with-i.e"Ringu"). The movie has an great first third (seeing how the first victim's body ended up was pretty freaky), very low key and creepy, and you think its setting you up for a good slam bang finale. It isn't. Maybe I shouldn't have expected too much from a PG 13 movie. Simply put, the movie lacks tension; Rachel's investigation lacks urgency, and the dates that are VERY frequently flashed across the screen give the movie an episodic feel that doesn't help matters at all. It goes NOWHERE, and the open ending is HIGHLY anti-climatic. Imagine getting on board a rollercoaster that sputters to a stop midway and you'll get an idea of what watching this movie is like.I love the concept though-a video tape that kills is something only the Japanese could concieve of (their love affair with technology and their personalization of it is apparent yet again. See also anime movies, in particular Ghost in the Shell-NOT a horror film however, despite the title).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the original japanese film a few years ago and thought to my self wow that was a really good horror, a one of story line a story never been used before on screen.That makes such a change compared to all these new horror films that pop up from time to time, dreamworks made the remake and this mistake happens so often, the remake is nothing like the original screen master piece. Sure these companies have got the money got the actors but the films never quite cuts it. I have seen many many horror films one of the best by far and always will be is the exorcist the same as starwars for science fiction films, however the ring was up they some where with the exorsist, i love the 80s and 90s horror flicks they were the best and always will be. It was so refreshing to watch a truly excellent horror film the story the acting the effects it was great.But be warned this film is about as dark as it can get it gets into your head and stays they for a little while. As so many new horror films go wrong in todays society they forget the one thing that so many lack ,psychology fear.Remember when we were kids we were all terrified of what was under the bed ,when the bedroom light was turned off they are no boundaries of fear nor the imagination. If you can put this mental feeling into an audience for an hour and a half you are on to a winner, the ring did just that one of the best horror films i have watched up to date horror writers take note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie scared me pretty good. I would say that the beginning of the movie is nicely done,really setting a creepy standard. But then it settles down, and we get somewhat of a deeply disturbing detective story as the heroine tries to get to the bottom of the mystery before her time is up.The last 10 minutes will have you shaking and coldsweating. First the director offers us a happy ending, then a sudden descent, and we are left with a sense that it was pure evil with little redemption at the end. The part where a horse runs amok aboard a ferry is scary. I didnt see the Japanese original version, but if it is better than this one, then there is no way around seeing it as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like so many horror films of recent vintage, `The Ring' is far more effective in its setup than it is in its execution.The film starts off with a promising premise. A group of teenagers watch a mysterious videotape that predicts that each of them will die in seven days. When the prophecy turns out to be true, Rachel, the aunt of one of the victims, decides to do some investigating of her own to uncover the facts behind this strange supernatural phenomenon. The problem is that not only has Rachel herself seen the tape (which looks for all the world like outtakes from `Un Chien Andalou'), but so also have her ex-boyfriend and little son. Her search for answers thus becomes a matter of life-and-death not merely for herself but for her loved ones as well.`The Ring' has some nice moments of suspense right up front, but the more Rachel unravels the mystery the less mysterious and terrifying the film becomes. This seems to be a common failing in many horror films and `The Ring' finds no real way to overcome it. Naomi Watts is energetic and attractive as the feisty heroine of the story, but the clues she uncovers just aren't very interesting or compelling. `The Ring' is competently made and nicely atmospheric at times, but it doesn't get under your skin the way the best horror films invariably do. Perhaps it's because the tape itself ceases to become a threat early on once the three main characters have all had a crack at watching it. All we are left to do is watch Rachel racing against the clock looking for answers, turning `The Ring' into more of a whodunit mystery than a tale of terror. This might be acceptable if the `solution' weren't a hackneyed bit of Grand Guignol idiocy that we've seen hundreds of times before.`The Ring' is a watchable little time waster but it won't keep you up at night and it won't make you think twice before popping that next videotape into your VCR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the scariest films I've ever seen; what's great about it is how it doesn't rely on excessive amounts of gore or cheap thrills to scare you. There's barely any blood or violence in the movie at all, and it's still more scary than most violent horror movies. I love how the horror is all atmospheric; it keeps building up to something worse, instead of just hitting you with constant scenes of violence. This is a perfect movie to put on, if you're sitting alone a dark night, in need of a good scare. Nearly anyone will find it scary. The plot is interesting, and keeps developing constantly, so you never get tired of it. The acting is top-notch, by pretty much every single actor involved, major &amp; minor character alike. The characters are believable, and their actions understandable. The movie has an excellent mystery, that leaves a lot of open ends to the audience to figure out for themselves; unfortunately, there may be too many open ends... I've seen it three times, and I still can't make sense of everything that happens in the movie. That's the only complaint, though. Other than that, it's nearly perfect. It's definitely one of the scariest movies ever, especially if you're into atmospheric horror. I'd recommend this to any fan of atmospheric horror movies; this is one of those movies you have to watch, if you're into atmosphere in a horror movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow Version of a Slow Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The pacing of both the original and English remake of the Ring seems to be rather slow. While there are some creepy moments in this version of the story its still as over rated as the original. For the most part the two films are almost interchangeable in my mind, although the images from the cursed tape is better in this version. The only real differences being the location and the episodes around Brian Cox.The question of which is better ultimately comes down to whether you want to read subtitles or not. For me there is something creepier about the original version and its lack of digital effects that makes the final several minutes of this version less scary because its less real, but thats a minor complaint and either version is fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chilling and thrilling horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming from the Steven Spielberg stable Dreamworks, this surprisingly respectful remake of Ring is an excellent horror thriller in its own right. The Ring manages to pay respect to the original and use its ideas, but often chooses to interpret various scenes its own way.To say it lives up to Nakata Hideo's near perfect original, would be a mistake, but The Ring is just about there. Starring Muholland Drive's Naomi Watts, written by Scream 3 scribe Ehren Kruger, and directed by Pirates of the Caribbean's Gore Verbinski, the signs weren't good. To top all of that off, they were making an unnecessary remake of an acclaimed masterpiece.However, The Ring was the surprise success of 2002/03, due to a clever and dramatic advertising campaign (see left). The tagline `Before you die, you see' was a temptation to audiences and The Ring ended up as the scariest movie since the original. It made a star of Naomi Watts, and of director Gore Verbinski, and Scream 3 writer Ehren Kruger.The plot focuses on the mystery of a nightmarish videotape which kills you one week after you watch it. Cynical journalist Rachel Keller (Watts) soon gets drawn into the mystery after her niece and 3 of her friends all die inexplicably on the same night, in different places. Soon, she finds the tape for herself and watches it, and then the phone rings. Later she enlists help from her ex-boyfriend, who also watches it. However, after her inexplicably paranormal son watches the tape also; she is drawn further into a bizarre mystery which somehow involves horses, a suicidal parent and a very deep well.The Ring shows an intricate attention to every detail. The setting itself is filled with clues (for example ring shapes in the background), and every place is dripping with dread and atmosphere. The whole film has a dark blue-green tinted feel, which reflects the surreal video, and the stark contrasts in some scenes make the scene where big revelations happen seem more realistic. In fact all of Bojan Bazelli's dreamlike cinematography is a wonder to behold. Hans Zimmer's surreal, swelling score is beautiful and dramatic, but never intrusive. The on-screen countdown adds to the sense of urgency, and Ehren Kruger's (who wrote the distinctly average Scream 3) clever and inventive script adds emotion to a story which seemed bland originally due to the all too literal TartanAsia subtitles.The Ring strives to work on as many levels as Ring did. The ghost story seemed much more in place in the Land of the Rising Sun, than the land of baseball and leaders with below par IQs. There is no longer a sense of unpredictable dislocation as the Japanese version had, and the less said about the reimagining of Nakata's frightening final scene, he better.However where The Ring improves, is in the way that everything that is happening is more dramatic and exciting. The killer video is much more creepy and bizarre, and the struggle of Rachel is made more sympathetic as she leaves her comfortable Seattle home into a dislocated windswept village far away from help. The scene in the well is much scarier, and the opening possesses far more tension than Nakata's original. The Ring also leaves many questions unanswered, but enough actually answered to work as a stand alone horror movie. Whether The Ring can survive as a franchise remains to be seen (The Ring 2 is already in production) but as a horror on its own, it is creepy and imaginative enough in its own way, and remains almost as disturbing as the original.Verdict: Far better than all the 21st century Hollywood horror movies put together, and a pretty tough rival to Nakata Hideo's original, The Ring is a frightening and memorable horror picture. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't really take scary movies. They don't even have to be scary.. I've never been one for "haunting" movies either. After I saw "The Sixth Sense," I had trouble sleeping for over a month (utterly pathetic, I know). I thought it was really ironic, then, that everyone found "The Ring" to be soooo frightening. Maybe it is just because I had expected it to be sooo scary that I worked myself up for something extraordinarily "scary", but when I saw it.. I was left thinking, "well that was kinda stupid..." I mean the movie was entertaining, and sure, it was suspenseful.. but come on .... a girl walking out of a TV? Really now... "The Ring" is a good movie and it's pretty clever, but for me it didn't really do it. Didn't have the effect on me that it seemed to on everyone else... kinda like "The Blair Witch Project" .. that wasn't as scary as it was out to be either....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepfest falls short of the mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the second of two films that have had me sleeping with the lights on. The other, in case you're curious, is "The Sixth Sense." But that is about all the two films have in common.Where "Sense" had an excellent plot and superb acting, "Ring" has plot holes big enough to drive a semi through. Much of the backstory involving the Morgans and their evil adopted child, Samara, is ambiguous. We're supposed to know that Samara's bad but we don't know why or how she got that way.The entire film appears to have been shot through a blue-green filter, which does make for some interesting cinematography at times but later becomes a distraction. The shots of Samara's victims are suitably creepy, as is Samara's own demise at her mother's hands.The acting is pretty good, with Naomi Watts proving she can carry a film. Daveigh Chase is not nearly as frightening as some other evil children in films past (notably Damien from "The Omen")."Sense" had scenes that literally made me jump out of my chair; "Ring" did not. As remakes go, it's all right but not spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, but not as frightening as I'd hoped.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought into the hype, I admit it. All I kept hearing upon this films release was "Oh my god it's SOOOO SCARY!!!" So I went to see it with a group of friends, preparing to be scared out of my skirt and really looking forward to it. Well, the film was beautifully shot and genuinely creepy, but not at all as scary as I had hoped it would be.Everyone knows the story by now: A weird videotape with disconcerting, but seemingly unconnected images, has the power to kill anyone who views it exactly seven days later. A group of teens view it and, sure enough, within a week they are all dead. One girl's dreadful corpse is found horribly bloated, ghastly discolored and waterlogged, in her bedroom closet. This is the one scene that literally made me jump, but it was very brief. The rest of the film concerns the efforts of this unfortunate girls Aunt to solve the mystery of the video...a mystery that becomes more urgent when she views it herself and receives a creepy phone call from a little girl who simply tells her: "Seven days." A warning to people who are irritated by ambiguous endings (like me):The mystery surrounding the murder of a little girl remains ambiguous to the films final scenes. We never truly know why she was so inherently evil, how she created the video or why she refuses to rest. These questions are left for the viewer to answer. However, you will see some really good performances, some absolutely stunning scenery and a startling climax featuring a dripping wet ghost emerging from a television screen. However, I couldn't help but feel that the film was about 20 minutes too long and the plot rather flimsy if thought about too hard. Still, it's a pretty decent ghost story that will succeed in scaring many a viewer. The ghostly images on the cursed videotape itself makes this movie worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I haven't seen a decent horror movie for about a decade, after a short research on recent ones, I picked 'The Ring'. Also because of Naomi Watts whose performance in 'Mulholland Drive' was awesome (here she was nothing special). The script and the reviews suggested that it was a great freaky horror but to me it was simply boring. There wasn't a single scene that frightened me. The storyline was flat, there wasn't anything at all to make you think of or remember this movie, there was no message, no point. The characters were boring as well with an average acting, they didn't make you worry/care about them if they die. I blame the director for that. The only good things were some nice shots and and the sounds. The fake ending was so stupid, it's only purpose being to leave the story open for a 2nd part, which I won't see for sure. 3/10</fullReview>

Placed in barn with horses, can't sleep "because they keep her awake" - what do they do, play cards all night? throw wild parties? they're horses for heaven's sake! Evil child kills horses. Child placed in well to die.Now, here's where it just leaps off the page: to exact her revenge, evil child makes an evil VIDEO TAPE! Ha ah! Scared you, didn't it! Not hauntings, not body possessions - a tape! Perhaps in time she'll master the art of DVD burning? And what is the point of this evil tape? To kill people as she was killed. Okayyyyyy. But traditionally, an angry spirit wants those who were responsible for harming it to be killed - not complete and innocent strangers! What's up with that? And when the clues on the tape are deciphered and the body is recovered, is the vengence over? Nope. So what's the point? Kill everyone on the planet? Good call.The kid in the movie was cheap knock off of the boy from The Sixth Sense, all spooky silent walking and big eyes. And the mom looked like one of those sitcom aunts that suddenly has to take care of a kid that wasn't hers. Wackiness ensues. And how does someone find a lighthouse so quickly from a blurry video frame? Dang, she must be a better researcher than people give her credit for.Creepy images and tons of atmosphere but the movie didn't do anything for me. I prefer movies with resolution not supernatural "gotchas" that never end. The movie has further solidified my opinion that all movie children are evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first ending, where everything was resolved was great. The movie seemed great, I was ready to say "great movie" 10/10. But then the second ending came along and made me feel nothing. This totally subverted the movie making it seem a mere trick of the director to frustrate the audience. 6/10.All the symbolism became mere gimmickry. The movie led us down a clear and intelligently presented thread, only to abruptly change its course in the last few minutes. This is incredibly annoying. Oh wow, the ring is a ring - it has no ending... gee the symbolism! bleh. It left me feeling the way as the movie "Adaptation," which I thought was brilliant until the single/signal word "kill" is uttered by the lead actress. It was so wrong and so forced and so awkward that it left me feeling nothing for the "first" movie.-Zafoid</fullReview>

Once you get clued in, after a dull and contrived search for the truth about the ring, the movie becomes more laughable than scary. To exacerbate matters, after the movie has ostensibly ended, there is a cheap twist thrown in which is a transparent attempt to launch a sequel.SPOILER AHEAD...If you can believe that a dead girl can make a symbol ridden video tape from beyond the grave, then distribute it, then make phone calls to the viewer right after he has seen it, and then come right out of the tv screen to scare the life out of her victim, then you might get scared.

First of all, this movie went on too long and the story wasn't interesting enough to hold my attention for a long period of time.Here's the story *SPOILERS SPOILERS BIG BIG SPOILERS*:We start off with a girl named Katie and her friends. They watch the film and get a phone call that says they will die in seven days... and they do. Katie's mother asks Katie's aunt to investigate. She goes on a journey and finds the tape. The tape contains images of a woman in a mirror, a ladder, blah blah blah boring cakes. She gets a call that she will die. She uses what time she has left to find the source of the tape. She finds out the woman on the tape is named Anna Morgan. She goes to Anna's home and talks to her husband. Turns out that Anna had an adopted daughter who caused Anna to hallucinate things so Anna killed her and pushed her down a well. Katie's aunt (Rachel) finds the well and tells Samara (Anna's daughter) that everything is ok. The end. But wait!! That's not the end! Samara still wants to kill!! And what does this have to do with the tape? Nothing. How did the tape get made? No one knows. Why did the tape get made? Even more elusive.If you've made it this far, I praise you. And if you actually understood anything I explained, you just might be genius. This movie stinks. Go rent 'The Exorcist'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, i have to mention that I haven't seen the original. So perhaps my view on this picture will be a tad more objective 'cos I won't compare it to Ringu.-might contain spoilers (and a lot of typo's)-Either way, i heard a lot of good things about this movie, so with high expectations I decided to watch it on a dark, cold winter night. The movie starts with two teens on the bed, talking bout this urban legend. My first impression was: oh god, not again. Now a killer with a mask will jump from behind the curtains and stab them both to death, right? Well..no!From the beginning there's this eery atmosphere and with a few (cheap) tricks the tension starts to rise till the end of this intro which leaves us with a riddle of what exactly happened. I almost pissed my pants after this first scene so the intro really set the mood.The story continues at a comfortable pace. Nothing drastic happens, but there's this constant creepy atmosphere and simple things like that red tree at the cabin, the bleeding noses, terrific camera-angles and loud sounds (read: noise) that just make you want to grab a pillow and hold it in front of your eyes.Till the 7th day, I can't tell anything bad or annoying bout this movie. But then they start messing things up. Rachel falls into the well, Samara grabs her hand and Rachel gets this vision of how things went. This part looks great actually, but then Samara comes to the surface. Bad move lads. Till that particular event, 'Samara' was a huge mystery: was samara really evil, how did she look like, etc. But here everything about this mystery goes to waste when Samara floats to the surface in, what seemed to me, a clumsy way.Well, from then on they think everything is solved and the party goes home. If they had ended the film here, that would have been a damn lame ending. So they put on this extra chapter in which the truth becomes clear to Rachel and the poor lad dies in a great scene (remember the fly that left the screen? Wow!) It's a nice turn in the story, but it feels artificial. They could have done a lot better job to add this extra part.Also, there are quite many `what if's like `what if the TV is really small so samara can't crawl out' or `what if you're in this forest on the 7th with no TVs around you' etc.Despite the mediocre ending, I give this movie 7/10.PS: Nice acting from Naomi Watts</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't expect gobs of gore and buckets of blood with The Ring. Director Gore Verbinski manages to drum up barrels of suspense and creepy moments without all that. The Ring is a remake of a Japanese horror thriller called Ringu. The story in short details a videocassette that when seen causes one's death within a week. Although shot almost scene for scene like Ringu for almost the first two-thirds, The Ring combines an innovative story, some solid acting, and some creepy special effects and mysterious music all to great effect. Naomi Watts stars and does a credible acting job as a mother trying to save herself and her son amidst this terrible REAL urban legend of sorts. The rest of the acting is uniformly good with Brian Cox standing out in a small yet pivotal role(and a role not in Ringu). Though you won't understand everything at the end, The Ring will provide a whale of a good time giving you some real, honest goose bumps. It's nice to see a film like this get a lot of support and yet not be trashy in any way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't like the remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Important note: I've seen the original 'Ringu' and my whole opinion is based on having seen the original. If you haven't seen the original ignore this comment and just see this movie. It's not that bad if you haven't seen it.To those who have seen the original: DAMN this was bad! It starts with the tape which is NOT scary and there is too much explanation about the tape. No mystery. There was too much explanation throughout the whole movie which was bad. I know that movie studio's generally want to keep their movies simple for the american audience but you guys like movies like 'The Wicker Man' don't you? I could go on on how bad it all was in comparison to the original (which even I thought was overhyped). The boy in this version was annoying (he talked a lot which he shouldn't have; he should have been like the boy in 'stir of echoes' or like the boy in freakin' 'Ringu'!!!) and the whole horse story was dull and they didn't use the brilliant ending of the original.Was it all bad??? No! Naomi Watts was good. Haven't seen a bad performance from her yet. Keep it up!And now...... my biggest complaint. The whole 'philosophy' behind the Ring was absent in the remake. It was as if the writer of the screenplay didn't know why the movie is called Ring. OK you have the shape of a Ring when looking up from the bottom of a well BUT the main reason the original is called Ring is because the tape causes events to happen over and over again.. like a vicious circle... RING.But all my complains doesn't stop them from remaking a sequel. If The Ring 2 will be a remake of Ringu 2 than the girlfriend of the boy's father will try to figure out what happened to her boyfriend. This remake could work because the original wasn't all that good. Crap I'm spending too much energy on this.. BYE!</fullReview>

I find no structure in the film what so ever, what's up with does horses all of a sudden? Who's voice do you hear on the telephone that says 7 days? How is it that you copy the TAPE that you will not die? Who made the tape, when, why? Although I was not bored while watching, let's say it's a good weekend t.v. film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let me say that I have NOT seen the japanese original! You don't have to rely on guts and gore to make a good horror movie. "The Others" is one example, this is another. For most part, this is one truly creepy and scary horror movie. Naomi Watts is excellent in her (a bit awkward) part as a single mother. Let's hope she can lay her hands on some more major parts! It is a visually stunning movie too. "Feardotcom" tried to achieve a similar look and managed for the most part, but otherwise that movie led nowhere and was all over the place! Here the visuals serve a purpose. To set a specific mood. The best scenes are the ones on the island! They are genuinely disturbing in a very quiet and understated way. *******MINOR SPOILER HERE******* And even though the "surprise" ending after the ending is totally predictable, it is still chilling. *******END OF MINOR SPOILER***** There are only two things I am not satisfied with. First, the little boy who plays the son. He is not a bad actor but he displays some truly bizarre behaviour. Or rather, he displays no concern at all when all type of strange happenings are occurring all around him. He seems to be the "Sixth sense"-boy crossed with "The Omen"-boy. And finally, the plot is really no big shakes. Once you get the hang of things, there is really no need for any more explainations. However, the film makers insists on explaining and explaining and explaining in too many flashbacks. But otherwise a classy shocker!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people told me this movie was really good and really scary before I saw it. Of course, I did not believe it would be scary, but I was in for a real surprise when I actually saw it.This movie was one of the least scary movies I have ever seen. First of all, it is a ridiculous premise for a movie, a killer videotape?In fact, the scariest thing about the movie is probably the colors. It is so dark and dreary, everything seems to be a sort of metallic blue shade....not hugely appealing, although I suppose a good bit accurate for a film about the Pacific Northwest.If you are looking for a scary movie, this is not it. It does not even have the sort of "shocking/jump out of your seat" moments that even bad horror movies have. I would call it a huge disappointment overall, and unless you are eight years old, this movie will not scare you.The only good thing is the fact that it stars the beautiful Naomi Watts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another pointless Hollywood remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring is yet another Hollywood remake of a foreign language film which is barely 5 years old. As you would expect it is flashier, more action-packed, and loaded with tricksy camerawork and CGI effects, but it loses out in the creepy/suspense stakes. Whereas the original Ring was dark, grainy, and built up a sustained tension, this version is bright and colorful, full of vibrant images and packed with booga-booga jump scares no doubt aimed at pleasing the 18 year olds raised on a diet of Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer.Director Gore Verbinski has taken a classic and genuinely scary ghost story and turned it into your standard disposable Hollywood blockbuster fare. The industries constant remaking of recently acclaimed foreign movies (eg Les Visiteurs/Just Visiting, Insomnia, Open Your Eyes/Vanilla Sky) borders on insulting. Subtitles aren't *that* hard to read are they?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard so many people saying they found this movie to be "utterly terrifying," "that it was chilling," and that you "HAVE got to see it." To be honest with you, I fell asleep halfway through it. This production was a hodge podge of sloppy acting, predictable cliches, and ridiculous metaphorical rhetoric. I really wanted to watch a scary movie, but instead I watch a jumbled up storyline. Yes, there were a couple of ghoulish scenes, but they were few and far between.Incidentally, how many of us are still alive? I mean, after all, we watched the movie, and the tape. I truly wonder how many of the people who have watched this tape are still alive seven days after the fact. Now, a study on that premise would make an interesting storyline. :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this movie came out everyone was telling me the same thing: That movie was SCARY! Since so many people had such a strong reaction to a horror film, I had to check it out. The entire story to The Ring is one of the dumbest stories I've ever encountered. The plot makes no sense. The "horrific" images in the movie aren't horrific at all, and the little boy in the movie made me want to kill his parents for every conceiving him. Also, the lead female character does stupid stupid things. I suppose if this happened in real life it would be scary, but take from me- don't believe the hype. That's what will get you scared. The whole time I was watching I was jittery because I was prepared to be scared sh*tless. But just when I thought something was going to happen, it didn't, I got bored, and finally the movie ended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... but the movie was boring. sorry, but that's what i think.i like horror movies, like the old italian stuff or also some friday 13th or nightmare on elm street. some people say, that "Neo-horror" just sucks, but that&amp;#180;s not quite true in my opinion, "may" is a pretty good movie for example. but back to "the ring".when some friends of mine saw the ring they said they were too afraid to drive home alone, to watch a video or to answer the phone. they also told me that also the "tough guys" were afraid after having watched the movie. so i thought that it would be cool, scary and maybe also gory. but i failed. i TERRIBLY failed.the ring seems like someone wanted to make a horror film and thought about a story. he invented some teenagers that went camping, like in some other horror flicks (not to mention some names ;)). then he needed something deadly to make the movie scary. zombies and other villains seemed to "old fashioned" to him and so he came up with the idea of a deadly VIDEOTAPE!!! wow. scary.the whole plot of the movie seems like a kind of alibi for the film to take so long. there's actually not much action in the plot, not to mention the absolute minimum of blood and gore i;ve ever seen in a "Horror" movie. the idea of that girl crawling out of the TV reminded me of poltergeist and DEMONS, so that was not too original either. also the scary atmosphere was missing in the ring.dont get me wrong, i dont HATE the movie. it just makes me wonder that (for example) "the gates of hell" is said to have huge plot holes or "the beyond" is said to have no plot at all. so i think its kind of strange that the ring gets a rating of 7,6 here at IMDB, while "gates" gets only 5,8 because of the "lacking storyline".</fullReview>

Those who view the tape receive a phone call, then eventually die just seven days later. Watts is an ambitious journalist who decides to investigate the tape's authenticity. After falling victim to the 'curse' herself, she goes on a mission to uncover the secret that will beat it and stop the inevitable from happening. Well-crafted thriller has an unusual premise that holds your interest, and has a few startling moments here and there, but it presents about four different endings, none of which are very satisfying. **?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry for any spoilers... OK...after seven days, your tv comes on and bad things happen... I understand the movie makes great lengths to show that Americans live by their televisions, that's fine. But here is one question, if your tv has just turned on twice without anyone turning it on (except for spoiler answer) and you are REALLY paranoid, why not go take a walk? Leave the house. Sit in a park, heck, sleep there. OK, tv is the death of us all and society, the fact this movie made over 100 million in the box office alone really does prove that. BUT as a movie, horror fans (and I mean those born when HORROR movies were coming out, not most crap in the past 15 years) have seen this all before. The only addition is a good director. The movie LOOKS good, it is shot wonderfully. The problem is the movie itself. The acting is not horrible, the script is, well, very long winded for a movie that had WAY too many fake jolts (you know, the "insert violen shrill here when nothing happens") and not any real moments of suspense. I will concede the movie is a good attempt of taping into eerie suspense (not really horror though) but only an attempt. Recently, Signs is much better because it really puts a human - family - what would you do - aspect to it where in this film its more - stretch your brain - please? And for those who say this is the best scary film since the Exorcist, watch that movie again, it is a very dark comedy, not a horror film, and in my opinion, not a very effective dark comedy. Instead of this film, please watch the real classic "horror" films such as Carrie, The Last House on the Left, Zombie, Opera, Suspiria, Sleepaway Camp (yeah, you heard me), and many others. Again, not a terrible movie but for those who watch films of this nature who are over 20 years old (who saw the old movies before they were/are classics), this is a forgettable Sunday afternoon movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Many Questions, Too Little Answers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring had a chilling concept and much potential.The Concept: A tape, filled with seemingly random and meaningless bits and peices of footage, is deadly. Once one watches it, they immediately recieve a phone call, with a voice that simply says, "Seven Days." Seven days after this phone call, you die. In what fashion do you die? How do you die? Who's behind it? Who kills you? How can anyone detect when you are watching a videotape? Etc.., are many of the hundreds of questions you will be asking while you watch this movie. The problem? By the time the credits have finished at the end of the movie, you still have many more questions than answers. And the answers you have don't make much sense, and don't satisfy at all.This movie also does not deliver as many say or said it would in the are of being "scary" or a "horror." All of the shocks and scares of the movie are in the style of the Sixth Sense. Something scary doesn't necessarily happen, it just happens very quickly and loudly, and right in your face, usually proceeded by a silent build up. There are a couple of those types of scares in this movie. Most, however, come by anticipation. Most hear so much about how "freaky" and/or "scary" this movie is, so they watch on the edge of their seats waiting for a scare, and a lot of the time a quiet scene is followed by something very loud happening in the next scene, something that is not scary at all.I give this movie ** out of ****, because it did have an entertaining idea, and wasn't total crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I learned that "The Ring" was a remake of a Japanese film called "Ringu", I figured I'd watch Ringu first and then see the Americanized version and compare. I watched Ringu alone in my room, which wasn't a very good idea. I was scared out of my wits and floored by the storyline which I found very, very well done. I then saw The Ring the next day and was more than slightly confused and very disheartened. The only things that were the same (to me) were that the little girl had some whacked out powers and that she made a video to show her angst. The rest of the storyline was completely twisted and WRONG. I went home and when I got Ringu 2 I watched it and realized how the American version was even more wrong. Considering that the films were based on a book, you'd think the Americans could've followed the actual storyline better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is interesting in that it seems to evenly divide reviewers. It's either creepy, or it's moronic. To tell the truth, I didn't find it all that creepy. However, I do think I understand why so many people do. First, the movie goes out of the way to throw stylistic (no, the Seattle-area really doesn't look that depressing), creepy images that are calculated to disturb the viewer. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Second, I do think that the underlying issue is what is really giving some viewers the willies. That issue of course, is child-abuse and murder. Almost all of us are greatly disturbed by the very notion of abusing and killing children, the driving theme in this film. I am of the opinion, that without that element, very few viewers would have found the story as chilling as they did. The abuse affects us (the viewer) psychologically, on a conscious or unconscious level, making us more susceptible to the dark and chilling images in the film (which in most other films would be cliche-it's hard to be truly disturbed by the murders of over-sexed teenage jerks). Just a theory. Feel free to shoot holes in it.**1/2 out of ****, appreciate the effort of the filmakers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film about the mysterious videotape that kills you one week after you watch it. The story centres on journalist Rachel Keller (played by the beautiful Naomi Watts) who, having seen the tape, has one week to solve its riddle or become its latest victim.Personally, I found this the scariest movie I have seen. I'm not a huge fan of the horror genre (not matter what anybody tells you, this IS a horror film) but I've seen most of the standards and can appreciate a good scary film. The whole atmosphere is downright chilling, and the scenes with Samara in the mental hospital are particularly disturbing. Great credit must go to young Daveigh Chase for her performance. Indeed, the character of Samara must rank as one of the scariest cinematic creations ever. She makes the film and the scenes involving her are the scary ones. And I mean SCARY. Her image will linger with you for long after the film has ended and you will never look at a television the same way again.There are arguments and counter-arguments for whether this is superior to the Japanese original. I want to add my two cents and I'll say this: whichever version you see first will probably be the one you will champion. On repeat viewing the film does lose some of its impact because you know what to expect. You know how the tape kills people and the shock will be gone. Therefore, if you see this after the Japanese version it will seem inferior, and vice versa. That said, its still a very effective horror film and, in my opinion, far superior to anything Hollywood has produced in this genre for a long time. Well worth a look, but I wouldn't advise watching alone because if someone hasn't already told you what happens, it will scare the hell out of you. I gave 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My experience with "The Ring" has gone on for quite awhile even though I only just saw it last weekend. I saw the previews before it came out and being a huge scary movie buff, couldn't wait to see it. For some reason, I never got to do it when it was in theatres and as many of us do nowadays, thought "Ah hell, I'll just download it and watch it on my computer." However, the quality was so crappy that it took away from the movie and I only ended up watching/suffering through part one before I gave up. (Part one only got to the part where Rachel is viewing the tape in the audio/video room)I wasn't scared at all and pretty much forgot that I even wanted to see it...which takes us up to this past weekend.While at Blockbuster, I noticed The Ring DVD in the Previously Viewed section for a good price and figured "Why not?" And I'm SOOOO glad that I bought it and brought it home.I watched it last Sunday afternoon on my gorgeous tv with wicked sound system and am still haunted by the soundtrack and images a week later. No need to go into plot as so many others have, but I can't remember the last time I was so unnerved...ok, probably the first night that Blair Witch came out before all the hype wrecked it. I'm still creeped out by the image of the well and Samara's slow crawl out of it towards you....*shudder*.I think the scariest part of the movie though was the fact that JUST as the movie ended and the screen went to static, my telephone rang...I was watching the movie with my dad *another huge scary movie buff* and he answered and then with a stone-face said "It's for you." The movie told the story so well that for a 45 second period, I ACTUALLY believed that it might be true. Nerdy? Yes. Best scare of my life?You better believe it.</fullReview>

The cinematography is really impressive; evoking Kubrick (mostly from The Shining)and at times even Spielberg (specifically from Poltergeist). The director has definitely done his visual homework. The film itself evoked my previously-eaten taco to become uncomfortable in my tummy and work its way up my throat. I'll let you read about the plot holes (more like plot abysses)from other reviewers as I am not interested in wasting much more of my time with anything associated with this flop of a film. As a horror fan, this film will not be worth your time. Watching a Tool video will give you the same amount of creeps and won't waste as much of your day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In seven days...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm glad I could make it home safe after watching "The Ring". The movie itself was not that frightening but the ending was so stunning and scary, I walked out of the cinema like a ghost with my eyes opened unusually wide. Not easily scared by movies, I don't know how much time will it take until I touch a video tape again. The movie is about this mysterious video tape, that whoever watches it, gets an immediate phone call where he's being notified about his death in seven days. If he or she doesn't believe it, well, they will one week later, after experiencing one absolutely terrifying encounter with a TV. But if he DOES believe it, he will try to prevent his own death, exactly what Naomi Watts' character, Rachel, did in the movie. This was the was the first time I saw Naomi in a movie and I was definitely impressed by her performance. Being a professional reporter, Rachel has no problem breaking into strange people houses, killing horses, stealing things - the usual stuff reporters do, but this time not only for the article in a newspaper, but also for her and her "family" lives. David Dorfman plays Rachels son, unsuccessfully trying to make the second Haley Joel Osment, but he definitely brings some thrilling, unforgettable lines("Don't You get it, she never sleeps"). Daveigh Chase, the voice of Lilo in "Lilo &amp; Stitch", plays exactly the opposite role here in a performance that would even scare the hell out of Stitch himself. Gore Verbinski , the director, makes it up here for his disastrous "The Mexican". Hopefully, he's on the right way. Go see this movie. Don't worry, You won't die in seven days after seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much better than the bland, emotionless Japanese original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought I'd take the advice of the pretentious minority one this one, those who highly recommended watching the Japanese film, 'Ringu', before watching the clearly superior American re-make. After watching the generally unimpressive original, I truly wasn't expecting alot from this film - after all, 'The Ring' didn't benefit from being a sexy foreign film, it must have been dumbed down to appeal to mainstream, borderline retarded American crowds, and most of the element of surprise had been wasted by my watching Ringu - right?Remember, Japanese audiences flock by the hysterical thousands to watch Jennifer Love Hewitt sing.Period, point blank, and that's the bottom line - 'The Ring' is superior to the original in every conceivable way - and it managed to thoroughly compel me while seriously freaking me out. Sometimes the book is better than the movie, sometimes a bands first album really is their best, and sometimes that guy blabbering on about not watching TV really doesn't watch TV. But in this case, feel free to ignore anyone telling you that 'The Ring' just can't hold a candle to the always superior foreign film.Forget about some very impressive special effects and remarkable cinematography that come with an obviously bigger budget (and when I say 'forget', I mean for the sake of comparison, not for the sake of enjoying the film). Compare the character development. Compare the attentions to detail. Compare the ambience, the general mood captured by 'The Ring' that was so lacking in 'Ringu'. And leave out the need to tell anyone who prefers the american film that they "just don't understand" the japanese version - I understand it just fine.***Potential spoilers, I guess.....Why in god's name should I like Ryuji, Reiko or their son (so unimportant and underplayed that I won't even bother to remember what his name was)? Call it a cultural difference if you like, but Ryuji is downright repulsive as a character, and Reiko was frustratingly weak and irrelevant. Conversely, Aidan is actually developed as an intriguing individual within a few minutes of the film. Kinda important, eh? Aren't I supposed to care one way or the other about his mother's eventually tireless quest to save his life? The relationship between all three Kellers was infinitely more interesting than the poor presentation of the same in 'Ringu'. Ryuji-Reiko? No chemistry, no real look into their past, no invitation to wonder about anything between the two beyond the faux finish of the film. Noah and Rachel actually had me believing they were once together, and more importantly had me wanting them to finish that way despite knowing it wasn't gonna happen ahead of time. Reiko and son? Forget it. I guess for the foreign film fan, it's preferable to just assume that a mother loves her son, so let's not bother with actually developing that on screen. Rachel and Aidan had some serious tension between them. And Ryuji-son? Nothing! No, I don't mean almost nothing, I mean LITERALLY NOTHING. Noah and Aidan managed to build something of interest in two minutes of meaningful dialogue.As for comparing Sadako/Samara - not even close. A Ringu proponent on this website actually said that samara was all wrong because she has thick black hair and only Japanese girls can have a mop like that? Jeez, just another example of the pretentious artsy fartsies reaching for straws. Samara was genuinely evil, but that revelation was done so well. She was a legitimate child of the Morgans, but something went wrong as they pressed fate in an attempt to have a child. She tortured her mother with her ability to 'imprint', caused her suicide, and eventually managed to imprint again beyond the grave. Sorry, but Sadako being extremely psychic because her mother was and maybe her father was not of this world is just not as compelling a story.I used to play in a terrible band called Deus Ex Machina - saw the term in the dictionary and thought it sounded cool. Basically, it's a term to describe a method of filling in a plot hole. In 'Ringu', there are Machina's galore, the most blatant being that Ryuki has frikkin' ESP, yes ladies and gentlemen, he has real psychic powers. Need to find out what really happened to Samara/Sadako? In 'The Ring', it actually requires some detective work, finding a tape from a psychiatric hospital, following clues left by Samara, pestering her father. In 'Ringu', things are much easier - just touch someone's head and the entire plot is explained! Wanna find her final resting place? In 'The Ring', the Kellers follow a serious of clues, left from Samara's ability to imprint, that lead them in spite of the fact that they don't truly understand why they are being led. In 'Ringu', Ryuji actually knows he's in a horror film! "If we find her body and release her soul, the curse will be lifted", and "let's start digging here, because I'm psychic and the director couldn't come up with a plausible way for us to legitimately find the well". Rubbish.Opening scene? 'The Ring' had me running for a fresh pair of Haines, despite the fact that I knew what was going to happen. 'Ringu' rushed through it as though they were trying to conserve film.The money shot? I thought 'Ringu' was just fine here, very frightening, hence the very similar scene in the American version. I liked the touch of fingernail close-ups in Ringu, the special effects and the fact that Samara looked like someone who died in a well in 'The Ring'. Fact is, though, that I was alright with Ryuji getting his at the end - I wasn't so cool with it happening to Noah, and that makes a world of difference.I really could keep going on. So much more depth to 'the Ring', and so much patchwork holding 'Ringu' together. Props to the original for making a nice flick from a novel on a limited budget, but calling it a superior film to 'The Ring' is just utter nonsense. Yes, the American version did follow the original closely in some spots - all the right spots if you ask me. And it strayed from the original in all the right ways as well (get it? as WELL). Verbinski took a mediocre B-movie and made it an unforgettable cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only gave this a 3, instead of a 1, because there was some fantastic imagery. Otherwise, this really was one of the bigger waste of time movies I've ever seen.This was NOT a truly scary movie. It was creepy. Absolutely creepy. But, the expectation that I would suspend my disbelief was SO high I simply couldn't do it.Many people have said there were too many questions left unanswered - that is totally true. I was more frustrated after the movie ended simply because there wasn't enough information provided about the WHY of the premise.Unfortunately truly bad acting by the two main adult characters did not contribute positively to my viewing experience. I had a hard time caring about anyone in the film. And the main woman did the most amazingly stupid things over and over and over - starting with watching the video to begin with!I don't recommend this movie at all, and am horrified that anyone would think to compare it to anything as excellent as The Sixth Sense!</fullReview>

That is why I will--most likely--NEVER rent the Japanese original of "the Ring!" That being said, let me point out the only TRUE con, re: the American version. *Possible spoilers ahead.* It should have been released PRIOR to "Fear.com," which was about a jinxed computer website. "The Ring" (either version) is about a jinxed videotape. I was still properly scared by the latter. Even saw it a second time! Just the same, I give it two stars--compared to three stars for the former--simply because "Fear.com" came out two weeks earlier. And, that I deemed TOO scary to see a second time!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be careful reading if you haven't seen it -- POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Standing on its own, The Ring is probably an above-average horror movie. Having said this, I'll admit that this review is biased toward the original Japanese version, Ringu. Believe me, I know that by reading most of the reviews on this film that a lot of people disagree with me. However, I tend to believe that the reason for this may be due to the fact that some of these people have seen the remake first which would kill the element of surprise in Ringu. The problems that I had with The Ring were its representation of the antagonist and some of the plot outlines throughout the movie. The whole aspect of the horse subplot was needless. Then, to add more to this, you have the horse and the ferry ride which still serves no real purpose to the movie except to add more time to the already overlong 116 minutes. And why are we always treated to the same "I don't believe you" to the "you're right, something's going on" scenario that seems to be always present in today's horror movies? At least with Ringu, the male role in that movie is smart enough at the start to realize that something out of the ordinary is going on, therefore, saving us from this clich and moving us toward the rest of the story. And now we come to our antagonist, Sardona. This was a complete letdown for me. I know, again I'm comparing an original to a remake but it can't be helped -- Sardona doesn't hold a candle to Sadako's creepy demeanor.I'm not saying that this movie doesn't have its moments. The opening sequence really grabs you and made me think at the time that it could possibly surpass the original. Honestly, I would recommend The Ring if only for the fact of the beginning and parts of the third act. But I would also recommend seeing the original Ringu first in order to preserve the surprises.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And I thought The Exorcist was scary... I'm usually bored, when I see a so called scary movie. These days they're all about a masked avenger stalking young, hot looking girls with a knife. But this one, The Ring, was different. I was so scared during and after this movie, that I expected to have a heart attack. Half the time I couldn't even look straight at the screen, which was a first for me. It has been three days since I went to see The Ring, and I'm still avoiding my VCR. This movie had great actors who I had never seen before, great plot and real live and loud horror. I'm surprised if I ever go see another scary movie in my life! I'm glad, that there is still someone out there who can make a real horror movie. But at the same time I wish I had never seen this one. If you're going to see this I have one advice: DON'T GO ALONE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this yesterday simply because time of the evening was rather late and it just happened to be the only film that was still running and I was in the mood to see something in the theater because (as we all know) it beats the television anytime. My expectations weren't too high because I find nine out of ten horror movies disappointing simply because as far as I understand horror flicks are supposed to be frightening and I think they're scary very rarely."The Ring" was a huge surprise because it turned out to be a real first-rate masterpiece of psychological horror! I have no recollection of when was the last time I've seen a movie that's as creepy as this was. If the remake is this good then I would really like to see the original. When a serial killer with a mask and an axe chases a screaming teenager I honestly can't say it's very scary but if the movie is properly done, all it takes to really scare the crap out of audience is a television that opens up with no reason whatsoever.If a movie can make the mere sound of a ringing telephone be like the scariest sound in the world, then it's a good horror film. "Scream" didn't make it, this one does. If the director can come up with something horrifying with a basic idea that's as silly and ridiculous as it obviously is in "The Ring" then he must be a total genius. This movie is so effective and thrilling that if you're not aware it can actually make you paranoid. "The Ring" is by far one of the best horror films I've ever seen. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't watch THE Ring. No you won't die, but you'll waste time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why people that say they like the US version better than the Japanese version. I think those people have an inability to appreciate foreign films or lack proper reading skills to read the subtitles. The Japanese version is far superior than the US version. THE Ring had questions that were answered very quickly and easily in the movie. Ring (I'd rather not say Ringu) is more of a mystery because many things are left to the unknown like the video tape. Everything in the video tape for THE Ring was explained unlike the video tape in Ring. I believe one of the things the the filmmakers in the Japanese version set out to say is that the unknown or uncertainty is what scares us. Having everything explained in the US version is like saying "Americans are stupid, let's make the movie make since." Something Dumbworks...er Dreamworks likes to say. So, as you can see, I recommend watching the Japanese version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM!This film was just brilliant. Opening night for this film I walked in the theatre knowing it was a thriller, but I did not expect to see the fantastic cinematography done in this film. As for some, I'm sure this was quite a scary experience and I admit I was scared quite a bit, but it was more of a psychological thriller than anything else. This film makes you think. It is up to you to follow through and figure out exactly what it is leading to. It was original and had a great plot indeed. The acting was done well and made you believe that the videotape has a curse and death will come upon you in 7 days. I love how it went day by day as Rachel(Naomi Watts) the newspaper reporter in this film, tried to figure out exactly what has been killing these teenagers.This film is up there with The Others as one of the best and original screenplays of all time. Just as you think the movie is going to end with a nice hug and chat with Rachel and her husband another 10 minute scene comes along. The little girl Samara actually comes out of the TV screen and kills the husband. That just blew me away and I stayed with awe. How is it possible that she can come out of the tv screen. It will be explained most likely in The Ring 2. It is obviously impossible for a little girl to come out of a tv screen, but it made for great shock. To add to that many things that people did not understand will be revealed in The Ring 2 and thats the beauty. However, there were many things to understand in this film you just had to think hard. When the DVD comes out, I will be at Best Buy ready to buy myself a copy. For the Ring fans that will be buying a copy, make sure you buy 2 or you'll have 7 days. Excellent thriller in my opinion and I am a thriller maniac freak. I give this film a definite 4 stars out of 4. I'm a harsh critic with thrillers because I like originality, well done plot and good acting. So I definitely recommend this film to all Horror/Thriller fans and the DVD will be a must get.**** OUT OF ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror movie that freaked me out...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the release of "Thirteen Ghosts" and "House on Haunted Hill," you're not expecting much out of many horror movies - especially when you know they're going to be lame. They're all the same; immature young adults move into a house rumored to be haunted. "The Ring," however, is a different story. It is truly disturbing and mind-boggling. It is probably the scariest movie I've seen in years.From the moment I saw the videotape - which will kill its viewers in seven days - to the very end of the movie, I was totally freaked out. "The Ring" doesn't rely on jumping out of your seat but constantly builds the tension, giving a sensation like that's going to happen. But it never does."The Ring" relies on images. There are times in which there is no music and very little sound, but what we see is scary and enough to give us nightmares. Director Gore Verbinski shows us the remains of victims killed by the videotape, courtesy of Rick Baker, he shows us an eerie video tape with a mysterious woman brushing her hair, looking in the mirror, among other things on the tape."The Ring" asks tons of questions but never answers them, leaving it remain mysterious. I don't think it's necessary to make a sequel or prequel, as the ending and the beginning of this film are absolutely perfect and unique. We are left asking ourselves the questions... and are sometimes answered them in our dreams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>biggest crap imaginable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie yesterday night at a sneak preview and found it terrible. So of course I wanted to look at the movie's ratings at imdb.com and was quite surprised by its high ratings. So maybe the reason for my dismay is that I actually did not want to watch a horror / psycho flic, but even if I would have wanted to this movie would have certainly disappointed me. There is no logic behind the movie whatsoever. All it does is steal some ideas of other movies (all genres) and meet every clich there is in the horror genre. And instead of ending at an acceptable 80 minutes, it drags on and on. SPOILER: Having almost reached the end, you think "okay, at least it has a decent ending with the bad dreams of that spooky girl in the well finally gone" and then it -like so many other horror flics- still continues and gives us an open end, ready to make a sequel if necessary. All I can say is: please don't! I am not an avid fan of the horror genre, but still I think that I can say this one is really really bad. I'd give it 2 out of ten points, and that's because the main actress is kinda good looking.</fullReview>

Now, see the Japanese one, titled "RINGU", and let your jaw drop. I recommend seeing them in this order only because the American one is to be appreciated on its many great merits, but if it is seen after RINGU, you can really unfairly find THE RING lacking. I honestly was much more visually pleased at the horrors of the US release, but RINGU will have you clenching on to the edge of your couch. I hate closets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite a fine performance by Naomi Watts and other cast members, including a much welcomed, albeit far too brief appearance by Jane Alexander, this contrived, slick production can easily be called the rich man's "Blair Witch Project". An artifice throughout, the story line follows a reporter's investigation of what appears to be a high-tech haunting replete with French-"New Wave"-styled, nonsense in a linear fashion then falters at the end when it reveals itself to be an unresolved exercise in meaningless destruction, pain, abuse and overall negative values.  If being manipulated by contrived quick cuts, sudden loud sounds and an ultimately inexplicable and malicious list of deaths is your cup of tea this is for you. For those who prefer a more popular form of entertainment, let this one pass and allow it to return to the dark corner of the Dumpster behind the building from whence it came. Supposedly a cerebral exercise: that, it is not. Appointment in Samara, indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is an old school horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's just get right to the point. The Ring is the scariest horror film I have seen in 20 years. Horror has been enjoying a healthy revival since 1996 when Scream got everyone interested in horror again. That is a good thing. What isn't so good is some of the cheap crap that has come out since then. For every film like The Sixth Sense and Blair Witch, you have a plethora of other films that have no idea what true horror is really about. Too many film makers think the best thing to do with horror is make a rockin' hardcore soundtrack and give us buckets of blood because this disguises the fact that most of them can't pace a film or invoke true chills. Gore Verbinski's The Ring returns to the roots of horror and pays homage to the early greats like Halloween and Psycho but almost goes a step past the greats, not quite but almost.The Ring does something that only a handful of horror films have done, and that is it stays in your subconscious hours and days and weeks after you watch the film. Gore Verbinski and Ehren Krueger have combined to make a masterpiece of modern horror that goes beyond anything that has come out for the last twenty years. This film is that good. For a guy who grew up loving films like Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street, I have been yearning for a film like this. A film that not only is a great scary film but a film that is a pure kinetic experience, one that makes me look behind me at my silent television sitting in the corner of the room. Is Samara there? When my radio begins to go haywire and search for stations on its own, is that Samara? This film gets inside of you and stays there. But it eats away at you like the nightmares that Malcolm McDowell is forced to watch in A Clockwork Orange. It attacks your mind and berates your senses. Samara is one bad ass villain. The Ring is a masterpiece and as I have already stated, this is the best horror film to come out since 1984 when Freddy Krueger stalked us in our dreams. The Ring may have it's roots in Japanese horror, but it owes much of its pedigree to all horror greats of the past, whether they are American, Canadian, Japanese or Italian. There is a bit of it all in here and the results are kinetic.When I watch a horror film, I know it is effective when that chill comes over you. Not the kind that makes you want to put a jacket on but the kind that literally starts from the nape of the neck and goes down the beginning of your butt. It's the chill that attacks your body and tells you that you are now at the mercy of the film and nothing you see from here on out is going to be expected. That is how The Ring is. The Ring had me scared. It had me nervous and it had me thrilled. Having fear envelop you is one of the most primal emotions you can experience. The Ring is a primal movie.There are a myriad of reviews in here that will tell you how amazing this film is, you should listen to them. This is a year that has been blessed with brilliant horror. With superb efforts like Mothman Prophecies, Frailty and now The Ring, 2002 should be known as the best year for horror films since the early 80's. If you only see one horror film this year, please see The Ring. If you want to be scared, see The Ring. It is a guarantee that this film will frighten and maybe even traumatize you. If films like The Changeling, The Shining and Halloween are synonymous with horror to you, then add The Ring to your vernacular.Oh, and you will never look at your television set the same again.And one final note. There is one infamous scene in this film, near the end, and I'm sure we all know what it is, and this is one of those scenes that will stand the test of time as one of the great images in horror films. I know horror aficionadoes will recall scenes like Hitchcock's shower scene, the bouncing ball in The Changeling, Michael Myers rising in the background at the end of Halloween, the head spinning scene in Exorcist, Freddy's tongue coming out of phone in Nightmare on Elm Street and Jason's first kill wearing his hockey mask in Friday the 13th Part III just to name a few. But *****************big spoiler here if you have not scene the movie********** when Samara comes out of the T.V., that is one of the most indefeasible and primal scenes I have seen in any horror film. It shocked me and thrilled me all at once. It is an image that will never leave my mind and it is just one of a plethora of scenarios that makes the Ring such an absolute masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails in Comparison to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie. I had been reading about it for a while through other sites, and it intrigued me. When I learned that there was going to be an American re-make, I immediately wanted to see it. But, having read that the Japanese version is a great horror movie, I wanted to see the original first. So, I did. And I was blown away. The movie was almost perfect. It was scary, had a genius plot, good direction, and a spectacular ending. I went to see the "The Ring" on opening night, keeping in mind that some said it stayed true to the original. The opening scene was like the original, but then the movie heads off into something else. The screenplay for the U.S. version was terrible. They should've stayed along the lines of the original. I really do not like how the U.S. version had to explain everything, it left nothing to the imagination. Movies are much more frightening when the viewer has to imagine what happened, rather than throwing it right in their face. The Japanese version made the perfect setting, and it just gave that dark, eery, suspenseful feeling. "The Ring" Americanized the original, with cheap scares and typical "american suspense." Although the re-make was better than recent horror, it does not live up to original, and it threw too much different ideas in, i.e. horses, Samara's father, the extensive footage of the cursed video tape. If you want to see a true horror movie, watch "Ringu", and try thinking for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had already read the reviews of the movie Ring on the internet as well as the reviews from the original version of this film, Ringu. So in a sense I knew what to expect especially from a remake produced by Hollywood. But I have to admit that the film did creep me out in some ways. Not enough for me to lose sleep on or to claim that it is the best horror film ever made. I guess what happened is that I had had higher hopes for it based off of reading the reviews about the original one. Needless to say that after viewing the film, I am dying to get my hands on the original. I was somewhat confused with the ending yet I would still watch it again and again. I really enjoyed the parts of being able to watch the video over and over. The video had disturbing and twisted scenes with an errie soundtrack that made your hairs on the back of your neck stand up. The horse scene was brillant and the actor who played as the son to the main character was simply wonderful. He was just as good if not better than the little boy who played in "Sixth Sense". I would love to commit more on the movie but I'm afraid that it would ruin it for others who have not yet witness it. But I can say that before you enter that theater, you better make sure that you have all the goodies you need and that you won't need to use the restroom because you won't want to miss one second of it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE RING(2002) **1/2 Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, David Dorfman, Brian Cox, Jane Alexander, Lindsay Frost, Amber Tamblyn , Rachael Bella, Daveigh Chase, Shannon Cochran. Somewhat disappointing yet stylishly rendered remake of the Japanese cult classic about a mysterious (and dangerous) videotape that inexplicably kills its viewer exactly seven days after watching it with Watts (who makes the most of her limited character) as a Seattle investigative news journalist who decides to pursue its meaning when her teenage niece suddenly expires from witnessing its contents. Mix `The Twilight Zone', `The X-Files', Hitchcock, `Stir of Echoes', `The Blair Witch Project', `Videodrome', and `The Sixth Sense' and pour on thickly is the result in this bizarre cocktail of suspense, dread, chills and a few good old-fashioned ghost story starts with some dreary production design effectively conceived by Tom Duffield, moodily dark cinematography by Bojan Bazelli and Hans Zimmer's pin prickly unnerving score definitively inhabits what should be a stellar spooky supernatural film but ultimately the screenplay by Ehren Kruger fails in the climactic final act which goes on too long with too many false endings.

		<fullReview>I believe this film stands on its own as a well made thriller. Unfortunately, people immediately feel the need to find every scene in the movie that was remotely similar to another film. Good directors borrow, great directors steal, right? Right. Anyway, aside from a few overdone scenes and contrived scares, the Ring is a competent remake of the original. The main problem lies in why a remake was made in the first place. For money, I know. This is a shame. Read: There were no holes in the plot. Anyway who disagrees, please email me and I will explain. Just because you didn't get it doesn't make it a bad movie.The American additions to the screenplay tend to hand hold a bit too much but American audiences are stupid, right? I jest. This film is well ahead of the majority of horror/thrillers hitting the screens lately.I hope it does quite well. The genre needs a boost. It is worth your money and time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got the chance to see this movie at an early screening and it was amazing. I haven't seen the original but this movie is outstanding. From the first 10 minutes of the movie your heart rate jumps to 160 and stays there for the next two hours. This movie stands alone as one of the scariest movies I've seen. Everything a good horror movie needs, this has. Note: it's not at all a slasher filled with mindless gore but an extremely well thought out screenplay. Naomi Watts performance is as riveting as it is different from her character in "Mulholland Dr". Unusually, out of the entire cast there was no weak link. Every one gave a strong, believable performance. This movie is definitely one of the better movies of the year. The high contrast, shades of grey look of the film perfectly accentuates the stark images. The story, sound and cinematography combine to deliver chills that will stay with you long after you've seen the movie. It is truly a visceral experience.</fullReview>

I actually had to sleep on a friend's floor after watching it. Shame on the Hollywood remake! The story loses so much grace and horror when superimposed onto Western culture. Why don't we try to remake "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" while we're at it? Why not set it in Maine?If you ever intend to watch the former, certainly more artful version (and tragically, many will not because they don't want to exhaust themselves by reading subtitles), do not ruin the experience for yourself by first watching the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film 2 years ago but I remember it for long time Many people criticized this film like this: "In this film fear is a result of terrible face, harsh sounds ... And Japanese version better" I think in this film the action is not main thing but only a scene,space. And main in this film I think is to show people, their relations...to help people became a bit kinder. And this film shows this. In this film Samara wasn't an absolutely evil. She had some singularities. And her adoptive parents put her into psychiatric hospital where she was alone for many hours, she lived in a stable and in the end her adoptive mother broke her in the well. As for me it is a enough reason to take offense. Some people write that it is very non-original and stupid story and many films has story like this. Yes this story is very simpler than story in book of Koji Suzuki. But main mean of this is not a difficult, long and very interesting criminal story. Americans when they were making this remake they didn't understood this idea. They tried to make a very scary film. So they put this in their film (this history is modified history from book of Koji Suzuki) but their main intensification was directed to make a good action. So this film has a good history of Samara with bad and stupid history of Rachel and company.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you love to be scared silly without any vulgarity or gore, this is a great film to turn to. I am an avid horror movie fan and I just ADORE this movie. Horror movies don't usually scare me, but after viewing this one I couldn't sleep for a week. And since it is basically clean except for a little language here and there and some scary images, anybody above the age of maybe 10-12, depending on if they scare easily, could see this film (maybe more or less.)The film revolves around Rachel, who finds a mysterious tape that supposedly kills anyone who watches it a week after viewing it. When she watches it, she has just one week to find out how to break the deadly curse. Worst of all is that her son Aidan and Noah, her ex husband, father of Aidan, have also viewed it. But with the help of Noah, she is determined to put a stop to this once and for all.I give this movie a 10/10 rating, because it creeps me out in a classy, psychological way, rather than gross and unnecessary things. You really start to care for the characters and find yourself not able to stop watching until the chilling end of this great chilling film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie and wound up clutching my best friend the whole time. The beginning is a setup for a great urban legend- two girls, one recalls watching a "cursed videotape", there is a creepy sequence, and then she meets her end at the hands of an evil little girl who looks like she hasn't showered in years... The rest of the movie features Naomi Watts trying to figure out how to stop the videotape's destructive path. If you haven't figured it out already, all who watch this tape receive a phone call warning them that they will die seven days later. There are plenty of scares and a few surprises. All in all, this movie is NEVER to be watched alone, in the dark, or a combination of the two. This is one of the really successful horror films that don't rely on blood and gore to give you a real jolt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scariest PG-13 movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie, I got the chills for weeks. And that's saying something because it was rated PG-13. The story line was spectacular about a girl who was murdered by a mother and used a video tape to get her revenge on society. You don't pay much attention to the acting in this film. Naomi Watt's son in the movie was very creepy however and he really stood out in my mind. The creepiest and positively the coolest aspect of this movie was the contents of the video tape like a woman brushing her hair, a ladder and a girl in a mirror. Only the ring can make the nicest things seem so horrifying. The girl popping out of the video tape and the phone ringing saying "seven days" helped the movie a lot too. The very beginning and the very end were the coolest parts of the movie. The only downside to this movie was that the entire movie wasn't plain horror and suspense. A lot of the movie consists of boring dialogue, but when the movie is over, I guarantee you won't even remember these stretches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The weirdest thing: this movie is not all that scary. Well, it is. But not the "scary" that most American audiences expect, with decomposed-faced ghosts popping up, grabbing your ankle, weird noises in the wall. Nope, this ghost hardly makes any appearances at all. There are one or two jump scenes, but nothing that will really freak you out. What makes this movie so scary is the sense of impending doom, like a black raincloud hanging over your head, ready to burst any minute. It's the kind of fright that hasn't been successfully made since The Sixth Sense or even Psycho. Hardly anything is shown, but everything else is shoved in your face to make you think that you saw everything that you didn't really see. And that's what gives you nightmares.What's also creepy is that it's not your everyday plot: psycho killer on the loose, or even boy who can see ghosts. No, this plot has been weaved and woven to the point where only those with enough patience are able to sit down and unknot the plot until they can go "oh! now I get it...." but just like fractions, that's not the end. There's back story and after story and clever twists and turns and meatballs every now and then.So if you're interested in a good psychological ghost thriller, grab a trustworthy pet to cuddle and a glass of water and, contrary to what many critics say, watch it alone! It's juicier that way and will have you leaping backward away from your television set faster than you can say "seven days."My take: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's get one thing straight! The Ring does its job.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who feel all high and mighty because you've seen Ringu and think it's better than The Ring, how would you like to know that The Ring is not even based on Ringu! If some of you would do some simple research or at least watch the other films that have come before The Ring, you'll see that a Japanese film named Ring Virus (or Ring) is almost identical to The Ring, far more so than Ringu. Ringu has a lot of differences in comparison to The Ring, but Ring Virus and The Ring share a virtually identical plot and characters.And at that, i'd like to say they are both superb films! The Ring does a great job at what it's supposed to do - scare the **** out of you. It's a psychological thriller and provides a compelling enough story to drag you in if you let it. As for some of the cultural translations needed to make Samara - a character that is shrouded in Japanese folklore and phenomena - truly horrifying, I think the American version couldn't have done a better job. While some give The Ring the cold shoulder with questions and confusion, I think it's important to come to movies like this expecting things you shouldn't be able to understand or ask questions about. It's called imagination. Suspended disbelief.And if you're really that curious about how Samara can make images appear on videotapes or make phone calls from a well, you can look into it for yourself.The best thing about The Ring is the more you watch it, the more fascinating and terrifying it really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie if you're willing to turn your brain off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoilers: If you have not seen the movie, you shouldn't be reading this*** Overall, "The Ring" was a fantastic movie, mainly because out of the limited number of horror movies I have seen in my life, this one actually managed to scare me. All the creepy little details are perfectly done, and it also has some great shock moments (the scene with Rachel's body in the closet made me jump about a foot). The tape itself is very mysterious and disturbing, and is, in my opinion, the best part of the movie.However, there were several things that were rather dumb, and the more I thought about them after I watched it, the more I didn't like it. It's the kind of movie that you can't analyze too much, or you'll ruin it for yourself. For one thing, the entire premise of combining supernatural mysticism with VHS technology is a bit goofy. But what really turned me off about this one was the kid, Aiden.Aiden drove me crazy. I'm supposed to feel scared for him, and yet he spends the entire movie looking like he's about to wet his pants. He's a shaking, bug-eyed, dippy little nerd. All kids in horror flicks are like this, too (The Sixth Sense, The Shining, Invaders From Mars, etc.), and I'm sick of it. I want to see a horror where the kid stands up for himself like a man. Maybe then I'd care about whether the ghost gets him or not. Nervous outcasts like Aiden just annoy me. If I had a kid like him, I'd LET the ghost get him. After all, if he's not gutsy enough to protect himself from a stupid ghost like Samara, he probably wasn't going to last long anyway.This brings me to my second point: Samara the ghost was indeed stupid. Yes, everything was creepy and suspenseful, until we find out the exact method she uses to kill her victims, namely, crawling out of the TV and... looking at them. What the heck!? How hard can it be to defeat her?? All you have to do is unplug your TV. If you're not swift enough to do that, then just run away! She can't catch you, because she happens to be the slowest-moving ghost of all time.This is why I got so mad at that guy Noah at the end. All he had to do was LEAVE THE DAMN ROOM, but this proved to be too hard a task for him. Samara's inching toward him with these teeny-tiny baby steps, and this guy decides to start falling over and crashing into things like one of the Three Stooges. What a moron. If he's so uncoordinated that he can't walk ten feet without tripping all over himself, then he probably wouldn't have lived long anyway, either.Well, if you can handle the unintended silliness of the plot and characters, and focus on the well-done atmosphere and details, then you will enjoy this movie. Just don't think about it too hard.</fullReview>

I would recommend it to a curious soul by saying "It's a good rental but don't fall through the holes in the plot." This movie contains one of the best "how did they do that," scenes of all time. It involves a spooked horse and a ferry. Another hole in this movie is that they don't even enlighten us as to how they did it in the DVD "extras." Speaking of the extras, the "cutting room floor," scenes only serve to add the confusion.It starts out as a typical teen horror/slasher flick then goes for a "Sixth Sense," look and feel. It does both nicely, but is rudely awakened by the numerous question marks that are brought up. The Riddler would love this movie. I won't go through them, but if you are the type to accept anything presented to you without question, you will love this one. As far as being scary, when I was a kid a movie could have that effect on me. But that was many moons ago. This movie falls into the category of "next."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really not that scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Course that could be for a reason: I saw Scary Movie 3, which spoofs it pretty well, before I saw this. Or it could just be that while the effects are cool, the plot just isn't too scary. Scary would be the acting jobs of the two kids, which do give the move a slight flavor of weirdness and creepiness. But not enough to compensate for the rest.Personally, Ringu is better. Granted, it's only about as scary as this, so slightly to mild, but it does a better job of explaining things, and the lead charcters don't seem to be quite as stupid. Also, it doesn't involve the death of a horse, which just bothered me with The Ring, though it made sense later.Still, it was a good movie - just not that scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie about an evil VHS cassette. Why not? -- we've clearly run out of other ideas. But before you ladle on the praise for originality, please recall that this is a remake of a much tighter Japanese cult-shocker.*The Ring* is equally weighted with virtues and faults. The actual videotape in question, which will kill you exactly one week to the minute after you view it, is itself a rather clever take-off on some of the Surrealist work of Bunuel and Dali from the Twenties (but without Bunuel's REALLY horrible imagery, like eyeballs getting slit with knives). An advance here is that the imagery on the tape comes alive, right through the TV: a filmed housefly can actually be plucked off the screen, as the days ominously pass and the curse gathers strength. Needless to say, the housefly is merely foreshadowing for much nastier "interactive" horrors to come.The plot is full of holes or is otherwise incomprehensible. The movie never considers, for instance, that a person could simply be in a place where there are no televisions when his or her week is up: without the medium of television, the ghost isn't able to manifest itself in order to kill him/her. Or perhaps you simply die, whether you're near a TV or not. Who knows? There are other absurdities, but to give them out would be spoiling things. (For those in the know, I'm referring to the efficacy of making copies.)It's not that I require water-tight plots for my horror films -- or indeed, for any films. But it's to be assumed that a movie without a strong plot will have many other virtues to compensate. *The Ring* mostly fails here, as well: Verbinski's idea of setting a mood consists of covering the camera lenses with icy-blue filters; the cast, with the sole exception of Naomi Watts, is low-wattage and includes a Haley Joel Osment copycatter (at one point, the kid in this movie even wears an undertaker's dark suit); and the suspense is disappointingly light, except for the splendid beginning when we aren't sure what to expect.But having said all this, *The Ring* also avoids being completely ridiculous. The main characters, who operate and investigate under a cloud of certain impending death, seem caught up in a psychological anguish which is unusual in a genre where sudden scares are the norm. Self-sacrifice in a horror flick hasn't been seen since the finale of *The Exorcist*, thirty years ago. All in all, *The Ring* gamely continues the mini-Renaissance of decent scary movies that began with *The Sixth Sense*. Worth watching -- 5 / 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the Japanese original a few months before i heard that Hollywood was making their own version of this film. The original, although not a unique idea, is a very interesting one if handled right. It was a very watchable horror, nothing special, but well worth a view.The remake however it a shambles. It takes a few good ideas from the film it is remaking, and also borrows from many other Hollywood horrors. The two films show the difference between the cinema from continent to continent. Japanese cinema is far more artistic and its audience view the films in a far different way. I can not imagine many traditional Japanese audiences enjoying Gore Verbinski's film.It has a few redeeming points. The special effects, as you would expect go some way to making the Hollywood version watchable, but as for the plot, it makes little sense, and we are simply not interested enough to unravel the bits that need us to.The usual horror conventions of the jump effect loud music are implmenented as the only way to scare us in this horror. The only thing this film will succeed in doing is making people want to watch the original and bringing it to Western audiences.Score this film 4 out of 10</fullReview>

In fact, the premise was interesting enough to make me look into the story deeper than one should ... the plot is really holding together by a thread and shouldn't really be examined too closely. You get the feeling that all of the source material is there, but it was maybe chopped up a little too much in the editing room. Nonetheless it was a good Halloween night movie to watch ... better than "The Others", not as good as "The Sixth Sense".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Maybe a small spoiler.) Wow, what else can I say? I have watched many horror movies over my 40 years of life from Hitchcock's great masterpiece `The Birds' To the some of the more recent Teen slasher movies prevalent recently. And in all that time I have never had a movie wake me the following night with Nightmares. This movie did exactly that! Whether it was the overall creepiness of the movie or the fact that it touched some dark fear buried deep in my subconscious I don't know, but the fact is after watching this movie last night I awakened four times to horrible nightmares three of which were directly connected to the movie. As I sit here today bleary-eyed writing this I think back to the house I grew up in which had an old abandoned cistern under it that our kitchen had been built over. I used to have a phobia as a child of falling through the kitchen floor into the depths of this black watery hole never to been seen again. Maybe some of the scenes in this movie touched that long buried fear. On a creepy scale of 1-10 this movie is a 15!!!! Kudos to director Gore Verbinski for scaring the crap out of me! 8 out of 10 Stars.(2 star deduction for the ambiguous ending.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original Japanese version of this film, so i was able to watch the film without having to compare it to Ringu. As a result i quite liked this film. I found it to be genuinely scary and well acted. Unlike most horrors that are produced in Hollywood nowadays this film turns its back on "teen horror", and the opening sequence can perhaps be seen as a kind of tongue in cheek rejection of teen based horror movies. The storyline in this movie manages to captivate you into the film; you find yourself caring for the main characters as well as feeling a fascinating mixture of pity and horror for the family featured in the video tape.Overall therefore the film comes across as a decent horror movie, with the director Gore Verbinski wisely using suspense over blood to scare the audience. Verbinski is triumphant in so far as he has created a film whose dark mood manages to leave an unsettling psychological effect on the audience by the end of the film. The main actors too are in good form, in the shape of Australiasians Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson. Another major plus for this film is the cinematic use of colouring. There is a distinct use of dark greenish imagery throughout this film which greatly heightens the gloomy atmosphere that Verbinski clearly wants to create.That said this film is not without criticism. The ending is unsatisfactory and damages much of the good work of the film up until that point. There is also little attempt made at making sense of just who the little girl really was, and why she was doing what she was. The boy too is a bit tedious, his character almost seems to be saying to the audience "we wanted Haley Joe Osmond but he is now too old and too expensive." That aside this is a decent horror movie, though had i seen the original, like with so many other Hollywood remakes i suspect i would have been disappointed with this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "The Ring" last summer and thought it was a splendidly-designed and carefully paced thriller, but I was also disappointed that the movie tied up all its points a bit to cleanly (some more ambiguity would've been welcome to keep the viewer on edge, but I suppose that's minor). Well, I recently saw the inspiration, "Ringu," and was thoroughly unimpressed by it, so I decided to give the American version another look and, by god, it is a little better than I initially gave it credit for. With a welcome infusion of COLOR, pace, more accessible dialogue, engaging characters, and some fantastic special effects (which translate surprisingly well to the small screen), "The Ring" comes out victorious (granted, it's not a long-standing classic for the ages, but it is diverting). Another factor is the intricacies of the plot--whereas "Ringu" merely set up a spooky concept (mysterious videotape that kills a person 7 days after viewing) and didn't build much around it, the American version has a more complicated narrative that induces some genuine heart-in-throat intensity.6/10</fullReview>

I thought the scariest part for me was that I paid 7 dollars to see it and not only did I see it once but twice(second time on a date) well OK it starts out really good, great scary account of the girl being found in the closet but then it's like hours of people wandering around like Michael Jackson looking for a small child, I mean c'mon it's so hard to find a movie thats really scary these days, Sixth Sense had some of it, Blair Witch definately did the job, but the greats in my opinion follow the same principal mess with your audiances' collective head, throw in a creepy make uped person once in awhile and you go gold, but this it was like c'mon, so far we had the video was creepy, the closet scene and the end was kinda creepy but I was so bored with impatience I blurted to my friend, "if some woman came outta my tv I'd be like, 'hey you get in the kitchen and make me some pie' I mean great concept guys, I'm really looking forward to Ringu but next time give us some midway chills, not just oh I have a nose bleed and fly came out of the TV and now I'm pulling things out of my throat, I want to be scared now bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the Japanese version,its tempting to compare the two. But I prefer to think of them as two parallel stories in the same world. Which you prefer, is up to you. Honestly, for me, its this one.It starts with your classic Slasher scene: Two teenage girls in a big empty house basically outline what to expect in the coming movie. But before that scene is over, its clear that this movie defies expectations. More than that, it manipulates them.The imagery in it is really chilling. I'm talking insomnia inducing. Ever scene is surgically crafted to freak the hell outta you, and boy does it work. Our every fear is manipulated (long painful death, claustrophobia, bugs, being forgotten.) and I defy anybody not to be shocked at a particularly brutal scene involving a horse. The film looks unique, somehow washed out and hopeless, even in broad daylight.The effects are well done, but just subtle enough so that you are never really quite sure. Did you see what you think you did? Did she really look like that? Did she make the right choice? And thats the beauty of the film. You're never quite sure about anything. The lines between the heroes and villains are very blurred. And the one time you are sure, you're then proved very wrong.But the movie is really made by two scenes in particular. One, is the rightly lauded "Money shot", where the...villain, I suppose, appears. I saw it 5 weeks ago, and that still freaks me out. You have to see it to believe.The other is the last scene: Poignant, moving, and somehow the most horrifying of the whole film.Don't go alone. Or perhaps it would be best...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really kind of liked this movie. No, it wasn't a heart-stopping, jumpy movie but there is no arguing that it is a well made, skin-crawly, creepy, atmospheric movie. I am the type of person that can enjoy both kinds of movies equally well and I do. Some of the scenes in the Ring are straight out of a nightmare and others are shown so briefly, you're not sure what you just saw - which only helps circulate the creepy atmosphere. I've read some of the reviews on here and have to say that I don't understand why some people take offense at remakes of foreign films. Granted, I usually like the original version as well but I can't possibly keep up with every foreign title. Or perhaps I'm just a lazy American but, sometimes it's difficult trying to get into the feel of a movie with having to read subtitles. Also can't watch dubbed movies, that's just plain silly. But if the remake is done well, what's the problem. I've seen both and thought them equally well made. In a way I am grateful to the people that bring some of these foreign films to the US mainstream. I may never have become aware of this, and other wonderful titles were it not for their Americanized cousins. Movies like Ringu and even Abre los ojos (Vanilla Sky) might still be unknown to me otherwise. That would be just sad. Cheers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie in a sneak preview. I had heard some stuff about it, but nothing more than it was about a videotape killing people and that it was a remake of a japanese film called Ringu. I didn't really expect anything, but DAMN, was this film GOOD! Sure, it has lot's of loose ends that aren't tied, in fact most of them aren't, but I couldn't care less... This movie is all about atmosphere. The creepyness sets under your skin, waiting to attack when you least expect it. The hairs on my arms raised higher and higher throughout the film untill the climax gave me the final blow... I left the theater shivering and I'm still shivering now...Mind you, I don't scare easily and I thought The Blair Witch Project and The Mothman Prophecies (to name but a few) sucked beyond believe. But this movie got to me... I was alone, so I ended up mixing into other moviegoers conversations (who mostly thought the movie was boring and sucked), explaining the ending to them.... that was cool...Go see it unprecedended. Don't listen to everybody saying the original was better. It does NOT matter. This film is great in it's own right... And if the original is even better, I'll check that out post haste... but I don't think I wanna watch a video anytime soon... brrrrrrrr9 outta 10 easy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watch it, and die. That's the basic premise behind this horror thriller, one of the few scary movies out there that carries a PG-13 rating. See, there's this videotape, and anyone who watches it gets a phone call as soon as they're done. A voice says, "You have seven days." And seven days later, you're deader than David Caruso's movie career. So what's behind these weird deaths? To find out, the mother of a teenager who apparently watched the tape (along with several other ill-fated friends) asks her sister Rachel (Naomi Watts), a newspaper reporter, to look into the matter. Rachel has a little boy named Aidan (David Dorman, looking a lot like a Culkin brother), who was close to the suddenly deceased teen. Rachel's travails take her to the stereotypical isolated cabin, where the group of teens stayed, and she discovers the tape. And watches it, of course, as I'm sure we all would. Does she also have seven days? Will she die of fright? And what of her cherubic, quiet son? And how about the neo-hippie, Bohemian ex-lover Noah, whose expertise in video production she needs? Rachel and Noah - who also watches the tape, against Rachel's wishes - find out more and more about the tape's origins and especially about the various specific images on the tape. You see, anyone who has taken a film class in college has seen student or arthouse film shorts that are steeped in abstract art. The images on the tape, very evocative and eerily mesmerizing, are all tied in together somehow - but how? What begins as an investigation of a seemingly harmless urban legend spawns a hysterical, desperate search for survival. It'd be one thing if Rachel had just been able to find out who was behind the tape - you know, a kind of "I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for that snooping reporter" thing - without actually watching the tape. But she HAS to watch it, and we have to watch along with her. There are some truly disturbing moments on the tape, and there were plenty of people shuddering in the movie theater. The main problem with the movie is that it never makes one think it's real. Sure, movies aren't documentaries, but a movie is much more enjoyable when the audience really feels as if they're in the movie, or at least feels as if the movie could be happening. But The Ring doesn't quite hook its audience; instead, it feels disconnected, as if - surprise! - you're watching a movie. This is not to say that the characters are not endearing or well-developed, because they are. Rachel is an excellent heroine - she's very smart, can think on her own, she's inventive, curious, creative, and adventurous. (She's also gorgeous, but that aspect isn't played up at all, refreshingly.) And Aidan is a wonderful multilayered character - like many things in the movie, Aidan is not always what we see. Is he a just a quiet, smart kid? Does he know about The Ring? Director Gore Verbinski does a great job in setting the mood; what Rachel feels, we do, although we still realize that what's happening is happening on screen only. There's excellent atmosphere, including a creepy scene with a little girl in an insane asylum; it's all very lurid. Watching Rachel piece the mystery together, while racing the clock, is fascinating - but again, it's like watching runners in a marathon on TV. You can see them sweat, and you can see them gasp, but you can't feel the pain they're going through, either physically or mentally. The pacing of the movie is also above average - truly suspenseful moments are drawn out, and the real terror isn't seen, but imagined. As with The Sixth Sense, the act of building tension in a scene can really make or break a horror/suspense movie. Lesser films show you everything, and that's why they're lesser films. So what's the bottom line? Is this a movie worth watching? Yes, it is. It's not the full-blown horror classic it wants to be, but it doesn't miss the mark by much. And the scenes on the infamous videotape have to be seen to be believed. It is a movie that'll haunt you for a few days or weeks? Probably not. It has a lot of evocative images, and it's well acted, but it lacks a heart.</fullReview>

I never read any reviews or even a plot description for the 1998 version.Emotionally devasting, deeply disturbing thriller will stay with you long after you have walked out of the theater. The film is a remake of the 1998 film called Ringu. It is about a reporter (Naomi Watts) who hears an urban legend about a video tape that kills whomever watches it exactly one week later. After a group of teens who supposedly watched the tape are all found dead, she begins to investigate what is happening. Adding urgency to her mission, is the fact that she has also watched the tape herself.A terrific performance from Naomi Watts and a good supporting cast along with realistic special effects, richly detailed direction, a bone chilling &amp; expertly plotted script, and a ending that will haunt you make this a must see film for all horror fans. If you have never seen the 1998 version and you think you have figured out the ending, guess again because more and likely your way off as to which direction this film is heading. Even at 110 minutes (trailers not included), there is not a single wasted moment in this film.Rated PG-13; Adult Themes, Disturbing Images, and a little bit of Profanity.</fullReview>

This kind of film is a treasure and should go down in history as the film to watch on Halloween. The film holds a PG-13 Rating and it still terrifies you down to the last bone in your body. Naomi Watts coming fresh off Muhollund Drive does a decent job as a mother and a victim of the situation of the videotape. No gore or blood, instead great quick shots and a haunting score from master Hans Zimmer causes this film to scare without the over done sick killer movie. (ex. Scream). Watch the unique shots and colors in this film - they will stick with you. BY THE way you will never look at another Television the same WAY! The Ring is GREAT! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychological horror doesn't get much better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Psychological horror films can be among the most effective ones. Their reliance on slowly building tension and atmosphere makes them less susceptible to the desensitization that can come with the repeated "jump scares" and excessive gore that can be an issue in other kinds of horror movies. Of course, psychological horror always must be sure to not be too slow-paced, because then it becomes boring. The Ring is a perfect example of what I consider a good psych-horror movie to be, because it unfolds like a mystery and keeps the viewer cerebrally involved...as it scares the crap out of them.&nbsp;There really is a good story here. Figuring out what is going on and why is a great part of why The Ring is one of my favorite horror flicks. It completely avoids many of the genre's clichs, while still providing scene after scene of unsettling imagery. We're talking some really freaky stuff. The characters come off as relatively normal human beings, instead of the annoying one-note caricatures that populate so many of the movie's contemporaries.&nbsp;I really think that it surpasses the original Japanese version in almost every way. The story is tighter, more focused, and more consistent. I love Naomi Watts, so it's no surprise that I think the casting was pretty great. And as I said before, the atmosphere is absolutely stellar. All the greys, blues, fog and rain mixed with the growing despair of the characters, really helps to put the viewer in the right mood. It's amazing how a sense of dread permeates the entire film, even though the main antagonist is seen so sparingly. There's virtually no gore or violence, and everything works exceptionally well without it. This movie scared the hell out of me in high school, and it still does today. It's a great mystery/thriller, artfully woven into one of the best horror movies in years. &nbsp; &nbsp;</fullReview>

Katie's Mother Ruth (Lindsay Frost) ask's reporter &amp; friend of the family Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) to do what she does best &amp; investigate the mysterious circumstance's surrounding her daughter's death from apparent heart failure, Rachel agrees &amp; soon learns of the videotape story. She retraces Katie's steps back to a motel &amp; finds the tape which she watches &amp; receives the phone call, as she investigates the tape &amp; the image's on it Katie believes the story to be true &amp; that she has a few days left before she dies unless she can figure out a way to put an end to the curse...This American Japanese co-production was directed by Gore Verbinski &amp; is a fine remake of the original popular Japanese horror film Ringu (1998). The script by Ehren Kruger based on the Ringu novel by Koji Suzuki I think actually improves upon the Japanese original which I have seen &amp; liked but I liked this one more, the films start off fairly similar with the news reporter becoming involved &amp; watching the tape herself but about half way through The Ring '02 actually tries to put a proper story to the tape &amp; at this point it goes in it's own direction &amp; sets about telling a decent little ghost story which in the end is quite effective. The film moves along at a good pace although not much actually happens in it so don't expect lots of gore or action as The Ring is that type of horror film which actually tries to rely on a good strong story as opposed to in-your-face special effects &amp; loud music. The character's are good as is the dialogue, there are some genuinely creepy moments &amp; the basic concept of watching a videotape that will kill you in 7 days is quite sinister &amp; freaky. Everything unfolds in a satisfying fashion although not everything works perfectly, for example the ending almost seemed like the filmmakers didn't know where to go with the story &amp; they just wanted to finish the film. Overall I was pleasantly surprised by The Ring '02 as I wasn't expecting a lot but I found myself really enjoying it &amp; it's as simple &amp; straight forward as that.Director Verbinski makes this film what it is, the film has a terrific atmosphere of bleakness &amp; gloom. He shoots everything in a grayish dull tone that gives the film an air of depression &amp; hopelessness &amp; it works extremely well. The cinematography is kept simple yet it is highly effective I mean I'd never have thought a single tree could have been so effective &amp; striking, thankfully there's no annoying quick fire edits here. There are some great scenes in The Ring &amp; some pretty creepy ones too especially the sight of a ghostly girl emerging from a TV set, forget about any violence or gore as it's not that type of film.With a supposed budget of about $45,000,000 The Ring has that Hollywood polish about it &amp; has excellent production values as one would expect. Apparently a fair amount of footage was cut from the final version including a sub-plot about a child killer &amp; Samara's death was far more explicit, it would be nice to see this stuff but I doubt there will ever be a director's cut. Turned down by Jennifer Connelly, Gwyneth Paltrow &amp; Kate Beckinsale before Watts accepted she does a good job as the lead who desperately searches for answers &amp; the rest of the largely unknown cast does well.The Ring is a remake which betters the original as quite a few do including The Blob (1988), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2004) that's controversial I know but it's just my opinion &amp; The Hills Have Eyes (2006) so all this remake fever in Hollywood has actually produced it's fair share of good films &amp; I definitely count The Ring as one of them, well worth a watch especially if you like ghost stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Ghost needs Psychiatric Care.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is one common problem with Japanese horror films: the ghosts kill for no reason! This happens also in the Ju On(The Grudge) also. I mean, even Satan kills for a reason and not merely for pleasure, assuming Satan governs the underworld and set the code of conduct there. So this ghost must be very psychotic even in ghost's standard.But the funny part is that they want to do it the hard way. I can't understand why a ghost powerful as Samara has chosen to go through such trouble as making the video tape, promulgating it, giving the victims a ring, screwing up their photos, and squeezing through the small TV set to order to creep them to death. We have to be given a good reason to accept all these crap! And what's the rationale for being able to escape Samara's attack by copying the tape to someone else? Totally absurd! With all these unanswered, the rest of the film becomes meaningless and irrational. As Ju On 2 did not provide these answers to Ju On 1, I doubted whether The Ring 2 will do the opposite.Is this the culture with Japanese viewers: enjoy to be scared but don't care to know why??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original (Ringu) was not bad, i gave it a 8/10 for an interesting plot, but this remake is really one of the worst i have ever seen. Imho even the special effects were better in the japanese version. And don't say i am just one of those moviefreaks who like boring and slow classics, the remake of Stanislav Lem's Solaris for example was quite enjoyable, giving a new perspective to the movie and i really recoommend watching both of the movies. When it comes to the ring/ringu my only advice is don't watch the ring before you have seen ringu, the original maybe slower and harder to understand but it has a LOT more to it. Watch the content of the killer-tape in Ringu and compare it to the content in The Ring ;) that should say it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie Review for The Ring By MaxDRoger Ebert said of the movie Pearl Harbor, that is was 'a two hour movie crammed into three.' I mention that only because Gore Verbinski, director of The Ring, performs a trick of time manipulation similar in scope and power. He manages to make two hours seem like four. Essentially he has crafted a test of human mental endurance: How long can a mind be subjected to the insanely boring?The Ring tells the tail of a cursed videotape that kills who ever watches it precisely seven days post viewing. Whoever watches the tape gets a phone call right after the tape ends. A whispery voice, says 'Seven days.' (It is interesting that every one who gets this call knows that it means they have only seven days to live. No one ever thinks to ask, 'Seven Days what? Who is this?). Our heroes are a divorced single-mother of a withdrawnchild-professional-journalist-torn between her career and motherhood-type, a withdrawn child who draws weird pictures and is mildly psychic, and the slacker-video expert ex-husband. The journalist is put on the case by a grieving sister confused by the mysterious circumstances of her daughter's death. 'You ask questions its what you do.' Says the grieving sister to the journalist. Great. From there on we know that at the very least the journalist and the withdrawn boy-who draws eerie premonitory pictures will see the tape. That much does not shock us. What is shocking is the fact that no one takes the news, 'seven days', too hard. We might expect this from the journalist, she is used to working with deadlines, but what about the kid? Or how about the slacker ex-husband? In fact no one really gets too worked up about it at all.The Ring begins much the same way Scream, a superior movie to be sure, did, with one minor variation. Instead of one young teenage girl alone in a big house out in the middle of nowhere, there are two. Actually there are other variations in this scene. For instance, Verbinski opted to substitute snappy dialogue with the utterly banal. He also managed to remove any tension or malice from the opening scene or any scene. We, the audience, are never scared, we are never made to jump, and we never, ever care.What is on the cursed tape? It is supposed be like someone's nightmare. However it is full of images that are not as menacing, disturbing or scary as they could be. I will not bore you with the details I wish the film had not bored me with them. Actually I will bore you with one detail. Embedded in the images are the all clues an enterprising journalist with a mildly psychic son, and a video expert ex-husband need to unravel the motives, and origin of the malevolent force behind the tape. The son however is no help at all. While he is obviously in contact with the malevolent force, and could provide some valuable information to the other heroes, he is a clich.He is the disturbed boy who voices his deeper revelations through cryptic drawings. This means that to the rest of the cast he will only speak in sentence fragments, nods and grunts while trying hard to look mysterious and somewhat beyond.The mistake Gore Verbinski makes, well the most important one anyway, was to think he had a film more important than he really did. At the heart of this film is a Friday night teen horror flick. He misses this and instead tries to make a film that is deeper, and more mysterious. He cannot do this because he is, after all, working the script he was given. The result is a ponderous film, that tries to beat into you, with clichd shot after clichd shot (the film uses every cinematic convention in the horror filmmaker's arsenal), that it is a film with depth and originality. On top of that he steals from truly engaging suspense/horror films: Psycho, Halloween, The Exorcist, Scream, The Sixth Sense. I am sure I am missing others, but I hope you will not fault me their omission. After all, about 20 minutes before the film was to roll the blessed credits, I had pulled out my cell phone and began playing brick attack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why The Ring &lt;&lt; Ringu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To put it simply where Ringu was elliptic, The Ring is a heavy-handed horror flick. Ringu mastered a blend of horrific fantasies with simple reality. The shuffling pace of its horror perfectly fitted the narrative structure: 'We want to know, to know only. But we have to experiment...'Yes, this is kind of the same premise as most slasher movies like, say, Scream 3. The difference is Ringu concentrated on it, leaving behind every over-used scheme, building its story and its rhythm over the journalist's investigation. The Ring drifts from this, focusing not on the journalist's investigation but on the journalist herself, her lovely sixth-sense lucid little boy and, last but not least, her dull-blank ex-boyfriend. But developing the central character is definitely not the point: it's all about the horror itself, stupid!'It's a remake, dude! Let's make it thoroughly understandable and bigger than life.'Producing an American version means lots of out-of-the-box rough-tunings. So first they build the story around Naomi Watts, director Verbinski revels in nice close-ups of his star all along her 'seven day pitch'. Then they used every narrative and horror cheap trick available. Of course they jumped on the opportunity to build up that little boy that sees. In the way they designed a sad witness for the source of horror (oh, the poor cursed father!). The horror cheap tricks are mainly expensive special effects: sophisticated ugly make-up and some digital stuff, all ringing out of tune.Eventually where is the horrific suggestive strength of Ringu? Why alleviate the original ending after dragging these leaden ballasts all along? When a movie/book is good enough there's no room for an adaptation. But I must be wrong since The Ring gathered more than $100m.</fullReview>

When I was watching I could see the genius at work, the close ups of Samara's ripped fingernail beds, and her water logged toes. Oh and don't forget the tape! The disturbing objects in her "loft" and the insects were just the best cinematography I probably I have seen in my life. Also the fuzzy television was lovely, and killing people by scaring them, brings a new freshness into the movie world. I just have to say that no movie makes me want to be smothered and pushed down a well like this one!!! Samara Morgan will become one of the classic horrifying murderers with her counterparts: Michael Meyers, Jason, Freddy Krueger, and Leather Face. Everyone should experience this amazing work, it is the best I have seen in years. All I want to say is that wearing a stained white gown and having Maryjane's that are too tight is the hottest look, of the season, can you say Fall 2008! This Movie is life changing and everyone should see it before you die! 7 days!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems as if every decade needs an iconic horror figure. Be it the 1970's Alien, 1980's Freddy Krueger or the 1990's I Know Why You Screamed Last Summer at the Scary Movie thingy. Come the first decade of the 2000's and you get Samara ? the creepy, crawling, neglected young girl who haunts people through video tapes and slithers out of TV screens.The effective 2002 American remake to the Japanese hit strikes a chord every time I watch it and still gives me the Willies every time I re-watch it on cable or DVD. It's a healthy mixture between thrillers and horror films, serving chilling delights for its target audiences on each and every twist and turn. It's almost hard to believe that the charming 17-year-old Daveigh Chase is also the girl behind the voice of Lilo &amp; Stitch's Lilo. That thought alone scares more than this wonderfully horrific must-see ever will.Anyways, this film is highly recommended, but don't try watching it alone (or answering the phone while you're at it).</fullReview>

We began to watch and got through roughly half of it before one of our kids woke up and we had to hit the STOP button. Up to this point, the movie seemed to click along...Production was slick, acting/direction were well done, and the story seemed to be going somewhere...we went to bed without finishing... The next evening, my wife and I licked our chops in anticipation of the last 1/2...Our Heroine made it to the source of the terror and then...EVERYTHING started to fall apart! By the time the movie ended, my wife and I were clueless and angry! Someone drop me an email and explain what happened...I can't find a reason other than the Hollywood clich that the Horror Film has to grab you and shake you at the end and leave you with a question...The problem here was - We had too many darn questions!!!The Ring involves a supernatural videotape that will kill anyone who watches it in 7 days...The video is strange...paranormal; time code on it doesn't track and attempts to decipher it by our heroine leave more questions than answers...After you watch the tape, you get a creepy phone call telling you "SEVEN DAYS"... Our heroine Watts watches the tape after a relative's daughter dies after also seeing it...Watts' clock starts ticking. Since she's a darn good investigative reporter, she uses her time left to research the video's origins to try to find an escape... It's a neat premise but the story ultimately goes in the wrong direction, trying find pragmatic answers to the how and why. In doing this, too much that is abnormal (and there's a lot of it) is left hanging...and of course, we get the contrived "ending within an ending" that's been done a million times. We were hoping for so much more! Oh well...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Seattle newspaper reporters (Naomi Watts) cousin dies seven days after watching a video. The video contains grainy, weird, frightening images and, after viewing it, you get a phone call saying "seven days". Seven days later, you die. Watts hears this but doesn't believe it. She gets a copy of the tape, views it, then the phone rings...The plot is intriguing (and based on a 1998 Japanese film). Also the movie takes itself very seriously and there's (thankfully) no stupid comic relief. Also Watts gives a powerhouse performance as does David Dorfman playing her really creepy little son. There's no gore, very little blood and the scares are mostly quiet ones. I usually love horror movies like that. This one just misses the mark.The plot is way too intelligent for its own good (I got confused by the end). It throws in a very frightening twist at the end that I didn't buy at all, and leaves lots of loose ends hanging. Still, for 99% of the way, it works. It's worth seeing just for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before you judge The Ring remake, you should see the original Jap version which is clearly one of the scariest movies ever made. Gore Verbanksi and Ehren Kruger have made a decent remake with beautiful cinematography and a great performance by Namoi Watts. The little boy who played Aidan also gave a great performance. The film isn't extemely scary but it is tense and keeps you on the edge of your seat during some points. Dreamworks cut out a lot of the scares and a subplot involving Chris Cooper that would have resolved the film more. Hopefully the sequel which we know is coming will have the oringial Japanese writer involved. I give it *** out of ****.</fullReview>

Naomi Watts reacts to all the grim happenings with the same look of wide-eyed astonishment, but she's a grounded, approachable actress and an attractive presence, the best actor in the picture.

		<shortDescription>A video that has not been made, but watched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to suggest a solution of what the ring in "The Ring" is, around which two long movies circle. Many watchers may have asked themselves WHO after all has made the mysterious video-tape with this "freaky stuff" in it (quotation). In "The Ring" I, Noah wonders in the presence of Rachel that their copy isn't a copy (because of the scrambled code-numbers), moreover, in the scene where the lady is combing her hair one does not see the shadow of the camera, which one would expect. Not even the filmed persons' shadows can be seen in the pictured mirrors, etc. The worst thing, however, is, that the fly that appears in the tape is mirror-inverted when Rachel sees her the first time. When she sees her the second time, she comes even out of the picture. It is clear, that the latter event is meant to prepare what will happen in "The Ring II" (2005), namely persons being able to transcend the con-texture-border between screen-inside and screen-outside reality. Actually, this phenomenon will be THE horror motive of the Ring II. But therefore, let us stick with the lacking shadows and the "inverted" fly. Another most interesting question is that obviously, Samara's father was not the film-maker, since there will be more films after his suicide, especially during the whole "Ring II".I therefore suggest as a solution that the authors of "The Ring" have used a seldom semiotic paradox, namely a sign without "thetic" introduction. Normally, every sign has to be "thetically" introduced, i.e. declared as a sign (the knot in your handkerchief, f.ex.). A sign is only a sign when there is somebody who declares it a sign. Sign do not exist in nature like eggs, boulders of water. Now, theoretically, one could think of a sign that consists only of a sign-carrier, an object, and, instead of the introducer of the sign, of at least one interpreter. Such a sign-model, at least in theory, fulfills the requirement of Peirce that a triadic sign relation is established. In other words: The mysterious video-tape in "The Ring" is a film that has never been made - but only watched. Consequently, what is shown on the tape cannot concern the past (like in normal movies), but must concern the future. And this is exactly what is happening in "The Ring": Rachel sees the lady, the mirror, the man standing on the upper level of the house, the burning tree, the worms ... and at the end the "ring" itself.If this interpretation of mine is correct - and I have no doubts that it is allowed to impute such a high form of metaphysics to whoever wrote the script - , then this movie deserves not only 10 points but needs to be welcomed in the exclusive club of those seldom products of entertainment industry which have truly brought forward scientific thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent remake of a great Japanese chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd seen the Japanese original a few times but had not seen the American remake until it was on television a couple of days ago. I hadn't bothered watching it sooner as I assumed it wouldn't have anything to say which the original hadn't already said; while I prefer the original this was better than I expected and had some decent chills.As in the original the film opens with two school girls talking about a mysterious video tape which after viewing you only has seven days to live. One of the girls had seen the tape when she went with a group of other friends to a remote mountain cabin the previous weekend. Soon strange things start happening, the television turns itself on and something happens which scares to death the girl who saw the tape and leaves the other so scared she has to be put in a mental hospital. This would have been put down to a mere tragic occurrence had the dead girls cousin not been a reporter who thought something strange was going on and overheard the tape being talked about during the funeral. Rachel, the reporter, heads up to the cabin and finds the tape which being sceptical she watches then gets a phone call telling her she has a week to live. She takes the tape back to work to examine it more thoroughly. She lets her ex husband see the tape when he insists he can help her.When they examine the tape they see that there are references to something that happened on an island several years before where many horses appeared to deliberately drown themselves and the woman who owned them committed suicide, she goes there and finds the house in the tape where the woman's widower still lives, he does not want to talk about his daughter however...Anybody who has seen the original will have a good idea of what to expect although there are quite a few changes which will either irritate the viewer or make them think it gives the film a degree of freshness. I preferred the way it was done in the original although that may just be a matter of taste. Naomi Watts put in a fine performance in the lead roll and Brain Cox is excellent as always in his small role as the man on the island. I was less keen on the way Rachel's ex was portrayed, he seemed far too laid back. The character of the reporter's son also seemed to have been changed unnecessarily, originally he was just an ordinary child but here he has some unexplained psychic connection to the cause of all the trouble.If you like a good scare without having to see lots of gore then this is worth watching on television although I'd recommend getting the original instead if you are planning to make a purchase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great ideas somehow lead to a mediocre movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit I was really excited about seeing this movie. Those who shared my opinions about movies on the IMDb have regularly cited THE RING as being a classic movie in the vein of such movies as THE EXORCIST or a proper horror movie (when the citation is provided in comments related to movies I hated such as JEEPERS CREEPERS). As such, I felt I was being provided with some good reliable advice. Unknowingly I was in for such a huge disappointment.Indeed, THE RING proved to be an even bigger disappointment for me than THE HAUNTING (the original not the remake).The plot of THE RING is as follows - people come into possession of a videotape that when viewed leads to their death 7 days after. This idea is great on paper and indeed the movie does take some positive steps to bring this concept to life.In the movie's favour are some excellent scenes that one never sees coming. These scenes are bolstered by some decent camera-work and suspense music in the background. The producers take the wise path of psychological horror - the movie is devoid of gore, silly CGI-generated monsters and speedied up action sequences that most movies from its time are notorious for. It was for perhaps these reasons that people perceive it as a classic. But the view of such people is misplaced - THE RING is not a classic, just something better than many movies of its time. This was the case until SAW came along to become what is easily the best movie of the 2000s decade.But I return to the good points about THE RING. A good performance from the lead actress, Naomi Watts, helps the proceedings. The young actor playing the kid with psychic powers, David Dorfman, deserves a special mention.Unfortunately, the material the actors are forced to work with is devoid of sustained suspense, tension or emotion. THE RING is certainly NOT scary. I will make a few comparisons to other movies to illustrate what THE RING should have contained.- Fear of the unknown. THE RING touches upon this important element of psychological horror but without success. We don't know where the videotape came from, who made it or who is controlling the malevolent forces leading to the deaths of its viewers. Too many unanswered questions, too many scenes of boredom and too many inconsistencies in tone ensure the idea falls flat. In contrast, THE EXORCIST was successful in this respect because the unknown element was the demon possessing Regan. We didn't know what it was, where it came from, or what it would do next. We knew the child was suffering but didn't know just what was going on inside. For these reasons, THE EXORCIST rightly retains the status of a classic horror movie, even 36 years after its release.- Fear of impending doom. THE RING brings to us the idea of someone knowing they will die in 7 days time. But, there is no reaction from characters put in this position. Not one character seems to be scared by the risk of death. As such, the fear of impending doom is non-existent, even though this should be the main aspect to carry the movie. In contrast, THE OMEN shows us how the fear of impending doom creeps up on the characters. We know these characters are doomed, they become scared, they turn on one another, they seek answers from the Holy Bible, they trace their steps back to find out where the malevolent force originated from and try to prevent disaster.- A malevolent force to battle against. THE RING reveals a malevolent force that is behind the deaths of those watching the notorious videotape. The force is a young girl named Samara but she has no identity, no motives and no direction. She is just an evil girl who kills because she sees herself as being ignored. Good effects are used to make the girl seem freaky but we never find out HOW she kills these people. Also, her connection to the videotape itself is very unclear. In contrast, THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE provides a malevolent force in the form of a family of psychopaths. We know they once worked in a slaughterhouse and somehow turned from killing animals to killing humans. The menacing spectre of Leatherface and the symbols of death in the family's house consistently haunt us. It draws us in and never lets us out. We also know how they kill.- Appropriate ending. THE RING doesn't even have a proper ending. Due to the subject matter and the concepts brought to the screen, the producers were unable to go for the usual Hollywood-style happy ending where everyone turns out to be fine, the monsters are dead, malevolent forces are banished and everyone lives happily ever after. So what did the producers do? They just stopped the movie. In other words, there is no ending. In contrast, who could forget the ending of Alfred Hitchcock's classic, PSYCHO? In PSYCHO, Norman Bates is shown to have a split personality and by the end, his sane half has lost the battle. The final scene of that movie remains one of the most disturbing committed to film and is certainly no happy cop-out ending. This is just one reason why PSYCHO remains one of the greatest horror/suspense movies of all time.I have used four classic horror movies as examples to illustrate where THE RING borrowed ideas from and what it aimed to be but failed to be. Its success was due purely to timing of its release.In short, THE RING is a very over-hyped, mediocre movie that I do not recommend. Instead, I would advise readers of my comment to check out the classics I have outlined if they have not already done so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does It Have a Happy or Sad Ending?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the movie half way through and any movie that kills a teenager at the beginning, (Slightly better than killing a kid) is probably not going to be mainstream stuff. About a half an hour in to it I went to IMDb to see if I could figure out if it was going to have a happy or sad ending. I read about 30 comments and could not figure it out. It was compared to the Blair Witch Project a couple times and so I decided to stop watching as I was afraid it was going to having a sad disappointing ending to it like the Blair Witch did.There should be some sort of rating system that let viewers know ahead of time if good or evil is going to win out.</fullReview>

So why isn't this. I had to watch it in school because we're doing a Media project and this was absolute shi* It's not scary, it's not that intense and all me mates in class hated it. And who can blame them! I actually thought it would be good but it wasn't. The only bit that entertained me from killing myself was when Samara (what a shi* name) comes out the TV and kills the man. Apart from that it was rubbish. The stupid woman (Noami Watts) keeps on making copies of the film and then watches them! She even makes a copy so that her son watches it. Doesn't the fuc*ing phrase 'You will die in seven days' scare her! Overall this was shi* 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this was definitely not the worst horror film (or "psychological thriller", as some have erroneously dubbed it) I've ever seen, it most certainly is not worthy of "scariest film ever" status. It's creepy and strange, but also totally hokey and full of plot holes. This is basically a teenage-level horror film that's pretending to be much more. It's an insult to the viewer's intelligence, as well as actual psychological thrillers like pretty much any Hitchcock, or more recently "The Sixth Sense" and "The Others." My specific critiques are given below.*SPOILERS AHEAD* Firstly, the whole phone call thing. Lame. That was so unnecessary and was just plain silly. HOKEY. How many other scary movies did that plot point steal from? Creative.Second, the girl crawling out of the television. I seriously laughed out loud. That was supposed to be the scariest thing we've seen in a movie since "The Shining"? Please. It would have been much scarier if the people watching the video had gotten sucked into it.Third, the marbles forming in the shape of the arrow. Also laughed out loud there.Finally, and I think this was the main weakness of the movie. WHAT was Samara's motivation??? Up until the "twist", it at least seemed plausible that she was trying to be freed from her "dark place." But when it's revealed that she'd been hurting people *before* that and her fall into the well was the result, not the cause, of her misdeeds, everything just unravels. The whole POINT of the psychological thriller is to reveal *why* the person is doing what they're doing. They hinted that the circumstances around her birth were suspicious-- why couldn't they carry that out a bit-- was she the spawn of Satan? A demon? Was she conceived by some voodoo curse? For cryin' out loud, give us something to work with. The whole "Evil for evil's sake" is a cop out and totally uninteresting.I'd give it a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah.Kinda moody here and there, kinda liked the kid coming up out the well, liked the way she came out the TV. Nearly worked. Liked the flickery look of her, like she was made of TV. That was kinda cool.Liked the horse on the ferry, nearly worked with those worrying cellos thumping away a la "Jaws".But, um, its got that problem that movies have now, where everything's in the Modern Style, desaturated images, tastefully composed shots of grime and electric cables looking more like a still life in an art gallery than a scene from a movie, blurry shots of eeeevil Samara in the asylum, BEAUTIFULLY composed and tinted, making me think "oooh how tasteful and elegant" not "cripes, what a creepy little girl". My poor brain won't do "arrg scary" at the same time as it's doing "oooo tasteful". During that bit where they find her room in the barn with the cute little TV like something out of a spooooooky sort of Calvin and Hobbes strip (it had cutely angled little ariels like a friendly grasshopper) and the little carousel and her little bed all uniformly tinted in pale browns and faded sour creams I thought, how EVOCATIVE. How MYSTERIOUS. And how thoroughly FAKE LOOKING. Such a perfect, sweet little theatre set - it would have been beautiful on a stage but in the movie it just looks like something that would have been beautiful on a stage.If you over-stylise these things, they stop being scary and just become static, like images in a gallery. They're lovely to look at, but why not just make images and put them in a gallery? They'd work better and probably actually be scarier. It's fine to overdo the interior deco in a fantasy film or a comedy or a sci fi flick, but not a horror movie, horror movies have to be real, nail-scrapingy, eye-bulgingly real. Reality isn't tasteful or well-composed. Or cunningly tinted to look older than it is.Having said all that, the girl coming out the TV nearly worked, because it's supposed to be supernatural.Guys, horror movies have rules.Also, no, no, no, filmmakers, don't add pointless subplots about parents trying to reunite for the sake of their kid. It's a horror movie, not a chick flick.3 stars, all 3 for Samara coming out the well, which, had I been significantly younger and had seen fewer horror movies, would probably have been quite scary.</fullReview>

Seriously.The Ring is a supernatural thriller that is rich with plenty of dark atmosphere and stylish direction, but it's a film that has its share of flaws as well. The biggest flaw is in the writing department, as we are given a seemly silly premise, yet it is never really explained. Logic really falls short, too short for satisfaction. Even worse the finale is over-longed in the coming, although it does have an admittedly great scare.Naomi Watts is the best of a pretty decent cast.So all around this hit thriller is worth a watch, but it's really not as good as some are writing it up to be.** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

Upon answering it, that person is told he/she will die in seven days. Okay, here is a logical point: if you watch the video, DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE. Unplug it. Or use your cell phone. Or better yet don't watch the tape at all. I could not stand the ignorance of the people in this movie. Would this 'threat' call cell phones as well? If not, unplug the land line &amp; use the cell phone to your heart's content. If you want to see this movie, fine. But don't expect logic. It doesn't exist here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary and eerie with what you'd expect out of a film like this but The Ring is an overall failure of forced horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea that you watch a video tape, receive a phone call and then die within a week of engaging in these two events is an interesting idea but at the same time, not that scary ? what is it that's going to cause you to die that is so scary you can't get medical or authoritarian help? But that's what The Ring is; a film that doesn't rely on character logistics or 'what should be done in that situation' but rather relies on eeriness and uncanny things to get across its scares.I will not deny that The Ring is scary because it is a very unnerving and creepy film ? although there's no violence or gore, I was still finding myself looking away from the screen once or twice but I realised afterwards that this was due to the fact I had absolutely no idea what it was I was dealing with in the film. If you were to make a ten second film of someone opening a creaky old door, going inside to a pitch black room whilst all the time having eerie music playing over the events and really dark lighting over the images, you'll probably find your audience looking away merely because they don't know who any one is, why what's happening IS happening and what's going to pop out at them. This is The Ring to a tee.The Ring is a horror film that takes a detective route and the character of Rachel Keller (Watts) takes on the detective role in a rather tired way. The introduction to the video tape in question is a very brief and rather crude way of setting up the events ? no, I don't believe that fate would have one girl mention 'the tape' literally minutes before the other girl would succumb to its curse and no, I don't believe that characters at the funeral would be able to free roam their way through the bedroom where the death happened since it should be a crime scene, but there is no help in the form of authoritarian figures, remember? This is a world without police and the FBI to investigate strange occurrences which is ironic because at times, The Ring does feel like an episode of The X Files.Once it's established that this tape exists, The Ring turns into a film that relies on its breaking of everyday rules to crank up suspense. I mentioned the bedroom/crime scene occurrence which shouldn't have even happened because people wouldn't have been allowed up there. Also, the car ferry scene where a horse bolts from its carriage due to Keller's presence; again, it shouldn't have happened because once a car ferry starts moving, passengers aren't allowed on the car deck. As it was, that scene was self-motivated by the character of Keller (who could've stepped away when the horse got agitated) and turned out to be rather unpleasant.The film consists of Keller and her sidekick Noah Clay (Henderson) attempting to solve the case of the tape whilst avoiding the uncanny events that happen in-between every now and again. These include the horse/ferry scene, the taking of a fly from the video, nose bleeds, flashing images from the video itself and a creepy Sixth Sense-come-Omen type male child who the film relies on to get most of the uncomfortable atmosphere across; needless to say it works but on a basic level. Why anything's actually scary in The Ring is because you will not have too much of an idea to what is going on. The confusing plot that only really becomes clear in the final fifteen minutes merely toils on your mind more and more as each eerie scene goes past ?being able to cope with the scares and with the working out of the plot is hard work. The fact the film makers have a license to include just about anything in the form of scares doesn't help too much.I found the finale of the film a little disturbing but only because Keller involves her child in a way that I didn't think was necessary in fact The Ring ends rather downbeat and more like a tragedy when it becomes clear what the motivation of the tape actually is. The Ring has its scares and maybe two jumps at the most but this is very much a case of seen it - don't need to see it again.</fullReview>

The ending is also unsatisfying &amp; really nothing more than a set up for it's sequel. All in all, if you like slow moving horror movies, this one might be up your alley, however if you don't I'd advise you skip this one.

		<fullReview>Many critics heaped praise on this film, some even calling it the scariest film since "The Exorcist". I can name several horror films that were far more scarier than this film. Is it is a good horror movie? Yes. A great one? I don't think so. "The Ring" is just as overrated and devoid of scares as "The Blair Witch Project". If you want a good scare, I suggest horror films like "The Omen", "Suspiria", "Rosemary's Baby", and "The Changeling". "The Ring" isn't a patch on these horror classics."The Ring" is obviously a remake of a 1998 Japanese film called "Ringu", which is a much better and scarier version. I liked some things about this film--the sense of foreboding and atmosphere of the film, the background score, most of the performances. I thought Naomi Watts gave a fantastic performance, as did David Dorfman, who plays Noami's creepy young son. Brian Cox and Jane Alexander were both quite effective in their small roles. Daveigh Chase gives a chilling performance as Samara. I didn't like Martin Henderson's performance. I thought it was rather empty. All in all, "The Ring" is a good horror film, but its not really that scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't see this movie! I'm telling you, don't see this movie, especially at night when it's raining and you've got the lights out. Although "The Ring" has one of my favourite actresses in it, don't see it. Naomi Watts is terrific in so many ways and very convincing as Rachel. Still, the movie should not be seen. It's terrible! I do think that either the director or the writers knew about Luis Bun~uel and Salvador Dali's "Andalusian Dog" because the video tape that Rachel is told not to see, but sees anyway, seems very much modeled on that early surrealist film. "Andalusian Dog" (1929) has its ants, while the video within "The Ring" has its fly."The Ring" is the scariest ghost movie you'll ever see, which is why you shouldn't see it. It ranks up there with my favourite FRANKENSTEIN-themed film, "The Fly". In terms of "The Ring"'s fright potential, it is unequaled. It's well acted, well scripted and the music assists foreboding mood, rather than getting in the way."The Ring" could have been titled: "Sleepless Around Seattle". Calling it, "The Ring" gives it a Wagnerian tone. But no, this ring heralds a phone call. You pick up the receiver and some insomniac child from a 'village of the damned' will tell you that you only have seven days to live because you watched her personal "Un chien andalou". Samara will come, 'uninvited' to visit you in seven days. Don't risk this. Don't see "The Ring".</fullReview>

Then later they showed a bridge that she is driving across to get to the island and it was Deception Pass Bridge and I screamed because it is a landmark of Whidbey Island.

I'm giving no spoilers away here, but the ending was a bit anticlimactic, and the final explanation wasn't that great. Maybe if the screenwriter had foreshadowed it a bit more in the script it could have been better.However, the ending is the only thing that keeps me from giving this movie 10/10.

		<shortDescription>Not scary enough, but still good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie tells the story of Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), a journalist who's niece has died of mysterious causes. Rachel wants to find out what these causes are, so, on a tip from her niece's friends, she seeks out a videotape that is said to kill those who watch it exactly seven days after seeing the tape. Inevitably she watches it and has 7 days to discover its secrets.The Ring is not so much scary as creepy and it spends so much time being creepy that, near the end, I expected it to be scarier, and when it wasn't, I felt let down. The Ring tells a good story and it sets itself up for a big payoff at the end, a climax that should have been very frightening, but in the end, rather than being terrified speechless, I asked my sister, who had already seen it, "Is that all?" Now don't get me wrong, I liked the movie and I can't say that I wasn't scared for most of it. It's definitely worth seeing for those of us who like to scare the crap out of ourselves, but don't expect to be crapless when this movie is over.</fullReview>

But so far as the story, i think it is excellent. Just the texture and how every single clue just fits in like a jigsaw puzzle. it stinks about how its a cliffhanger. I've never seen the original version, and after seeing the remake, i think it would be awkward. The video tape is freaky though,i wish someone would make a movie like that and as a joke, pass it around the world. Just a thought.

		<fullReview>This one of my least favorite movies. So I'll try to make this review less abusive as possible to those who do like it.The Ring is about a mysterious video when it's viewed by someone they die within 7 days. After a girl dies within 7 days a single mom who works for a newspaper watches the video and doesn't find it possible for a strange video cassette to kill people for watching it.Within the next few days on investigating the single mom finds a lot of strange things going on. And soon believes that she will die soon enough.But with a lot of studying from the video and investigating she's close from solving this mystery.It's not my kind of movie. Probably because I'm not obsess with these kind of movies. But don't take my word for it, if you like Strange Thriller flicks then you might like this. Rent it or borrow it from a friend.Course one of the good things about this movie is they have Daveigh Chase from "Lilo and Stitch" &amp; "Spirited Away" playing a role in this movie.</fullReview>

Shelter Mountain Inn. But it seems that the rumors at Revere High are true. As Rachel is horror struck after watching the tape when she found it at shelter Mountain Inn, the phone mysteriously rings.......Coninsidense right? But no, the one on the phone was none other than Samara, the evil girl on the tape.Is this the end of Racheals life? Can she unlock the secrets of the tape and stop it from killing her, and can she send Samara back to peace? Only she can find out, no one else can....Basic summary of The Ring, but the plot is much better than how I have explained it, but beware.... Be ready for anything!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK.For those of you reading my history of comments. You know how we're gonna do this.I'm gonna keep this short and to the point like macaroni.PRO's- the scare factory is producing chills and screams in this movie, DIFFERENT in a good scary way, immersive, scary in a strange-thats-not-right way.CON's- I'm 24 and my brother is 26... this movie scared him. So you tell me... is there a con about a movie that scares your big brother??? I don't think so.Like i said before... it scared my brother which is a plus plus. It didn't scare me though. Maybe there's something wrong with me. Anycase the movie is good horror movie and to me this is the only horror movie out there. All other scary movies are not scary at all.Watch this movie and wait 7 days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought This movie was so awesome! It wasn't scary though but i still thought it was totally great. Like the little girl coming out of the TV was kinda freaky and some of the people who died were kinda gruesome but yeah it was so cool. It was suspenseful and I really thought that made the movie even better. Some parts I don't think made very much sense but i mean lots of horror\\thrillers are like that and I never know what going on at parts. So The Ring i thought was 10\10 because of all of the above. I don't wanna spoil it so I'm not gonna say the favorites and stuff but just for all you readers out there who are obviously reading this just so you know this movie rocks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw this in the theatre because I was a fan of the Koji novel and thought the Ringu series kind of was...ummm...lacking. On a recent Saturday night, bored in my flat, I decided to give her a look. And what a sexy beast this film is. The script is a mess, but the visual style of gore verbinski has made me a believer of anything he directs. The horse/boat scene alone is worth ten pounds...some sequences freaked my knickers and I wondered how this got a 15 certificate over here. Overall, this is an outstanding visual feast. The acting is top notch and Brian Cox is a delight to see in most anything. Naomi is as beautiful as ever and Martin Henderson seems to be a decent up and coming actor as long as he stays away from dreck like that motorcycle flick he did a couple years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is really exciting to see and does not have much useless gory scenes for scaring the audience. all the thrill is from wanting to know how the movie ends and not from screaming and blood squirting all over the place. the audience mostly start to care about what happens to the characters. if you want to see major blood and screaming, this isn't the movie for you, but if you just want a thrill, this is a great movie. it is very scary lots of times and have special moments that you will remember for a long time. this movie would really be recommanded for watching with a bunch of friends on a rainy day. it would definitely give you a big scare, but with friends there, you probably won't have trouble sleeping. although, if you are the type of person that is very gullible, this movie probably have some moments that seem too realistic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did You Make a Copy? The Ring, directed by Gore Verbinski, redefines the horror storyline many people expect in movies today. This film is a remake of the Japan film The Ringu and exceeds it by far. The Ring is creepy, haunting, and mesmerizing all while staying within the PG-13 rating standards. Audiences leave the movie with a genuine feeling of fright and unease. The story follows a young woman and her son discovering a VCR tape which appears to be the cause of many frightening deaths, including the niece of the central character. After discovering her niece's boyfriend died the same night and in a similar fashion, Rachel (Naomi Watts) begins to question the nature of their fatalities. Her inquiries lead her to a mysterious tape she soon watches.Rachel then begins to research the origin of the tape, and discovers she is experiencing many of the same things she viewed on the tape. Her son Aidan (David Keller) and her close friend Noah (Martin Henderson) watch the tape also. The movie includes a viewing of the tape, and it is frightening. The images are disturbing, and the tape is grainy and surreal. It creates an overall feeling of fright. Rachel, Aidan, and Noah work towards discovering an answer for their impending deaths. This includes visiting a mental hospital and the area the tape was filmed at.The Ring is truly a unique viewing experience. I was scared of the dark for several nights after watching it. The movie depicts a frightening, unnerving story without using the usual amounts of blood, gore, and extreme frontal nudity-- all of which have become standard practice when creating a horror show. I believe this movie is astounding and should be regarded as a major motion-picture breakthrough. The Ring is in a genre of its own, delivering great screams and still staying easy on the stomachs of the viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was certainly a very strange and mysterious film with creepy old houses and very depressing rain that never seemed to stop. There was a VCR tape that was shown and it had all kinds of symptoms to a mental disorder in someone's brain or at least it seemed that was the intent. There was a very strange part of the film where a horse breaks loose on a Ferry Boat going across a large body of water and forgets he is not on a race track, like the BIG A and decides to cause all kinds of problems to the cars and people on this unlucky ride. If you watch Television it just might be your last view of the BOOB TUBE in that particular Barn or Old Shack of a House. Hope you enjoy the ending of the film, it will knock your socks OFF !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric horror at its best **SPOILERS**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring is not only one of the best horror films in recent years, but also one of the best remakes. Contrary to some truly awful remakes, such as The Fog, The Ring does not drown (no morbid pun intended) in ridiculous back stories and unnecessary characters. Instead, director Gore Verbinski takes the Japanese Ringu and transfers the story's elements to the Western world, without having the narrative lose any of its dread. While Hideo Nakata's original may have presented the fear in a more subtle manner, mostly using the actors' reactions and the imagined rather than seen, Verbinski presents it by way of gloomy, tense cinematography, music that hints at the unexpected horror right around the corner and locales that do not exactly spell out domestic bliss. Simply put, Verbinski is not attempting to translate Ringu; he is adapting the Japanese film in a new way and fully succeeding at conveying its themes of urban loneliness, parental worry and, of course, its supernatural aspects.Needless to say, I loved the rainy, shadowy atmosphere of Seattle. Had the story been set anywhere else, the menace of the piece would have been lost. The dark weather also adds to the ending, further accentuating Samara's evil intentions.The acting is good all around. Naomi Watts is great as a serious, rational reporter who has to confront an unbelievable, yet very real danger, all the while protecting her son. Martin Henderson also strikes a chord as a not-quite-grown-up father, whose outlook is also changed by the deadly video tape.An excellent horror film, made even better by its underlying socio-cultural themes and unique imagery.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no idea what this movie was about when my brother took me to see it so I had no idea what to expect. There are scary movies that have startling scenes, there are scary movies that will creep you out, then there are scary movies that keep you awake at night. This was all three. I was actually sinking in my seat and hiding behind my jacket while watching.The plot is that of a video that if you watch you then only have seven days to live. The concept of a "killer video" is new to me and it was played out very well up until the very end. The movie was chronicling the seven day hell that the main character, Rachel (Naomi Watts) was going through before her demise. You could feel every bit of fear and anxiety she was experiencing as she tirelessly tried to find out how to prevent her untimely death. As she clamored for answers and got closer to the meaning of this video tape she had more and more inexplicable events happen to her. The movie was only made better and more intense by not going the traditional route of discovering the injustice to stop the suffering. The Ring is a must see for scary movie enthusiast, the scariest movie I've seen in years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I saw the movie together. We paid attention to what was going on. We _really_ paid attention. At times I felt a little twinge, but nothing like I did when I saw Linda Blair tearing into those priests and spewing pea-soup and walking down the stairs like a spider with blood gushing out of her mouth. The movie just flickered on and on and I thought it was never going to end. My wife said, "What's going on." I replied, "I don't have the foggiest." We didn't shiver. We didn't shake. No one in the audience made a sound. A few got up and left. But I paid my money and I almost never walk out during a movie. I mean, like, what is the matter with me? Am I the only person on the planet that didn't enjoy this flick? Did I miss something? My eyes were open the whole time. I didn't fall asleep, but wanted to. Compared to this, I thought _Blair Witch_ deserved ten stars. I swear I was totally sober through the whole movie. No drinking or drugs. I just didn't get it.

		<shortDescription>Damn fine horror film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I was skeptical because it was PG-13...because there is so many bad ones out there. I was VERY surprised to say the least. This movie had the atmosphere that makes a horror film...this to me goes into that tiny group of great PG horror films such as Poltergeist. Also knowing it was written by Ehren Kruger before I watched it made me a little biased because I despise so many of his works. But he did something right in this movie. It's still full of his little trademarks such as offbeat side characters and weird little metaphors here and there...but it worked this time. Also I think the masterful directing by Gore Verbinski made it a little better than it actually was. But who cares? It was good as hell. The acting was great by one of my favs Naomi Watts...she had the charisma to make her one of my favorite horror film heroines. She just had that classy presence on the screen and it worked wonders for the film. She shined is all I can say. The side characters all do very well...I won't get to into them...they were just pretty good. The antagonist of the film Samara was an interesting and awesome character...such rage and evil inside made her one of the most ruthless villains of all time. The directing was top notch by Verbinski...loved every thing he put into it. Tbe film just had the"look" to it that made it classy, scary, and beautiful all at once. The color palette was depressing and soggy...one of my favorite types of settings. SPOILERS: Also to add to its success were many freaky and really interesting scenes such as the horse on the ferry, Rachel's dream of coughing up that thing Samara wore in the hospital, the fly, the awesome Day 1,2,3..... title cards that made us feel the impending doom, interesting camera angles, wonderful use of a red tree against a gray sky, and I could go on and on. It just reminded me of a painting several times throughout. Once again great directing by Gore...no one could of done it better then he did.The writing by Kruger here was surprisingly good despite his usual clichs...but like I stated the clichs work here for some odd reason. I know this wasn't his idea. I know of the original Japanese versions and I have seen them...I'm really just not interested in them as much. Anyway, I know what Kruger added to the original story to make it his own. The writing on the Rachel character was very sharp, funny, and well wrought. She had great lines that made her more than just a standard horror heroine...she had that curiosity and timing just right. Also the characters had a very sharp way of speaking to each other. As with Kruger's other films, the characters sound a little to "smart ass" to be quite true. But again it worked here...the mixing of the script with Gore was a perfect match made in Heaven.I'll end this review hoping others out there will enjoy it as well. I know many have. Don't be discouraged because of other films such as The Grudge and the god awful Ring Two...in which Kruger's real skin showed. It is definitely one of the best "ghost" stories in years. One thing I can praise Kruger for was the simple line in which Rachel tells her angered boss after he threatens to fire her. It's the perfect introduction into a horror story.HARVEY: You're fired. RACHEL: No I'm not. HARVEY: YES you are. RACHEL: No I'm not...I'm cooking to good a story....then all hell breaks loose.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you switch your TV on and pop this DVD/cassette into the player, you could never imagine what things await you when you watch this film. Not only are the images extremely horrifying, the whole idea of the film sends shivers up your spine. In the film, a tape is featured that when watched, the victim dies in seven days. That right there is a skin crawling effect. Spookily good makeup artists bring the haunting character of Samara Morgan to life, and undead young girl gone bad. The whole affect of rotting flesh and the hair-in-front-of-the-face thing is creepy but extremely compelling. The Ring is just one of those Horror film prodigies you for sure won't want to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your television turns on by itself; the electricity flickers; water leaks under the door; then, a small, pale, decayed hand reaches for you out of the screen, grabs you, and pulls you in.This story is about a young journalist named Rachel Keller. Her niece, along with three friends, watch a cursed video that kills people exactly 168 hours (that's a week people!) after they watch it. When She then begins doing research on the video, and ends up watching it herself. She then starts seeing images from the tape in everyday life and starts to do research on the things in it. She comes across Moesko Island, the Morgans that lived there, and their mysterious daughter Samara. She begins to discover the story behind the tape.This movie is one of my absolute favourites! I, having seen several movies and read several books with completely static, two-dimensional characters, was amazed at how well the characters were developed, especially Samara. I also love the intensity and creepiness of it, and the fact that there is NO blood or gore, well except for the little nosebleed they all get, but seriously, that's ALL!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was the scariest horror movie I have ever seen. From the teen's dead face in the closet at the beginning to the girl crawling out of the well and then out of the t.v. at the end and everything in between made this movie great. I read the comment in the beginning and it said that it was just silly. All horror is silly because it is not based on reality, but what makes a movie horrifying is our imagination. You have to have imagination for most everything that comes out of Hollywood especially horror films. I am not known to be emotional, but this movie actually made me move farther back in my seat when Samara crawled out of the well. The screaming teenagers that were probably underage helped with the effect. The reason I didn't give it a 10 was because it was a little slow at times. I was very surprised that the Ring 2 was just as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror movies, ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror is my favorite genre, let me start off by saying that. With that being said, however, it is extremely hard to find good horror movies. They're often referred to as, 'horr-ible' movies, which a lot of the time, can be true of them, since a majority of the horror movies that come out are generally low-budget, bad casted, 'B' movies. But, this movie, was quite different. It captures attention right from the beginning, and doesn't let go of your fearful imagination, until the end credits role. There is non-stop intensity throughout the entire movie, and each puzzle piece, discretely and carefully makes its way into the film, without you realizing it until the end. Naomi Watts, wasn't exactly well-known before this movie came out, and it was somewhat of a surprise(at least to me), that after it came out, she became more prominent in the film industry. She was of course excellent in it, however it was the type of role, any mediocre actress could have played.The other big surprise that the film offered, was that it was originally a Japenease movie. Usually the remakes, either aren't as good, or don't do well, just simply because they were originally foreign. However, this movie definitely is much more different, and is on a completely different level then some of the others we're used to seeing, or hearing about.I loved it, and it's definitely one of the best, and one of my favorite, horror movies. It's not at all slow, just at the right pace, scary, yet more phsychological than bloody. And, although I loved 'Scream', and 'The Blair Witch Project', it's sort of a happy medium between the two. It's not as bloody as 'Scream', and yet not as mind-warping as 'Project'. It's again, in a league of its own, with scare tactics, and I give the film, and original creator of the whole idea, behind, 'The Ring' a standing ovation, for his efforts, in inventing the piece.Anyone who's a horror lover, will certainly take to this as well. But, I will warn the people who loved movies like, 'House of 1,000 Corpses'. This is not that kind of movie, and far from satanic, by any means. Of course, that always depends on each individual person's opinion on what satanic is. I feel, that it is not. And, I will let you know in other film reviews, what I consider to be satanic. Like, 'Corpses'...which I felt was satanic. But, again, this is not, and if you do like the other types, where all it would entail, is demonic possession, or bloody ouiji boards, and such...this is not that kind of movie.Check it out though, if you are a horror fan. It's a great watch, and it didn't do well, for nothing'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an amazing horror movie. I loved it from the start. I saw it by chance when Blockbusters didn't have 'hide and seek.' I watched it over break with my best friend Megs. We were at my grandparent's house at 1 in the morning and we got so freaked out. From the very beginning we had a creepy feeling. Every other minute we would check behind us to make sure no one was there. From Katie's death, me and Megs didn't sit more than a foot away from each other. This movie kept you on your guard the whole way through. There was exactly the right mix of suspense and revelations, and at the right times too. It was a true horror flick. All the way until Noah died, I was on the edge of my seat. One of the more memorable parts was when it showed Noah in his apartment and me and my friend were like "Oh, no he can't die, him and Rachel are supposed to get married again." (sorry, randomness) the creepiness of the dead faces was awesome, and not too overdone. Samara completely freaked me out, and mystified me at the same time. There were terrific performances by Naomi Watts, David Dorfman, Martin Henderson, and especially Daveigh Chase. In conclusion, this was a terrific horror film, and both me and my friend Megs recommend it and give it 10 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring is an excellent horror film - an adaptation of the brilliant Japanese film Ringu. Gore Verbinski does a great job directing this film, with an excellent performance by Naomi Watts and newcomer David Dorfman (he's the next big horror kid actor - after Haley Joel Osment). The reason I like this horror film is precisely because it's not B-movie style blood and guts horror - rather a smartly scripted psychological horror which only shows the scary elements when it is necessary and thus creates suspense (the same happened with Spielberg's Jaws - he smartly didn't "show" the shark until the very end of the film). Bring on The Ring 2! A solid 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My First Horror Movie! Still One Of My Favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, although this movie is only from 2002 it feels very nostalgic for me. I saw this movie when I was 12 and when I was still going to Eden Prairie so it has a lot of old memories attached to it.That's a little strange considering the film I'm reviewing is a terrifying shriek-fest that disturbed me for months. But this was my introduction to horror, so I suppose that's why I'm happy looking back on it.This film is not perfect. The acting is not of extremely high caliber (aside from Naomi as Racherl and Daveigh as Samara). Yet there is a magic beyond the film's outer layer that disturbs the senses. The noises of the tape are a good example of this, still frightening for me today.When I saw this film at my birthday party on Sept. 5th, 2005 it was the first time I had watched it in a very long time. I did not get extremely frightened by any of it except for the classic scene where Samara crawls out of the TV. But I'm sure you could predict that.However, I will never fully recover from this movie and I will never look at static the same way again. And I thank the makers of the movie for allowing me to do so. They turned a slightly cheesy Japanese movie into something oddly beautiful and disturbing at once. Something that brings out subconscious fears that we may have never known we had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply one of best 4 or 5 horror flicks ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an amateur film reviewer, I'm genuinely surprised by the number of individuals who rated this movie at an "8" or lower. Based on the very weird, surrealistic Japanese original, this film breaks the mold of the increasingly predictable, mega-redundant themes and settings of the horror genre in the US. Please... Visiting a good DVD rental shop with tons of horror flicks lined up together is truly depressing, so commonplace are nearly all productions from US companies.If one eliminates sci-fi "horror" films like the great "Alien" of 1979, then this film joins a very small select group, like "Night of the Living Dead," the remakes of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and Carpenter's "The Thing," and then moves decisively beyond them into some yet-to-be-defined new departure of eclectic imagination. Sure, a few of the scenes really stretch all credibility (as the contrived survival of a key player in one of several sequential "endings"), but the movement, complexity, and cast of characters in the work render this objection mostly innocuous. Strange, inexplicable occurrences simply remain flatly mysterious or ambiguous. The fly (not a spoiler). Yet the "shocking" scene in the scary, revelatory Edward-Munch-like house also shares in the tradition of somewhat conventional "build-up" scenes right out of "The Thing." Finally, unlike the wonderful "gotcha" resolution of "The Sixth Sense," this film concludes with an ominously open-ended question, actually giving the culminating terror a palpable, horrifying moral dilemma that requires no sequel whatever. This is utterly unique. And it simply isn't what American audiences pay good "horror" money to see, on screen or video.If this isn't a 10, folks, then I'd like to know one that's been made in the past ten years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked The Ring a lot because of its genuinely creepy atmosphere. The mood of the movie is dark, gray, and eerie, and that's why it is so appealing. So many horror movies today are so intent on shoving gore and depravity in your face (*cough Saw*) that its refreshing to watch a horror movie that just lets its spooky story creep under your skin. Everything from the water motif to the strange and disturbing videotape is scary and different enough to not feel totally clichd.That being said, its not free of clichs. There is a little boy who draws a lot of creepy pictures (like, um, every horror movie in recent history). For some reason this movie's clichs didn't bother me as much as usual, though, because unlike other movies, The Ring wasn't built on clichs, it just borrowed them for its story. The excellent score by Hans Zimmer also helps move the film along and add to its dark, heavy mood.A very enjoyable and fresh horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Ring" is a remake of "Ringu" in the most strict sense of the word. The story lines are almost identical. It's been a while since i placed close attention to the Japanese version, but a lot of its shots &amp; angles seem to have been copied as well.This sounds like a miserably failed nephew of Gus Van Sant's "Psycho 1998", but where a bloody shower was no recipe for quality, "The Ring" maintains a degree of tension throughout which elevates it above the original. Perhaps it accomplishes this mainly because of the Americanized (familiar) thrills &amp; storytelling and the polished look of the production. However I also find the background on the murder of the psychic girl to be more comprehensible. Her nature seems less predictable, which leaves room for a few last-minute plot twists. Agreed, in retrospective most of them are in line with "Ringu" again, but i'd assumed at that point we'd be taking a different path. Another nice altering was the cursed videotape itself: the images were closer related to the psychic girl's past, and with all the technical research involved, it plays a bigger part, lol. Viewed in a darkened television room on my own, this movie gave me genuine shivers. Few can claim that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Congratulations Hollywood for seeing that Japanese horror movies make money. I think I'd like to believe I speak for everyone when I say that you milked the cash cow a bit too much over the years. But I enjoyed The Ring. The American version explains more than the Japanese original and goes a bit deeper into the reasoning of the main antagonist.A bunch of students return from a retreat only to die a horrible death a week later. An investigative journalist thinks this story goes a bit deeper. She finds out that they all watched this videotape that kills you seven days to the minute you view it.Would you believe an idea like this? I felt like there was something missing from the American version. I couldn't be drawn into the suspense and terror that existed in Japanese. I think they did an excellent job in introducing Samara. And overall, the movie is well made and I would recommend it to anyone curious. Give it a try if you haven't seen it yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>' Disturbing '</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This horror film is definitely the most disturbingly psychological movie i have seen for a while. If little children with dark hair creep you out then maybe a film to avoid - yet i watched it. Samara a disturbed and neglected young girl haunts a video tape - If someone watches it they die in ' Seven Days ' -Naomi Watts places Rachel - mother of Adian. Her Niece watches the video tape and she notices creepy pictures in her bedroom and decides to investigate. She has no idea what shes getting herself into. The video itself i found weird and much different to what i expected. This isn't your typical horror it has a lot of twists and keeps you hanging on the edge of your seat or hiding behind it whichever. The Ring2 i thought Samara was more creepy in the way she acts and moves, yet the storyline seems abit teedias. I had to watch it a 2nd time to understand little bits. The first is better, because its unusual and no-one has achieved a movie like this. Acting from all the cast is very good. Naomi Watts succeeds in playing the worried mother figure very well. Worth seeing if you would rather have a decent storyline to your horror movie then i would recommend it. There isn't a lot of blood and gore but a disturbed girl crawling around trying to kill everything makes up for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly suspenseful thriller with supernatural undertones.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really had no intention of seeing "The Ring", but my public library is sending me "The Ring 2" next week, so I figured I'd better find out what the first movie was about. I wasn't expecting a lot, and got more than I was expecting. Even though it was late, and I was tired, I just couldn't quit watching. I believe everyone knows the basic premise -- people who watch a certain video die at 10PM exactly 7 days later.Naomi Watts is the main protagonist, Rachel, a reporter who's niece dies without explanation. She gets very interested when a teacher shows her drawings made by her small son, days before the death of his cousin, showing her buried. (Watts, a Brit raised in Australia, is one of the few who can do a very credible American accent.)SPOILERS: Amber Tamblyn, a year before her TV role as Joan of Arcadia, plays cousin Katie here, who tells her fiend that she and her boyfriend at a remote motel had watched a video, and it is she who dies of fright as she opens a door at home with a noisy TV screen where she experiences something deathly frightening. Rachel figures out quickly that Katie and her boyfriend both died at exactly 10PM. She discovers another young couple who had died mysteriously at 10PM. Close examination of the video tape, which she finds at the remote motel, reveals the image of a light house, which she traces to a San Juan island off the Seattle coast. Long story short, years earlier a little girl had been thrown into a well and covered, and now that well was immediately below the room Katie had seen the video in. The only way, apparently, to avoid death in 7 days was to somehow free the dead girl, which Rachel does. But that isn't the end of the story, setting up the sequel. Near the end, the dead girl crawls out of the TV in Rachel's divorced husband's place, and he, having also seen the video, dies in his chair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror movies in this century are staying at the PG-13 level, I've expressed this before but this one is terrifying. The images in this movie are gruesome and haunting, they will stay in your head for a while. The little girl Sumara, oh my God she's creepy looking. She glitches every once in a while and that scared me. The acting is good, Hayden, the little boy, I did not like him, but this movie is compared so much to the sixth sense, and he doesn't quite match Osment's performance in The Sixth Sense, but that's because Osment's role in the Sixth Sense had a greater depth. But still Hayden's part is played quite well. Naomi Watts has always been a good actress and she was a good choice for the part. All in all, a good scary movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie moved me so much... you wouldn't believe. I took a pillow with me to the theaters, but i used it only twice. All the other times I used it nothing happened. Throughout the movie, the suspense and sense of death was carried by the characters. Everything seemed so real, so scary that in a time in the beginning I was screaming and crying and laughing and I said to my sister and my friend that I want to get out. When I go to sleep now I always think there is a dead body in the closet, and that the house I live in is haunted. I think I could die in seven days, and I obviously wanna see now The Ring 2. If you like horror movies, or just wanna have a good time with your friends, then this excellent movie is for you!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Want to Die, Watch the Video</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really sure why The Ring was the huge success it was. It's not exactly a horror original as many feel it to be. Besides being based on "Ringu", how about a similar urban legend such as "Candyman" from 10 years earlier? And the distorted faces on photos &amp; video, we've seen that before. There's even a similarity to the doomed characters in "The Omen" way back in '76, whose deaths were foretold in photos. But all this may be irrelevant as The Ring uses the best elements of horror and makes them its own. Perhaps the most frightening element, at least on first viewing, is the suggestion this could really be; the viewer even notices a slight video static before the movie proper, on the FBI warning note on the DVD, for example. It's a clever tactic to send a shudder early on.The main power of the story is that it's a journey of discovery - some dark discoveries, to be sure, but compelling nonetheless. You're drawn to be a witness to the main character's journey. It's almost playful at first - rumors, gossip; she listens, a bit bemused. It's a slow, gradual rise in the dread. Naomi Watts has the task of tugging us all along with her and she's very good. You see that slight terror and disgust in her features when she first views the tape and you feel sympathy; you know things will continue to get worse. The countdown to doom, day by day, is also nothing new, but that doesn't mean it can't be effective. And it's strengthened by the increasing knowledge that this is a doom one cannot escape; no running away, no weapons will help. The photography also helps in creating a very oppressive atmosphere. Some of the scenes also remind of Kubrick's "The Shining" from 1980; it's a mood of steadily oppressive horror. All this works when you first see the film; on 2nd viewing you know who will or won't die and the viewing experience is rather empty. So watch it a second time. It'll get rid of the shudders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Ring" is a stylish and thoroughly creepy movie that still gives me goosebumps when I watch it today. Naomi Watts is intriguing as Rachel Keller, a journalist who investigates a scary videotape after her niece's death. When she receives a call after viewing the tape stating "Seven Days", Rachel realizes that this is no hoax, and that she must race against time before she meets the same fate. Uncovering a horrifying story as the days tick slowly away, Rachel realizes an unfathomable horror. Gore Verbinski kept this thriller's plot tight and the movie races satisfyingly to the unforgettable climax. "The Ring" ranks with "The Exorcist" as truly one of the most disturbing and scary movies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good adaptation of a Japanese film that had one hell of a killer ending. The Samara villain was pretty damn clever and cool I believe she even won an MTV Award that year. Another memorable trivia piece for this movie was that half the reels sent out to the movie theaters were defective and showed only half of the movie prompting many viewers to get their money back. Unheard of I don't know of that ever having happened before or since. One thing is certain. This made Naomi Watts a star. Maybe not a huge star, but a star. Whether or not she gets any bigger I wouldn't hazard a guess. The special effects are cool and the plot twists are fresh and keep you entertained. Brian Cox unfortunately has a very small part blink three times and you'll miss him completely. It's not a scary as most other well known and popular horror films but it will keep your attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was highly recommended and the comments here seemed to indication it was worth watching. But what a waste of time! First, it was filmed entirely in a green tint which made it very distracting and hard to watch. Second, there was very little horror: just a few gruesome scenes designed to titillate your imagination. Third, the acting was mediocre at best. The premise is, of course, complete nonsense: a good horror story should have at least a semblance of credibility. I don't believe in giving plots away in case you decide to watch it, but I recommend having another movie in reserve in case you decide this is not worth seeing to the end. I give it a 3 instead of a 1 only because there are probably some people who enjoy it, but no one in my family is included in that list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite simply one of the scariest movies i have ever seen,simply brilliant in all aspects! (In my opinion), with an amazing performance from Naomi Watts!. all the characters were great and mysterious, and i really found the story very scary, and extremely gripping, plus Naomi Watts is simply amazing in this!. This scared the crap out of me, and i thought the effects were awesome, plus the finale was great!. Both This and The original Japense version Ringu are extremely scary, and i think this is one of the best American remakes ever!, plus i thought it was brilliantly written as well. Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson had excellent chemistry together, and the character development was very good, plus David Dorfman and Daveigh Chase are both extremely creepy as the kids. The opening is one of the scariest things i have ever seen, and it was constantly unpredictable, plus the images were quite frightening!. This is quite simply one of the scariest movies i have ever seen, simply brilliant in all aspects (in my opinion), and i say drop what your doing immediately and go see it!. The Direction is brilliant!. Gore Verbinski does a brilliant job here, with jaw dropping camera work, fantastic use of colors, constantly adding scary atmosphere, creating very scary images, great angles, and keeping the film extremely scary throughout!. There is a tiny bit of blood and gore, but this movie is not really bout that. We get lots of creepy images, very scary disfigured faces,fingers cut on glass,tongue vomited out,nail through finger,bloody nose bleeds,bunch of severed fingers, melting corpse, and other minor stuff. The Acting is amazing!. Naomi Watts is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS! and is AMAZING as usual. She is extremely likable, vulnerable, had excellent chemistry with Martin Henderson, was constantly on top of things, was intense, and really gave a stellar show! (Naomi Rules!). Martin Henderson is excellent here, he is also extremely likable, had excellent chemistry with Naomi Watts, had a good sense of humor, and just did an excellent job overall!. David Dorfman is great and very creepy as the son, his eyes really gave me the creeps, and did what he was required to do extremely well!. Brian Cox is great and very intense in his cameo, he was awesome!. Daveigh Chase gives a very memorable performance as Samara and scared the crap out of me big time!, the scene where she walks in from the TV, is one of the creepiest things you will see (a little scarier in Ringu, but it still scared me very much!). Shannon Cochran was great in her scenes as the mother, i liked her lots. Amber Tamblyn Rachael Bella were both hot, and did there jobs well. Rest of the cast do awesome. Overall Go see this immediately, it's one of the scariest films i have ever seen!. ***** out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My lord, this was quite possibly one of the greatest horror movies ever. This isn't some gory crap like House of 1,000 Corpes, oh no. This is a mental-type movie. It doesn't show you how people are physically damaged when killed, and so there are so very many ways your mind can perceive based on their corpses. I love this movie, and was straight up terrified. Of course, if your all into gore and don't have an imaginative mind, then this is not for you.The terror of not being able to see your enemy is played up in this, which I like. You never really see Samara, except in the hospital and at the end, but you see her effects, and such things are scary to me. And the sense of lack of time is something that also adds a suspenseful feeling. It's one of those things where you really are hoping and praying for the hero or heroine before time is up. And of course, kudos to the ending. I must say I was not expecting that. And the ending makes you think...or at least...it did until they made a sequel, which I have yet to see but am still disappointed. Of course, I won't give away the ending, but I will tell you that if your mind works like mine, you'll be thinking about the future of Rachel.On the downside, the beginning was fudged up. How would anyone know about the tape if they haven't watched it? Doesn't everyone die after watching it? And of course, THEY MADE A SEQUEL! Other than that, I was totally impressed and terrified by this movie. 9 outta 10.</fullReview>

Samara found out the Blondie burned the tape and then Samaria as pay back takes over the little kids body. the rest is a secret you must find it out by your self!!!!!</fullReview>

The cast was great in this - much better than the original Japanese version "Ringu". Naomi Watts is the perfect actress for Rachel Keller and Aidan was just plain freaky - the way he's supposed to be. Everything you wouldn't expect happens and the ending is twisted and equally disturbing. It just opens up a new idea for your imagination to scare the heck out of you. The story is told very well and added much more suspense than "Ringu". It should be R, not PG-13 because of the psychological level of disturbance. I also recommend "The Ring 2" if you like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A gift to the thriller industry, though it is considered a horror, "the Ring" is an original story (after "Ringu") with an original score. If you like haunting cinematography, not overdone to become clich, and a sinister plot that unravels in your mind as you see through Rachel's (Naomi Watts) eyes, definitely check this out. I cannot say enough how the tenseness takes over as the music and the motives combine. I went to high school in Washington state and the ferry rides were never like this. As clues are gathered by Rachel (the investigator for reasons displayed early in the movie) the audience is captured between a whodunit or whatdunit type of anticipation, that is determined to find something really bad at the end of the line.</fullReview>

We first saw it at my friends birthday party and i didn't find it scary at all, but i think thats because i've seen it so many times now. I have it on DVD, the special edition, with lots of special features etc. It was really good, it starts off with a really good beginning, and ends with a great ending, it keeps you in suspense and it is made really well. It's very good and it has a great story line, i couldn't wait to see the second one when i knew they were making one. I have now seen all the Japanise films of "The Ring" but i still think that the American one is much better. If they ever make "The Ring 0" I will definitely bee the first to watch it. I is my favourite film and if you asked me for advise, i would tell you exactly what i have said here. I hope you found this comment helpful! :D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. It's been more than a year since I saw "The Ring," and yet it still sticks in my mind as the scariest movie that has ever been created. The musical score is not only intense and horrifying, but the sequence of images that are flashed at you seriously freak you out. I watched this at a sleepover with three other guys (in the pitch black) and we couldn't sleep all night.There were two scenes in particular that stood (and still stand) out in my mind:1) When Noah is in that workshop place and his 7 days are up, that has got to be the scariest sequence in the whole movie. What happens:first, Noah is reading a newspaper and puts his cup of coffee down on the paper. When he picks it up again, a "ring" of coffee has leaked through and forms a ring on his newspaper. A sign of things to come.next, the TV in the workshop flickers on to complete static. noah pales and stands up, staring at the TV. he's the only one in the workshop. he walks over to the remote which is sitting on a table, and flicks the TV off.third, the TV turns back on. Noah seriously freaks now and pulls the plug from the TV. he's satisfied that everything'll be OK, but the TV goes back on (to a screen of static, of course)next, the static goes away and is replaced by the infamous well, bathed in gray-blue. and who should climb out of the well but...samara. noah watches in horror as she crawls out of the well and towards the TV screen.eventually, she reaches the TV screen and crawls out...with her gory skin and tattered clothes and black hair, samara is the devil. literally. then she goes for noah.noah tries to get away, but of course, you cannot get away from samara. he runs, but samara employs her "evil ghost child" powers and teleports to right in front of noah. noah keeps running, samara keeps teleporting. there's one shot where she's right up near the camera and you can literally HEAR her.then, samara is standing over noah (he's tripped over something and can't get away) ... and the screen goes blank.cut to rachel, who is running up the stairs to the workshop place, runs in, and you get a flash of noah's totally ripped up face. very scary.2) when rachel is on the island at night, she breaks into samara's dad's house (remember, samara's dad is a horse-obsessed psycho) and rachel is searching for clues in the guy's house at night. Of course, he hears her - and jumps out from behind with a hook. EXTREMELY freaky, because this is day 6 and rachel isn't supposed to die because of some crazy other guy, she's supposed to be murdered by samara. Anyway. the guy, who is obviously having some sort of mental malfunction, goes for rachel with the hook. rachel starts yelling at him and screaming - then something in his brain clicks. his mind basically stops working, and ...he jumps into the bathtub and electrocutes himself with a really weird contraption. scary sequence with freaky shots and intense music. NEVER watch this movie in the dark alone!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, maybe not the very very best, but it has to be very close to it. Excellent pacing, visually hypnotic, tight tight plot, surreal atmosphere. It's right up there with Psycho and exorcist.OK, maybe it does have a some weaknesses. Maybe it depends a bit too much on built-in Hollywood horror mythology. It doesn't explain a lot, or offer any kind of substantive framework for how this happens. I mean this is all in the mind, in the realm of ghosts and psychic stuff. I mean, it works, and very well, but it could never happen.Really, horror movies like Psycho are better, because that could have actually happened.This movie is just way out there in ghostland.But the visual effect is simply tour de force stuff. A beautiful movie. Not all THAT original, like I said--in a way it depends on a huge framework of Hollywood horror clichs. But the visual world is alluring. Sort of reminds me of Jacob's Ladder, what with the way it slips from a totally realistic workaday world into surreal otherworld.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too many American films are amalgamations of other films. This is one of them. One of its lessons is people who may be possessed do not like to answer ringing phones. The incessantly ringing phone has become a staple of American mainstream horror/thriller films. Do you find a ringing phone scary? If so, this film may be for you.Naomi Watts was not convincing as the odd boy's mother. What mother lets her kid walk alone to school in the pouring rain? She smokes and curses to prove how tough she is. Watts is as tough as Monica Potter. Jodie Foster or Hilary Swank could have done better. They are both credibly tough actresses. Watts is a lightweight girlie girl.Why can't odd child actors just be children instead of spooky miniature adults? Haley Joel Osment was much better in THE SIXTH SENSE.The dark, gloomy atmosphere was straight out of SEVEN. It did not make this film atmospheric. No police were involved because no one but one person seemed to notice people were dying at the same time on the same day. Other people in Seattle would have caught on to this while Watts smoked more cigarettes and used a few more curse words to convince herself she was tough. Why must such a bad film insult the intelligence of its audience is this film's biggest mystery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A real movie with the tension that make you shiver for days. In the begin it takes a while but that's standard in all movies. The guy in it is very sexy I must say. It's no problem if you see The ring two first. No you can see why ring 2 is bad and this one is very good to the best. The part with the horse on the boat is stunning and unbelievable done. At the end you think its over. But it goes on. The actors are doing very good acting. The light of the movie is very good. No borrowing moments for me on this movie. I will watch it a second time for sure.I liked the words see spoke at the end. The ring 2 is not very good. Some expensive special effects doesn't make it a good movie. But oke Two is worth seeing also.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a horror movie, this rocked! I watch a lot of b-movies, horror movies and slasher flicks, and this was the best movie within those genres within the last ten years ( yes that includes The Sixth Sense.) The cinematography and sound was top notch, the acted was credible and the suspense fantastic. Unlike some movies, this movie is actually creepy an may upset some with weak stomachs ( just ask my ex-wife, it creeped her out!.Naomi Watts, the lead actress in the movie, played the part of Rachel, a reporter and a single mother trying to cope with a young son named Aidan who's mental age is well higher then his actual age. Aidans cousin dies a supernatural death and chaos ensues. Bit by bit Rachel gets drawn into the web of 'the ring' via the viewing of a videotape. Soon she and her sons life are in jeopardy. Enlisting the help of her ex (and father of Aidan), they try to solve the mystery of 'the ring'.The movie is well paced and moody.However, at the 3/4 mark it jumps a little and it seems a whole segment was cut out, but otherwise was very well done. The ending, which upset some, I thought was fantastic. Too bad Hollywood put out a subpar sequel in 2005, with no doubt more to follow in future years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I don't get it. I've seen plenty of horror movies, all surpassing the scariness of this movie. This movie just isn't scary to me. First of all, I only counted about five scenes of actual scariness. The ending was a joke, so bad that I didn't even need to hide my eyes. I just seen Amityville Horror and before that I seen The Grudge. I went to the grudge and that movie was pretty much like the ring except the scariness was turned up about 50 decibels, containing about 30 scenes of fright and chills. I went to see Amityville horror and the the scariness is up to 100 decibels, possibly the scariest movie of all time. I challenge anyone to go see these two movies and then, THEN, then tell me The Ring is scarier. I'm sorry, but The Ring is The Hype. Same goes for The Exorcist too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a blockbuster action film - lots of flash and no story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film pretty excited. I thought it was going to be a really good scary ghost flick (I'm really big on ghost films).So imagine my disappointment when I found out what it was: just a bunch of flashy "ooh, our camera is dropping frames, isn't that scary?" scenes, and no real reason for it to be going on.Don't get me wrong. The effects do achieve a good deal of fright...for about the first forty minutes of the movie. After that it just felt like guys in business suits were waving their hands in front of my face going "oooOOOOoooOOOOooooo" while they took my six fifty and watched their sales skyrocket. Needless to say, the creepiness dwindled considerably fast.The ending of the movie will make you angry, because rather than tie everything together, they instead choose to just do a bunch of random crap. You'll understand what I mean if you see it.Long story short, this movie was just another crappily-written piece of junk with shinier effects than the ones you can rent for a dollar at your local video store. I blame the success of it on all of the dumb people I've ever known...because, honestly, they're the only ones I've ever heard rave about the scariness of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>scariest movie in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't scare easily. Usually, movies that are supposed to be scary just roll off my back. That's not to say that I don't love a good horror film; I'm susceptible to a few shudders in a good horror movie, but generally I can watch one and be able to sleep at night afterward.Not so "The Ring". This movie scared the s*** out of me. I can't put it any less crudely than that; something about it just resonated with me more than with other horror movies. "The Ring" was the scariest movie I've seen in a very long time; not even classics like "Halloween" or "Psycho" approach this level of terror.I confess I've never seen the original Japanese film on which that was based, so I'm not in a position to compare the two; and I feel that it would be unfair to do so anyway. "The Ring" stands alone as a great movie just as a movie based on a book can stand alone as a great movie, and that's what's important. The cast is top-notch; Naomi Watts, as Rachel, gives the best performance I've ever seen her give. It's a career-defining moment. Brian Cox also stands out as the long-suffering father of the little girl, Samara, who as played by Daveigh Chase may be the most chilling movie villain of all time. That she could do such a terrible thing and feel no remorse at all, being a little girl, it's just scary because it's so unexpected. The climax, where we see her crawl out of the TV to kill Noah (Martin Henderson, who along with David Dorfman as Rachel's son Aidan is credible and believable in his role) is just the scariest thing I think I've ever seen. I remember when I was little, watching "Carrie", with this girl moving things with her mind, trapping all these people in a gym and killing them with an unholy bloodbath, being scared by that. I was not as scared by that when I was 10 as I was by the climax of "The Ring" at 27. I still get chills thinking of that scene, and that little girl.The idea of being killed 7 days after watching a videotape didn't seem that scary to me, and I confess that when it was in theaters I had written it off as just another dumb teen horror movie along the lines of "Urban Legends" or "I Know What You Did Last Summer". Obviously I was way off, and I'm glad I gave into all the people who told me I had to watch it. I'm not sure if I can actually say that "The Ring" is the scariest movie of all time, but it's definitely close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak unbelievable plot no better than buffy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THere are few genres where in my opinion a film scores points by being believable as much so as the horror film genre. The very foundations of a film which sets out its stall to " scare" as in the case of "The Ring" are jeopardised when totally unfathomable things begin to occur. This film contains many of these moments but the main irksome point in the plot would have to be a girl who never dies who makes a video tape that kills people after seven days when she crawls out of the TV. Maybe America has indeed watched too much TV and is ready to quickly digest this sort of nonsense, or maybe this film with its pg-13 rating was aimed at an audience easily ready to suggestion IE .. kids drunk people or suggestion-able adults. This film is an utterly pointless waste of celluloid , i just feel sorry for the actors involved who after this sort of tripe are no doubt facing a very unrewarding career. Avoid this film at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great suspense movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring was a cleverly made movie. The story is about a videotape that kills you in 7 days after you watch it. One of the things I like about this movie is that it is not extremely violent. It does not contain sex scenes, extreme gore, and I can't remember any cursing. Most horror movies contain all these things when it is completely unnecessary. I am not Mr. Ultra Conservative, but I find a movie more creative when you don't have to fill it up with such things. I watched this movie with a friend on a big screen TV in DTS. There were definitely several scenes that made me jump and that hasn't happened in a LONG time! The only reason I docked the movie 2 stars was because it was a bit slow and there wasn't quite enough "jumpy" scenes. Aside from that, a great movie to watch alone or with a good friend in the dark. I hope the sequel is just as good or better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is a horror classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the leaders in the horror genre. It is up there with all the rest. It is creepy, thrilling, and keeps you guessing. The plot-line is good and the scenes are well shot. You are always asking yourself questions, and in the end it all makes sense. Although it is a supernatural horror, the ring is greatly about mystery and the way the film is done is fantastic. For horror fans this is a must-see. In my-school this film is a forbidden object, that if seen will make the watcher an immortal horror fan. The little girl is great and is disturbing, and the final moment in which she is unmasked, you see where this film is really going. Another great thing about this film is how weird it is. The affects of the tape make no logical sense, and they don't need to. Though there are some flaws.The opening scene is tacky and unoriginal. Also at the start the boy is really weird and feels miscast. But all-in-all a classic and if you like horror you already should be driving to rent a copy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course different tastes will cause some people to feel differently about different films. I think The Ring is quite possibly one of the greatest films of all time, and needless to say my favorite or at the very least top three. Horror films, and I have seen hundreds, tend to lack extreme intelligence, they can be campy, crazy, senseless but still fun to watch. The Ring doesn't even fall into that category. Instead the American remake of the Japanese Ringu (also brilliantly made) is one of the most intelligent horrific and terrifying movies in existence. It doesn't just frighten, it gets under the skin and terrifies.The Ring is the story of a reporter named Rachel Keller, who's niece and three of her teenage friends quite suddenly die, their heart just stops. Rachel speaks to several people at her niece's funeral and discovers that many of them believe in an urban legend of a killer video tape that supposedly her niece and friends had watched. Rachel is determined to get to the bottom of the mysterious deaths and goes to the place where her niece supposedly saw this tape, an inn in the mountains. She finds the unmarked tape, and not believing the legend pops it in and is instantly caught in a downward spiral, no pun intended, of a mysterious, terrifying mystery. Suddenly a believer of the legend she calls her ex-boyfriend (possibly husband) and father of her son who is some sort of a video expert and shows it to him. He doesn't believe the stories at all until he gradually begins to realize he too is dying. They desperately piece together the clues from the killer video tape but not before their son, Aidan, accidentally gets hold of the tape and watches it as well. Now they're not only fighting for their lives but the life of their son. They uncover a horrible curse that started with an adopted daughter of a man and woman who were horse breeders. It seemed that the woman murdered her daughter after losing her mind. Despite the fact that they seemingly have figured out the mystery, they've got it all wrong and the evil won't go away.How incredibly easy it would be for a plot like this to do one of two things. 1. Become so incredibly confusing that it would be hard to follow and make no sense or 2. be completely cut and edited to shreds to "dumb it down" for the movie going public. Somehow, brilliantly, Gore Verbinsky managed to do neither. The film fits together perfectly, and leaves so much open to discussion, imagination, or further stories of this deadly curse. The cast is all around brilliant. Naomi Watts, who until this film I would have figured not a good enough actress to pull off such an emotional role is so excellent as Rachel. She shows confidence, fear, and breakdown all at once. Her boyfriend played by Martin Henderson is equally as great in his role and their relationship is handled with dignity and charisma. And huge hats off to young David Dorfman who plays Watts' son Aidan. Dorfman's character is diverse and very strange. He seems to carry a connection with the evil Samara, and perhaps has some sort of abilities himself. He is much more grown up than he appears. Dorfman engulfs this role and is just startling and creepy and adds to the mood. He does a great job. So why is The Ring so great?? It's terrifying, that's why. This is done first and foremost by brilliant writing, the story itself is terrifying. But Verbinsky also created a very dull, Grey, rainy, dark setting that is constant and never breaks for comedy or "lighten up." The killer video itself sends shivers down your spine and you finish the movie wondering if your phone is gonna ring with a proclamation of "SEVEN DAYS!" As in the original Japanese film, the time line is fast paced and you feel the anxiousness knowing they only have a short time to solve the mystery. The Ring is genuinely creepy and I don't suggest ever watching it alone. But I do suggest anyone a fan of remakes or horror or suspense, you MUST MUST own The Ring. I cannot wait another minute to see the follow up. There is so much more to this franchise!! HUGE 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Technology. Looking at a videotape can kill you in this movie. Are there really curses in the world? Well, look at King Tut's tomb, the Boston Red Sox, the Chicago Cubs and my experience with the lottery. After a little light humour, getting serious is what this movie is all about. The performances are good, the technology is excellent and the story has twists that are hard to resist. It's evenly paced and has no slow spots. I like the fact that a sequel is being planned and given all of the sequels that we get that are based solely on making money, this seems to be the kind of story that can work with multiple stories done the right way. Perhaps the killing influence in the next film will be a DVD? :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Satisfying Horror Film I Have Seen In Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is somehow much more satisfying than the original version, but not as creepy.After the death of her niece, the mother request Rachel to investigate about the videotape that seem to kill anyone who watch it after seven days; that include herself, as she have to find the ways before it kill her in a week time.Just the plods are already creepy. Though compare to the Japanese it might not be that creepy (but don't think it is not creepy, because it is). And overall it is much watch able than the original, more enjoyable since you don't have to read the subtitle; bigger budget and makeup make the movie even more enthusiasm to watch.Reason To Watch:  Naomi look really great,  Brilliant acing by D.Dorfman  Amber Tamblyn, after all it is so hard to see her.  Very satisfying and money worthy.  Good remake and the director did capture Japanese style very well.Reason Not To:  Might be disturbing by the video,  Why is this movie was made even though the Ringu is still a new movie. Might be very scary for some people.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>you have GOT to be kidding me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I just watched The Ring for the first time, and it was probably the dumbest movie I have ever seen. I am a huge fan of the horror genre, and was practically raised on them. I had very low expectations for this film, and after the first ten minutes of the movie, I thought the my expectations would be proved wrong. The movie got off to a very spooky start, and then just grasped at straws for the remainder of the film. The movie starts off with two teenage girls talking about this video that kills you when you watch it, and true to horror movie form, one of them is doomed. It was a spooky setup and I was starting to look forward to seeing the rest of the film. . .only to be brought back down to my original expectations. The movie continues on from this point to follow Naomi Watts' character around as she investigates the tape. She follows all her clues, and asks a million and one questions about the tape, and those involved in the making of the tape, and then the movie ends without answering any of the questions. It really is a shame. It is the success of this film that has sent the horror movie genre on the lame downward spiral of PG-13 ghost movie after PG-13 ghost movie, and the movie was absolutely pointless, and not scary. Boo. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best physcological horror movie in existence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So you have your 'Halloween's', 'Nightmare on Elm street's', and 'Evil Dead's' - big deal, however gory and violent you can get in a movie, you are never going to get close to the physcological pure genius that is 'The Ring'. The word 'horror' in the English dictionary is defined as 'A strong feeling of fear'. With the films I mentioned above, there isn't a lot of fear, just dark room's, blunt instruments and fake pints of blood. 'The Ring' is based on the Japanese original movie of the same name and is about an evil video tape created by a young girl who kills you seven days after you watch it by crawling out of a well and through your TV set, the only way to prevent this however is to create a copy of the evil tape and show it to someone else to 'spread the suffering'. There are some special effects, between the region of 'The Matrix' which was terrible and completely made of special effects and 'The Village' which although was brilliant, had none. 'The Ring' get's you gripped from the puzzling and gripping start to the shockingly stunning ending, which I loved because of it's great reasoning yet amazingly obvious answer. If you consider yourself as a movie buff or horror fanatic and you haven't yet seen this movie (tut tut) then you should Definitely see it. Word's do not give this masterpiece justice. Brilliant. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, this movie had potential. It was, as others have stated, well crafted - the direction, the premise, the imagery - all good.But I cannot tap into a movie very easily if it has either bad acting or bad dialogue, and this movie failed at both of those. I simply did not sympathise with the characters, and never did get the creepy/cool/scary/funny feeling I get from truly great thriller/horror flicks like The Exorcist, The Shining, Poltergeist and Psycho.It's funny, the supporting actors were not too bad, but I thought the two main roles were terrible. They needed either Jennifer Connely and Jared Leto, Christina Ricci and Johnny Depp, or hell even Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon to do this movie.And it needed better dialogue.3/10 - wait for it, someday we will be granted a truly wonderful horror flick to put in our proud collection of horror DvDs, and finally be able to say that yes, our generation can produce good horror.A better remake in the meantime is the remake of Psycho. Vince Vaughn gives a great performance and it is most definitely worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was ridiculous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, right next to the Blair Witch. Basically, this is the premise: A bunch of teenagers watch what looks to be a Marylin Manson or Nine Inch Nails music video on a VHS tape they find in a motel in the woods. Then they get phone calls from a ghost who politely tells them they will die in 7 days (gives them time to buy life insurance policies, I suppose). Then in seven days an 11 year girl crawls out of their TV sets and beats the snot out of them. I'm serious, it really is that stupid.Eventually, the protagonist of the story decides to copy the tape thus allaying her own demise at the hands of the vengeful cathode ray tube spector. That is right, everybody who has seen it has to copy the tape to avoid having a little girl climb out of their TV and beat the crap out of them. There were many elements blatantly stolen from other movies (such as the sixth sense). In all fairness, the production values and special effects were pretty good and there were a few choice gory scenes. But for the most part this was an immensely stupid movie that scared no one.Wait for this one to come out on cable TV or borrow it from someone who has the DVD. DO NOT PAY TO SEE IT. IT IS NOT WORTH PAYING FOR.</fullReview>

Having said all that?.I still give this 10 out of 10. I love creepy films, but this is more than just creepy, it's insidious and nasty, you keep trying to swerve away from the creepy content and think about the atmospheric believable acting or the cinematography, but the shadow of flies, maggots, spinning chairs and grotesque facial distortions are lurking just out of the periphery of your minds eye. I think I'll give the original version a body swerve for a while longer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest film since "The Exorcist"? Puhleez!.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can name several horror films from 1980-present that were far more scarier than this film. This is a good movie, no doubt about that. Gore Verbinski is a fine director and he usually makes very entertaining films but "The Ring" was a bit lethargic. He also helmed the Brad Pitt-Julia Roberts highly underrated caper, "The Mexican". Surprisingly, a commercial failure!. Anyway, I thought "The Ring" was unlike any horror film I've ever seen before---a mysterious videotape that causes the death of its viewers in approximately a week. The premise is as ridiculous as it is interesting...but scary?. What's so scary about it?. The film reminds me of yet another supposedly scary film, "The Blair Witch Project", which was a big joke. Nothing in that film made me quiver with fear...absolutely nothing!. I was startled about 4 or 5 times throughout the duration of "The Ring", that's it. "What Lies Beneath", for instance, is a good example of a scary film. That film scared me witless, this one didn't. "The Ring" is obviously a remake of a 1998 Japanese film called "Ringu", which I hear is a much better and scarier version. I liked some things about the remake: the sense of foreboding and atmosphere of the film, the background score, the performances. I thought Naomi Watts pitched in fantastic performance, as did David Dorfman, who plays Noami's strange young son. There's something unsettling about the kid...he looks possessed, lol. He should be cast in more horror movies!. Martin Henderson's performance was rather empty. Brian Cox and Jane Alexander were both quite effective in their small roles. Daveigh Chase gives a creepy performance as Samara.In a nutshell, "The Ring" is definitely a good film, but its not that scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Polishes Japanese Inexpensive Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This American remake of a Japanese inexpensive but ambitious horror, Ringu, shows what Hollywood can do in order to give a film production a better surface. The U.S. version, The Ring, arguably has a better content of the cursed videotape, with an apparent influence from the surrealism. The viewers may be more easily identified with The Ring's Noah (Martin Henderson), who is skeptical about supernatural phenomena, than with Ringu's Ryoji (Hiroyuki Sanada), who possesses an ESP. In The Ring, the protagonist's son Aidan (David Dorfman) has more significant role, in both storytelling and creating the atmosphere (wearing the archetypical Hollywood's horror-flick makeup), than the Japanese counterpart does. Several details added in the American version (e.g., a horse jumping into the sea from a ferry) deepen the backdrop, while the post-production that manipulates the pictures into a blue tone generates a chilly mood. Overall, in this case, what Hollywood offers works, resulting in making a more polished entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film ignorant of it's history or the Japanese original. That may color my opinion that this film is much better than the original, which I felt was overwrought and not very scary. The Ring had me clutching my armrest at the theater, knuckles white and heart racing.The movie builds suspense like no other film in recent memory, and doles out its "shock" moments wonderfully. Watts and Dorfman are excellent and Henderson is a great find. I have high hopes for Ring 2 and a better edition of the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie of All Time *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>~MAJOR SPOILERS~ON MY OPINION OF THE MOVIE: There are no words to describe this movie. It is beautifully written, not very scary (which is good to me), yet will freak you out. The horror of 'what ifs' is what this movie is made of. YOu fear you will die the same way Katie or Noah did. You no longer look at wells, or like TV. This movie is bound to have psychological effects on you, which makes it entertaining. ON ACTING: The acting is truly the best. Everyone must have studied hard to get their character down. Daveigh Chase (Samara MOrgan) is so well transformed into a villain/pity, that you can't even tell who she is. Her voice, look, hair, is all different. Naomi Watts (Rachel Keller) hides her accent, and becomes a very motherly figure. The rest of the cast was awesome, but I have nothing to say about them. ON EFFECTS: Samara crawling out of the TV is so scary and well done, I had nightmares for 7 days..The horse scene is a bit sad and sick, but it was well done on special effects. The make-up is so amazing, I have no idea what to say. Let me just say that Katie's face was close to no special effects. I think that deserves a medal on its own. ON LOCATION: The movie seems a bit green, but it is fine to me because I love the color green. The places were all dark and gloomy adding to the fear. MY FAVORITE MOVIE!! 11 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible. some spoilers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is a young journalist with a divorced husband, Noah (Martin Henderson), and a son, Aidan (David Dorfman). Her niece was recently found dead with a look of pure shock embedded in her face as if something scared her to death. Upon learning that her niece's three friends died at the same time, too, and hearing about a disturbing videotape that is said to kill you seven days after watching it, Rachel comes into the possession of that same tape. Now, as time grows short, Rachel and Noah race to save their lives from impending doom and discover what the tape has to do with a tragedy-stricken horse ranch and a very strange little girl named Samara (Daveigh Chase). The original "Ringu" was a work of art. it was scary...no, terrifying, original, creepy, and inspirational. When Hollywood wasn't doing so good, what was it time to do? remake it, except replace engaging characters with annoying ones, devoid any suspense and replace it with cheesy writing, and ruin what could have been a great remake completely. Thats not to say the big budget wasn't good for nothing, though.....the direction is stylish, the cinematography is okay, and there were 2 (yes, only two) scary parts: When they discover Katie's corpse in the closet and when the cursed tape is first shown. aside from that, it's quite boring. Just terrible. My rating for "The ring":1.5/10.About the DVD: Dreamworks has released an uninteresting DVD for the film. The 1:85.1 aspect ratio has lots of obvious edge enhancement and....surprisingly...some grain as well. The colors are ugly (The dark green cinematography certainly didn't help) and skin tones are bland. The audio, however, is excellent. The surround sound effects are quite good and make the film more jumpy than it really is. For extras we get exactly two crappy features--the first being billed as a "Documentary", when it is really only a slew of deleted scenes woven together seamlessly. The second feature is a trailer. The DVD's respectability is only a notch above the film itself. My rating for the DVD: 3.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest Film Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of horror films I can say with confidence that The Ring is the most terrifying movie ever made. This film is based on the Japanese novel and movie, Ringu. I own both the Ring, and Ringu, and The Ring adds much to the original. After so many disappointing horror films it is good to come across such a fresh approach to what frightens us. The story of a vengeful ghost looking for retribution is just the cover for the true horror of this film. A couple who refuse to accept nature's, or God's, will that they simply weren't meant to have a child somehow manage a pregnancy. Their offspring, a little girl named Samara, is far more than she appears. An undefined dark force channels itself through her, and infects people and animals with horrible mental images. One has the since that this force is evil itself and, in a truly Lovecraftian sense, if one were to see this evil fully it would be more than the mind could handle, which suggests how this entity kills people through Samara. The movie is eloquently and beautifully directed with gorgeous cinematography and an eerie music score by Hans Zimmer. This next comment is a spoiler, so stop reading here if you have not seen the film. The most terrifying thing about the film is the knowledge that this darkest evil will not stop, but will infect the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why can't Hollywood make more films like this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taken at mere face value, The Ring, has much going for it, in spite of some small minuses. It's no secret, of course, that it is a remake of a Japanese film based upon a Japanese novel, which is in turn based upon an obscure text about people dying after reading a book. So while it isn't quite as original as it appears, it deserves major kudos for not going down the same road as almost every other Hollywood cookie cutter horror film of the past fifteen years.I'll deal with the negatives before I go into the positives. They won't take long. First of all, there's people who compare this film to The Sixth Sense simply because it has a somewhat spooky child as one of the main characters. The Sixth Sense was a copy, and not a very good one at that, of the Richard Matheson novel A Stir Of Echoes, out of which a far superior film of almost the same name was made. The reason Stir Of Echoes was far superior to The Sixth Sense, ability to acknowledge its source material aside, was that the child character was actually likeable. In The Ring, the child character is tedious and unsympathetic, a major problem that occurs in nearly every Hollywood film where children take part.Second, as has been mentioned before, the equine deaths mentioned in this version are unnecessary and pointless. They add nothing to the character we're supposed to be afraid of. The screen time used to detail this element could have been put to better use in linking the episodic days together with more strength.The strengths of this film can also be mistaken for weaknesses. For one thing, it is good that we know next to nothing about the little girl whose voice we hear after the video is watched. All we need to know about her is that she has had a harsh, tragic life, one that she is none too happy about. The tagline that you see a ring before you die is pretty literal, but it's learning why one sees a ring that makes this part of the film interesting. In essence, the film knows what to tell the viewer and when, which is essential in making any horror film work. This is one of the few Hollywood films that gives our imagination something to do.Another high point of the film is the special effects, or the restrained usage thereof. So many horror films rely on numerous effects to paint this or that character to be the most horrific thing you'll ever see on celluloid. The problem is that the viewer winds up drowned in so many effects that they become numb to what they're supposed to be horrified by. In The Ring, videotape viewings aside, the special effects are sparse and, at least by appearance, mostly practical. The points when it stops looking "real" are those when it suits the story not to do so. Which only helps the situation. I'd rather have five minutes of "bad" special effects in a two hour film than two hours of being drowned in "good" ones that only seem to remind me that they are effects.If original ideas, or at least ones that don't resemble every other that is coming out at the time, were more frequent in Hollywood, it would be safe to say that The Ring would not be getting as much praise as it is. However, since there's no jingoism, propaganda, or feel-good crap to be found here, The Ring is indeed a rare product from Hollywood. The absence of any obvious pandering to focus groups alone makes The Ring worthwhile. In all, I give it an eight out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, but no Ringu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some great scary scenes, and some respectable acting. But now that I've see Ringu, I wonder, why did they make this film? They copied certain aspects of it so closely that it seemed like a "why bother" remake. But what mystifies me is the things they changed from the original that they SHOULD HAVE copied. The story in the U.S. version is so convoluted, and some of it simply doesn't make sense. I walked out of the theater a bit trembly from the effective shock scenes ... then I started thinking, "Hey, wait a minute... what about ... and how did ... ??" All these questions popped into my head later, little things that just didn't add up. Soon after that, I rented Ringu, which was so beautifully done -- slick, streamlined story, tight acting and editing, great suspense build. It left me wondering why the U.S. filmmakers went to so much trouble to screw up a simple story that made a lot more sense, when they were determined to copy to a "T" so many other aspects. Oh, and KUDOS to the earlier poster who bemoaned the fact that the U.S. version didn't mention the original in the credits; for shame! Suffice to say, the shocks that made me jump in The Ring didn't stick with me, while the suspense and poignancy of the original still comes to mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie came out in the theater, I passed on seeing it. I thought it was going to be another hack-and-slash-how-many-ways-can-you-kill-a-person movie. I was bored to death with that kind of movie and couldn't see wasting the price of a ticket on it.Boy, was I wrong!Knowing my penchant for good horror flicks, my best friend got me a copy of The Ring for my birthday. She told me the reviews it had been getting, and another friend recommended it too. I still set it aside for some time when I was bored and had nothing else to do. Well, that night was last night, and I must admit to being a little tired while I'm writing this because I didn't sleep last night. Literally. I think it was 5am before I stopped seeing images from the movie in my mind. This is what horror should be. It is thought provoking, scary, entertaining, and disturbing. There are none of the gross-outs of some of the other horror movies out there. There are also no pat answers to the mystery involved.This is a MUST SEE. Even though it disturbed me, I know it's going to be one I watch over and over again. I can't wait for the second movie to come out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap Copy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I started in the wrong way. I say this because this was the first movie of the "Ring series"(?) that I saw. I was truly disappointed as I exit from the movie theatre... I thought to myself if the novel itself was that bad. I considered various thing in "The Ring" awful: the bits of story that were cut out (probably to make a revelation on the sequel), the cheap camera angles and the comic(!) terror scenes (it is the best qualification I can give them). Now, a week later I saw "Ringu" and... I couldn't even TRY to compare! The fantastic camera angles, the unexpected (complete) story, the jump-of-your-sofa terror scenes and the symbolic stops (in which I mention - with applause - the scene where father and son stop in the rain, which in The Ring has no special meaning).So, seeing "The Ring", in my opinion, is a waste of time and I give it with no regret 2/10 (in the other hand, I highly recommend seeing "Ringu" - 10/10!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Korean and othe Asian versions were better....IMO</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the well-done Korean "Ring Virus", I decided to see the American version as well. And well, I was pretty dissapointed.To start, the colour seemed too bright for me. In "Ring Virus", the colour was very dark, setting the moody atmosphere better.I also like the Cheju island setting of "Ring Virus", since the setting seems so ancient and mysterious.Second, the acting. Naomi Watts is not that good of an actress and every scene that she is in, she seems rather snobby and stuck-up acting, even around the little boy (who is not like the kid in Ring Virus, more like the kid in Sixth Sense). While Korean actress Eun-Kyung Shin did a lot more better job and seemed much more emotional and caring.Another thing, though I think Daviegh Chase is a cute actress, she is just way too young for her role in this movie as Samara. Usually, the actresses whom played Sadako/Eun-Suh have been at least in their young adult years, but Chase was only 11 or 12 while playing this role. Does anyone find that a little disturbing besides me?And then there is the video. In "Ring Virus", it was made out to look sweet and innocent on purpose, because sometimes the scariest of things can be something that can look cute and innocent at first, but then lash out at you later. In this version, the video is just about as "chilling" as a Marilyn Manson music video.And the idea of a sequel and never crediting the original creator is quite a crying shame....</fullReview>

I shall not to go into details, since I highly recommend watching this movie from clean slate to really appreciate it; the music score is fitting, and visuals make you jump in your chair.A definite recommend for genre fans, or for that matter - anyone wanting to get a good chill (btw, I would strongly recommend NOT to have children under 14 watching this film) 9/10</fullReview>

Horror movie is like the Jason/Freddy crapola.This is one of the main reasons people thought the movie was stupid cause they are expecting someone to be killed every 5 minutes. I saw Ringu and I didnt think it was that great but I have seen worse and I have seen better. You also cant determine that it was a bite off of Sixth Sense since Ringu was made before Sixth Sense.The Ring was much better than Ringu. I liked the dark gloomy weather of Washington.

		<shortDescription>Slightly flawed,but generally effective Hollywood re-make of cult Japanese horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsInvestigative reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) loses her niece under mysterious circumstances.A short while after her funeral,her young son Aidan (David Dorfman) starts behaving disturbingly and she learns of the existence of a video tape that supposedly kills its viewer seven days post watching it.Initially sceptical,Rachel digs a little deeper in to the claim along with her seperated husband Noah (Martin Henderson) and unravels some disturbing evidence that suggests she may be wrong.There were a couple of things clouding my judgement of this film before I'd even seen it.Firstly,it's a re-make of an original Japanese film and I was constantly dogged by the feeling throughout that I was just watching a poor glossy Hollywood imitation of a much better foreign film,much like the under-whelment I found after I enjoyed the 1993 film The Vanishing,only to learn it was a re-make of a French film of the same name (and by the same director).Secondly,the premise did seem rather far-fetched and preposterous.However,having watched the story unfold before me,The Ring did ultimately emerge as a very engrossing affair,with a premise that was just about on a par for a horror film,especially if you enjoyed a flick like 1992's Candyman.The film knows how to build it's suspense scenes successfully,creating a nervous sense of impending menace that does a fair bit to move you to the edge of your seat.It also offers a nice visual feel,especially in it's imaginative editing sequences and the dour filming style.When the scene comes when the contents of the tape are shown to us for the first time,the subliminal images we see and the way in which they are conveyed truly suck us in,especially when we associate them with the forboding mystery we are to learn about.The scares are extremely well-orchestrated,and so,of course,are all that more effective.On the performances front,a no name cast carry off a worthy script convincingly,with all the right elements invested in their performances to keep us glued to the screen.There are one or two minor hiccups with the end result.It's a little overlong,with an unnecessary last few minutes tacked on that lumbers us with an ending that leaves us a little short changed and out in the blue.There's also a rather cliched use of a little boy as one of the main protagonists that's been seen in one or two too many horror films in the past (The Sixth Sense and Identity,being two of the most recent) to have any effect.But generally speaking,it's superior Hollywood horror fare,genuinely frightening and unnerving,very well-made and a very successful translation of something that (sigh) I just know was probably much better the first time round.****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunted movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good God. The Ring is probably the only true horror classic we've had in the past decade, and is more frightening than many of the other classics one can name. It's a shame that more people don't realize how deep and well-crafted this movie truly is, and how well the visuals tie together the whole film. It really helped me appreciate how nearly everything in the entire movie meant to frighten can be traced all the way back to Samara's experience, because throughout the whole movie, she is forcing everyone to share her experience. Take a look at all the deaths that happen in the movie. What is similar about them? Watch it again, and you'll see it's just another way of Samara forcing others to share her pain. The visuals in this movie are tremendous and subtle; I recommend that anyone go slowly through the tape scene, just to see where these visuals are repeated, and where they come from. You've noticed that I haven't said anything of the actors or the plot. They're really secondary to me, even if they all give decent performances. And I'm not going to even mention The Scene near the end of this movie. If you've seen it, you already know it is probably one of the most frightening things ever filmed. In the end, this movie is sucha totally solid and coherent piece, because nearly every moment of it seems to be haunted by the presence of a little girl who has seen horrible things and will never stop sharing them with you.</fullReview>

The long shots of ugly buildings and what I interpreted as a criticism of TV addicts (frequent scenes in which people are watching television, perhaps suggesting they are prime victims for the young woman in the tape) and the ultimate triumph of the evil and perversion crystallized in the film--all cement a Lovecraftian atmosphere. What is missing is the intelligence and uniqueness of the Japanese teacher in the original. Decent.</fullReview>

This film may have some of the creepiest imagery since "Carnival of Souls". In addition to the nightmarish imagery, this film also included an Urban Legend, an intriguing mystery and a twist at the end, all these things kept me completely engrossed in the film from beginning to end.I did not see the original, so I am only reviewing it based on it's own merits. The plotline does have some flaws but not enough to distract from its overall impact. The fact that the story centers around television and video proves that a ghost story does not have to take place in an "old dark house" to be scary.</fullReview>

Now the actors, the little boy was weird, the lady was weird, and that guy(dont know who he is though) was weird. they were all ok actors but a little weird at some parts. How about one of the movie quotes "First u watch the tape, then the phone rings and the little girl says You'll die in seven days. So six days go by since these kids watch the tape. All 4 of them think its all a bunch of bull, and that someone it trying to pplay a prank on them. On the seven day they all are at home and at the same time all of the die. Some say that someone killed them, but no marks anywhere, others say that it was that they were scared to death. But the one truth will be known. The movie scared them to death." Or something like that. One freakish sceen is when she fell in the well and a hand grabbed here arm. She thinks it is over but it is still happening. Her son already told her that she cant be helped. Ok movie not one of my top i thoguht it was a little freaky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE RING(2002)***1/2 out of *****Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, Daveigh Chase, Brian Cox, David DorfmanPlot- Some teenagers are killed when they watch a weird tape at a lodge. Rachel (Watts) is a journalist and she decides to find out what really happened to those kids, and the story behind the infamous tape.This Movie is not as bad as some people claim, I have to admit, it had me white knuckled, grabbing the arms of my chair, jumping and sometimes screaming. But, it used cheap methods to get me to do that jumping and screaming.The acting is top notch, Naomi Watts was meant for this role, this girl can act! Brian Cox is also wonderful as Richard Morgan. Little David Dorfman is my only annoyance, hes just to serious and over acts a bit.My huge problem with this film is all the loud noises that indicate scene changes. Horror movies like this should have you feeling suspenseful and wondering whats going to happen next, not sitting there panicking about when the next huge loud noise is going to be. And literally, panicking is the only word for it.This film in one word- CREEPY. I recommend it to anyone who likes horror and doesn't mind a ton of jump scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring vs. Ringu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just don't understand people who say that The Ring was just a crap Hollywood remake or that it was remade as a movie for the teen slasher crowd. Did these people see the same movie I did? Apparently not. I have also noticed that whichever version people see first seems to be the one they prefer. I myself saw The Ring before I saw Ringu, and at the time I thought The Ring would be pretty hard to top. After seeing Ringu, I honestly don't see how the original is supposedly superior. While it is a good movie on its own, I found the remake to be much more effective. Here are some of the reasons (WARNING: Spoilers ahead):1. The atmosphere of The Ring was just dripping with dread and foreshadowing throughout. Ringu, by comparison, seemed much more calm and normal, which isn't exactly what I'm looking for in a horror film/ thriller.2. The characters and story seemed much more developed and fleshed-out in The Ring, particularly the characters and story of Samara and her parents, which made Samara much scarier, and all of them much more tragic. In Ringu, there was hardly any time given to the back story of Sadako or her parents at all, so they seemed much less developed, more two-dimensional, and in turn less scary.3. The dreaded videotape itself was longer, more fleshed-out, and far creepier in The Ring. Some of the same images appeared in both movies, but there just seemed to be a lot more going on and a lot more disturbing content in The Ring's version. Ringu's version was very short by comparison, with almost none of the dread or impact. The "ring" itself - the lid of the well as seen from beneath - was barely even visible in Ringu. In The Ring it became an effective visual motif.4. The production values in The Ring were much better than in the original, lending so much more to the atmosphere. Of course this is where many accuse it of being "too Hollywood" or too slick. If adding a lot of atmosphere through cinematography and some minor digital effects is "Hollywood-izing" it, then in this case it's a good thing. The horrific effect shown on the first victim, the little touches like the strange video fly, the extended surrealistic scenes in the video, the lone red tree, and the scene where Samara comes out of the TV with digital enhancements, are all fairly minor things that really added quite a bit to the atmosphere, and in turn to the movie's effect on me. In Ringu, the "film negative" effect that's shown when the victims meet their fate is rather cheesy and not scary at all.The only complaints I have about The Ring are the exaggerated creepiness of the boy and the over-the-top death scene of Samara's father. But those are easily overlooked annoyances. I honestly don't see how the remake plays to the teen slasher crowd. To me this was anything but that. It was one of the most intelligent, effective, and freaky movies I've ever seen, and it should be applauded for that. Pre-conceived notions, expectations, and prejudices from other movies should be left by the wayside when judging this excellent movie. Watch it with an open mind, and you won't be disappointed. While it didn't give me nightmares, it certainly got under my skin and gave me the heebie-jeebies for a few days afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a film! From start to finish its as scary as anything I've ever seen and the climax!? Man O Man it has to be seen to be believed....I have to admit to having not seen the original Japanese version, but to be honest I cant see how a film i have to read would be as scary as this. The adult castings are pretty much incidental, with the freaky kids stealing the show. What struck me most about the film is how beautifully it was filmed. Every scene is packed with symbolisms and filmed in a way that would make purists question whether this was in fact a Kubrick film, had the great man not sadly passed away.This film has everything for everyone - those wanting a quick scare have an easy to follow plot that still maintains interest. Those wanting a horror film that leaves you thinking long after the finale have the deeper and darker psychological aspect to the Ring and those looking for a movie filmed in such a way that makes you glad you're a movie-lover have a piece Kubrick would be proud off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is more a comment on the comments in here than on the film itself. Of those who disliked the film, a number of them complain that the film doesn't explain enough, while others complain that it explains too much. Some praise the film as being very intelligent and original, while others complain that the plot is too thin. It's simply amazing to me how differently people perceive the same thing. The Ring is very much original in comparison with other horror films. It is not original in the sense that it is a remake of Ringu, but so what? It leaves a lot of questions unanswered, which, to me, is a big part of what makes it creepy. Are you still as scared once you've learned all of the answers? I know I'm not. It leaves a lot to think about, to wonder about, to imagine, and whether you choose to ponder the unanswered questions or not, The Ring is scary. It is, by far, one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen. Watch it on DVD, and then watch the Easter Egg - Go to the bottom right of the main menu, where it says, "Don't look here," (I think that's what it says - I don't have the menu in front of me) then arrow down, and hit enter. I'll rate this one 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why another remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why another remake?Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed The Ring, a relatively good quality remake of the classic Japanese "Ringu". It was rather faithful to the original, made good use of atmospheric elements as well as providing a good setting for some fairly good acting. But, unfortunately, it was incapable of keeping the viewer's attention focused on the atmosphere and had to rely on what I deem cheap camera fast-panning tricks (*rapid movement* followed by "Boo, are you scared yet?") and gore (blood/decomposing bodies), something that the original had none of, which leads me to believe that Hollywood is incapable of making a horror film that will keep the viewer on the edge of his/her seat without the use of these two rather amateurish features.This film does make me wonder why everytime a quality film is made in a non-Hollywood studio, America always has to vandalise this original piece of work and attempt to Americanise it by remaking it into a white-Caucasian, adrenaline joyride. Are our colonial cousins incapable of savouring an original piece of work in its original form? Or is this simply a testament to a fast-food culture where reading subtitles is simply too much effort?Anyway, I'm getting carried away once again. The Ring was a good remake of a classical masterpiece.However, do yourself a favour and stick with the original. It is far better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring fulfilled my expectations. There was suspense, mystery and puzzles to solve. It was so mysterious that sometimes my wife was afraid and I have to admit me too a little bit. Fortunately its only a movie. The soundtrack from Hans Zimmer was superb. The direction was excellent and the picture was dark but impressive. The end seems "I Know What You Did Last Summer" but this one doesnt finish logical. It follows super natural films as "Dragonfly", "The Sixth Sense" or "The Mothman Prophecies". I am wondering how the story continues in "The Ring 2". There is not much horror and blood but some scary scenes. A must see. 7/10.</fullReview>

I could go on for days about this film but will leave it at this... Great movie, can't think of a single flaw 10/10 - Perfect...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Television sets within television sets- the brilliance explained.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The brilliant concept of the movie is this...The fear is contained inside a television set within another television set.It is a movie about a second t.v. within your own that contains a creature that is a girl of silent and demonic fear. And if ever that girl should come through and into the real world so help us....Here is the trick psychology-effect: If the demonic fear is able to transcend the boundaries of one television set, what will prevent it from transcending the second? "Relax, its just a movie" we tell ourselves- or is it? You can see how it takes that old comfort-saying and rips it to shreds.Rent it on video to recieve the greatest effect- far more than watching it in theaters.Basically, the audience recieves a sense of safety and security by seeing how the source of fear is contained behind a television set and within a video tape. Then we are given this idea that looks can be deceiving when we buy into the chance that the little girl is not evil after all, but is only trying to find a way to rest in peace after death, "hey! she's harmless!"... or is she? the twist gives us a hard-hitting blow to the head when we discover to our disappointment that this demonic evil has the ability to "pretend to be nice like the rest of us." This concept is brand new and fresh, unlike any horror film I have ever seen, and you have I bet.Another brilliant idea is the physical form of the evil itself- it came in those good old fashion electromagnetic waves that has entertained america and the rest of the world for decades. It should really mess up the mind and provoke the semi-intelligent viewer who I doubt would have picked up on these underlying concepts the way I did. But that is the intention which is too obvious to be recognized and the brilliance behind the movie.That is all I have to say for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little horror hokum never hurt anybody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ring, The (2002) Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, David Dorfman, Brian Cox, Jane Alexander, D: Gore Verbiniski. There's a videotape out there (made up of eerie images) that when watched the viewer gets a phone call and is told they only have seven days to live. Watts is good throughout as a Seattle reporter and mother trying to uncover the tape's mystery after her niece dies from it. Combo of urban legend and ghost story shows how to execute spooky hokum and make it fun, though the investigation turns out to be pointless and the film never ends. But when it sticks to the creepy stuff, it buys you into believing that you see the ring when you die! Based on a novel by Koji Suzuki and remade from the 1998 Japanese hit RINGU. Running Time: 115 minutes and rated PG-13 for thematic elements, disturbing images, and some language. RATING: ** ? (out of ****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear is a personal thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take into your viewing of this film no presuppositions; fear is a personal thing, and when it aims to seep into the mind as deeply as this, some people will pass it by without a sideways glance, and others will just laugh.Some films scare on the surface - Halloween, Psycho, The Exorcist and TTCSM are superficial, almost enjoyable thrillers, laced with gore, comedy and shocks. That is the modern idea of horror. It is unlikely that a person of sound mind will take the scenes to bed with them, less still have any nightmares.The Ring has some of these, but the real genius are those moments that cause nothing more than aghast silence, and a sense of bewilderment. Don't Look Now has such moments; Eraserhead goes, perhaps, a little too far, but still hangs around like a bad taste in the mouth. Some of the imagery in The Ring is too intense, it needs comic relief, but around each corner is another thug of a moment : blood red, hyper-polarised, in your face.As I have said, real horror is a personal thing, and I won't be losing the baggage that this film has left in my head for some time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The X-Files Revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been waiting forward for quite some time to see this movie at the moment I finally did. I was asking myself if it would be just another crappy horror movie, or maybe...something more. Well it's something more. Watching through the movie, I could not stop thinking of The X-Files or The Sixth Sense. The ending does make it rather special though.SPOILERSThe story starts with two friends, two girls. One of them had seen a VHS with a movie which is said to kill you one week after the day you had seen it. And, if you can possibly imagine, as the movie starts it's just that day! The start is quite tough and well made as it will most certainly thrill you if not scare you. The story from now on will follow the fate of three other people, who themselves have watched this wicked cassette. It will be a horror ride.The movie does have an interesting storyline and it does have the necessary scares to keep you glued to the chair(or to your partner). As it is a quality horror movie, which should sustain the "damage" it has caused, the end isn't all-telling. You would be the unlucky one if your phone rang just after "the movie". And if you didn't answer it, then you'd have to live with the scares for one week. Just what happened to a friend of mine. The acting goes well with what is happening and, as I've said(more or less), the couple really does remind me of the X-Files. And this is maybe a weak point of the movie. I mean, it's not that enchanting too look at something and say: Wait a minute! I think I've seen something like this before. It is a lack of originality.As a whole it's a very good piece of work. Not as thrilling as I might have wanted it and a little too unoriginal, but still very good. If you want to be in for some thrilling stuff, then just watch this piece of cinematography. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Object Lesson in How To Ruin A Great Film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tagline: Before you die, you see the ring. The Reality: When you see The Ring, you die of boredom.What a surprise. Hollywood hears of an original idea from another country and then maliciously sets out to ruin it. And once again the mission has been successfully accomplished. In a nutshell: An urban legend about a killer video-tape attracts the attention of a female reporter after one of her relatives apparently dies seven days after watching it. She watches it herself and then receives a phone call telling her that she too will die in seven days. Not surprisingly, she freaks out and gets her ex-boyfriend/husband/whatever to watch it too. Then her (apparently psychic) son also watches the tape and so she sets out to uncover the mystery of the killer video before her and/or everyone else dies in unimaginative ways. To say any more would ruin the outcome of the far superior Japanese original.There are so many things wrong with this film, it would take too long to name them all so here are some statistical highlights:2 x Unnecessary characters.1 x Scene stolen from The Omen. 2 x cases of unexplained psychic children.4 x cases of Wooden acting.2 x Dodgy mannequins2 x Hilarious "Terrified to death" victim make-ups.1 x Line of truly awful dialogue.1 x viewer who will never trust a remake ever again (Although I did actually say that after Psycho too).Anyway, I'm off to watch the new version of The Italian Job now.

		<fullReview>Director Gore Verbinski directs this finely crafted film. I for one say that this movie came to me as a total shock. I went to see this film and knew absolutely nothing about it. I left the theater shaking, and dumbfounded. One of the flaws this movie has is the way it leaves you hanging with so many questions.It starts off as another urban legend; two teen girls swap stories about a videotape that "kills you when you watch it." One of the girls claims she has seen it. Through the rest of the film it leads you down the path of THIS IS GOING TO BE STUPID, but quickly changes after a reporter (Naomi Watts) decides to investigate the mysterious death of her niece. She comes across the tape and watches it, and begins to believe that the curse is real. She races the clock to try and solve the mystery while her boyfriend, and her son watch the tape.This film is dark, yet intriging in unimaginable ways. The camera angles and the filters used create the mood to be dark and cold, and sometimes disturbing. This film is not for the faint of heart, so beware! 10 STARS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was not a bad movie. It had enough suspense and disturbing scenes. The horror was just fine for me-not too extreme like "The Evil Dead", "Zombie", and Biohazard-kill and eat them all kind of movies but rather mysterious and even cerebral. I have to say I liked it. It has its weak points, but it doesn?ft fail to hold your attention till the end.The film is about killer videotape: the one who watches it immediately receives a telephone call with a voice just saying "Seven Days". Seven days after this phone call, you die. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) after seeing the tape has to save her life within those seven days. Intriguing enough isn't it. And not just the plot but also the camerawork, photography and the whole decor were fantastic. I will just say that I was looking forward to see the content of this videotape and to my opinion it was awesome-one of the creepiest things I?fve ever seen. However, there were some flaws I?fd like to share with those who saw the movie already:***SPOILERS AHEAD***First of all, Who builds a house over a well? We don't where I come from that's for sure. But this is a small one. A major flaw is the reasoning behind who lives after seeing the tape and who dies. In the movie Rachel made a copy of the tape and destroyed the original. Believing that making a copy keeps you alive she made her son make a copy of his own. The last line from that movie was when he asked her what was going to happen to those they were going to show the tape to. If we conclude that in order to stay alive you have to make a copy of the tape plus show it to somebody else, everything could end very fast. They just have to show the tape to somebody (say with AIDS, cancer, 90 years old or just anybody) and then destroy it.But maybe it?fs just me who can?ft understand. Overall it is entertaining. Give it a try.</fullReview>

I kept waiting for something really cool to happen, or at least, something that connected all the symbolism that runs rampant in this picture. Neither ever happens. This film is god awful, and if I truly thought I could get more out of it, I would gladly watch it again. But, I know it would only be a waste of 2 hours of my life...again.

		<shortDescription>Naomi Watt's second triumph!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After her pitch perfect emotionally devastating performance in 2001's "Mulholland Drive". Naomi Watts comes up with another triumphant film, which is "The Ring". Although "The Ring" is not as powerful and inspiring as "Mulholland Drive". "The Ring" deserves the highest possible accolade as well.The direction is simply superb. Once you see this movie, it gets its hooks in you. I saw it at midnight about two months ago, and I thought I'd fall asleep, but I didn't. The story was so clever, that it doesn't let people close their eyes for a minute. The opening sequences are excellent; you really understand the story once you see them. You see two young girls kidding each other about the videotape that supposedly kills people, and they find out it's true and then they get killed. Then, Naomi Watts' presence in the film makes you watch without getting bored or annoyed for a second. The surrealistic video is so interesting, as well as the whole story. It's not a movie in which monsters kill others, but a psychological horror story that'll make you think a great deal about the complexity of Samara's personality. It also has the most unpredictable and brilliant scenes in film history. For instance the scene where the horse is chasing Naomi's character is great. You'd never expect that. You say in your mind, "Wait! It's not her time to die yet". This scene is so full of horror, mystery, seriousness, etc. Another excellent scene is when she tries to find out about Samara's life and then a man kills himself in the bathroom. However, the best and scariest of all is when Rachel falls into the well and also when Samara gets out of the TV. What scenes! Besides its wonderful and dark photography, and strong acting by the majority of the cast, this shows the dark side of a little girl who could be so tender, but has reasons to kill even the nicest person. It'll make you think of how far a person can go because of being ignored by their family or other people. The final scenes are very unexpected, and understandable. If you really pay attention to this movie you'll understand the whole thing. Without a doubt "The Ring" is one of the most interesting and clever psychological horror movies ever made! I could say it's the best movie of 2002, since most of 2002 movies are very bad. An example would be the corny "The Hours" and the overrated "Lord of the Rings". Naomi Watts has become one of my favorite actresses. She's reached perfection and respect with "Mulholland Drive" and "The Ring". She's given the roles of a lifetime, and she'll be getting fantastic offers, which she obviously deserves. 8.5/10 </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A major Dissapointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER I never saw the Japanese original but it most certainly had to have been better than this lame remake. The Ring ends up being nothing more than a dragged out wild goose chase to find out why you die 7 days after watching some video. When I first heard the premise, I was skeptical that such a juvenile plot could be pulled off. The explanation at the end of the film - that you are killed by the ghost of a little girl that died 7 days after being dumped in a well, is a far-fetched letdown to the big buildup the rest of the film provides. And if this is intending to be a horror movie, it's a half-hearted attempt with only a handful of scary images sprinkled throughout it's 2 hour duration. If you consider Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, and the Friday the Thirteenth series good horror, you'll probably want to waste your time watching The Ring - otherwise don't bother. This movie gets a 4 by me and that's being generous....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty much inferior to the original (may contain small spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> Many people like this movie better than the original, or hate it and still think it's made better. I'll give it the same those people gave it- they prefer it because: 1) The story line is more thought out.2) The effects are better in consequence to it being thought out more. For example, the victims rot as if being in the well. 3) After the deaths the movie cuts as if it was the end of the video, whereas the original had photograph negatives which many people found to be corny. I on the other hand, though I liked the remake's touch better, didn't find anything wrong with using the negative's effect. It rather suited the original.  If it weren't for such strange mutations of the storyline, I might agree this was the rare case in which the Hollywood remake was better than it's original. But the deal with the horses (especially the one jumping off the boat) didn't live up to it's original. There's no sign of a supernatural superstitious force, which makes the original much creepier. You don't know anything of the girl's father, and the mother was now talking english to her horse instead of another language to the girl's real father (from what I understood of it). So Samara just comes out as a normal angst ridden pre-adolescent who causes trouble. You don't see the hidden connection to the supernatural power which made her able to attack her victems through a video and make them suffer as she did. And apart from that, the acting wasn't all that well either. The people were rude and unbearable (I'm certain not everyone acts this way in America). Part of the problem has to do with the dialogue. I'm sure Rachel wasn't meant to sound so rude when she said "Excuse me, but what the hell are you talking about?". She seems to catch on easily to the other clues in her way, surely she would be smart enough to catch on to what that woman was saying. In the original, her ex-husband gave her the clues. In this one he is just there and does very little. You can't feel; the tension between him and his son either. Instead they talk about it- one of the faults of American acting. You should know what's going on by watching, not hearing. But the worse thing is the failing attempts at comic release which certainly had no place in the film. Running with the hose and falling is one example. It just made the whole thing seem stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can style make up for weak material? Only so much. Basically, it's a junior high campfire story done up as a "Sixth Sense" wannabe, with a dash of "Blair Witch" and some throw-away Hitchcock references. I give the movie credit for using scary atmospherics instead of continual gross-outs and "Boo!" moments, but sometimes it was just plain slow. It also dragged on too long, and I was tired of the movie and checking the time before the movie finally decided to call it a day.The Hitchcock references gave me a chuckle of recognition, but at the same time they seemed like an overly self-conscious display of style, just like the odd coloring throughout the film.If your standard of horror consists of slasher flicks, this movie is going to look pretty good, a cut above the rest. If your standards are higher, this movie will probably seem like an also-ran. The movie tries hard, but it also has too many copycat elements.</fullReview>

Lots of scary-looking images not a scary movie makes. Definitely a let down for pretentious film poseurs everywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unpleasant Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, a horror movie should not be a pleasant experience, should it? What I actually mean is that 'The Ring' is an unpleasant artistic experience, and this despite being actually well filmed. The director seems to be one of these technically skilled people, capable of taking a story and translating it into good cinematography. The problem is that the story has no logic, time is badly manipulated, there is no emotion to connect the viewers to the guys supposed to be good in the story, and frankly not enough thrill to make this a memorable horror film. The end which is suppose to explain what this was all about (need it?) is kind of a ridiculous joke, imported from the 'Gothic' stories. I realize that many people actually liked the film, but in this case I need to be rather on the critics side. 'The Ring' is a mediocre film, and there are not too many reasons to recommend it to my friends. 6/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Final Score:7.6 (out of 10)***Warning: May contain Spoiler***One thing I can't stand is when movie reviewers spend half their review recapping the events of the movie - `She did this, she went here, she went there, then this happens' - and that would be a lot of wasted summarizing time based on all the mileage Naomi Watts racks up trying to solve the mystery in `The Ring'. I would much rather hear about what the movie is, what it does and if it's something I would like. Don't be fooled by the hype: this vaguely titled film is not particularly scary - although it does have it's haunting images and creepy, intense moments - as much as it is a royal mystery in which the pieces are scattered throughout in details and images that we the viewers are left to piece together like a puzzle. The premise revolves around a new kind of urban legend. It is an age old ghost story of spiritual manifestation, cruelty and abandonment, revenge and a chain letter-like curse that is propelled into modern times where it's instruments of terror resurface as things like videotapes, TVs, electromagnetic waves and a symbolic virus that could spread across the globe. Evil never dies it just changes forms. The only truly, scary part of the movie are the unexplained ramifications of the ending - and the more you think about it the creepier it gets.I actually liked this movie much more then the score indicates. It has a few problems that hamper it from becoming really great, but that I am willing to overlook them and get sucked into the journey. It is not the definitive version, just an American version of the wildly popular - and undeniably original - Japanese story. It is an American movie (meaning: from America), but in the hands of visionary stylist Gore Verbinski it is distinctly (and thankfully) not a Hollywood movie (meaning: mainstream and possessing all the studio inserted clichs that shallow commercial products have). It packages itself like a cheap Hollywood horror flick, even giving us the dead-teen standard slasher movie intro and the usual `It's over` ending, to make the mainstream (and undoubtedly the studio) feel safe, then veers completely away from those clichs into clever and more cerebral territory. Let's start at the top: the visuals are incredible. Say what you will about visuals being to glossy, but film IS a visual medium and Verbinski's talents are put to good use here. The visuals are not only great looking, but help in unfolding details of the mystery. The great thing about this story and this movie is that it sets up it's urban legend and it's world and then sticks pretty solidly to it's rules (what may confound the viewer at first makes complete sense if you sit back and put it together). It takes us on a ride in which all the events on it's mysterious videotape cleverly occur in the lives of those who watch it. We are shown an image on the tape and later when it occurs in `real-life' we are given an completely different view of it (like the water that bubbles up blood or the image of what at first looks like a solar eclipse and turns out to be something completely different). Also on the technical side, Hanz Zimmer's score is fantastic and the sound of the film is perfect. Listen closely to how Verbinski plays a particularly creepy screeching sound from the tape sporadically in the background of the entire movie. Under the pen of screenwriter-for-hire Ehren Kruger (who knocked me out with `Arlington Road' and then disappointed me ever since until now) the story, which is mostly a story within a story, cleverly comes together.The minuses are few but keep it from achieving the success it deserves. Two things: the dialogue and the character development. Naomi Watts is a great actress, but she isn't given much to work with dialogue-wise and it makes her look silly. Her conversations with Noah are like nails screeching on a chalkboard. Then there are the characters, while Watts is a commanding lead, I found myself not really caring one way or the other if she or most of the other characters lived or died - they are just to 1-dimensional. A lot of people have asked why the kid is changed in this version from a regular kid into a disturbed, creepy little boy. The answer, I thought was pretty obvious: Kruger wants to parallel him with the neglect and abuse of Samara. That, to me, is that great underlying subtext of `The Ring'. It's a film about how kids can be mistreated, neglected and abandoned by parents who don't have the patience or time to deal with them. But this story is different. This is a story about two parents who p***ed off the wrong girl - and now it's everybody's problem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching countless horror movies (13th Ghost, The Haunting, etc.), it's been a long, long time since I've experienced the gasping and hair-raising sensation from watching the Ring. The director did an excellent job at elevating those tense moments without giving it all away. I even rented Ringu to see how they compare, and not to sound like a "homer", the U.S. version was much better. I felt it was more intense. This movie is so good, I have to list in as one of the top 10 horror movies I have seen:1. The Excorcist 2. The Omen 3. Night Of The Living Dead (1968) 4. The Sixth Sense 5. The Ring 6. The Blair Witch Project 7. The Thing (1982) 8. Poltergeist 9. A Nightmare On Elm Street 10.

For example, why does the lead actress go through what everyone else goes through, even though she has inadvertently solved the puzzle. The holes in this film are extrodinary. I recommend you see it for yourself, but just don't ponder over it to much. Cause it really doesn't amount to anything. Just enjoy the visuals and just maybe your skin will crawl. Yet how people feel this is scarier than the Exorcist or some other truely great horror films, says to me that they don't like horror movies in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A crappy remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'd like to start by saying that, in a very personal taste, I liked Ringu much better than this one. The only thing to receive applause in The ring are, without a doubt, the photography and the make-up. Anything else is poorly done: the story, the way to unfold it, the overdose of go-seek-a-scare scenes and the need to explain things at the end of it (which, by the way, wasn't that clear). Sure, Hollywood did a great job in matters of visual but, in a real content of the movie, which goes from the adaptation of the cursed video to it's plot development, it failed big time. I'm not one against the US remakes. I enjoyed The magnificent seven (from Sturges) as much as I did The seven samurai (from Kurosawa), but, let's face it, Hollywood also has stroke several times on adapting real art foreign films like The wings of desire (from Wenders) as to make a crap film named City of angels. My belief is, The ring, falls on this last category.In terms of pacing I would recommend watching Ringu first instead of The ring, for anyone interested in seeing both. The japanese is slower but sure is better constructed and explained. My biggest complaint about The ring is that this one traded the whole creepy, evil and an air full of a perverse presence atmosphere from the original (and it's sounds), for more expensive special effects and a more sped up rhythm. This changed the whole aura of creepiness for the urge of an immediate disturbance. Sure, I got really scared a couple of times, by being caught with the guard down may I say, but they were moments frightening enough to give me those chilly goose bumps -the best one occurres near the beginning-; but that was it. Nothing else captivated or demanded my attention. It appears to me that Hollywood wanted an attractive package to sell rather than one good film that could be really apreciated by moviegoers with a brain inside their heads.Also, the changes and additions in this film are more than evident. Despite being almost a carbon copy in it's first hour, The ring falls short on its task to get you IN the movie starting from the cursed video, that works better as a resemblence of the surrealistic and goofy movie Un perro andaluz (made by Luis Bu?uel and Salvador Dal in the late 20's), than the images that comes from a distressed mind (which actually are). Sure Ringu is slower, but besides the lot of talking involved there's also a strange, weird feeling in the air; its something like an evil presence that you can guess and watch in some secuences, and verbinski wasn't capable of capture that in here. Thats way I like Ringu, and thats why I also recommend it instead of The Ring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this movie was truly creepy and very well made.But once I'd finished watching, the questions began, such as,Why does that girl have the ability to project her evil onto videotape, specifically? Why doesn't she just run a pirate video feed into, like, ESPN or A&amp;E or something and be done with it? Or better yet wait until Super Bowl Sunday?Where did Samara come from? They "went away" and came back with her, telling everyone that she was adopted; Richard said that Anna wasn't ever meant to have a child and that Samara wasn't his child and yet we see the birth certificate in Richard's house, naming him as the father.Katie clearly took the death threat seriously, since she told Aidan about it, so what was with the joking and then "sudden realization" that it was all true the night she died?How did Samara manage to live in so many places for so long? She lived in the barn, she lived in the hospital, she lived in the family's mainland home. . . And why hasn't that tree gotten bigger in the last 14 years?Why did Aidan say all that about "the horses keep her awake; she doesn't like living in the dark" when he should have said, "she's *evil*; don't help her"? That is, of course, why Rachel couldn't drag Aidan around with her, not because she'd be exposing him to danger, but because the whole movie would have ended right then.Why bother setting up an ongoing theme of maternal love and rejection if the real message was "she's evil and it's never going to stop"?I understand that this movie is the remake of a part of a trilogy, but they should have made this movie make sense within itself, rather than, apparently, just copying down the bits that were revealed in the corresponding movie in hopes that the American moviegoing public will foot the bill for two more.</fullReview>

I had hoped however, I would be in with a chance when I went to see this offering, but in fact, no chance! The whole thing is a mixture of impossible scenarios that totally lack any kind of credibility coupled with a loose story line that never begins to work.Take my advice, keep your hard earned in your pocket and keep it for something else.. Just a thought, maybe some youngsters will get a buzz from this film, if they are impressionable enough, but I suppose even that is not really a fair comment, most young people nowadays are smart enough to recognise a dud when they see one, which sadly, this is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, first off, let's get this strait...this movie is not scary! I was expecting this movie to be super-scary, but there was only one time when I even got close to getting scared (the closet flashback). Sure, there is suspense and it gets a tiny bit spooky, but most of it is only from all the morons you know telling you "oh my god, THE RING made me p*ss my shorts!". This ain't scary. Now, on to something else...The story is good, but it so closely similar to FEARDOTCOM, you wonder if the same writer didn't use a different name and write FEARDOTCOM as well. Speaking of writer, the film is written by Ehren Kruger, the guy behind the writing of SCREAM 3 (a film which I probably gave far too low of a rating, it was quite good)...yeah, he returns to write THE RING. He is getting better with time and he is beginning to grow on me. He *almost* scared me with this one. The film is at times tinted a gloomy greyish color which also mimics FEARDOTCOM and David Fincher's masterpiece SE7EN. And, speaking of story...the film is based on some movie called RINGU, apparantly one of Japan's biggest hits in like, forever. Uh, well they must have some pretty bad movies over there, because out here in USA-ville, we had a couple tons of better movies than THE RING. I can't judge as to how good that film is, but I will soon see it.As for THE RING, the cast is not very big, there are not very many characters. Brian Cox's (25TH HOUR) character doesn't come into the film until practically the very end and Naomi Watts I have never heard of before in my life. Also, I don't know about anyone else, but I was a little confused with this film. The whole thing moved fast and moved along quickly, but there were certain things that I just didn't understand. There are certain portions of the film that really don't make a whole lot of sense, and I was getting a little agitated towards the end and I even began thinking "okay, what just happened?". This film was a lot more thriller-ish than FEARDOTCOM was, only because FEARDOTCOM went more for a horror approach on the audience, and horror films usually don't scare people too much. Thrillers are mainly the types of films that make people wet the bed. THE RING is a thriller. The whole thing with the 'ring' is also another one of those things that after you're done watching the movie, you kinda think "ohhh!!".Overall, not the best film ever made, but then again, I have seen a slew of films that sucked terribly. This is one of the bigger and better hits of 2002, and I recommend that you see this movie, because overall, it may not be very perfectly constructed, but at least it is entertaining.THE RING: 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loan the 6th Sense !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I saw the trailer for the US-remake of the Japanese hit first time, I thought regarding the scenes with David Dorfman: Wow, who is this, Haley? Now, the enthusiasm has been replaced by disappointment.In a mix of Horror, Drama and suspense, they try to follow the tracks of the 6th Sense, but the foot-steps are numbers too great. If you compare: The horror-elements can't shock the visitor. Surprise, an important ingredient of a thriller, lacks almost total. But this is no surprise, in the eye of a uninspired plot (Female Journalist try to find the origin of a video to safe her life and explores a family tragedy.). This psychological part weaves to be upset and amateurish. A few scenes with Brian Cox are not enough. And when Dorfman whispers about the dead young girl "She shows me things", then this shakes you some seconds. But in the next moment you thinks of Osment and the possibilities given away. The makers hadn't the 6th sense for the causes of Shyamalans success and overpaced their project. But little would have been more. They should go back to school.Loan the original, this movie isn't worth a cinema trip!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rainy Edinburgh afternoon. Free ticket. The cinema completely to myself.No crunching of popcorn or slurping of coke. After 20 minutes I started admiring the way the Emergency Exit signs were lit up but not too much. The problem - the dialogue. There was a decent movie in there somewhere but I sure couldn't find it. As with other critics I have questions:- How did Noah get to the island so quickly? and why was Noah such a bad actor? Why did the dad of the deceased teenager look like the dad of the deceased child in The Sixth Sense? Why did they have a funeral at, what appeared to be, night? Why, every time it rained, did I think of Se7en? Once again, what's with the horses? Am I right in thinking that the movie should've ended half an hour before it did? Was the reason it didn't have something to do with needing to set it up for Ring 2? I worry about these things</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring is a remake of a Japanese movie called Ringu which I haven't seen. I guess that is a good thing because now I don't know what parts were better in Ringu (or not better at all) so I could enjoy this movie totally.Sometimes may be the story goes a little too far but that didn't bother me. It was pretty clever and most of all it was very thrilling and full of suspense. The movie really keeps you on the edge of your seat and Naomi Watts is (as we already could see in Mulholland Dr.) a great actress. She is the perfect heroine in this movie.With good direction, good cinematography, good actors including a great lead actress and music that adds something to the tension Hollywood can make good horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's cut the pretense. This movie was ultimately crap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the more arrogant people in the room like to say that those who point out the gaping plot and story holes in this "film" just don't get it, this flick is merely a bone thrown to the jack-asses who have been jonesing for that grainy, Zapruder-like offering to salivate over since the first Blair Witch.When the audience is left having to figure out HUGE gaps in the movie, it's not because the film is trying to be a think-piece. It's because it's a piece of crap. Leave big enough holes and everyone can feel smart by making up the explanations. The talk of the sequal only feeds the people who are starting to realize you can't really defend this movie. "Well, we only know part of the story now. You'll know it all after the second movie." Sorry. That's a little flat for me, and only reinforces that this movie was poorly made.To be honest, though, I didn't have that bad of a time watching. You certainly feel cheated when it (finally) ends, but until then you don't know how many loose ends will be left unexplained.Like with Blair Witch, though, it really doesn't pass the "waaaaaait a minute" test just after you walk out of the theater and start thinking about what you just saw.Finally, I really don't give a crap how good or bad the foreign versions of this film were. I don't watch Japanese films. I'm not about to start watching Japanese films. I'm out of college, and no longer have to pretend to enjoy foreign or "indie" films of ANY kind, so I rarely do, save for Life is Beautiful, which kicked ass.In a nutshell, the ride isn't bad, but when it's over you'll be left to guess a great deal of the story, and I don't consider that intellectual entertainment. I call it poor film-making. .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, now let me say, I was almost covering my ears because of all the jump scenes in this movie. The Ring was simply terrifying, and is the scariest movie I have ever seen. Naomi Watts was also good, and I had seen her in CHildren of the Corn 4, which she also did a good job in. The video tape that they watch in this movie is slightly disturbing, I mean, a girl crawling out of a well, a person pulling a string out of their mouth, a pit of maggots! YUCK! All in all, If you want to sleep with the lights on for three months than you should see The Ring. I give The Ring a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the deal with foreign cinema?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen lots (and I mean *lots*) of foreign movies, and almost without exception, they suck. Badly.Then comes (from Japan) a remake of "Ringu," called "The Ring." I've never heard of "Ringu," so I look some information up on it. It sounds promising, even though the basic idea is kind of silly, but with the suspension-of-belief in full-off mode I figure, why not, it is just a movie.Apparently, "Ringu" and "The Ring" are pretty close to one another (I'm not about to go learn Japanese so I can really find out.)If that is true, then "Ringu" is garbage as well. Because "The Ring" is truly worthless junk. Plot? Oh, no, can't be bothered with one that makes sense (even with my belief suspended). Acting? Lame. And where does one find kid actors with creepy eyes? Do they have a cattle-call for ugly?Shocks? Ok, one or two, but only because of the use of LOUD (and repetitive) sounds. Scary? Nope. Stupid? Yep. This movie belongs in the class of "Jeepers Creepers" and "Blair Witch."Thus I can tell you, from years of experience (also called abuse) from watching foreign movies that there still are only a handful of good movies coming out of the rest of the world, whereas in the USA we beat their annual total each year, and still have time to produce drek (like "The Ring.")Stay away from "The Ring". Before you die of boredom, you see "The Ring."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Ring" is a genuinely scary movie. It is filled with shocking and chilling moments. The surreal images on the video alone are unsettling enough. I had gone to this movie with curiosity. We know that anyone who watches the cursed video will die in seven days, but how? I soon got the feeling that the manner of the victims' deaths was not as important as the tragic story behind the videotape. One thing I appreciated about "The Ring" was that it was not a splatter horror movie. Psychological horror is much scarier in my opinion! Just keep telling yourself, "It's only a movie," or you might not be able to watch TV afterwards (or answer the phone)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again Hollywood takes an excellent foreign film and produces a bland, uninteresting copy with no merit of its own. Gone is the creepy atmosphere of Ringu, the urban legend theme that gave the original its believability is barely touched on and cheap shocks (which don't generally work) replace the genuine horror of the Japanese version. This is basically a cynical exercise in film making by numbers, cashing in on the original's notoriety. I challenge anyone to come up with a Hollywood remake that even comes close to a foreign original. Do yourself a favour and see Ringu instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a terrible ending!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the Japanese film "Ringu", which is based on the novel by Koji Suzuki, "The Ring" follows a woman named Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the mysterious death of her niece, in the process discovering a videotape that kills all who watch it in seven days. The final twist is not one of your typical Hollywood clichs, but thats only because Hollywood clichs do not negate the entire film, which is what the ending does. There have been so many movies with a little boy who looks and acts similar to Rachel's son Aidan (David Dorfman), that watching all the scenes with Aidan are difficult because you feel like you know exactly what he is going to say and do. The visuals are excellent, but that doesn't make up for the mediocre acting and direction and the terrible ending. When compared to recent horror films, "The Ring" really is not that bad. Just about every horror movie within the last decade or so has been terrible, except for "28 Days Later" and "Dawn of the Dead", and "The Ring" is without a doubt better than something like "Freddy vs. Jason" or "Alien vs. Predator". All the previews said that this was one of the greatest horror films ever, and everyone who saw this said it was so scary, so I expected to be scared. There is nothing in the film that makes you jump out of your seat, which is obviously what most people look for in horror movies. While "The Ring" is probably one of the ten best horror films of a 21st century in which good horror films have been almost impossible to find, there is no way that this film could rank among the truly great horror films of all time.</fullReview>

Compared to the original the Americanized version have no taste. The cultural transposition did not really work (probably even more outside America). Probably it's a good movie compared to gore and B rated movies. But it is just a bad copy.

		<shortDescription>A waste of time and money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please take your time to read this review, as it could save you from throwing your money away! As a fan of horror movies, I think I can safely say that The Ring was, frankly, one of the worst horror movies (or any movie really!) that I've seen in many years. Just when you think the horror movie cinema can't get any worse, it just did! This movie might have been all right if it turned out that the truth behind the killer videotape was a murderer of some sort (who is still alive, and not a ghost like Samara!) trying to get some kind of revenge on someone. But an evil little girl that died a few decades ago, was, frankly a stupid idea.This was not a horror movie, or even a scary movie, there are only loud noises and supernatural goings-on, which are cheap scares that are predictable. The scenes that were intended to be scary were too exaggerated right to the point where they stop being scary and caused people to laugh. It's amazing, what kind of things people will do to try and make a movie scary, only resulting in making it look stupid. People with the slightest common sense should not get scared by trash like this.Naomi Watts is a good actress and quite pretty too, so she shouldn't waste her time making movies like this. See her in King Kong instead. If you have nothing to do on a lazy Saturday afternoon and would like to waste your time and money, then The Ring may be for you.The movie also leaves hundreds of unanswered questions. Who exactly is this little girl? How did she come to exist? And why did she make a killer videotape in the first place? The ending that it ended up with did not even exist! Gore Verbinski has taken an, I admit it, rather interesting twist ending from the original Japanese film Ringu, and turned it into something empty and incomplete, that will never ever be complete again, not if they make a thousand ring movies. They should have just made them solve the mystery, and just leave it at that. There is no need to carry on. You will wait and wait to see what will happen next, and in the end, nothing will, and you will realise that you have been wasting two hours of something that does not have a point to it. Luckily David Zucker, who I personally think is a great director, was there with 2000's Scary Movie 3, to give it a somewhat satisfactory enough ending, even if it was mixed in with other similar horror movie genres. The Ring is basically insulting horror movies of the past, for example Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, that are worth seeing.A stupid plot like this can not possibly make a good movie, not even if they had made an interesting ending, (although that might have made it better), and I think that the directors should just give up trying to make a good movie because it just seems to be getting worse with each sequel.I understand that some of you might want to ignore this review and judge this movie for yourselves, but just take this advice from me: don't bother! Watch a decent horror film that is actually worth watching like Gothika instead, that has a satisfactory plot and ending.The only thing to praise about this film is that it has a promising beginning that might make you eager to continue watching (that actually results in nothing, of course!), and some interesting special effects, but it's all a rather pointless exercise.I hope I have saved some people their time and money! My rating: minus 500 out of 10, and that's still not low enough!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First i would like to say those of you who saw Ringu first should not even comment on this film. Why? because once you see one of them you begin having expectations for the other. Once one scares the crap out of you do you really believe the other one is going to scare you as much?? For those of us that did not see Ringu first, this was the horror movie we have all been waiting for. No pyschos with knives. No blood/gore. I found in some of the comments that this movie was unoriginal and in some of the other comments the movie did not follow the horror guidelines...well those two statements are pretty much contradictory which means those people are just blabbing for attention. If you are looking for an original horror movie i guess you can count out scream 1, 2, and 3, all the Friday the 13th and Jason movies, all the psycho movies ie. Silence of the Lambs, etc. Is it possible for a horror movie to be original?? The Ring is about as close as you can get to original.And now to blast away the people who gave negative reviews even further. Most of us know that what we fear the most is the unknown. The origin of Samara and her powers are not revealed to us. But honestly do we have to know? Many things do not need explained but will still scare the crap out of people. If you ever thought you saw a ghost you would neither care or think about how it got there and you would be scared out of your wits. Why are you scared? Because most supernatural phenomena cannot be explained and you cannot possibly understand it. Samara is pure evil...that is all we need to know to be scared of her...the most dreadful sadistic girl you can imagine. She has the frightening ability to burn horrific images into your mind and drive you crazy, all the while you feel your death approaching. This is how scary Samara is...and how scary the movie is. And you don't even need to know a thing about Samara to be scared.The story of this movie is actually well thought of. Contrary to what you may read in some of the negative reviews, this movie does have a great story and is not exactly difficult to follow. I saw one review where one person said that the movie never explained the chronology of events about the horses and how the child, Samara, affected the horses. Are you kidding?? This was fully explained. Anna Morgan was driven insane by the images Samara was revealing to her in her mind. Anna and Richard Morgan decided to banish Samara to their barn, hoping the separation would help stop all of it. While Samara was in the barn, she grew annoyed of the horses and decided to drive them insane. This was an act of revenge for being put in the barn.Now lets talk about the two things that make up a great movie...story and acting. The story is pretty much original, especially the scare tactics. Some of you say they are cheap. Cheap????? They scared the crap out of me. Quick flashes of distorted faces and horrific images do not allow the brain to settle/desensitize. Seconds or Minutes after each "scare" that one quick moment is etched into your mind...the summation of all these moments is the main reason why many of us are still scared of this movie even 10 days after we first watched it. The split-second shots of katie's face and Samara's eye did it for me. The storyline is understandable. Some of these people comment about how the story just doesn't make sense. Well I'm sure if they popped in the movie one more time and stopped whining about how this isn't a Friday the 13th or Scream Stabber movie, they would be able to follow the story pretty easily. As for the acting...well Naomi Watts was perfect and the others, while not being excellent, did an good enough job to where their bad acting did not take away from the film.Because this film has the originality that most horror films do not, and because this movie scared the crap out of me, i have no choice but to give this movie a 10 out of 10 rating</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the worst remakes of recent years, made worse because it should have been so much better. Wooden acting from most-unlike the original, the intro was far to teen movie like-unlike the original, terrible attempts at scaring-unlike the original, and a weak ending-unlike the original. You've probably guessed i'm a big fan of the original, yes, i consider it to be the best horror movie of the nineties, since Elm Street part one, but do not let you think that means i am biased- I had high hopes for this, which were quashed, but I have high hopes for the sequel. I also loved The Grudge remake and felt it was almost as good as the original.Although this tried to be clever, and gets points for attempting to create some atmosphere, it just falls on its face, reverting to very weak and predictable jumpy moments. Lesson 1- Loud noises may make the audience jump, but they will not be SCARED- in the cinema they have BIG speakers so the sound of a car driving may be enough to make us jump. Is this scary? No. The Ring relies far too much on this- horses kicking walls etc. Eg, you're walking around your house thinking about something. Someone bumps into you when you don't expect it- you are momentarily shocked, but soon forget it. This is not scary. However, if you are walking around you're house with the belief that someone or something is outside, or perhaps inside intending to get you, that is fear. You are scared. Ringu did this for 90 minutes or so, The Ring does it for 0. Naomi Watts is a good actress, and Verbinski is an OK director, but they do not seem comfortable here. He may not have been able to direct her effectively. The rest of the cast is instantly forgettable. The kid, Yoichi equivalent was good in Panic, but here is just another '6th Sense Look Out Scary Kid Alert' kid. Yoichi in the original said little, but he was not the focus, and he still managed to make us uncomfortable. The score in the original is extremely effective and haunting, this has nothing. The story is minimal admittedly, but the original covered this and dealt with what there was with great skill. Here it tries to cover it up by bringing in some nonsense horse side plot which has little relevance and is entirely dumb. And the ending. The original Sadako moment is one of the most frightening things ever filmed, you will feel your whole body become tense the first time you see it, edited perfectly and filmed so excruciatingly slowly that you may almost not be able to bear it. In this it is laughable, far too fast, (again with the loud noises) and we actually cut away from it! We cut away from it!! This takes whatever tension there may have been away from the scene, and then we are set up for another predictable 'jump' moment when the seat is turned round and...! How many times has that ploy been used in movies? Samara herself is not scary, just seems like an annoying little girl. Sadako however is pure rage, unstoppable, and very creepy. Let's hope that Nakata can do something better with the sequel.4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, even if u don't believe in the supernatural, the Japanese story-line was much more detailed, flawless, and just plain Good. But if u didn't believe in the supernatural or at least fear the unknown, like SO many do in one form or another, then u shouldn't have been the slightest bit un-nerved by this movie. The Japanese version, like many eastern countries and their religions, may seem to delve too deep in the supernatural side for most of modern America. Especially for those who need an explanation for everything.But even the thought of Sadako (Samara) being conceived from a "demon seed", so to speak, is not so crazy as to make the movie less enjoyable. Even the BIBLE says that the Philistine giants (Goliath of David and Goliath) were born from women who were impregnated by angels (or maybe Demons if u consider they are "fallen angels"). So, anyone with a spiritual side can just feel the skin crawling, un-nerving, spiritual disturb this movie gives. And while the American version obviously had better special effects, such as the distorted faces and Samara herself (her eye... eww), I personally found it scarier to see the realistic fear on the real faces. Not the physically impossible distortions the US version put in for cheap thrills. If you enjoyed the US version, I HIGHLY recommend u see the original. Just be open minded to the fact that it probably only had a fraction of the budget, which just adds to the awe in how good it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You will die of brain rot after you see THE RING!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cheap thrills. That's a summary of the entire film. The Ring (2002) is a dumbed down Hollywood version of the Japanese horror film Ringu (1999). The Ring is actually two movies in one, it combines both elements of Ringu and Ringu 2. Instead of making a straight horror ghost story like the Japanese version, The Ring suffers from the old scheme of trying too hard. Yes, it tries to be scary, hip and an instant classic. The movie fails on all three levels. The subliminal scenes are of old hat nature, adding elements to this film that were not in the original damage the film's chill factor and the liberal amounts of cheap scares land this movie right in the middle of Cheeseville.Naomi Watts is several years older than the character is suppose to be and by literally transposing scenes from the Japanese version will not make any sense to most of the audience giving Ms. Watts the aura of being a bad parent. The child in the movie is too cold for his own good and the father character is bad. I did not enjoy the film when I first saw it and after viewing it recently I still don't. Why mess with a good thing? Why did they have to add the t&amp;a factor into the picture? Not only is the film bad but cheap as well. Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Might contain spoilers...I really liked the movie from a film making perspective. It really had a nice atmosphere and was wonderfully photographed (it really did feel like it took place in late fall/early winter in Washington State). The makeup and effects were really well used, and the music and sound effects gave it a perfect atmosphere.My big issue is the last act. It feels like a cheat. Halfway through the movie morphed into a nice mystery and climaxed with a really cathartic scene where Naomi Watts' character discovers what really happened to the girl on the video. She goes through hell to get to the bottom of the mystery of the Morgan family in order to save her own. After all that build up and the emotional journey you have taken with these characters into this living nightmare, it just felt like a huge cheat when the movie kept going past its logical end and turned back into a traditional horror story in the last little bit. What was the point of her unraveling the mystery when the tape was just a really nasty chain letter? And if it was just a chain letter, why would the evil spirit hide the fact that copying it was the only way to live? If the person KNEW that was the deal, they'd be more apt to make copies and it would spread faster (and plot wise it would lead to some nice scenes of the characters agonizing over if they should make a copy and live, or sacrifice their life to destroy the tape once and for all). The ending just felt wrong. The other 3/4 of the movie I loved, however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice idea that deserved a better fate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I just didn't get it, as I have heard a lot of good things about this movie. The idea about a videotape that kills whoever watches it in seven days is a nice one. The actors also perform well and the main plot is nice. However, to me, there are a lot of sub-plots within the movie that appears and disappears throughout the movie that makes the movie make no sense. So instead of being frightened or held in suspense as you might expect from a horror or thriller I was just going "huh?" and "what?".However this movie isn't all that bad, mainly because of the idea and originality and the actors performance. Save it for a rainy day or whenever you have some time over. I give it 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, what a horrible disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know it's never fair when you don't see a big hit movie until a few weeks after release, and you hear so many great things about it. It never lives up, and I usually have sympathy for a movie in this situation.But The Ring was a freaking trainwreck of a production, and I can't believe anyone liked it. There were two good parts in the movie, and they were both beacuse of well done, creepy images. The first was near the beginning when they found the older girl in the closet, and you see her face for about a quarter of a second. That was creepy. The second and final good part was when the girl was walking out of the TV. Bravo for that scene.The rest of the movie was nothing more than terrible. The acting...Oh my dear lord I can't even decide where to begin. It was despicable. And I am usually very forgiving of acting in either an action or a horror flick, because they usually have redeeming qualities. But there was no excuse for acting THIS unimpressive. I am talking here mainly about the two main characters. They simply sucked. I can't describe it any differently.Also, the script/writing. What the #*&amp;%^@(*&amp;#%^()@# were these people thinking? What unengaging, uninteresting dialogue! Screw the writing of this bad, bad movie.I have seen worse movies, but I'm very vocal abou this one because it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen that was considered excellent by most people. Maybe I'm just completely stupid.2.5/10 You're better off watching Eight Legged Freaks so you can at least get some laughs. At least that movie didn't take itself SO seriously, like The Ring.Bah. I can't say anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kids need to toughen up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to keep this short. This movie was garbage. If this is what scares kids today, kids today are pussywillows. The only good thing about this movie was the cinematography, and even that wasn't as good as most movies. The story is terribly linear. Naomi Watts has the answers to every question that is placed in front of her, with very little conflict. Anyone who says this doesn't resort to jolts and loud noises must've been high when they saw the movie, because that's the only way they got any kind of rise out of me. This is just more proof that the horror movie industry is dying a slow and painful death. The studios have run out of ideas, and have to make remakes of foreign films that no one has heard of to bring anything fresh to the screen. Naomi Watts looked good, Brian Cox was good in his role, as he always is, but the movie that my classmates describe to me as "The scariest movie I've ever seen" are really mis-informed. The Ring is scum, awful, awful scum. I'm talking shoe scrapings after stepping in turd and waiting a year to clean it off scum. of ten, I would be kind and give this a 1.1/10. Go see the Exorcist, then talk to me about a well done scary movie. Wow, I guess I didn't keep it very short.</fullReview>

The eerie and downright disturbing elements are all gone, and I had to stop myself from not pushing fast-forward when I watched it at home. Why did they have to make this great film into a boring "teen-slasher"? Cause that is what it seems like to me.

		<shortDescription>Sorry, no sale (major spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I am, generally, easily terrified this movie didn't do a thing for me. My problems: (1) Why did Watts' sister ask her to look into the death of her daughter whose heart "just stopped beating" when we learn she looked like she'd been dead a month? (2) After they find the kid (which is supposed to exorcise the whole thing) her son says "You weren't supposed to help her." Thanks kid, that's a great time to bring that up. I hate kids in movies who make things worse when they could be helping. (3) What were they supposed to do? Was there a way to stop it? (4) I kind of get the "making a copy spares you" thing - you're spared if you help the kid. But why did the son ask what would happen to the person they showed it to? Who said they have to show it to anyone?Of course they used the old horror film "out" of alluding to things that, if told, wouldn't work. Like (a) how did they actually manage to have Satan's child? (b) If they did all those bad things to her - why did daddy survive? (c) With a whole island to do it in, why did mommy take her daughter all the way to another part of the state to dump her in the well?Sorry, just didn't work for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For months on end all I got told was I had to see 'THE RING'. Comments like 'Its so scary' and 'I could not sleep' was the continuous remarks I received. It didnt get my attention AT ALL when they were running adds on the TV and I must say my attention was AT ALL grabbed when I finally did see it.Im a HUGE horror fan. I have sat down and watched alot of creepy stuff in my time and although movies like 'SCREAM' or 'THE EXOCIST' seem to scare the living crap out of alot of people, I didnt flinch. I was really excited about watching 'The Ring' but sadly I was very dissapointed. It was confusing, too slow and it WASNT SCARY! The graphic detail that went into the movie was fantastic! I was really impressed with all the details that went into the movie. The graphics and art formation was intensive and very real. The director did a fantastic job as well but I was let mostly down by lack of realism from the actors and the storyline was way too slow and confusing.Not my favourite scary movie at all and not in my TOP FIVE either.I give it 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Ringu...??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who haven't watch the original, spare the nonsense sixth sense imitation and blair witch because Ringu (the original flick) was released way earlier than than those two movie. The original ring, Sadako (later named Samara in the remake) remains as the the main perspective rather than telling nonsense incoherent meaningless tale about a woman and her son. Sadako who played by Rie Inou just simply amazing in Ringu compared to rather dull "jason wannabe" Samara which for me just ruin the whole show. Hideo Nakata was hailed as 1 of the greatest director (and not horror film director alone)in Asia because the way he tell the story using only sound, camera view and angle and sheer excellence acting by the cast, way difference and "not pathetic like" Hollywood stereotype gory and nudity involvement horror flick. The point is this movie trying ever so hard to delved upon the original film but did they succeed, i believe the answer is NO. The story telling is slow and incoherent. But the worst part is u just cannot sense the fear in Naomi Watts and that's just so unforgiveable because in the original Ringu almost all the cast did they job brilliantly, U can sense the fear in Reiko eyes when she discover the tape. And u can sense her uneasiness and shaking by just looking at her body movement. Now, that i call a 5 star horror acting is all about.My verdict: ** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>!!Spoilers!! I'm sorry, but this might have been the stupidest movie I've ever seen. It was incredibly cheesy, corny, and had a ridiculous ending. Filmmakers need to draw the line between gross and scary. There were some things in the movie that looked simply disgusting. The Birds - Now that was a scary movie. That had these psychotic birds that flew around eating people and pecking out their eyes. Not this stupid "girl coming out of a TV to kill you" type of thing. This movie was not hard to follow, or hard to understand, it was just hard for me to freaking stay awake. ooh, a horse is going nuts! ahh! scary! This girl is mentally disturbed and was wierdo-freak parents! ahh! She has long hair over her face and looks like a freak! ahh! I would have gotten more enjoyment out of banging my head on a wall for the 2 hours this movie dragged on. The coolest part was when the horse want nuts and got all chopped up. That was hilarious. And the video itself was rather interesting. Either way, I want my $4.50 and 2 hours of my life back. Terrible. I would have given it a negative score if I could. If you haven't seen this movie, don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>See this film alone in the front row of the cinema to get the full effect. Well worth it.It is a roller-coaster of emotion. No point seeing it on tv with friends. It works in the same way as 'Scream' it gives false endings &amp; makes you conclude an ending, then gives you a different one. Very rewarding as a ride. This film is a unique reminder of why we need cinema &amp; not DVD or video, this film in the cinema makes us 'feel' emotion against our will. It is never about plot or resolution it is always about making us have emotion against our will. Skill.Rating - 8/10. The only thing stopping this being 10/10 is that the Japanese version is superior.Who should see this film - Any adult who enjoys cinema for the ride &amp; the thrill. This film is not big or clever or deep, but you will appreciate the artistry involved in making you 'feel' or gasp. To make a tree look scary &amp; to make the audience scared by it, takes great skill. A great funfair ride, well worth the entry price, considering it's simplicity. Traditional film making at its best.</fullReview>

I acknowledge that this film was originally made in Japanese well before the two films that I have just listed were made. However, if you've seen those two films, all of the screenplay schemes in "The Ring" will look identical. This film had solid intentions but the plot in and of itself was its achilles heal. It was predictable and the flash screen close-ups were the only attempts at scaring the audience. Overall this film does not bring anything to the table that has not already been well established.</fullReview>

But since Americans are falsely considered too thick to be able to watch movies where the main character don't speak English and all the women aren't blondes, they waved some green papers around and made their own version."Before you die - you see the ring". Yeah. Don't remember that from the real movie. Hmm - almost seems like the creators didn't understand why the movie was called "ring." Oh yeah, of course! You have to _use your brain_ to understand it! As I said, film makers of today don't believe that Americans can think.

I don't know if they are talking about the ORIGIONAL movie titled the RING (made in Japan). This movie had such a strange premise (a video tape that contains eerie images and when somebody views the tape, they are supposed to DIE in 7 days). A lot of questions were left unanswered. Such as HOW THE HECK DID THOSE IMAGES GET TO THE TAPE? Also, WAS THAT GIRL POSESSED BY SATAN? I don't know what her deal was. What about that spooky little boy Aiden? He gave me the creeps!! I thought his role should have been a little more on the EVIL side. The female lead was good and the scenary was incredible. It was all shot in Washington. The ending did surprise me. It was a very DARK and DISTURBING ending. All in all, I would say this movie delivered the goods. It's not in my top 20 horror movies of all time, but it's still worth a viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler Yeah, so it was startling at a couple parts, and the director knows how to make you jump by cutting quickly to a LOUD SOUND. Real gift you got there, Gore. However, the main characters are SO selfish and obnoxious, and the supporting cast SO clearly cardboard copies of 1,000 better characters in scarier films, that this film ultimately is just frustrating and kind of lame. At best it's a decent mystery, but c'mon, is this REALLY as scary as people are saying, or did the quick cutting just make you jump a bunch? After all, STARTLING is not SCARY (though just about all of the horror directors out there seem to have a really hard time understanding this). My main beefs with this silly movie were 1) Why, if this broad cares so much about her little Haley Joel does she ignore him the entire flick, and leave him at home with the babysitter for 90% of the film? The writer thinks so low of the audience that this chick can treat her child like crap the whole time, but if she keeps saying "I'm doing this for Haley Joel #2" then we're all supposed to go "Holy crap! Guess she does love that little brat." I had a lot more points to make, but I'm only writing this to keep from an essay I've been putting off, so I'm just going to make one more point - Who the hell kills themselves by gathering all the appliances in the house, creating some weird crown out of hot dog tongs, then hoping in a half filled tub and switching the surge protector around your neck to "on." Naomi Watts shoulda yelled "Uh...hey Mr. Old Man...you can do the trick with just a toaster in the bathtub." But I guess that wouldn't be so CHILLING and DISTURBING. Ohhhhhhhhhhh. I'm shuddering just thinking about her looking through old newspaper articles and saying "What did you do to yourself, Ruth?" just like EVERY character in these hackneyed plots has to say when their in the basement looking though old newspaper articles. This had such potential, and is just kinda gay at best. Try a little harder! C'mon, it's not THAT hard to be scary. Although, I beleive I'm in the minority, since everyone's running around saying this gave them nightmares. I'm jealous. I wish I was scared this easily. I'd go to thrillers a lot more often. Oh well, back to writing my freakin essay. Grrrrrrrrrrr.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On a good day in ideal light this movie is foolish suburbanite pseudointellectual hogwash. This movie is utter garbage, an insult to anyone with a three-digit IQ and a disgrace to the cinema everywhere. When you think of the miles of pristine 35mm film that were sacrificed so this movie could earn a studio millions of dollars, one is reduced to tears.The recipe contains two parts lowbrow kitsch to one part silly horror. Combine with unaccomplished actors and morality preaching and we have `The Ring,' an innundation of poorly shot images and masturbatory use of wide-angle lenses strung together to form a barely cohesive story. The nauseating use of twisting plots and poor characterization is almost as infuriating as the distinctly plagiarized shots. The absurd plot makes suspending belief for `Star Trek' look easy.We are bounced like a ping-pong ball in our sympathetic expectations as audience members until we drop on the ground suffering from a bad case of futility. If I wanted such an experience I would open up to random pages of a Charles Dickens novel reading off random words from the page, pretending to be able to formulate something of value.If you are not a pre-pubescent moron or a comatose half-wit, then do yourself a favour and see something else. Forget urban legends, watching `THE RING' is more likely to kill your brain cells than any VHS tape recovered at a mountain lodging.</fullReview>

Do yourself a favor, track down the original Japanese trilogy (bootlegs can usually be purchased on EBay). Not only is it scarier, but it makes more sense!Just goes to show that imagination and not money (the remake literaly cost 60 times more) dictate how scary a movie is. Fun fact: The producers of the remake saw the original and were so blown away that a 1/2 hour later, they bought up the remake rights. My question: If you thought it was the scariest and greatest thing you've ever seen, WHY REMAKE IT?!? Sheesh.Don't settle for anything less! See the original!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most horror movies suck.Its sad, but true. The average horror movie has absolutely no respect for its audience, is seemingly aimed at pre-teens, and not very bright ones at that, and is full of cheap scares, ridiculous characters who don't act a bit like anyone you know, and when all else fails, maybe some bad CGI or a bucket or two of fake blood. The Ring is different, and for that reason alone it earned my respect. Was I really scared by it? No, not really (although the climatic ending was appropriately jump inducing). But it did a great job of maintaining an atmosphere throughout of "wrongness". Nice soundtrack work, quick cuts, disturbing images, just enough revelation, kept the world feeling just a little off, and a little creepy.Unfortunately, not much happened, and what you had was a movie long on atmosphere, but almost boringly devoid of chills. But its not often I have the pleasure of making that complaint about anything not arthouse, so I'll gladly take the tradeoff.Overall a well made, mature, horror film. Just maybe lacking in excitement at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since I saw Ringu I was hooked on everything connected to it. So I needed to see the American remake. A lot of people told me it was a scary and very good movie. The reviews talked about a must see movie. How wrong they all were. I was slapping myself all true the movie and as the story progressed got more and more annoyed with the whole thing. Then I saw the ace actor Brian Cox and thought that maybe he could raise the level of the movie a bit. But he saw that there was no saving this movie and he quickly killed off his character in a very very strange way. This was just one of the things that does not make any sense. This remake loses the steady pace Ringu and adds all kinds of things I still don't know what these added to the story. What was that with the horses? Why does the kid think he sees dead people (pun intended)? Horrible movie, watch Ringu and Ringu 2 (a few scenes of which also end up in this remake adding more confusion) instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe this movie made it past the director, editor, boom operator and test audience. It's what a really bad movie could be, if it tried.The most annoying being the boom mike in almost every other dialogue scene from the beginning. It was a constant reminder I was watching a show. I could have watched it in a barn with horses. Two that stick out prominently in my head are: The entire boom "arm", mike and cord in the upper right corner in the scene where Rachel leaves Noah's apt the first time and is standing by the elevator discussing poo-poo drivel. The other goofy use of the mike is in the scene where Rachel interviews wacko at the insane asylum. Not only can you see the mike you can watch it go back and forth from wacko to Rachel during their talk. Stink-o. The frames of the solo face shots cut off the chins in a not-art-film way and the love for her son was about a genuine as a frog and a rock. The up side was the kid was the best part. He was a little creepy but endearing and I appreciated the dull overall color to add to the mood. Otherwise, maybe the "deleted" scenes that some say there are would explain the confusing David Lynch attempt they were going for. And for the love of all that is holy how did they or ANYONE miss that mike at the top of the screen. The entire theatre was laughing at it here. There was even after movie chit chat and a cheer when the boom operators name went by. P U</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging and creepy horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I liked this film and found it rather enjoyable, some aspects of the film have become a rather bland trend in the horror genre. Ever since The Sixth Sense, a little kid has to be the nexus of supernatural subplots and manipulations. Please! I will give Gore Verbinski a good pat on the back for actually creating an eerie film that makes your skin crawl in many areas. However, the first ten minutes, the little kid and the terrible dialogue by the little girl proved to keep this film from getting an 8. I will state this, the cinematography and sound were quite excellent, signifying the care and patience put into this film. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't like this movie and was mad that i spent money renting this at Blockbuster and I am also angry that I ordered pizza for this movie because I thought it would be really sweet. I'll explain why this movie wasn't good to me. THIS WILL SPOIL THE END OF THE MOVIE AS I WILL MAKE COMMENTS ABOUT THE ENDING!1. This movie was in no way scary to me. You see some dead face for .5 seconds in two different scenes throughout the entire movie. That is not nearly enough to scare me or even entertain me. Maybe if they had like their hearts ripped out or there body was taken apart and like their bodies were hanging from a wall.2. The lapses between the two so called "death scenes". Waiting the entire movie to kill off one character. That is simply ludacris. Maybe if you found some pictures or something in a cabin that showed the high school students who had died in the beginning.3. Aiden ,or whatever the boys name was, did some stupid stuff throughout the movie. "I couldn't sleep!" What the hell kind of excuse is that. And why did he now so much about the girl.If I have some more time I might go over a few other details that annoyed me. I must say the ending was a little innovative but it seemed to make two mistakes. I would of enjoyed this movie more if after Naomi Watts and Noah (don't know actors name) the movie simply faded out and the credits began to roll. BUT, this didn't happen and the ending had Noah die and then they make a copy of the take and the movie ended. Well I think that the director should have went beyond that and had something more happen. I honestly have no idea what should of happened but there NEEDED to be something else to happen after that.Oh, yeah and the horse jumping off the boat was like the funniest thing I ever saw in my life. It was like just about to clear the railing and then it's back legs hit the railing and the horses face collides with the side of the boat. I was laughing for like three minutes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite frankly, this scared the life out of me!! I went to the cinema not expecting too much and then had nightmares for 3 nights!! The Ring is a really enjoyable and horrifying film with all the ingredients to make you feel as uncomfortable as hell. I do feel that the big screen is the only place to appreciate how scary it is as there is no escape from the imagery. Without giving anything away the Television scene near the end is so long and excruciatingly creepy I felt myself being forced to look at the fire exit sign in the theatre for relief!

		<fullReview>Well, the original Japanese version of this film was fantastic! It's such a shame that the Americans decided to do a remake.... The premise of the film has been slightly changed, incorporating bits from both Ring and Ring 2. The new plot is pathetic, the in-film 'video' didn't have the mystery that the original had, and the storyline has been interweaved with irrelevant rubbish. I wasn't expecting much from this film, as most American interpretations of foreign film are dire to say the least! The use of visual metaphor, story, situation and casting were all terrible. If you havn't seen this film yet then don't bother! Rent the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was terrible. I can't believe the amount of hype that this movie received. I went in expecting a movie that would be somewhat scary but all I got was a movie that was laughable at best. Let's see, there were so many weak points, it's hard to know where to start.1. The lack of a coherent plot severely crippled this movie. It took too long to figure out what was actually going on and the ending was a tad lame. The ending didn't really answer any questions and at best, added to the confusion.2. The lack of good acting skills also hurt this movie. In my opinion, the best character by far was the little boy. Everybody else was just gravy.3. The capabilities of Samara were not scary, but just so far out there that it didn't make any sense. With the abilities that Samara was given, she should've been able to destroy everybody...weird...she didn't...4. This movie was just plain overrated. If this is what is considered very scary, people need to watch the classics again. To relate this movie to The Exorcist does not do The Exorcist justice. That movie was truly scary. The Ring went for some cheap scares and it shows.In the end, this movie was pretty poor. Too often, the standards of the general public falls when they view a string of weak movies. This movie might be scary compared to what has been released lately, but it is nowhere near the quality of The Exorcist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a remake with its own impressive, terrifying perspective that works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming back to The Ring, having (unfortunately) yet to see the original Ringu or Japanese Ring features, it is most involving and absorbing as an effort of a filmmaker who takes the materials of convention and forms them into terrifying shapes. It's all about ambiance, really, and director Gore Verbinski doesn't take any of this in a silly manner, or one that he would want us to think is too silly. It's about a video tape that when watched in seven days the viewer of said tape (a series of images not unlike a master's class at a university in gut-wrenching and eye-tumbling surrealism) will die.The characters in the ring investigate this, and come upon some familiar tropes of the ghost story and of things like sentience (I got a particular feeling and connection back to the Shining, no pun intended), but Verbinski's intent is to grip the viewer in a story that keeps to itself very well, is filmed without the gimmicks of, for example, Michael Bay's productions of remake-horror crap, and features actors that can make us believe this material. As with other superior ghost-story horror movies this decade like the Orphanage, it appreciates what is possible in just lighting a room, in letting a character take time to see things and experience them in a visceral manner so that we can as well, and Verbinski and his write bring on images that are inescapable (i.e. the horse on the ship, the girl crawling out of the TV and going across the room).It's a crafty piece of slick Hollywood horror, and it's intrigued me enough to go back to the unseen source material, which is the best a remake can do aside from its potential re-watchability. 8.5/10</fullReview>

Watch it as many times as you want, most of what happens has no explanation, and the plot has more holes than a block of Boar's Head Swiss Cheese. Maybe "Ring 2" will clear things up for us...

		<fullReview>I saw The Ring last night after my brother rented it out and i found it scary....ish!. Now it takes alot to scare me because i laughed all the way through when i watched The Exorcist, Stigmata and The Omen plus i hate horror films anyway but i decided to give this one a go mainly because Naomi Watts is in it and i think shes really sexy. I thought the film was quite well made but typically Hollywood in its over the top production. That girl in it i think her name was Samara god she was horrible, creepiest little girl i've ever seen in a film, i think the secret to a good scary horror movie is to have a weird little kid causing all the havoc. And im not ashamed to admit that after i watched it and went upstairs to sleep i had to switch each light of and ran as fast as i could to the next one, you know one of them ones. Overall though it was well worth a look.Mark: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had potential to be very frightening but I just didn't feel it. I was the most scared when they switched scenes and would play a screeching sound and show an eyeball or a ring between the shots. The whole point was that the girl wanted people to hear her story but why would she kill them once they did? If she had this amazing power to just kill someone, why wouldn't she just kill the people who didn't know about her or some how make them find out her story. A lot of stuff wasn't even explained like how did she make the tape? It seems kind of impossible to me that a tape just appears somewhere. The girl looked pretty freaky but other than that, this movie was not scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Very mild spoilers) Remember that classic Monty Python skit about the old women stealing babies? Mid-way through, a man in a British army officer uniform breaks in and stops the skit, Complaining that "this was a perfectly good skit about stealing babies and then it got SILLY so next time hat happens I'm going to stop it.Right? RIGHT!". Something like that needed to happen in the last 20 minutes on The Ring. What started out as a perfectly good B horror movie got ridiculous. Not the "it's coming out of the TV" part (I apologize to those who genuinely were scared as horror is a very personal thing) or cheesy "sucked dry" corpse, but the sad "answer" at the end that points out about 40 plot holes big enough to dive aMAC truck through (already listed by many others) What could have been anunsettling vague ending with a memorably creepy Surrealist B&amp;W video(reminiscent of NIN "Closer video) to haunt your dreams is spoiled by theimplausible explanation. The film is undeniably well crafted and the acting is above "B" quality, but many "B" films have been more unsettling simply by witholding the answers and letting the visuals or atmosphere linger without Zombie Stalker horror orridiculous coicidences and plot devices. Reference the original "Phantasm","Blair Witch Project", "Picnic at Hanging Rock" or "Dead Ringers" for films with similarly implausible subject matter that are extremely effective by what they DON'T include. As stated above, horror is a personal experience and whatscares some may make other (me) laugh in the theatre despite my best efforts. A little subtlety at the denoument could have made this an eerily effective thriller instead of something that falls apart at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following in the footsteps of "Panic Room" (see my review) and "Punch-Drunk Love" as critically praised pieces of trash, "The Ring" comes from underground to bore you to death at a theater near you. This is one of those movies that is off the charts STUPID, like "Blair Witch" STUPID, where anyone whose brain is in the "on" position realizes that this is nothing more than a lame fright film that has been done before a hundred times. It is far from scary and defies all logic from frame 1 to the end of the flick. This film may have the bells and whistles to entertain 11-14 year old kids, but anyone who is above the age of 20 should be embarrassed if they enjoyed this garbage.The problems are mostly plot related and I don't feel like "spoiling" any of the logic defying twists and turns that nearly put me to sleep. Let me just tell you that if you like really slow movies that don't require a pesky plot, or continuity, this is your cup of tea. It's a horror flick, so for the most part the acting is poor. The "acting" in the opening sequence is quite horrid, as if the untrained kids were reading their lines off of the script just beyond the camera. Brion Cox, who I have seen in other films, is quite scary in his delivery, as if he forgot that he has 30 years of film experience.Naomi Watts is the one and only positive in this stinker. Her presence alone carries this movie, as in Mulhullond Dr. (another piece of junk) and she needs to learn how to say the word "pass" when she is offered fine fare such as this. She still manages to remain relatively unscathed as the entire movie crashes and burns around her and hopefully will star in something better soon.If you think that "Jeepers Creepers" and "The Blair Witch Project" are five-star, grade-A films, this movie is made just for you. I think those movies are amazingly dumb and I felt stupid after I watched them, and felt even dumber after watching this film. I think "The Ring" actually symbolizes the large plot holes that are readily apparent if you are paying attention. If you are willing to check your brain at the door, you have a chance to not hate this movie, but I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can understand why people are so blown away by Gore Verbinski's version of The Ring. After all, american horror fans are somewhat desperate for halfway decent film making so I'm not suprised that the public has gobbled up this watered-down retread. Ladies and Gentlemen, do not be deceived.Hideo Nakata's 1998 film "Ringu" is the scariest, most perfectly crafted horror film ever made. It is a masterpiece of sheer terror and imagination. It is everything that the american version is not.Dreamworks doesn't want you to know that, that is why they are suppressing the release of japanese film in this country. Everywhere else in the world, "Ringu" is known to be the greatest horror film ever made. But, not in America. Why? So Dreamworks can take your money and shove an inferior film down your throat.Do yourselves a favor. Log on the Ebay right now and get yourself a copy of the Japanese "Ring" trilogy (Ring, Ring 2, Ring 0). Then experience what TRUE horror is like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Creepy is definately the word I say describes this film the most. The atomosphere is good too. I enjoyed this film. It is one of the few horror films made that have made me tense. Are there problems? Yes. The story is about a reporter that while trying to find out why her niece died comes across a tape that supposedly kills you if you watch it...so what does she do? She watches it. On it are a bunch of disturbing images in black and white that reminds one of that one Nine Inch Nail video from way back. She promptly shows it to her ex because he insists then her son sneaks and watches it. So the reporter has to solve the mystery or in seven days as a phone call tells them they will die. Some of the problems for me included the girl in the mental institution...you never find out why she is there or how she knows things. Also, the little boy has some physic (I know this is spelled wrong) powers that are never fully explained and at one point you wonder why didn't the boy say what he knew earlier. There are a couple of other little things, but all in all it was a good movie...now I just have to see what happens to me at the end of the week.</fullReview>

I got the movie for 2 dollars so I got lucky there but it is still awful. The horrible plot is about a video tape, that if you watch you end up dying 7 days later. I don't even know why the movie is even called The Ring. I don't know what the ring has anything about it. The movie isn't even scary. There is one good pop-up and that is at the start of the movie when the girls face turn ugly but that wasn't even scary for me. Then they do stupid investigation stuff and I end up getting bored and pull out my computer. Then they get to this island and find the well this dead girl (that the movie is about) and the main character goes down the well and thinks she solved it. I thought OMG,is this the end to this madness. Unfortunately it wasn't, I kinda was happy that the possessed girl or whatever she is killed the guy because I thought hay maybe this isn't a complete bust. Then 5 minutes later the movie ends with nothing answered and nothing explained. This movie is terrible and I recommend that nobody sees it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't get to the end of this shock fest. Naomi Watts investigates an exceedingly strange videotape. Her friends are indifferent to her unease. A close examination of the tape, which seems to curse its viewers, reveals a connection to an Anna Morgan whose ranch full of prize horses appears to have died of some unfathomable epidemic on the beach and -- that's about where I left.Possibly the climax revealed all and was done in a way that fascinated viewers as much as that bizarre VHS did, but I wouldn't know. A couple of elements were turn offs.One is that it was filmed in a way that saturated the images -- ALL the images -- with a familiar ghoulish green. It's the color of a comic-book Zombie. Man, is that tiresome.Another is that if the film managed to avoid a horror story clich, I must have missed it. Watts enters a room accompanied by spooky music, sees the back of the baby sitter's body sitting stiffly upright in a chair, approaches the chair and occupant, reaches her hand out to touch the apparently lifeless shoulder -- and the baby sitter shrieks, having only been asleep. Watts has a frightening dream, wakes up and thrusts her open-mouthed face into the camera lens, her eyes bulging, her chest panting. The experienced viewer pendiculates.I could see the plot developing in accordance with the usual textbook rules though. The shocks at first are minor, then grow more grotesque. The first truly bizarre experience that Naomi Watts has comes during one of her many playbacks of the tape. She stops it, zooms in on a fly that always has appeared in one corner of the screen, reaches tentatively towards it and then picks it out of the image, alive. Then what does she do? She's distracted and apparently releases the fly deliberately, uninterested in learning more about it. I'd have had it in a jar pronto and taken it to the nearest entomologist for a closer look at this mysterious mouche.Next up the scale, she's on the phone and begins coughing and hacks up a long string of what appears to be twined human hair, maybe a yard long, with some kind of small plastic device on the end of it. The object, whatever it is, shares the destiny of that fly. Nothing more is heard of it. The entire incident is immediately forgotten by Watts and dropped from the story.I noted before that when Naomi Watts wakes from a bad dream she sits upright and thrusts her open-mouthed face into the lens. That mouth almost saves the picture. In a movie full of dark shadows, rain, dampness, and green, Watt's two incisors are the only things that glisten. My God, those incisors belong on Bugs Bunny. I was in their thrall throughout. In some inexplicable way they add to Watts' delicate blond beauty. Talk about mysteries! That's about it. Naturally nobody believes Watts and her friends are helpless and any witnesses don't like to talk about the past and her child is in jeopardy and blah blah blah. I wonder what the original was like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good horror film with a cool concept. Gore Verbinski's style is unmistakable. He has left this work well marked with his stylistic shots, and suspenseful progression. Very creepy and a bit strange but it has a good mix of everything. psychological horror always must be sure to not be too slow-paced, because then it becomes boring. The Ring is a perfect example of what I consider a good psych-horror movie to be, because it unfolds like a mystery and keeps the viewer cerebrally involved...as it scares the crap out of them.The thrust of "the Ring" isn't only to entertain and to make shiver. It is also doubled by a reflexion on the power of the image. One of the images of the film depicts a woman in front of a mirror looking at the camera. So, she's also looking at the viewer. This is unhealthy voyeurism that the movie denounces like the insensible media which expose to the mainstream, woes and sorrows of the victims and so manipulate the viewers' fears. The sequence during which Ann Morgan's husband is incensed by Rachel's will to learn more about Samara rings thoroughly true. Moreover, these seemingly maladjusted images embody symbols: the chair and the lighthouse illustrate loneliness, the figure at the window (a hint at "Psycho"?, 1960) might symbolize parental severity. The creepiest, clammiest, twitchiest squealfest in months. Successfully envelops us in a disturbing experience. disturbing, unsettling and downright creepy.</fullReview>

I was amazed at how many people freaked when the girl came out of the TV, it wasn't scary at all. Its not even a new idea.. ever hear of Poltergeist? I wasn't scarred and I wasn't entertained. What makes a horror great? There are two ways to make a horror strong- either make it on something that could truly happen or something that is just full of suspense and tension. This movie had none of it- no reality, no suspense, no surprise. Just a video a women and her child, oh and of course the "hero" boyfriend. The start really wasn't that bad, but it got worse and worse. The end was just idiotic. I would stay away from this film if you are looking for a scare, that is unless you scare easier than a 1 year old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor remake of the Japanese original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the original Ring long before Hollywood had decided to 'have a go' at it. I found this remake to be entirely predictable.The original is a very chilling film ? even when watched with subtitles. In this version we have the usual 'love angle' with the estranged child's father (yawn,) performed with textbook wooden acting. Then we have the irrelevant random shock images etc.The scene in the original Ring where she crawls out of the TV scene is one of the most chilling things I have seen, you know that this is evil in its pure form. On this weak remake it is nothing more than a girl with blood streaked horror make up on her face.The other really annoying thing about this film is how you keep recognising scene types that have been borrowed from other films. The dialogue between Rachel and Noah could have been lifted from any one of a dozen cheap family soap dramas.Weak predictable and unnecessary remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember when everyone was talking about this? Remember when it was, like, the scariest movie ever, and stuff? Man, am I glad that fad has passed.This decent but incomplete adaptation is also a decent and incomplete companion piece to the original Ringu. I consider a fan of Asian cinema, but Ringu was also a decent and incomplete film unto itself. That's pretty much the way to describe this entire series.Why does the ghost decide to inhabit the curse in a videotape (of all things, especially considering that this remake comes in the DVD era)? The answer can only be assumed. How does the tape come to exist? Well apparently it was first recorded by those teenagers up in the mountains, but then again, how did that urban legend then spread if it the teenager who dies in the beginning was one of the first and only ones to see it? But more importantly than plot holes... why do people think this movie is scary again? An answer shall never rise from the well.Anyway, as a production its pretty decent. Naomi Watts is as good as any movie she's in, which means she does pretty well but not spectacular here. Gore Verbinski is, I feel, a really good director, he just is caught in Hollywood doing stuff like this. Everyone gives their due and the movie itself goes along pretty well (in fact, I give it entertainment points for being funny, as the horse falling into the water scene is spectacular comedy). It's just that nothing in the proceedings really sticks or matters. It's a horror show that toned itself down enough to be handled by 13 year olds, which means it's pretty much refused the right to do anything really interesting at all.And if trippy videos scare people, why isn't avant-garde cinema taking off? Hey, Ring-fans: the works of Stan Brakhage, man. That stuff can kill you.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric, but not scary, rather dumb, and very draggy - just like the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many horror fan boys proclaimed the original "Ringu" to be the scariest thing in years, the new in horror. I personally found the original to be quite dull. Some admired it for focusing on tension, but the fact is it wasn't suspenseful. It was rather dumb, occasionally creepy but never actually scary, and overall boring. Unsurprisingly, the American remake is lame also. The pacing is considerably better, but its still very contrived. There are moments of unease and creepiness, but the attempts at shock fail miserably. There are a few moments of unintentional hilarity (the horse, the hose) that also detract.To be honest, its competently made. Witnessing from this and "Pirates of the Caribbean", Gore Verbinski has some degree of talent visually. The film is atmospheric, full of some nice lighting and fog. However, a film can't run on atmosphere alone. There's simply no substance to "The Ring", and the plot is both moronic and makes little sense. Too many things are left unexplained, and most fatally, the film drags on. It seems to have roughly four endings, each of which would make a good way to end the film, but all of them together is disastrous. Despite the atmospheric direction from Verbinski and a decent if shallow lead turn from Naomi Watts, "The Ring" is over-hyped and most importantly, not scary at all. Its not as unbearable as "Ringu", but its still strictly mediocre. (4/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A waste of my time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this American remake of Ringu took all that was good and creepy about the original and made everything so obvious, boring and ... well (no offence) American! I suppose it looks good enough... there are some creepy bits... some of the actors weren't utterly useless. But overall it was a huge waste of my time. (I want those 2 hours of my life back... I could have done something more productive like... Oh, Stared at my ceiling?)What made me even more disappointed was that I had seen and enjoyed the original. (If I hadn't then I might just have given this one a 2 or 3 for trying.) It was good precisely because it didn't attempt to shock you at every turn but rather crept up at you and made you feel thoroughly uncomfortable. (In a good way.) Whereas this piece of rubbish tried so hard to be scary that it ended up not being scary at all. See the original instead... it is far superior to this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot was predicable and dull. Not the movie you want to see if you want to go see if you expect something good. The acting was okay but I wouldn't recommend the movie to any horror fan. You could guess the ending when the movie first started and everything in between was just to fill space. Everyone may say that this movie is so scary and full of suspense but if you're a real movie goer this movie it tasteless and dull. The Ring is a colossal waste of time and satellite frequency. Some of the actors over played their parts and some sounded like they were reading lines. The movie would have been better if those actors wouldn't have been in it. Want to see something really horrifying? Go stick your head in the toilet. What you will see in there is more scary than anything you will find in this flick. Startling? Maybe. Scary? Nope, try a different movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can understand why this is such a popular movie. I mean, it has plenty of false scares, extreme use of CGI, ghosts, and a hot lead actress such as Naomi Watts; who steals the movie with her performance and sexy looks. But for true Horror fans this may be cheating.When I first watched "The Ring" in the theater I thought it was boring, dull, and cheap. Over the years I've watched it on cable and even on local t.v. My opinion hasn't changed notably.Sure, this is an American remake but it goes too far on the CGI aspect and the Hollywood clich?s. I mean, the original "Ringu" was creepy and started the craziness for ghost children in Horror.The American remake exploits the Samara factor to the point that it is cheap, non-scary, an even laughable. For those who haven't seen the original, this version may fit for ghost revenge tastes but forget about suspense or true scare scenes. Sure, the final scene involving Samara coming out of T.V. and chasing some guy is candy for the eye but still it's a lame scene.Enough with remakes and CGI abuse. This movie is responsible for a new wave of cheap CGI Horror flicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this movie is crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, as it was said before, this movie is a remake of the excellent Japanese movie "Ringu" by Hideo Nakata. I saw "Ringu" several years ago and really enjoyed it. So when I heard about this American remake I was expecting the worst, and sadly, I was right. "The Ring" isn't worth "Ringu". It's just crap compared to it, and above all, it's not scary an inch ! "Ringu" is really scary, but this remake has lost all that made "Ringu" so good. The work that Hideo Nakata made on "Ringu" is pure genius, whereas "The Ring" is just another bad Hollywood horror film with only a bit of originality since the story is Japanese. The music that tells you when it's going to be "scary" before it happens..., the same shots seen a thousand times as in all Hollywood horror films..., the roughness, the crudeness, and the gore effects that are supposed to be terrifying..., this is only a glimpse of what makes "The Ring" so dull and stupid. Of course if you haven't ever seen any Japanese horror film and only know the Hollywood turkeys, you may find "The Ring" scary, but it's nothing compared to how terrifying you'll find "Ringu". Watch "Ringu" and you'll see what Hollywood can't do and why Hollywood horror films are so pitiful compared to the Japanese ones. I therefore strongly not recommend "The Ring", and recommend instead the brilliant "Ringu".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am writing this after four years of the release of the movie, and I normally don't write comments. But I am doing so because I felt that the movie was nowhere near the creepiness I was expecting. I heard, and heard from lots of people that this movie was sicko horrifying. So I had expectations, and many expectations. I made environment for watching. I watched this movie when it was 2 of night, alone in my room, wearing headphones and volume cranked to full. The movie began and for whole of the movie I was expecting that now the hell is going to loose, now it will bring the horror out of me. But was I wrong? Yes I was. True that I am kind of person who do not feels horror most of the times. I watched 'Dawn of the dead' (2004) in the same environment and wasn't feeling afraid. If you don't think that Dawn of the dead was creepy, maybe you are right. But I am sure that the first half an hour of that movie is indeed creepy. The movie ended and there was no scene when my heartbeat was increased. I felt that 'Dawn of the dead (2004)' and both Exorcist are more creepy. And this movie lived up nowhere near to the hype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Horror has come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie last night and I must say this is the best horror movie out of Hollywood, I've ever seen. Earlier this year I saw "Shining" and "The Exorcist" - which everyone had been telling me about and saying that they were the scariest movies of all time.... In the end - after watching those two I knew I had wasted time. There was nothing scary, but gore cursing and other stupid effects in both those movies. This movie had some extraordinary direction. Each frame/scene ends leaving you thinking that something will happen.I had to turn away couple times so I wouldn't have to look at the faces of the girl who dies in the start and Naomi's husband who dies in the end. Not that I was scared, but I don't believe looking at those gruesome images is any good, mentally. A true horror classic with no gore, no nudity, no cursing and other B grade horror movie stuff. I would rate this and "The Others" as the best ones I've ever seen. I live alone in a studio apartment, but I wasn't scared or anything. It's simply a matter of what you want to believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good movie. Not really scary, just a bit creepy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard quite a few people make comments such as "this is the scariest movie ever!" I rented it with a friend. It wasn't actually very "scary," it was more "creepy" and the ideas were more "cool" than anything else.If you're looking for scary stuff, that is the realm of horror stories and the macabre, the king (obviously) is H.P. Lovecraft. His take on the matter is summarized by this line of his: "The oldest and greatest emotion of man is fear; and the oldest and greatest kind of fear is fear of the unknown." The Ring (and other modern "horror" movies) could take a bit of a lesson from that. Don't show everything. Let the mechanisms be implicit (not missing, but not explicit either). That's part of why Hitchcock was so successful at what he did ("The Birds," etc.).Anyway, It's worth a rent if you've never seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had read comments about how the Ring wasn't as good as Ringu from people who saw Ringu first and having watched the ring first, I thought the Japanese one was not scary at all. The suspenseful sound effects and music were more effective in the American version to make it creepier where as in the Japanese one, there was a smooth transition to when the death scenes came out. The decayed faces on the dead victims were scarier than the ones in the Japanese version. Also, I thought the ESP in the Japanese version was kind of lame. I thought the revelation of the story at the end was better made in the American version. The American film is superior!</fullReview>

The little boy was too mature for my liking, and the other characters were somewhat clich - A freaky killer who was a seemingly innocent child, the mother had a one dimension personality and was jam-packed with sarcastic comments, The ex-boyfriend -a non-believer turned believer when it was a bit too late, etc. Also, What if the person who was supposed to die wasn't at home or anywhere near a television set? What happens then? When you think about it, it is a little bit unrealistic that all of the 'video' victims just happen to be at home when they are supposed to die. Now, I kind of wish that someone could have died somewhere outside the home, it possibly could have made it a little bit more realistic.</fullReview>

There was some confusion (as i read in other comments) about how the images got on the tape. It WAS mentioned in the movie. The four teens from the beginning were trying to record a football game, when they were staying in CABIN12. Samara, being in the well RIGHT UNDER CABIN12 made the reception bad and as the football game was recorded, the images were placed there instead.There are parts of this movie that you wont understand until you see The Ring twO. The second one is better. Nothing really happens in the first one. Its an introduction to the story. All it is is Rachel (Naiomi Watts) trying to figure out the mystery. Something ACTUALLY happens in the second one. The second one is definitely bizarre. Mostly cause a Japanese person directed it, instead of Gore Verbinski. They are both great. If you're a GREAT fan of horror movies that aren't really scary, but give you that EERIE feeling when you're watching it..i'd recommend seeing this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring is one of those movies where you have to pay attention cause if you don't you may miss something. Noah died looking freakier than Katie because he got her out of the well(even though she was invisible) when he got Rachel out of the well. Rachel put Samara's spirit to rest and Noah unearthed it again because if Samara had gotten out of the well, she would have killed her mother. instead, Noah got her out of the well so she killed him. that's why she came out of the TV. Rachel watched it and she got the call that she'd die. after her, Noah watched it so he was gonna die. because Rachel showed it to him, she was spared. Aidan watched it so if he shows it to anyone, that person will die. Samara's spirit was at rest because she knew someone knew the truth about who killed her and that's why the football game wasn't on the tape. the well was under cabin 12 where the game was playing and she wanted to be heard so she recorded the RING. That's her voice saying"seven days". and that's why the pictures taken after they watch the tape are blurry. The person gets the feeling they will die soon because the TV is off, and static comes on. The person turns it off and leaves. then, the static comes back on like an invisible hand turns on the TV</fullReview>

This is a great movie with so many twists and turns, but it makes you think which is kinda a good thing because most movies are just so bland and just plain boring! anyways this movie is awesome and one more thing two new scary movies that are actually scary are The Exorcism of Emily Rose &amp; Cry_Wolf.

		<shortDescription>the best thriller ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was just a year ago when my eye caught a DVD called ''The ring'' in a Videoclub. I had heard a few things about it but I didn't think that it would be such a big deal. However, I decided to borrow and watch it. I was totally astonished. From the very beginning to the end credits I remained absorbed in the magic of this movie. Even though the plot is a bit complicated, it is imaginative and totally innovative that it can lure even the most demanding spectators. According to it, there is a videotape which if someone watches, he dies after seven days. Yeah, it may be unrealistic but very challenging as well. Isn't it? Furthermore, the direction was great.Gore Verbinski, the charismatic director of ''The ring'' managed successfully to create a gloomy atmosphere where horror and mystery are harmoniously combined. This whole situation provokes to the spectator a weird feeling of anxiety and fear for what is going to happen in the movie.Undoubtedly, the outstanding performance of Naomi Watts, who proved for one more time how talented she is, has a great impact on them too.In many cases, the spectator puts himself into her place and tries to answer the questions about the cursed videotape. The whole movie is a quest for the truth, an attempt to survive from the evil that seems to live in the tape. One of the best thriller ever, equal to the ''Silence of lambs'', with Jodie Foster, and ''Seven'', with Brad Pitt. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

It was just a movie with a barely there plot line with lots of lame, random images that were suppose to be freaky. I was able to sit through the whole thing and instead of feeling scared, had to resist the urge to laugh all the way through.The only freaky thing was the little kid. He was definitely a piece of work and needed therapy even before viewing the videotape.I think my brother, who joined me in heckling the film (and he is a horror film lover) summed it up best when he said: "I guess the point of the movie is VHS is evil so watch DVDs." *Thumbs WAY Down*</fullReview>

The story focuses on a tape that when you watch it the phone rings, you answer it and a voice on the other side says 'seven days' then you have seven days before your death. This story is based around a reporter who is attempting to figure out why a group of people died at exactly the same time. It just so happens that they had watched the tape with one an other. You are killed by a dead girl named Samara.Of course the reporter (naomi watts) watches the tape then shows her ex the tape. she knows death is coming her way so investigates the matter further.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I live in the UK and was glad to find something a little different.Hideo Nakata's 'Ring' was the first film I'd genuinely found creepy mainly due to the gradual build of suspense and the fact you were actually given some kind of atmospherics (rather than an American paint-by numbers or loud in-your-face horror).Gore Verbinski's remake does two things: 1) Scene by scene re-enactments of all the best moments of the original (with none of the same sensibilities or feel of the Japanese version). Basically it's Ring-Lite in terms of horror, but also it represents a case of trying to achieve "more bang for your buck" 2) Removes all internal logic present in the world of 'Ring'. What the heck was with the horses in 'The Ring' (2002)? At least Sadako's lineage (her mother has psychic abilities) goes some way toward answering questions posed by the events of the first film.I personally don't really like anything beyond 'Ring' &amp; 'Ring 2'.'Ring 0: Birthday' humanised Sadako to such an extent, the character really doesn't scare me anymore. The mystery is gone and also I doubt anyone could fear her ever again.'Ring 2' was as far as it should have gone.No spin-offs, rip-offs or remakes.However, I await Nakata's US made 'The Ring 2' with a little more enthusiasm. Although US critics who raved about the first remake, they have been unimpressed with the sequel from what I've heard thus far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie should be put under the title of horror, but more one of Terror. The Ring contains very little gore, and apart from a couple of scenes (bath suicide, death of Samara) there is little violence. The film wins by having images which are 'wrong' from the girl in the closet at the beginning with the horribly contorted face, its not bloody but just 'not right', difficult to look at, easy to remember. The same with Samara emerging from the TV and doing 'that walk'.In agreement with the other user comment this does seem to be a movie about settling disgruntled spirits, however in difference the characters fail to do so. The films heroine does link the clues, and visits the resting place of the demon, however she realises that nobody can calm her, and even after trying to bargain with the dead, they still come for our souls, there is nothing anybody can do to escape.</fullReview>

I am a big horror movie fan. After watching it, I was like "That's it?!" Seriously, this was nothing to brag about. I wasn't that impressed. A videotape that kills people? Why not just stop the tape? It looked boring. The effects were plain. The acting was alright. Over all, it wasn't too bad. I was just not that impressed. I was really let down. Maybe I was expecting too much. But I just won't watch this film again.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think I can put into words how stupid this movie was. The other movie I watched today, The Scorpion King, was ten times better than this boring piece of crap. It started out like it was gonna be a spoof of horror movies, but turned out to pretend to be something it wasn't, which is a real horror movie. The Ring wasn't scary in the least, I didn't care about any of the characters, and I really couldn't have cared less about the dumb, meandering, and pointless story. I have seen four movies in the past two days that I never wanted to waste my time seeing. Now that I've seen them (Underworld, Scorpion King, The Ring, and 28 Days Later) I wish I would have stuck with my gut feeling and just not watched any of them. SK was the best of the four, and the other three all sucked about the same amount, although in different ways. If you have not seen this movie yet, heed my advice and stay away from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a poor remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this film all the way through. It's alright, if it was original I'd go so far as to say good.It isn't original though. It's a remake of a film that was only made 4 years ago. So technology can't be the excuse. It seems like some film guy went on holiday to Japan saw it in the cinema, rushed home and made it before the original could make it's way to America.This film has not been improved just dumbed down.I feel sorry for Americans, 'cause someone seems to think they aren't capable of watching foreign movies. Luckily Ringu is now a cult classic and The Ring (2002) is just yesterdays news, as seems to be the trend in modern cinema. The only good thing about the remake is that it's created more interest and awareness of the original film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a decent movie i wouldn`t even attempt to watch the cr*ppy Jappy version because it`s subtitled and subtitled movies are the worse movies you will ever get...FACT. you spent too much time loking at what is being said and not enough time looking at what is going on plus it`s just plain annoying thats why they invented dubbing.anyway onto this movie: it is good the atmosphere was there which is a good thing especially for a movie of this kind the ending fell flat on it`s arse (*my opinion only*) but the rest of the movie was good.Naomi Watts is lovely and she was perfect in this movie as was the lovely Amber Tamblyn (the first to be a victim of the cursed tape).the acting was solid and the story was fine but the ending could have been more of a nail biting cliff hanging kind of ending, it was an ok ending but not the best not what i would have done.if you like thrillers and Naomi Watts then i recommend this to you, it`s more thriller than horror even though it had a couple of creepy moments in it, so if you`ve not seen it then go do so you`ve nothing to loose, you could watch worse like: Resident Evil :(.rating for this movie: 8/10...rating for Naomi Watts 10/10...rating for Amber Tamblyn 10/10.bring on the sequel cant wait to see what happens :).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the scariest things I've ever seen, however...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...not completely successful as a movie."The Ring" really is one of the scariest movies ever. However it suffers from one mayor problem and that's the story. Even though it's original, hardly anything is explained and lot's of things are taken for granted, it also suffers from some plot holes. I don't know, maybe it was the creators intension to leave some things open and let the viewers themselves fill it up but to me it just seems that the story was an excuse just to make a movie with tons of scary moments. The fact that nothing really is explained maybe is what makes the movie scary but quite frankly I just don't buy it.But for some reason it doesn't really harm the movie. The biggest strength of the movie are obviously the scary moments and not the story. It are not the images that are the scariest things, what scared me the most was the use of sound. Next to "Das Boot" I rank this as the movie with the best use of sound. The movie also has perfect timing and a perfect horror atmosphere.An amusing things are that what I think we can already call the typical Gore Verbinski characters. There are some highly amusing and eccentric characters in the movie. It's funny that after have seeing only 2 Gore Verbinski films I can already recognize his style. I think that says something about the director.Best way to watch this movie is late at night, at home, alone with the lights of and the volume up and then you better hope that the phone doesn't ring. The movie is full with scary moments that will scare you in one way or another. I think it's safe to say that I can guarantee you will be scared. And be warned that you might have difficulties getting at sleep after you have seen the movie. It has a great ending that I will not and don't want to spoil.See this movie if you want to see a completely different horror movie. I would have rated this movie "only" a 7 but since it actually gave me a nightmare (something that I hadn't had for at least 2 years), it obviously had an higher impact on me then I expected, so I rate this movie a:8/10I just hope that "The Ring 2" will clear up some things.http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lame remake of a lame movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seem to be one of the few people in the world that thought the original Japanese version of this movie ('Ringu') was utter crap. There have been some amazing horror and other kinds of disturbing movies coming out of Japan over the last several years (e.g. 'Battle Royale', 'Wild Zero', 'Freezer', 'Gemini', Takashi Miike movies like 'Audition' and 'Ichi The Killer') so to focus on 'Ringu' as an example of cutting edge film making is a joke. (sigh) So hear we have the Hollywood remake... I really didn't expect much of it considering the lameness of the source material, but it's actually a little lamer, with some 'Sixth Sense'-isms thrown in and some silly stuff involving horses, which didn't make any sense. But then not much makes sense in either version anyway. My main problem with both movies is that they just aren't frightening. At all. Not one little bit. My other problem - and I could easily have overlooked it if they WERE frightening - was the sheer stupidity of the plot. The initial premise of a killer video is okay, if not exactly original (David Cronenberg's astonishing 'Videodrome' twenty years ago dealt with something similar, a cable TV broadcast which caused life-altering "hallucinations"), but the movie doesn't even stick with it, it goes into an increasingly ridiculous plot which has so many wholes in it (just who is making those phone calls by the way?) it's impossible to keep interested. And people say Dario Argento movies have stupid plots and cardboard characters! As to ex-Soap actress Naomi Watts, I just can't see what's so good about to her. The guy playing her ex, another 'Home And Away' veteran I think, he's pretty faceless, and Brian Cox, the one good actor in the movie, has little more than a cameo, which gives him little to work with. 'The Ring' is the most overrated horror movie since, well, 'Ringu'. And as far as I'm concerned anyone who thinks 'The Ring' is some kind of horror masterpiece can kiss mine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoilers!!)Good god! Are people that dumb to think this is a great movie? I'm just posing a question, not to say that they are. But really. This thing has virtually no acting whatsoever. I was not impressed. This movie couldn't scare a mouse even if it wanted to. It's also emotionless. It's basically and truely an americanized version of Ringu. And it goes with all the blame. Blame the parents, blame the parents. The original movie put the blame on mistreatment from the mother perhaps, but mostly the doctor who killed her. But in The Ring, the father is at fault, the mother kills the girl. And the movie doesn't end all that good.The pace of the movie is poor. Takes 55 minutes to go thru 6 days and 60 minutes to go thru 1 day. Alot of the movie doesn't make sense. The video is totally stupid. (the one we ain't supposed to watch)The timelines are rediculous. That cabin is far older than 40-50 years. It looks like it was built in the late 1800's. And even at that, I grew up going to this cabin that was built in 1910 and it looked far nicer. (yes it was a cabin. paper thin walls built on bricks type thing) The girl is too cute of a monster. Compared to Ringu which never really lets you see the face. I basically assume that the creators were aiming at folks who either loved Blair Witch Project (or god forbid it's sequel) or as it's pretty obvious, The Sixth Sense. Putting the focus on the kid. Which for a good chunk of the movie the mother could care less for.My recommendation. Watch Ringu first. Then watch this movie at your own risk. Ringu is very deceptive. Certainly it won't make you jump watching it, but don't walk round in the dark for awhile.The Ring will make you want these people to die. Especially that stupid brainless mother. Who acts smarter than she is.3/10Quality: 1/10 Entertainment: 3/10 Replayable: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ok, i got hold of this film after having seen the original and been absolutely terrified by it, i couldn't get through it the first time was much too scared. but this one i just wanted to kill myself it was so so bad on its own not just in comparison. they tried to make it different by changing some thing about the film but it all just falls flat on its face. there isn't anything in the film except a promising performance from the guy who played Noah. the kid was just whinny and irritating, the dialogue was kinda dire and Brian Cox is completely pointless and unnesesary in the film. the effects in the film are appauling and really not needed see the original for proof that CGI aint needed, or see the Two Towers for how to CGI somebody well. i suppose ishould comment on the plot at some point apart from just bitching about how bad it is. a journalist promises her sister that she will find out what killed her daughter, which leads her to uncover the tape that seven days after watching it you die, she watches the tape and so do some others and then it has some pointless rubbish and it ends badly and unlike the original. there is very little that remains the same about the remake, for a good example of remaking a classic and brilliant japanese movie and making it american you can do no wrong it watching the magnificent seven! but if you want a film that is just quite bad tehn fine go ahead. but please at least give some consideration to watching the original and you can't possibly argue that this is in anyway 1 billionth the film that is! a poor film and one of the worst americanised remakes i've ever seen</fullReview>

Good scarry scenes but sometimes a bit on the gore side, and dont match. Despite the good visual devises and the wise use of light, its usually boring and no effective. The worst thing is that it doesnt give any explanation of lots of important details, for example why, who and when the video tape was made. Getting with your mind all confused you get to the absurd ending, which is hilarious, strange and doesnt make any sense. Summarizing the film is pretentious and with only a visual display of effective scenes. Dont spend your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Valiant attempt at cutting-edge horror but let down on a few fronts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>God, now they're looking to remake films within four years of release! Well, if nothing else, THE RING has generated polarised opinion. Is it or isn't it better than Japan's RINGU (1998)? My opinion is that its pretty line-ball. For 4/5 of the movie the American version has arguably the edge, but production values and a dodgy last 10 minutes detract.Many images from THE RING are just superb. As creepy and as disturbing as anything I've seen since THE INNOCENTS. Clever SCREAM type opening which broadens into an intelligent and articulate tale of distinct horror. Aussie Watts turns in a blinder of a performance that leaves Kidman's turn in THE OTHERS a work of almost mediocrity. The film follows the Japanese version very closely, diverging principally with the central players and the plot-line variance. There is nothing to be gained re-hashing the story, any interested party will be aware of it.Certain aspects to the film are quite memorable. The cinematography for one. This is is a class of its own. The scenes with the horse aboard the ferry are as striking as they are horrific. The unfolding of the mystery is where THE RING becomes unhinged. Having been far to manipulative and clever for its own good, the makers were only ever left with a narrow window of credibility and backed into a corner the thing doesn't gel, with far too many unanswered questions and riddles. The greatest horror was in what you DIDN'T see...thus when poor old Noah finds himself watching the absolute last film he ever needed to see, the audience is suddenly handed a total rip-off of Dario Argento's DEMONS which wrecks both continuity and credibility. As many have pointed out also, the incessant appearance of the boom-mike is just inexcusable in a film of this quality and totally wrecks the tension and mood.Many were the good things to be had but 7.9 is an insane rating with regard to many other classics of film I could name that have rated far less in the IMDb. 6.8 perhaps! I would be lying if I said that I did not enjoy this film..it COULD have been one of the best horror/psychological films of the past 30 years. As it stands though, SIGNS and even THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES were better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Ahhh, "word of mouth"! The best advertising campaign a movie can have. Just ask "My Big Fat Greek Wedding". Positive word of mouth had me anxious to see "The Ring". Not many clever horror/suspense/thrillers come around these days. It appears the moviegoing public is so starved for this genre, that we can turn mish-mash into success at the box office. Don't kid yourself. This is a stupid, poorly made, well conceived milkshake of a movie. It blatantly steals from the best - "Poltergeist", "Psycho", "Rear Window", "Rosemary's Baby", and "The Sixth Sense". Even the lead actors appear to be rip-offs: Naomi Watts (excellent in "Mulholland Drive") mimics Rebecca DeMorney and Theresa Russell, Martin Henderson takes on Viggo Mortenson and Elias Koteas, and little David Dorfman does his best Haley Joel Osment and Adam Hann-Byrd ("Little Man Tate"). actually have talent. Director Gore Verbinski ("The Mexican") seems to be a big fan of horror movies and by golly, was going to get every idea he ever had into this one. And I think he had Brian Cox use one electrical appliance for every one of his ideas. Nice premise with the video tape and 7 days, just poor execution. The film does offer up some wonderful visuals in dream sequences and video. The past is much more interesting than the present for these characters. And I want to nominate Naomi Watts character for the absolute WORST MOTHER OF THE YEAR. So ridiculous.</fullReview>

It takes a pretty awful movie to have a person wishing he were in class. The only thing effective in this movie were the "shockers"--the cut to scenes that began with a loud noise. At least i jumped. Otherwise this was a moronic movie with a convoluded storyline that made no sense. And as others have noted, the ending was so completely forced that i wanted to force a pencil through my head. So completely forced that i felt the need to use a stupid play of words. The sad thing was that the movie had true potential. But all it did was sit in front of me saying, "Hello, i'm a psychological thriller. I want to play with your head and make you scared." But it takes more than that to scare a person. Just as in some suspensful movies, the suspenseful moments are overplayed to the point that they aren't truly suspenseful. The Ring suffered this same problem: scary moments were so played up that they ceased to be scary and caused me to laugh. To be honest the acting is really not too shabby. Its good, really. But it was wasted on a poorly executed flick. Time to research the Japanese version to see if it avoided the pitfalls of the American show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just because Spielberg's DreamWorks made a horror movie (an American version of a Japanese hokey) doesn't mean it's better than the budget-challenged "Nightmare on Elm Street", "Halloween", the campy 1957 "Voodoo Island" or the maligned "Abandon". The most dreadful thing about "The Ring" is its characters' lack of belief in and respect for themselves. Thus, to me, this movie draws comparison to the equally-dreadful, boring and inane "Blair Witch Project".My neurotic and droll mind actually thought that DreamWorks' marketing funds generated (a) the good buzz on this movie from the starving media, (b) the bad buzz from the media on "Abandon" (another inane thriller movie which opened at the same time as "The Ring" on 10/18/02) (Translation: No marketing funds from Paramount), and (c) the phony squeals, screams and applause from the Saturday night audience at Loews Cinema at Universal City in Los Angeles.In the end, it's all about money and good old-fashioned ballyhoo. DreamWorks produced another profitable movie that the public wants. No argument there. But for the media to say and the adoring public to start believing that "The Ring" is an intelligent and a genuine horror movie, now, that's a lot of croak.</fullReview>

Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory has more scary moments.First off this movie steals elements from so many other horror films and uses them incompetently. The whole into comes from Scream, the creepy kids who can see ghosts from Sixth Sense and on and on.An evil demon child "who should never have been born" makes an evil video tape that looks like a rejected Nine Inch Nails video and seven days after watching it, the viewer dies. So what does the heroine do, she shows it to everyone she cares and about, but won't let strangers see it.The one, genuinely, creepy moment comes at the end, but by the time you get to it, you want the evil demon child to get rid of all the morons you've seen in the movie so far. And the end was the dumbest thing I've ever encountered.Seeing this makes me want to see if the Japanese original is nearly half as dumb and incompetently done.</fullReview>

It was absolutely the most tedious, poorly acted, unoriginal and boring movie I've seen all year.I thought Naomi Watts should have won the Oscar last year for her amazing performance in Mulholland Drive and now am rethinking that opinion. I'm starting to think that she owes that performance to typecasting and David Lynch. What I thought was a brilliant job of intentional bad acting for the first half of "Drive" may have been the work of a bad actress being brilliantly used by a great director.there is so much wrong with this movie I don't even know where to start but suffice to say that you will lose count of the absurdities that fill this movie. And all for nothing. There may be a couple of scenes that make you jump but nothing is in the least bit scary.Watts should give 90% of everything she makes to David Lynch and take out a contract on Verbinski. He may have killed what I thought was a promising career.BTW, you'll see a lot of good reviews by critics around the country but believe me they are being baffled by BS (lit. degrees can be catered to by the way).This is a load of crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A silly Twin Peaks rip-off!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Worst film of 2002!! Poorly written, poorly acted &amp; poorly directed. Namoi Watts who showed promise as an actress in "Mulholland Drive" but she sure wasted her talents on this film. I heard the film cost a reported $60 million to make. I sure would like to know where the $60 million went? Surely noton the screen or its plot more for the markting of this film. Another film that shows how a company like "Dremworks" is just in the movie business to make a fast buck and not out make a truly great film. I saw this at an advance screening and boy what a waste of my time. The first 1/2 hour I was interseted in the story, &amp; I was caught up in the mystery of the VHS tape that killed people who watched it, the last hour an 1/2 the film got boring, slow-moving and muddled; characters came and went and gave half assed answers and the characters seemed to spill over from the "Twin Peaks" Tv show, and the ending was the biggest scam since "The Blair Witch Project". Not scary more like the "The Changeling" gone high-tech. I very silly movie with enough plot holes to sink a huge ship &amp; a film by then end that doesn't make sense and leaves more questions than answers. Thank god I saw this for free since I would been really made if I had wasted $8.00 to see this over hyped and under done film. Skip it &amp; wait for $0.50 cents day at your local dollar theater, or better yet wait for $0.99 cents day at your local video store when your really bored. Another film that should be considered for the Rasebery Award for Worst film of 2002!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ring a Ding Ding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** At first I thought that "The Ring" was the telephone ringing right after one watched this crazy video tape about trees deep water wells a fly in the ointment and finally a desolate island with this strange looking woman and lighthouse with only a ladder and chair in it! All taped in grainy black and white. It came as a complete shock to me when it was reviled in the movie that anyone who watched this mind bogging tape would die in exactly seven days! I thought that anyone who was able to sit through the whole God awful video tape would have died a whole lot sooner!It's after her niece Katie, Amber Tamlyn, suddenly died of fright seven days after she saw the tape that Seattle newspaper investigative reporter Rachel Keller, Naomi Watts, decided to check what was the cause of Katie's mysterious death. As things turn out not only does Rachel track down the strange killer tape, at the country motel where Katie spent the weekend with her friends, but also ends up watching it! What made things even worse is that Rachel's six year old son Adian, David Drofman, saw the tape as well without his mother knowing about it. This set the stage for Rachel, after finding out that the tape can actually kill anyone who watched it, together with her live-in boyfriend and Aidan's father Noah, Martin Henderson, attempt to somehow find out how to prevent the tape from not only killing Aidan but also Rachel as well as Noah who, you guessed it, also saw the tape! The movie "The Ring" never fully explains why this weirdo video-tape has this strange power to kill anyone who takes the time to watch it! We get this half-ass story that it had something to do with the creepy Morgan family who were champion horse breeders and lived on the island depicted in the video-tape. Anna Morgan, Shannon Cochran, the strange woman in the tape is shown killing herself by jumping off a cliff on the island. Anna's even stranger daughter Samara, Daveigh Chase, the person who the video-tape seemed to be all about seems to have had completely vanished into thin air after the tape was finished. It's old man Richrd Morgan, Brian Cox, the only surviving member of the Morgan clan who seems to be the only person in the movie who knows the secret of what this off-the-wall tape is really all about. But with him being tracked down and unmercifully harassed by Rachel into having him reveal the tape's secrets he just flips out and and ended it all in grand fashion. Richard goes out in a blaze of glory by electrocuting himself with some 20,000 volts of electricity using his overflowing bathtub as the electric volts powerful grounded conductor!***SPOILER**** The movie starts to fall apart as it slowly, and I mean Slowly, lumbers on to it's shocking as well as brainless conclusion. It's then that everything goes to pieces when the long dead, it turned out that she was murdered, Samara comes back to life in both the bottom of a 150 foot empty well as well as in, and out, of Noah's TV set! By the time the film is finally over you begin to realize that not only you but those who made it have absolutely no idea what its supposed to be all about!P.S "The Ring" seems to have copied, even though its based on the recent Japanese horror thriller "Riongu", from the 1983 David Cronenberg Sci-Fi classic "Videodrome". The big difference between the two movies is that "Videodrome" despite it's complicated storyline was both thought-provoking as well as entertaining where as "The Ring" never even managed to get off the ground!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Did Absolutely Nothing For Me - Except Put Me To Sleep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the high ratings and good reviews this movie gets, I approached it with very high expectations, which ultimately led to a major disappointment. The movie was spoiled from the start by a story that made no sense whatsoever (incoherent is a word that comes to mind to try to describe the plot), was then further burdened by weak acting galore and then ruins the only hope for its redemption by not even being bad enough to be funny - it ended up just plain bad (and not in the least bit scary.) Out of a mountain of problems, let me highlight just one: where in the world did the video come from? The story (such as it is) revolves around the concept that anyone who watches this video dies exactly seven days later. But the origin of the video is never satisfactorily explained. Yes, it has something to do with Samara (the deceased girl whose evil powers are still being used from her grave) - but how? And since the video is the centrepiece of the movie, I found that a major stumbling block that I couldn't get over. The truth is, this movie put me to sleep for about 40 minutes in the middle. When I could make no sense of the ending after waking up, I assumed it was because of the 40 minutes I had missed; so I went back and watched those 40 minutes. Clearly I was a glutton for punishment. It still made no sense. It was a total waste of 2 hours. 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a terrible movie. Not "so bad its good". There's nothing GOOD about it. It wasn't scary at all. And I kept dozing off during the too-long-talking-about-god-knows-what scenes. There was no plot whatsoever. A videotape? Give me a break! The ONLY fun I had with this movie was laughing about how terrible it was afterward. Oh, and calling the preppy annoying neighbors down the street and whispering "...seven days" into the phone, that was a riot. But not this movie, oooooooooooh no! This is a perfect example of the DEATH of the Horror Genre. The acting was pretty lousy (except for Brian Cox, who played Richard Morgan, the girl's insane father). The whole "gloomy" scene thing was just plain stupid. The girl wasn't scary AT ALL! Its called a gun people, SHOOT HER IN THE DAMN FACE! or...burn the tape and stop keeping the so-called "curse" alive. The horse scene was stupid as well. My brother watched the sequel and told me about 2 scenes...I forget what happened. I either got sick to my stomach or laughed so hard it hurt....either way, my stomach was in pain.

It ranks right up there with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, THE GODFATHER PART III, SIGNS, THE VILLAGE and FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS.I was 28 years old when I saw this and was laughing out loud during several parts of the movie. The part where the girl comes through the TV at the end had me almost on the floor. I don't understand how people are scared by this. If you little teenyboppers want to see a real scary movie, go watch Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING or THE EXORCIST.This movie is just really, really bad. Save your money.

		<fullReview>I gave this a 9 only because the movie isn't one to buy for watching over and over. Otherwise, I thought the first time through it was a 10. Everyone I know who watched it were just "WOWed" by it.It's scary, has a good storyline and decent acting. While not action packed, it keeps you glued. The ideas presented in it can certainly give you a jump when your phone rings. Definitely watch it, at night, alone (or with a member of the opposite sex), and you will enjoy it. It might also be enjoyable for groups of young friends. As with most serious scary movies - you don't want people who lighten the mood. Stay in the right ambiance and you will be frightened.Not a recommended purchase (DVD/VHS) for most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was the big deal with this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My school had a free screening of this movie one year, so I took advantage of it. I don't have high expectations of recently released horror movies, so if an opportunity arises where I don't have to waste money to see it, I'll take it. 'The Ring' was a major disappointment. As everyone probably knows, the story involves a videocassette that brings death upon it's viewers, who will recieve a phone call. Bottom line: don't pick up the telephone. Actually the movie makes for a good prank if you have friends watching this movie and then dial their phone while they're in the middle of seeing it. Will they answer it or won't they? I never found this movie to be scary and I blame it on one too many cheap scare tactics. At one point the story gets so ridiculous in trying to find out who the person is on the tape that I was expecting them to say the horse did it. It also doesn't add to the suspense when people in the theater are forcing their screams at nearly every (even subtle) little surprise in the movie. Now, normally, I love a good horror film, even if it is recently released, so long as I liked it. But this movie was just too overrated for what it was, probably trying to cash in on some of the fright fest exploits of the Blair Witch Project. They're not the same movie, but their scare tactics are similar at points. I say, if you're an easy scare when it comes to horror movies, then you'll probably go nuts with this production. But otherwise, I think it is a like it or hate it movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ring moves along slowly and the ending makes no sense. One scene made me jump(SPOILER:when the girl climbs out of the TV). The video tape had nothing scary about it. It was just a bunch of jumbled images in which some were explained later in the film and others weren't. And the film never explains how the tape came into existance to begin with. And what was with the horse on the ferry. A horse goes crazy, big deal. And the kid's character was a total rip off from 6th sense. He says he talks to the dead girl, but that is never explained. But the ending takes the cake as the dumbest explaination ever in a horror film. (SPOILERS) The lady, Rachel, assumes the reason she survived is because she made a copy of the tape. Huh! What! That is so stupid, so she gets her son to make a copy. That was just ridiculous. It's like the writer couldn't think of anything clever so he just came up with the simplest idea, regardless if it really made sense.FINAL VERDICT: Big let down! Not scary! Just an average movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>rip-off of the 1980 classic "The Changeling"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best part of Gore Verbinski's "The Ring", and one of the only reasons to see the movie, is Hans Zimmer's masterful score. It will go down as one of the most haunting and complex scores of his career. But besides the music and a few effective scenes the movie has nothing going for it.Naomi Watts, who can be a brilliant actress when in the hands of the right director(like David Lynch), is awful in this movie. She, along with most of the cast, consistently delivers her lines as if she were reading them off a teleprompter. Watts exhibits the same kind of artificiality that was necessary for her character in "Mulholland Drive", but here it is just embarrassing and it comes across as a terrible performance.Gore Verbinski, who shows potential as a filmmaker with a few well-directed scenes, based this film on the Japanese horror movie with the same title. The original movie, in and of itself, was a rip-off of the 1980 classic "The Changeling" with George C. Scott. It is incredibly vexatious when you sit there in the theatre waiting for the pay-off and it turns out to be the pay-off from another movie.Like I said before, most of the acting is atrocious, with the exception of Brian Cox's cameo. It is impossible for a bad movie to bring down this amazing actor. In fact, the two scenes involving Brian Cox are the most effective and frightening moments in the movie. Every other scene intended to be scary was laughable. The scares could be spotted a mile away.With "The Ring" Verbinski wanted to make a rich, psychologically disturbing horror film along the same lines as "The Tenant" and other great films that are better than this movie. Instead what we get is a film that wants to be something that it cannot be due to a flawed screenplay and bad performances. Not to mention that for anyone who has seen "The Changeling" this movie will be recycled material anyway.</fullReview>

Sadako is much much scarier than Samara for a start. Ringu just has a scarier aura whereas this is just like any old american horror film... ie: not very scary at all. My advice is see ringu. It is much better in every way and especially "the scene" (as I have heard it referred to. You'll know what I mean when you see it (well if you see ringu because the ring's version of it is lame in comparison)). If this was original it would be OK but it's not so just watch the original.

		<shortDescription>A complex, layered film that is an unsatisfying imitation of The Sixth Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***There are spoilers in this review***I doubt that any medium has ever captured so many shades of blue as this film has. The cinematography is gorgeous: the pacific northwest, in all its rainy, forested glory, is wonderfully depicted in this luscious movie.As much as this film strives to rid itself of its Hollywood-horror movie roots, unfortunately it falls back into them again, as evidenced by the fact that there are not just one but two prescient, sepulchral children (an old Hollywood standby), one of them so evil that her mother kills her. The premise of this film is intriguing: a strange videotape surfaces at a remote cabin, four teenagers die, and there's a big mystery. The object is to solve the mystery before you die. This film isn't as scary as the beginning would have you believe. Much of the time is spent solving the mystery of the weird video, which, as the film nears its conclusion, is clear that it was most likely shot and edited somewhere in the afterworld. Seems like a ghost would use a higher-quality medium like a DVD. Evil characters usually make sense, but Samara's motivations make none. Why a videocassette? Why kill people seven days after they watch it, why not just roam the world killing people indiscriminately? Why would Richard Morgan steal the videocassette of Samara's psyche-ward interview if he couldn't stand his daughter? And just what was the connection between the cabins and the Morgan family? Who built the cabin over the well and for what reason, did they know they were hiding a murder scene? And how could Samara draw the tree on her `bedroom' wall when she didn't even see it until just before she died? The plot holes get bigger and bigger as the film progresses.Although the characterizations are quite good, even complex, they are ruined by the unnecessarily confusing ending. Why would Samara go after Noah and leave Rachel and Aidan alone, when Rachel and Aidan saw the tape before Noah did? And given the expectation that all people who view the video will die, how could Rachel possibly hope to deter Samara by feeding the videocassette to unsuspecting viewers? Sooner or later, she's coming back to get Rachel. This film starts out really strong, but the improbabilities pile atop each other until you have a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing. This film is like the proverbial dumb blonde: she looks pretty, but when she opens her mouth to talk, it's pretty clear that her porch light is flickering. If you want scary, see Rosemary's Baby or The Blair Witch Project, two horror films which happen to be pretty and smart, a rare combination indeed.</fullReview>

I thought you had to be pretty much brain dead, once you saw the well, NOT to know that was 'The Ring".There are far too many plot holes to make it truly creepy. "My wife wasn't supposed to have a child..." Richard Morgan sez. All right, the daughter is not adopted as stated earlier in the movie. Is she a Demon Seed? What is her motivation for perpetuating her evil? Is she evil for evil's sake? Enquiring minds want to know.This isn't a ghost story that makes you think, it's a ghost story that annoys you. It could have been a lot more but wasn't. If you MUST see this, wait until it comes out on video and save the full price of admission. If you can't wait that long, see it at a matinee.

		<shortDescription>Your actual fright may be less than advertised...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For better and for worse, The Changeling has influenced every "ghost story" film since 1980. It was an OK movie with perhaps three good scares, but it initiated a formula which is now exhausted: Nancy Drew type clues are discovered (a secret, an old well, a hidden room, an illegitimate child, a spirit who cannot rest) and lead to other Nancy Drew type discoveries, eventually leading to a pat, unsatisfying resolution. Hollywood spends more time trying to convince you old ideas are fresh, than it would take to devise a new idea. As regurgitated in the Sixth Sense, Ghost, Session 9, the Devils Backbone, The Shining, The Others, A Stir of Echoes, The Lady in White, Sleepy Hollow, 13 Ghosts, Ghost Story, The Mothman Prophecies, Dark Water, The Fog, Flatliners, Poltergeist &amp; any episode of MTVs fear... etc. there is no one left on the planet who doesn't GET IT. You know the story arc before you set foot in the theater. All of these movies forego legitimate scares to instead "touch" the viewer and put the deceased to rest. Freud has been very, very busy at the graveyard. Plodding procedure displaces fright. I can't even recall the last movie I was actually scared at. This is extremely tiresome. It coincides exactly with the emergence of the phrase "bringing closure" pervading pop culture, and appearing in news stories that involve death, and it's that hoary goal that the modern ghost movie is preoccupied with. Unfortunately none of these movies offer you anything remotely frightening. It's post-psychological, "let's-put-the-ghosts-spirit-to-rest" hokum. Whatever fear people are feeling at this lame crop of movies they're bringing along or they have very weak spines. What Hollywood desperately needs is a ghost story where no one gives a damn about putting a spirit to rest, in which the ghosts are evil, people die horrible deaths, and the film scares the hell out of the audience... and I'm not talking about the "things suddenly appearing very close to the camera," or the "sudden loud phone ringing" variety.Although the batch of conceits in this movie are OK, the fatal choice is made to have the protagonist be a journalist with investigative skills, who seeks/finds/follows a well-worn (and interminable!!) path of ghostly clues. Could anyone in our solar system be surprised when they discover the spirit of someone wronged is at the core of the disturbances? Worse, this main story thread intrudes before we've even seen the myth play out with any minor character (No! That one doesn't count! All of it is off-screen). Before the myth even gets established we're on our way to solving it. How boring! It was very nice to see a cast of unknowns though. I can't imagine how awful this would have been with name talent in it. Brian Cox appears in a goofy part here. The movies absurd compression of time is a hoot. (The wife wears wears Victorian equestrian clothes, but her husband is still alive?) Perhaps best of all is an unintended (?) analogy about irresponsibilty in marketing. But all of this is insufficient to save the movie. I was revolted to see the wholesome nuclear family at the center of this movie escape their fate (seemingly) so I could not have been happier to see someone actually die when they finally did almost 2 hours into the movie, at which point it was way too little, too late.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To consider this the scariest film in the last decade is like saying that Babe Ruth has no place in baseball and could never be considered a legend.This movie was a boring, unsatisfying mess. Naomi Watts' acting leaves a bit to be desired. The premise of the whole film is cheesy.I mean, if people are gonna rip on the Nightmare on Elm Street series all for its unrealistic ways, then they have to go after The Ring. Otherwise, Contradiction 101.So apparently, there's a video tape that if you watch, somebody calls your phone to let you know you'll die in 7 days. To think this is at all clever is like saying you can run into a brick wall full speed without suffering any damage what so ever.So lets see - Mediocre acting, terrible story, terrible camera quality, terrible character development, all leads to a terrible movie.If you got scared by this atrocity, you are one big wimp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, quite possibly, correction, absolutely this is the worst movie ever made in the history of movies. It's a lethal combination of downright atrocious acting, directing, writing... the costumes are dodgy in a very high seven-brides-for-seven-brothers-as-performed-by-school-children kinder way, the scenery was GodAWFUL and that was the only thing that it had going for it. The special effects made me feel like someone was drilling a hole into my skull. If you're in the right mood, or have the right set of friends over, this piece of poopy still could not be any good.This was probably planned to be a comedy in the style of Porky's. I say "probably", because there is absolutely nothing that even reminds you of something funny at all in this monstrosity. Imagine some of the biggest goofballs you know, imagine them participating in a "silent movie" rehash (not kidding, the level does not get any more clever than that) and whose acting is quite probably worse than what you could get by just randomly recruiting people in the street. Imagine abysmal sound and video quality, non-existent plot -- it is almost amazing how it literally doesn't go anywhere -- and wanna-be scary moments featuring either quite fat or ugly middle-aged women.Well, if you can imagine that believe me, it is only the beginning of how atrocious this movie is. Everyone who gives it above 1 star worked for the movie. Seriously don't rent this because it's garbage juice. Not even worth checking out for free.... This one, "The Call of Cthulhu," has no redeeming qualities I can find, but it's the pretentiousness of the production that makes it the worst movie ever made.Bottom line: if any of you is willing to see the worst movie ever made, just choose this one. It is HANDS DOWN the worst movie ever made. Bravo Mr. Lovecraft, bravo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror is so hard to pull off because usually, we can guess way in advance what's going to happen. Not so with "The Ring". Even if you hear what the story is, much of the movie will still probably make you jump.It all begins when two teenage girls are talking about a video tape that you watch, and then you get a phone call telling you that you're going to die. Sure enough, one of them watches the tape. After her death, her aunt Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) investigates further and uncovers the story behind the tape. In the process, she seeks the answers to some questions: What is that ring? Who is that girl? And how does a lighthouse fit into this all? The movie mainly works because they know how to pull off surprises when you least expect it, and they let the answers to these questions evolve slowly but surely. By the end, you may be weary of watching any movie, or picking up the phone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good remake of a Japanese thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring is the version of a Japanese thriller from 1998. This Japanese idea was original, chilling and very intense. You know what that means if the USA finds out on something like this..." Let's Americanize it !!!" I'm sorry if that sounded sarcastic but, usually, that IS the general rule behind it. But certainly no complaints this time ! Upcoming genius in Hollywood Gore Verbinski did a great job with it and I even prefer this remake over the original Japanese version. Ringu deserves all the credit it can get for originality and plot but when it comes to entertainment and production, The Ring is far more superior. The story behind the videotape is far more detailed and there's a lot more to discover. You're a lot more involved in this one and the background of "Samara" is fascinating up to the highest possible level. There already was a good amount of suspense in the Japanese version but Verbinski goes even beyond that level and delivers a rarely seen gem here. Certainly one of the better horrorfilms since The Silence of the Lambs. You almost are afraid to wink your eyes in order not to miss anything that could be an important plot element. It's good to see they still make them like this. Verbinski wisely didn't exaggerate with the horror elements. There are some frightening make-up scenes in it but the suspense keeps you focused well enough. A story like this really doesn't need too much blood or make-up, it all depends on the script and the acting performances. Speaking of which...they're great !! Naomi Watts is, besides a very beautiful woman, a good and promising actress. She got my attention after Mulholland Dr. and she certainly confirms it here. I hope to see her many times again in movies like this. Brian Cox never gives away a bad performance so there's no need to say that he's absolutely perfect in his role here as well. I still can't believe that this guy is so underrated. He should be right up there with other big names of his generation like Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman. He is at least as good as them ! And let's not forget the little girl who played Samara here. Daveigh Chase is really spooky in her role and highly believable. Certainly a girl to keep an eye on in the next few years. The Ring is one of the best films I've seen since the new Millenium and therefore I surely recommend it to as much people as possible. And if you like this film, I advise you to watch a 1980 film called "The Changeling"...you'll find a few interesting similarities between these two titles. The Ring is the ideal film to watch with a group of people when it's late a night and the weather outside is dark. The perfect atmosphere for the perfect form of suspense. Enjoy !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary Fun...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the past few years we have seen supernatural thrillers take a rise in popularity. First, it was films like "The Sixth Sense," which were carried alongside hits such as "The Blair Witch Project." Then, there were the crude rip-offs that didn't work, and some that were just "average supernatural fare." Well, "The Ring," based on the highest-grossing Japanese thriller "Ringu," gets back on track in the right direction. The film stars Naomi Watts as Rachel, a single mother with a job as a reporter. After a niece of hers dies exactly seven days after watching a mysterious tape, Rachel has no choice but to uncover the deadly - and startling - truth behind the tape. Even if it means her life.Along with her are cast members Martin Henderson as Noah, a computer-tech-guy, and Brian Cox as a figure in the film I will not give away. The cast of the film is good. Above average for a psychological/supernatural thriller. Naomi Watts carries the story at a believable level and Martin Henderson gives some comic relief, but thank God not to the point of obnoxious like so many other thrillers. The plot of this film has its roots buried strongly where they should be, and never ceases to surprise. Some moments are predictable, but there are more than enough pleasant surprises along the way, with an ending that leaves the audience hanging, so that we have to wait for the sequel (yes, Watts is signed for a sequel, and a possible prequel, just like the Japanese film was accompanied with).So, all-in-all, if you want a modest, scary film that never gives out to commercialism or cheap thrills, see "The Ring" when it hits video and DVD next month (I saw it in a free theater with lousy speakers - I can't wait to see it on my surround sound entertainment system!)4/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Scary Movie with a Disappointing End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rachel Keller (the gorgeous Naomi Watts) is a journalist investigating a videotape that may have killed four teenagers (including her niece). There is an urban legend about this tape: the viewer will die seven days after watching it. If the legend is correct, Rachel will have to run against time to save her son's and her own life. The premise is great and the plot is scary. Everything works in this movie: the cast, the direction, the special effects, the screenplay etc. Unfortunately, the end of the story is not so good. Probably the intention of the studio in preparing the viewers for a sequel impairs the end of the plot. Anyway, watching this flick (and Naomi Watts) is worthwhile, which is highly indicated for fans of horror movies like me. Now I intend to watch the original Ringu. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Chamado" ("The Call")</fullReview>

They rave on and on about how terrifying it is, how creepy the little girl is, how unexpected the ending is, etc. I wasn't sure if I wanted to believe them, seeing as most horror films I had seen in the past were pretty dull.Now, after having seen it, I can say that it lived up exactly to my own expectations: boring and slightly trite. The only thing remarkable about this film is the originality of it's basic idea (from the original Japanese film "Ringu"). A journalist and your basic horror movie creepy psychic kid are chased by an even creepier raggedy undead girl who kills people one week after they see a cursed tape by coming out of their TV and, I don't know, consuming their life essence or something. Originality is really the only thing going for this movie. Everything else, from the acting to the sound, is just pretty unmemorable.If you're desperate for a psychological horror movie, turn your attention to " The Silence of the Lambs" or the underrated "Secret Window". Watch "The Ring" only as a last resort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed beyond belief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that Ringu was being made in Hollywood, I was appalled. When it came out and did well, I ignored it. I finally watched it last week and cannot believe it has done as well, both critically and financially. The acting is so wooden it's not funny, especially Naomi Watts. How reviews failed to point this out amazes me. I was led to believe that the film was a, practically, frame for frame remake of the original. The opening 15 minutes or so are nearly exactly the same and I began to be drawn in. But then the video comes into play and as each element in it is revealed in the storyline I got more and more frustrated. Some elements do survive the ordeal but some images cannot have been made by Samara (the scene of her mother's suicide for instance, the "burning tree" for instance etc etc). In fact the whole character of Samara makes no sense at all. Why was she put into the hospital? What had she done? What's with the pictures she "created"? Why did she get let out? Are her parents really her parents (showing a partial birth certificate for a second or two is only going to make me angrier!)? Why does her touch burn? It is an insult to my intelligence (and yours!)! There is no sense of doom, of urgency in any of the characters. There is no sense of geography. When 10 minutes of story would have, maybe, helped move the story along, we get 10 minutes of frantic action with no meaning. Why?! What Hideo Nakata did to Koji Suzuki's awesome novel was to take the important parts and overlay a supernatural story over the top. The Ring has taken the important parts out of Ringu and overlays a different supernatural story over the rest. The problem with The Ring is that the story they used is pathetically weak in comparison to that in Ringu. And if the US market is willing to accept it as "better" then that merely exposes the "quality" of contemporary US horror. I recommend that everyone read the book in addition to watching Ringu as a remedy to this disaster of a movie. Although it looks good and contains some shocks, it is too flawed to be a version of Ringu or a satisfying horror movie in its own right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Candyman, Candyman, Candyman"I'm sorry, I don't know what got into me.Japan: 1998. A little known horror movie was released under the name of 'Ring'. Ring wasn't a bad film, it wasn't a great film, it wasn't very original (though it wasn't a total rip off) or scary, but it wasn't rubbish. I gave it 6/10. A fair score.America: 2002. Hollywood smeared its glossy mits all over the Japanese film, and we were given: 'The Ring'.The Ring centres on the story of a video tape, and if you watch the tape, within seven days: you die. "It's truly terrifying" said some guy in some review on amazon.com, "What the f**k?" said The_Void just a second ago, a haunted video tape? Run away! Run away! Lame. What's next? A haunted mobile phone? Send a text and die? No, no how about a haunted can of deodorant, smell bad or die? Or a haunted website? Oh wait.Anyway, let's just ignore the lameness of the storyline for a second. The film starts off with two girls in a room and one of them tells the other one about a piece of film she has watched and that if you watch that film, within seven days, you die. That was seven days ago. I'm sure I don't need to spell out what happens next...the girl who watched the tape dies with a silly look on her face and the other one goes insane. I just hope she never meets my friend, he can do this really strange face where he sort of scrunches his lips together and goes cross eyed, Eek. The one here sucks, though.Think that was bad? sheesh, that was the best bit.This film is probably better for the people who saw it before seeing the original. The reason for that is that this film is almost a carbon copy of the original, which is understandable because that's the nature of remakes but in the move from east to west, they forgot to transfer the two best things about the original: its look and holes in the story. The original was nice and grainy, which made it all the more frightening. I mean, OK, its hard to scare when your centrepiece is a haunted piece of plastic but the grainy picture and the darkness of it went some way to making it frightening, the fact that it was glossy meant that the picture was clear and easy on the eyes, and therefore the scares were kept down to a minimum. Which is a good thing in say, a kids movie for example, but not in a horror.The second thing: The holes in the story. Usually plot holes are looked down on, but I don't mean plot holes, I'm referring to the fact that the original left several stones unturned, or only partially revealed. I think that someone forgot to tell Hollywood that sometimes the unexplained is more scary than the understandable, after all that's everyone's principal fear: The great unknown.The main meat of the story comes when a reporter (Naomi Watts) inadvertently views the video tape, then lets her friend watch it, and then her son watches it without her permission (typical kid). Naomi and her friend then have seven days to avert disaster, and save the life of her son. They do this by tracking down the origin of the haunted video piece of plastic and finding out about the girl in the tape, Samara. To the films credit, it moves at a nice pace, and keeps your interest fairly well. Then again, that's to the credit of the original really, not the remake.To my knowledge, this was my first encounter with Naomi Watts. I can't say I was impressed. I mean, her performance in this wasn't bad, and it may be my contempt for the film that's clouding my vision, but after all the great things I'd heard about the woman, I was expecting more. More did come however on my viewing of 'Mulholland Dr.' and wow, what a step down from that to this, eeek, what was she thinking?However, despite all the negativity so far, even this film has plus points, two of them in fact. The first one is the direction. In my opinion, the film is a credit to Gore Verbrinski, his directing is nicely done and the use of the camera is solid, it's just a shame about the rest of the movie. The second good thing about the movie is the soundtrack. The soundtrack itself is nothing to write home about, in fact I can barely even remember it, but at least it didn't resort to lots of heavy metal with a strong bass line like in so many other modern horror movies, that sort of music doesn't go down well at all in my opinion.The film's ending is another one of those predictable twists in the style of 'The Sixth Sense' or 'The Others', you know, the ones that everyone likes. After Naomi and co have solved the mystery, they think all is well and they all go home. However, all is not well as Naomi's friend finds out when Samara comes out of the television set in one of the stupidest movie moments of all time and gets him. I couldn't have been the only one who saw that coming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a waste of time.That said, the first ten minutes are extraordinary. Nicely shot, creepy, beautifully paced, and well acted. The only other ray of hope for this film was the first time we see one of Samara's victims (the blonde in the closet! Holy crap! I sure didn't see THAT coming in the theater!), but other than that this film tries and fails to repeat the aura of the first ten minutes for an couple of hours. Most of it is just too ridiculous. The horse scene, the electrocution scene, the final TV scene - nothing works. It's just not good. The horse/ferry scene is uneccessary, really just a lame attempt to be disturbing. The electrocution scene is too drawn out and implausible (this is a movie about ghosts coming out of TVs - for a shot to not work in it because it's too fantastic is really something!).This film almost works, or would have, if it ended after our heroine solved the mystery of the tape. "Wow," I said to myself in the theater as Naomi Watts and her beau walked off into the night, "They really tried some interesting stuff in that movie. Not all of it worked, but at least they tried." Then the film kept going. "Wait," I asked myself, "Why aren't they rolling credits?" Then it dawned on me that the movie was about to nosedive. I distinctly remember saying "No good can come of this." aloud, referring to the decision to not end the film. Obviously, I was horrendously disappointed. After seeing Creepy Little Hospitalized Girl Samara, Soggy Vicious Undead Samara was silly. The whole set-piece where Noah dies is totally predictable (right down to him tripping over something), Samara isn't scary, and removing frames of film to make movement jerky isn't frightening - it's headache inducing. God-awful ending to a god-awful movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not creepy scary at all. At least not until towards the end, when Samara comes out of the television and kills Noah. Until then, it seemed to be more psychological terror than live terror. I wouldn't recommend young children to see it for the simple fact that seeing Samara thrown down the well would probably scare them, not to mention the aforementioned television scene. It was also dark and dreary throughout the entire movie. That in itself prevented me from enjoying this movie to its full extent. Of course, Seattle is a dreary place. But, I would have enjoyed it more if It hadn't been so dark. It's a good movie in it's own right. Like I said before, it's a psychological horror movie, not a live horror movie until the end. Although, most people I know who have seen this movie won't watch a video tape now. Unless it's clearly labeled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible. Here is why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a great lover of Japanese horror and therefore find this American Adaptation of The Ring truly awful. They changed the storyline and although clearly this can be a good thing to play around with originality wise, they changed parts to something totally irrelevant and slowed down the whole pace.Not only this but Asian films don't rely on scary music playing every 5 seconds (which in American horrors ruins it anyway as it tells you whew to prepare for a 'scary' moment), rather than the surprises you get from the original and far superior Ringu.This American version has to spell out every bit of the plot with totally unnecessary dialogue to explain the story, whereas the clear symbolic images in the Japanese version is enough. It allows cognitive pleasures from the audience and does not spoon feed or treat the audience like they are totally stupid.I felt the young boy was represented in a far too 'mature' way in the way the part was acted and scripted. The younger innocence of the boy in Ringu makes parts far more sinister. There is a long list of reasons this version is awful, I have merely listed a few. Clearly no remake can live up to the original of anything, however there are many ways they could have improved this version and not make it the trash that it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Review May Contain Small Spoilers (they may actually save you the time you waste if you do see the movie anyway because at least then you may get a laugh in). When I first saw previews for The Ring I was rather intrigued. I read a summary on line and the idea of a people dying from watching a videotape was new to me so I decided to check it out. However, when I saw this movie in the theaters i was bored, unimpressed, and even a little let down. The actors couldn't act and the only thing that made them stand out from the actual set was the fact they were either dying or screaming. A lot of the movie was taken up with flashbacks that eventually lead to us realizing how the tape was created and why people die when they watch it. The style of going backwards in a movie to piece together a story that sucks never succeeds and is just wasting your time. The Ring is supposed to be a horror movie but there is little to be horrified with. Every now and then there will be one of those some dead girl screaming somewhere in a tight space like a closet or a well which only helps you stay awake for more stupidity. The special effects were lame and the behind the scenes crew were lazy. More than once I saw things left in the background including even an actual worker for the crew. Overall this was a lousy movie and a waste of time. Do not see this movie unless you like to be bored or you like to be disappointed. I was disappointed when I saw The Ring and it really dampened my faith in ghost stories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading the back of the DVD case you might be forgiven that THE RING is just another " Teens get stalked and killed by a stalker " flick . In fact the first five minutes plays out just as you`d expect a " Teens get stalked and killed by a stalker " flick , but after the opening things start improving a lot . Director Gore Verbinski crafts one extremely moody film crammed full of haunting abstract images . This would have been a memorable film for all the right reasons if it wasn`t for ending which makes THE RING memorable for all the wrong reasons !!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!I don`t know if I`m stupid but the ending didn`t make any sense to me . Let`s see Rachel finds the body of the murdered child and lays her to rest and only then does her son tell her she wasn`t supposed to help ! Oi vey , now he tells me . Were all the other people killed simply because they tried to help ? It doesn`t seem fair does it ? you bust your ass trying to do the right thing and what happens ? , a spirit of a child comes out of the TV and kills you . This leads to another plot hole . If you`ve watched the video and seven days later you surround yourself with people who haven`t seen the tape would the spirit still be able to come out of the screen and kill you ? Oh and did Rachel survive because she saw a copy of the tape rather than the original ? You tell me</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this I was terrified out of my wit and thought to myself that I will not watch again until after a week, just like the film, really, I was that freaked out. But now I can see that at least three quarters of it is now only creepy. Basically investigating a death of a girl, who was also a friend, reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) goes to a motel ranch that the girl stayed at last. The owner says the TV reception in each room is no good, so they have videos, and that is where she sees the one video with no case or label. After watching this video she is phoned by an unknown caller, saying "seven days". She now has that much time to find out what she can about the video, does it kill people after a week? Also starring Martin Henderson as Noah Clay, David Dorfman as Aidan Keller and Brian Cox as Richard Morgan. A good attempt by director Gore Versbinski (Mousehunt, Pirates of the Caribbean) to recreate a Japanese horror. I need to see the original. Worth watching!</fullReview>
