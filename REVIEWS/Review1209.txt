		<shortDescription>As Good as Movies Get</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies can wield a strange power over those who sit in the darkened seats of a theatre. The truly great ones manipulate your perception of reality, suspend your disbelief, and ultimately either alter or affirm your view on life. NUOVO CINEMA PARADISO is just such a movie. It is the near-perfect melding of direction, acting, script, sound track, and cinematography. Phillipe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio give the kind of performances usually associated with much more recognizable actors. The supporting cast looks like they could all be full-blooded Sicilians. The location shots add depth and realism to the entire production. Ennio Morricone's music is simply the most appropriate and emotive I have ever had the pleasure to hear in a theatre. Tornatore's script and direction are a joy, a breath of fresh air.I will not spoil this story by repeating it, nor will I give away the ending, although it matters not a whit. I could disclose fully everything in this movie, and in seeing it, all my words would evaporate. There is nothing like the experience of sitting through it, becoming engulfed by it, and in the end, being changed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seldom watch Italian movies, (i saw it today for the first time) being Italian maybe i'm biased, but this one really stands out. A real masterpiece; i can't remember another movie so moving like this one, maybe Schindler's list; it makes you laugh and it makes you cry, yet it is so simple and straightforward. Maybe there lies its magic: no Hollywood superstars, no special effects, just pure emotions and feelings, love, fear, grief and regret, nostalgia for childhood and youth, memories of places and times that will not come back, memories of the loved ones. Some movies are there to entertain, some to scare, some to question. This movie is there to affect your feelings. Definitely to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is by now well known that there are two versions of this film that differ greatly, the original 3 hour Italian cut and the heavily re-edited 2 hour version which was the version that charmed the world in 1989. It remains a wonderful experience, but the director's cut is so much richer, deeper, satisfying,well,everything. This review is of the director's cut which may not be the greatest film in the world but is my favourite film of all time ever since I came out of the cinema in which I first saw it in back in 1994 crying my eyes out. Never has a film effected me as emotionally as this one. Cinema Paradiso is many things- a touching story of a friendship, a wonderful portrayal of a Sicilian village, a loving tribute to the cinema, amongst other things, but the longer cut is I believe the most moving and romantic love story ever. For my money, you can forget Casablanca,Dr Zhivago,Titanic,Romeo and Juliet,etc {great as some of them are}, this is the one that does it for me.Divided into three sections, it is the first section that was left almost intact in the short version. It is of course primarily concerned with the relationship between young Toto and the projectionist of his local cinema, Alfredo. It is full of delightful touches,such as Toto stealing a frame of film from behind Alfredo's back, or when Toto helps Alfredo during an exam so he can be allowed into the projection booth, or perhaps best and simplest of all of all Toto's spellbound face as he watches the footage that will be censored by the town priest. The cinema is portrayed as almost being the centre of life in the town Giancaldo in which the film is mostly set. The actual sequences set in the cinema are full of wonderful observation and even some belly laughs. There's the man who only goes to the cinema to sleep and is always awoken by kids, the couple who see each other for the first time because everyone else is cowering from Dr Jekyll And Mr Hyde, the old man who says "no, this is IMPORTANT" when everyone else "booos" the news-all human life is here, with more observations and insights than in any Mike Leigh film. This section climaxes in a scene which is simply magical, when Alfredo projects a film onto the wall of a house so everyone can see it.As the film moves forward several years to show Toto as a 16 year old, the wonderful cinema scenes are still present. Who can forget the cinema usher telling off a group of young boys for playing with themselves while watching Brigitte Bardot and then sheepishly giving his own manhood a little touch? Director Guiseppe Tornatore also subtly reminds us of changing times, such as when television is first shown in the cinema. However, it is mainly concerned with Toto's {now called Salvatore} courtship of the girl he is in love with, Elena. No one who has experienced the pangs of first love can fail to respond to such scenes as Salvatore ranting on to Elena on the phone how much he loves her and realising he's actually been talking to her mother, or the beautiful first kiss and embrace in the projection booth {of course}.It is in the final section, as Salvatore, now a great film director, returns to Giancaldo as a 50ish man to attend Alfredo's funeral,where the humour all but disappears {well, life gets more serious as one gets older, does it not?} and the pace does slow-be warned. It is possibly the most emotional hour of cinema ever, and was cut to about 15 mins in the short version. Salvatore's reunion with Elena, which also displays absolutely brilliant acting from Jacques Perrin and Brigitte Fossey, is so painful a sequence, as the two characters pour their hearts out to each other. As Ennio Morricone's love theme swells up {a truly heartbreaking piece of music},it ends up being one of the most beautiful love scenes ever filmed. Salvatore's reunion with his mother and his exploration of the cobwebbed, dilapidated, cinema are also extremely moving. As for the final scene, where Salvatore opens a certain gift Alfredo left him-well,there's been too many spoilers already in this review, but suffice to say it is matchless, simply matchless. It was moving in the short cut, but is three times more meaningful in the director's cut.Cinema Paradiso has been called sentimental, but in the director's cut it is a darker, deeper kind of sentimentality. Maybe it is still "a love letter to the cinema", but it is also shows that obsessive love of something such as films can also result in sadness and regret. Think of what happens to Alfredo in the film, and as for Salvatore, well, his curse is that he has two loves in his life but success in one of them comes at the expense of the other. The uncut Cinema Paradiso is more then anything else about life and the effect of the decisions we make. O, and the greatest, most heartbreaking love story ever {have I already said this!}</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether you are a professional or an amateur it is always wise to avoid superlatives with regard to a movie critique ... but I cannot. 'Cinema Paradiso' is simply the finest movie I have ever seen. Like many who have posted at this site before me I have seen it many many times. It reaches within me to places other movies have never reached and I have often wondered why. Perhaps it is because of it's simplicity. It contains no expensive special effects, it has no gratuitous sex or violence, it has no "multi-millon dollar per performance" actors that I know of, it is arguable whether it even has a story line, and yet it soars far above the nonsense that film makers are producing these days. It's characters are portrayed by each and every actor in award winning style and the music is not only beautiful but absolutely perfect for this film.It is quite simply the story of a human life and it's tragedies and triumphs within the context of a vocation. A young boy matures and gradually learns the lessons of life, cultivates his passion for the cinema, and is rewarded with professional success; however, he remains unfulfilled for true love has escaped him only to return in the form of a gift of love which transcends time, space, and death to reveal at the closing of the film Toto's one true mistress.A staggering triumph of both the cinematic art and of story telling and yet there may be found people who do not like this movie .... I tend to keep such people at arms length and maintain a wary eye fixed upon them at all times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A breath of fresh air blowing away the cobwebs of Hollywood "blah" films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film at least a dozen times and each time I am carried away to a small village in Italy, where the dreams of a small boy come true and we can join his spellbinding journey. The Italian language (it is subtitled) adds to the film's beauty and music, the characters are so real you can almost smell them. I am absorbed into "Paradiso" each time I watch it, so that when it is over, I am shocked into the realisation that I haven't actually been anywhere except right there, in my theatre seat. I am not a huge "art house" film fan or indeed enjoy subtitled films (it is hard on the old eyes!) but "Paradiso" is a gem and is worth seeing again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Profoundly important movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso is a profoundly important movie because it deals with identifiable emotions/issues that could be considered universal on so many levels. The entire story is retrospective similar to Fellini's style as well as a love story that pulls in the viewer on an emotional level. The film also attempts to expose an inkling of Sicilian life, language,(different from Italian) and how "history" has intruded upon and shaped the mentality of the Sicilian people; to also show that traditional concepts of what is "moral" or right is not to be taken for granted because of the people and their particular history. For those who do not fancy history or non-fiction, the film attempts to educate the "outsider" not familiar with Sicilian history as it pertains to the WWII era. I watch it again and again and see more and more details that pertain to the story. I did see it on the big screen at a local theater back in 1991 and it was a hit with the audience. I have several scenerio that I think could make it more interesting and am very curious about the uncut version and what is different about it. Finally, the movie does make me cry because it is after all a love story and it is clear at the end that Toto (aka Salvatore)is still in love with Elena and that is why he never married or settled down "..to love one person. . . " as his mother says to him after his 30 year absence from home. The final scene of the credits also shows him looking at Elena again and the look on his face is telling. This film has many little "hints" that serve to inform the viewer and give just a little more info. about the story. Truly, one of the best films I have ever seen !!! These characters come alive and we feel like we know them--personally. Viva Giuseppe Tornatore for his masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every Filmmaker's Favorite Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Giuseppe Tornatore's Nuovo cinema Paradiso (Cinema Paradiso) is everything good about the movies. It is a story about love. The love between a Father and Son, an Individual and his home, and the love for the movies. Even if this is not your favorite film, if you are a filmmaker, you have no choice but to say this is your all time favorite film (if not one of the greatest films ever made). If only for the movie's ending, this is a great film. The ending answers all of your questions and completes the story. The missing love from a Man's life. The missing pieces to all the stories (movies) found and made into a whole. The final message from beyond the grave, the ending is perfect. If the musical score doesn't put you in tears, the amazing visuals will push you over the edge. This is what all movies should be about. Terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film about the love of movies and life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I continue to be moved and deeply touched by this beautiful film from Italy, and I never tire of watching it. I share the lives of Toto and Alfredo, the small Sicilian boy, who loses his father in the second world war, and the older man who runs the projector at the local cinema. Toto lives in a world of make believe, movies, adventure. His dreams take him away from the small Sicilian village where he lives with his mother and sister. Alfredo becomes for him a surrogate father, and the movies, his paralell existence. It is a deceptively simple film, which sweeps you up and carries you along. You never want it to end. And, when it does end, it is with such heartbreaking simplicity, I cannot help being moved to tears. Young Salvatore Cascio is a marvel as the small Toto, a mischievous, impish, adorable child. Phillipe Noiret is unforgettable as the sly and heart-warming Alfredo. You grow up with Toto, until he becomes a famous film director in Rome, and returns to the small village after many years for Alfredo's funeral. It is the story of life, lost love, devotion, friendship, and family. It is unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1988 Italian film (released in the US in 1990), is back with a full 51 minutes added on. This seemed like a stupid idea...there was nothing wrong with the original. The directors cut (which was 1/2 hour longer) was considered a mess. Also, for this release, an extra 1/2 hour was added! I expected the worse. Well, I was pleasantly surprised that this 3 hour version is better than the 2 hour one.This story follows the life of Salvatore. He's born in a tiny Italian village and we see him as a little boy in the 1930s, an adolescent in the 40s-50s and an adult in the 80s. It basically is about his love of movies and the one true love of his life--Elena. They are in love but she comes from a rich family and he lives in poverty. How can they be together?POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER IN NEXT PARAGRAPH!!!!The cut movie in the US excised a lot of the Elena subplot and concentrated on Salvatore's love of movies. There's nothing wrong with that, but Elena disappears quite suddenly. This full version explains what happened between them and fleshes out the characters more. It also reveals a crucial surprise at the end.The performances are all fantastic--especially by the gorgeous young actor playing Salvatore as a teenager. Elena is also stunning. The film has beautiful cinematography and a haunting music score. The 3 hours flew by for me. I didn't want it to end! So...beautiful music, attractive stars, good acting, compelling story and some incredible romantic sequences. A must-see!!!!Bring plenty of Kleenex though--I cried a least 5 times!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Loves Of 'Toto' Beautifully Told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this special edition DVD which shows the entire 174-minute film (in addition to the 121-minute one that most of us had seen over the years,) my rating of this film was elevated. This review is of the longer "director's cut."Most of the new footage involved the main's character's romance while he was a young man. The story then is continued years later when that character comes back to his hometown for a funeral and runs into the woman he was in love with but never was able to get for his own. It turns out to be a somewhat tragic love story.The first part of the film, with Salvatore Cascio as "Toto" a young boy is a love story about two people sharing their love of movies: the kid and an adult "Alfredo" (Phillpe Noiret) who runs the local movie theater. Their love of film bonds them for life.The word "love" is used repeatedly in this review because that's the dominant theme: the love people had for others and for the world of film, something all of us on this website share.The second and third parts of the film are the above-mentioned love story of Toto (Marco Leonardi as an adolescent and then Jacques Perrin as an adult) and "Elena" (Agnese Nano/ Brigitte Fossey). The first third of this director;s cut edition is much livelier and interesting, frankly, than the last two-thirds. Although not boring, it does drag in a few spots but the longer version is better in the long run because it makes the whole story much more meaningful.It's very nicely filmed and you get a real feel for the Italian people and their little town. The director of the movie, Giuseppe Tornatore, went on to make other great visual films, two of which I also like: Malena and The Star Maker.....but Cinema Paradiso, I believe, is considered his "masterpiece."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie.. with excellent background.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie definitely is one of my all time best movies. Director Giuseppe Tornatore placed himself in the list of the best directors. The usage of an excellent background score is a trademark of his movies and this movie is not at all a different case.He is also a master in getting best performances out of children and adolescents. Marco Leonardi was the pick of the whole cast. Also watch Melena for those trademarks of Tornatore.The character of Alfredo is one of the most unforgettable characters. The way emotions captured in a camera is way beyond naturality.Overall, this is a great movie with ultimate teamwork with everyone contributing. I just loved the movie very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes less is more: Don't watch the uncut version first!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler warning for anyone who hasn't seen this classic yet...ok? Don't read this review if you haven't seen at least one version of Cinema Paradiso.First of all, I was born in Italy, so I was extremely proud when Cinema Paradiso won the Oscar for best foreign film as well as the hearts of all movie goers when it was released. Also, I am a hopeless romantic who absolutely adores movies! So this movie was right up my alley on many levels!I saw the shorter version as most of us did when it came out in the US, and only recently saw the full uncut Director's version. It is one of my all-time favorite movies ever--and still is--but I must admit that I did not experience near the same magic or euphoria that the shorter original version gave me many moons ago! Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the extra 51 minutes because I wanted MORE of a great thing, but as the old saying goes, sometimes less is more! Nothing, I repeat, nothing can match the power of the imagination and thus there in lies the magic and the power of the shorter version! By cutting out the extra scenes, we, the audience, were all left up to our own devices and forced to fill in the blanks ourselves with our imagination and our heart! By seeing everything the way we do in the full blown version, well, despite how sweet it was, it left something to be desired. I enjoyed the reunion (al though the whole flashing light effect grew VERY tiresome after awhile) but I could have done without it.Also, the thing that has been eating away at me is the whole question about why in the world Alfredo would (or could!) interfere with his supposed adopted son's first true love! Sure, I've been trying to come up with angles and reasons for his insanely cruel action, but nothing will convince me that the writer/director simply screwed up and should not have made the character do such a dastardly deed! Period! I loved the whole notion that he loved his "son" so much that he forced him to leave town and made him promise never to come back again...because we all knew that Alfredo was right...the only way Toto was going to achieve his dream was by leaving their small town and son of a gun if Fredo wasn't right! However....for him to be the main reason for the breakup of Toto's great love spoils the whole story. I will never watch this version again. I bought the DVD and pray that the original shorter verson that I saw and fell in love with is on the DVD!!!P.S. Some of my all-time favorite scenes come from this movie: The kiss in the rain (which is the cover on the DVD!) The dialogue where Alfredo tells Toto "I don't want to hear you talk anymore. I want to hear people talking about you!" The montague at the end of all the kisses and censored scenes. The haunting images of Elena on Toto's little movie projector...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the director's cut after an hiatus of about 10 years since the last time I saw the shorter version of the Cinema Paraiso. The difference between the two versions does not take away from the immeasurable quality and sublime way of telling a story of either film. The director's cut does change the focus from the prominence of the love of Alfredo for Toto (Salvatore) in the shorter version to the love between Salvatore and Elena in the longer version. The shorter and longer versions are like watching two movies for the price of one.The subtle change of extended story line between the two versions should be studied by all film students who want to take up editing as a career. It is amazing how the absence of some material and the addition of others can develop to such equally impressive but different conclusions. In the first film the closure of Elena's role turns out to be final. In the second and longer version the doors are reopened slightly and maybe, just maybe, they may reunite and dispel some of Salvatore's lonely existence later on in his life. The shorter version is certainly more of a devised film (in a very good way). Gaps are left for us to fill in with our own interpretations of what could or could not have been. This is true of all art where the author of the work leaves us some space to imagine our own input or contribution to the film. The second film is more cathartic than the first, or more expositional ? letting us identify more with the elements of the story than invent them where we seek explanations. Case in point, again, the relationship with Elena: we imagine that she disappears and marries, under her father's orders, to some miserable "banking" husband and is lost to the bliss she could have had with Salvatore (at least, that is my invention of what could have happened to her). In the second version she seeks Salvatore so much she marries the next best thing she can find: Boccia ? the closest person she can get that approximates him, especially after he has disappeared to Rome.Phew?, that the two versions can become two different movies at the same time and still leave me weeping?. Wow! I don't even want to start on the excellent photography, the music score, the subtlety of the story telling and the tremendously gifted cast. I kneel and then prostrate humbly before the makers of this most exquisite work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Although this film has been universally praised in both its short and long versions, I must lodge a converse opinion. And express concern about a viewing public who would so applaud.This film was conceived with an intelligent framework, indeed one that I'm disposed to like regardless of the quality of execution. This is a film about films, but instead of the usual star and filmmaker end, it focuses on the effect on the viewer. It further merges one element of film -- visible passion in the kiss -- with the `real' life story depicted. More: it is set in Sicily where we can exploit dry villages and warm North African faces.But then it squanders all this wonderful foundation and expends all of its energy on mere sweetness. My gosh, we have the cute imp, who drags his mentor from a burning building! We have that wise man, now blind imparting the mysteries of life. As long as we stuck to the little boy, the charm was tolerable, but it went on and on and on like a triple load of cotton candy. Yes, there is some charm. Yes, there are a few lovely shots (including fireworks). Yes, some of the characters are endearing.But the director treats us like his portrayed villagers: as long as there is something on the screen, we in our simple lives are supposed to be mesmerized.This is the worst sort of film, one that soothes with palliative images and a romantic otherworldiness. If film for you is all about a pleasant escape, this is your movie. If film is instead a means for expanding your world and exploring ideas, stay away. This is Hallmark emptiness, and almost any other Italian (besides Benigni) will do better.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aims for magic, settles for clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since "Cinema Paradiso" is billed as a joyful celebration of movies for all of us who love them, I am sorry to say that its charms were lost on me. Its story of young Salvatore "Toto" who discovers the magic of the movies through his friendship with projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) has potential, but too often falls prey to false sentimentality, muddled storytelling, and unbelievable characters. It got to the point where I thought that the remote Sicilian village wasn't even a real location, but rather a soundstage set (the piazza seems too big and tidy).I watched the 122-minute version, not the 170-minute director's cut, but I still felt that "Cinema Paradiso" was too long, padded with innumerable "local color" scenes. The townspeople?who are all stock comic characters, including a village idiot?sit in the movie theater and react quirkily to the film they're watching. Presumably, this is meant to show how important the cinema is for them, bringing glamour and romance into their difficult lives. But since you never get a sense of what these people are individually like outside the movie theater, the contrast between real life and reel life isn't deeply felt.Toto is not a very sympathetic character in any of his three incarnations. At first, he is an annoyingly impish, prank-pulling little boy; then a lovesick and wildly impractical teenager; then a successful middle-aged film director who seems to have no inner life whatsoever. (Evidently, the middle-aged Toto is more developed in the director's cut, but I don't know if I have the patience to sit through that one!) The movie's attempt at heart-tugging romance falls flat because Toto's love interest Elena is so poorly characterized--all actress Agnese Nano has to do is stand there and look pretty. Noiret is good, though, moving beyond the cliché of the "crusty but lovable mentor" to reveal Alfredo's deep bitterness and determination that Toto not make the same mistakes he did. The famous ending montage of all the screen kisses that a conservative priest had censored is a lovely celebration of old Hollywood, but nothing that you can't find in the Academy Awards tribute montages every year. It also requires a major suspension of disbelief? weren't all these prints lost when the movie theater burned down? The best scene in "Cinema Paradiso," coming closest to conveying just what's so special about the movies, is when Alfredo turns his movie projector to face the window and screens a film on the outside of a building. The beam of silver light shoots through the empty black air; for an instant, all is magical, illuminated, even incendiary. Unfortunately, instead of creating many more new and wondrous moments like this one, "Cinema Paradiso" mostly falls back on old plot devices and one-dimensional characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD ***This movie is about a very touching friendship between a young boy and an old man, who are both in love with "the cinema". But further the movie shows interesting insights into the "culture of "movie-watching":All the people of the village who watch the movies in their "cinema paradiso" are really moved by the films and express their feelings overtly and loud - not like today, where there has to be a very intellectual silence in the theater audience. The cinema is really part of their lives and it has a direct meaning to them - every film is a new event. Think of the priest, who calls the kissing scenes "pornography"! At first this hysterical man seems very ridiculous, but if you think of the existential meaning the moving images give to their audience, then it seems like he wants to try to defend "his" church from being occupied by a new technical god. But the film shows also, that movies have got no objective meaning unless they've got a special and unique meaning FOR YOU."Cinema Paradiso" is simply brilliant, the characters are very well portrayed and the setting is perfect. The thousands of short references to old french, italian and Hollywood movies are fun for every movie buff.If you like movies, which know how to TELL A STORY - go and see this one, you won't be disappointed.9/10</fullReview>

I really love your website but you should pass this message to the management: quantity doesn't make quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Buffs will like this ode to the classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not many movies make me cry- but this non-formulaic story works. The last 5 minutes are not to be missed by any classic movie fan.Lessons to be learned about the different ways movies and movie theatres and their denizens have been enjoyed throughout the decades. And the practice of censorship in a small Italian town. A homecoming, a funeral, and a heartwarming gift, and a terrible disaster. A story about a young boy striving for work in the glamorous movie theatre. Don't miss it.The Italian version with subtitles is excellent, and the soundtrack is amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In memory of Philippe Noiret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philippe Noiret's death yesterday brings to mind all his movies, including "Nuovo cinema Paradiso". The first time that I saw this was right after I had seen "The Postman", and I recognized him as the man who had played Pablo Neruda. Here, he plays an equally great role, of the operator of a camera in a movie theater in an Italian village in years past. His friendship with and advice to young Salvatore proves to be more than the boy could have ever dreamed about. In a sense, the movie seems to be a look not only at what Italy was, but also what going to the movies was. It's definitely a masterpiece that I recommend. There may be the issue of whether or not we should make Italy's past look so idealistic, given that Mussolini was in power at the time. But I would assert that this movie shows that even in times of oppression, people can find ways to escape it. A really good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a beautiful cinematic poem.I´ll never understand why this movie in the States is considered an Art House movie. Almost for intellectuals. Why ? Because it is not in English? This couldn´t have been a more comercial normal movie if it really tried to be one in the first place. People who say this is an ART movie, definitely never watched one in their lives. Because they can be awful to watch sometimes. But there are good things too. Anyway...Unfortunely, I bet many people didn´t went to see it because of this classification. You don´t know what you´re missing !CINEMA PARADISO, is, ( along with THE BIG BLUE ), my all time favorite movie ever, ( I can never choose between them ). It has the most beautiful story I´ve seen in a movie so far.Many people don´t like it, but I can bet those people don´t truly love cinema. They´re just ordinary movie goers who consume movies as fast food. Anyone who loves Cinema has to love CINEMA PARADISO !I used to think that italian movies were only those junk crapPseudo-erotic " PORKYS " style comedies or else those Art Films that the very intelligent Elite of film critics pretend to like, and so I only went to see CINEMA PARADISO, a few months after his release, because I was thinking that this would be one more of those.I was wrong. This is the most beautifuly filmed love story ever, on par only with CASABLANCA although in a very diferent style. It´s amazing how this movie by telling a love story and a life of a character in fact tells about the history of cinema itself. The use of the theater location as a conection between characters through out the years is magnificently done.And it has probably the most beautiful soundtrack ever !Very emotive and capturing perfectly the story in all its moments.And it has the most beautiful and moving ending ever filmed! No matter how many times we see this film. I bet everybody drops a tear at the end. And more than a tear, I´m sure. I do.This is one of those rare moments in modern cinema that can´t be described. It has to be felt.This movie is a true MASTERPIECE ! Please go and see it. It realy deserves not to be ignored.Do yourselves a favor and go see it.You´ll never forget it. Believe me. It´s that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a big fan of movies released in 80's or earlier. I didn't expect much from this movie and watched it only owing to its high rating and ranking at IMDb. But buoy.. was I amazed. The movie is just less than 3 hours(extended version) but there is not a single moment where you find yourself detached from the movie. I wont call the acting at its best but its the story that forms the backbone of the movie. The story brings out relationship between three main pillars of human life - 'Love', 'Friendship' and 'Carrier'. This is the best romantic drama movie I have ever seen. If you weigh story more than big actor names and watching with subtitles is not a turn off(for non Italians) then this is a must watch for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew the film was held in high regard, and I went in with very high expectations.This is an incredible piece of cinema.The score/theme-music is perhaps Ennio Morricone's(Untouchables Etc) best, and that's saying something. It's only one of many fantastic characteristics that tie this whole thing together."Cinema Paradiso" seems like such a simple story, but nothing about the questions it asks about fate, love and friendship are simple.And that's what I really love about this story. It's realistic, heartbreaking, and uplifting all at the same time. The audience mimics the characters here. There are many things that you would like to change. How many times have you asked yourself if you would do it differently if you had it all over to do again? Could you? No. It's the way it happened. It's life. You can only piece together the moments of joy and happiness and reflect... hope.what a fantastic film!You'll like this if you liked: A Very Long Engagement(not quite as excellent), Hugo(a clear notch below and it borrowed a ton from this), or Cast Away(not as good, very similar themes in both films' last 30 min).this review is of the 3hr director's cut, not the theatrical release... I couldn't imagine it any other way. Will view it though.Late Edit(after viewing the shorter, original theatrical version): IMO.. the extended cut is far more powerful. The love story and the journey of the lead character is more complete, and ultimately, I find the extended cut to be much better. That's the version I would recommend to the first time viewer - although I seem to be in the minority on this subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best and most moving films of the 80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big lover of film, I am still kicking myself for not seeing this masterpiece any sooner. To me, Cinema Paadiso is one of the best films of the 80s and also the most moving, particularly in the final hour.I have seen many visually stunning films, and Cinema Paradiso is up there as one of the most visually ravishing films I've seen. The cinematography and editing are outstanding, and the scenery still looks gorgeous with an epic feel to it. Cinema Paradiso, alongside The Good, The Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West, also contains one of Ennio Morricone's most haunting scores and it is also one of my favourites of his.Cinema Paradiso is immaculately directed, has an touching, beautifully-written and honest script and a rich, compelling story that while it has an elegiac feel moves swiftly by draws you right in until the ending, which breaks my heart still after 5 times of seeing it.The characters are very well defined, particularly Alfredo, and the acting is outstanding with Salvatore Cascio, Enzo Cannavale, Marco Leonardi and especially Phillippe Noiret particularly impressive. All in all, a masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After inroads into the environment of the mobsters with "The Professor", and before making this touching human portrait entitled "Everybody's fine", the Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore gave birth screens one of the most beautiful films ever with "Cinema Paradiso", a homage to the cinema and never forget the friendship.The film tells the story of a young altar boy fascinated with the celluloid and a veteran projectionist prone to spoil. Set in a rustic atmosphere, where it is easy to recognize the typical characters of any province, the ratio of Alfredo and Toto, contains the nuances and leads to an intense and profound friendship. With absolute sobriety and the most charming comic relief, Tornatore taking shape that relationship that will last until the inevitable decline of the old projectionist (Philippe Noiret magnificent), but that will endure in memory of Salvatore di Vito, little Toto become, at present, a prominent filmmaker."Cinema Paradiso" is a pleasant and meaningful childhood memory. A profoundly tender and nostalgic film with which it is easy to identify without restrictions, especially if like Toto we have carried since childhood, or blood clutching a fascination for film. The film was winner of Golden Globe, Oscar for Best Foreign Film and was a Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. A pity that the Italian cinema still suffers from the crisis that is stifling the past several decades. Movies like "Cinema Paradiso", remind us that Italy always gave us one of the best filmmakers in the world.</fullReview>

With television not yet invented the town's only mean of entertainment is the movies. Every night the Cinema Paradiso movie theater is packed full of towns people who come to laugh, cry, and cheer. The story is told through the eyes of a boy called Salvatore. At an early age he falls in love with the movies and the theaters projectionist, Alfredo. Above all it is about the everlasting magic of the movies and the different affects it has on different people. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a big fan of movies, modern or classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really, Truly, Exquisite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never experienced this film before I got my greedy little hands on a copy of the DVD version just released that contains both versions of the film. The U.S. version released in the late 80's, and the original, longer cut. I resolved to watch both in one night, and let me tell you, it was not a smart idea. No, I didn't get bored, but one can only be wracked with the emotions of this film so much. I was physically and emotionally drained after staying up into the wee hours to experience both versions of the film, and I must say, I enjoyed every second of it, no matter how long it took.I have heard two dissenting opinions here. One is that the original version we saw, the one released here in the states, is the superior of the two versions. The other camp feels that the "new", longer version is better because of some fleshed out character development added in. I however am of the opinion that the 123 minute of the cut is more effective and better than this 3 hour cut. As so many people have reviewed this film, I will only state why I feel this way. (MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)The shorter version of this film truly held some magical qualities and made the whole movie seem ethereal. I could watch that version over and over again. This longer cut, however, seems to drag on a bit after what should be a natural end to the film. Yes, the extra scenes of Toto and Elena in the 60's was nice to see, but I felt that changing the focus from his love of movies to his love of Elena was a bit sudden. I also didn't like him finding Elena, and that, quite oddly, she was married to Boccia?? This made the film feel too pat, and robbed it of it's magical qualities I fell in love with in the "original" version of the film. Although the end does take on a new light, it also has a very different impact, since the moment of emotion came before in Elena's car, not in the theater. This however, is only one man's opinion. No one is right or wrong in which version they prefer, but it is strictly a matter of opinion. I for one feel as though knowing what happened to Elena was like being a little kid asking about Santa Clause's reality. you want to know, or at least you think you do, but as soon as you have the answer, you wish you'd never asked.For that reason, I would give the original version a 10/10, and the longer cut 9/10, that one point being taken away because of the mystery of Elena being solved. That being said, I will, in closing, respond to those of dissenting opinion that this movie is "not that good." Sometimes, a movie doesn't need big epic shots like Lawrence of Arabia or concentrated, art-house directing a la Martin Scorsese. I love Lawrence, and I love Martin Scorsese, but sometimes films can be great for the story, the actors, and the emotions they make you feel. All technicalities aside, (even though this is a very well-directed and the photography on this film is great), this is still one of the best films of all time, and ties with Godfather Part II and Amadeus as my favorite film of all time. See it, then see it again. But for my money, I'd steer clear of the longer cut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso is in one word, a masterpiece. It has been a long long time since I have seen a film that has touched me on such a primitive emotional level. Certainly, it manipulates your feelings and glorifies American cinema. What Cinema Paradiso does is remind you of what cinema was originally intended to do; view film as simply an escape from reality. It does so in a way that people, both young and old, male or female, Canadian or Italian can relate to. In summary, Cinema Paradiso is a simple, beautiful film.</fullReview>

My VHS copy of this movie has probably been screened 100 times, and I can't wait for it to be released on DVD. The story follows a small boys obsession with the world of cinema, and the kind projectionist that takes him under his wing. It's packed with emotion that wakes up the movie lover in all of us. And the final scene packs such a wallop that you had better make sure a full box of Kleenex is sitting beside you.

		<fullReview>A wonderful gift for all movie lovers around the world, Giuseppe Tarnatore's deserving Oscar Winner for Best Foreign Language Film has been (and I believe will be) loved and admired by the viewers regardless their age, gender, native language, and the country they grew up and saw their first movie in the theater, be it a huge multiplex or the modest cinema in a small village."Cinema Paradiso" takes place in a postwar Sicilian village and tells about a friendship between a projectionist in the local cinema of the title, Alfredo (Philippe Noiret, one of the best French character actors whose career spanned more than half a century and who was equally good in the surreal satire, light comedies, moving dramas or revenge war movies) and the little boy Salvatore or Toto whose father had died during the war. Since his childhood, Toto was fascinated by the movies and spent countless hours in the projection booth with Alfredo who had become the boy's friend and the mentor. After a fire blinds Alfredo, Toto becomes the projectionist, and the Cinema Paradiso continues to attract all villagers and to bring them together on Friday night to experience again and again the miracle of film. The boy's obsession with film becomes a lifelong love affair which will make him eventually a famous and successful filmmaker.Deceivingly simple and straightforward, the film is always moving, tender, touching, full of humor, love and compassion to its eccentric characters but what makes is special and unique, is the fact that we the viewers, all of us can and do relate to the story because we relive our own childhood movie experiences while watching the film. My memory took me many years and thousands miles back to the time when I was 5 and my grandmother took me to the theater for the first time. She later told me that she had been afraid that I would've became bored, restless, and started to cry - it never happened. I was so charmed and fascinated by what was happening on the huge screen that I sat not even moving, mesmerized and not uttering the single sound. Since that very moment, I have been always ready for the miracle to happen again. I expect every new movie to be great; I want to love, to cherish and to adore it. When it happens and the movie becomes mine, I am the happiest person in the Universe. It did happen tonight when I was watching Giuseppe Tarnatore's "Cinema Paradiso", one of the best films about the power, beauty, and magic of FILM ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i saw Cinema Paradiso about a decade ago. Truly, it is one of the treasures of cinema. i saw many of the classics -- Godfather 1&amp; 2, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone w/ the wind, psycho, etc. I saw all the recent Oscar best pictures -- Gladiator, American beauty, chicago, beautiful mind, Shakespeare in love, crash -- and even those nominated.But for me, none has as much emotional power and heartfelt sentiment as Cinema Paradiso. The director obviously is inspired and imbued his film with genuine love and passion.i have seen thousands of Hollywood, filipino, European, hongkong, Japanese, bollywood Indian &amp; other films but none has touched me as deeply as this low-budget Italian movie. The film has no explosions, no special effects or computer-generated effects, no expensive battle scenes. It is all heart, all passion, all emotions.There is something in the story of a young boy who fell in love with the movies, grew up to be a wealthy &amp; famous director but who made a lot of mistakes and regretted them, which is truly touching. the movie is bathed in nostalgia.Malena, made by the same director Guiseppe Tornatore, is also wonderful but could not equal Cinema Paradiso. Cinema Paradiso should be seen by all who love movies and its magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director's Cut: More Not Always Better, Alas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These comments address the recent release of Cinema Paradiso: The New Version (aka, the director's cut).I've been a longtime fan of this film, and as early as 1994 when I lived in London rumors were circulating about an extended version of the film. Imagine my excitement when the DVD was released with both version of CP: the original theatrical release and the one with the added footage. However, after viewing the longer incarnation of CP, I'm afraid to report that the added bits softens, and in some cases deadens, what was so originally powerful about CP in the first place: the sense of unrequited or unexplained loss of love.This new version sets out to explain much that in the original incarnation of the film was left tantalizingly unanswered. For example, Alfredo's sardonic speech about the guard falling in love with the princess ended with Alfredo saying he had no idea what the story meant. Left without a moral, the tale is potent precisely because its moral is uncertain. In this newer version, we see Toto having an epiphany and boldly declares the story's meaning. Suddenly, the piquant ambiguity of Alfredo's tale vanishes--as does much of the film's. We see Toto lose his virginity, and certain familiar conversations are expanded many, many minutes. Too many minutes, sometime.Exposition and explanations are really the only new additions to this picture. Most important, and for some most alarming, is a very detailed discovery of what happened to Elena after she left Toto for the last time--the so-called expanded "third act." I was always intrigued by the image of an older woman at the end of the final credits of the original version--I just KNEW that was Elena! I had always thought I wanted to know what had become of her, hence my desire for this cut of the film. But now that I know, I think I'm better off not having known.The elder Salvatore seemed more potent to me when his present life was wracked with deeply unsettling what-ifs. This version fills in all the blanks and leaves little to uncertainty, and to me this robs the film of its very essence: the notion that for many of us, life is filled with questions that will never be answered, can never be answered. This newer version now suggests the opposite, and makes the older Toto look like a morose stalker.I'll keep this DVD because I treasure this film, despite the additions. Fortunately, the original version is included, so from this time forward I'll keep the DVD platter on Side B. I, for one, prefer the mystery of unanswered questions because that rings so much truer to life and the spirit of this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellently nuanced film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the new Cinema Paradiso this weekend, which also marks the first time I ever saw it. It's a long film but you don't notice the time passing as you watch, since it speaks on many different levels of terms of life, memory and experience.The film has several storylines, reflecting different comments. A film about a first love, about a mentor and a student, about films or about not being able to go home again. However, to select a single one of these as the main story would miss the overall experience, since they are parts of an overall tapestry about the tough choices life presents.The standard hollywood treatment would made a completely happy ending, our hero gets together with the girl (now woman) of his heart; continues his successful movie career; his mentor remains flawless, and somehow restores the old town's spiritual heart. This doesn't happen, for as his mentor states "life is much harder than in the movies".Not to say that this a sad film, it's an extremely happy one, and by being tough and presenting a more truthful aspect of experience, its exquisite moments are that much more joyous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>amazing film, but beware of director's cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am going to start this by warning anyone who has yet to see the director's cut of Cinema Paradiso: DO NOT WATCH THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!!! I know everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I am saying this because I viewed both versions of Cinema Paradiso in my film class (123 min. version first, followed by the 170 min. director's cut), and with the exception of one person, everyone in the class wished that they had not seen it. At the very least, if you must watch the director's cut, I urge you, no, I implore you, to make sure you watch the 123 min version first. If you watch the 170 min version first, you are robbing yourself of a great experience you will never be able to reclaim; watching the 170 min version first WILL ruin the 123 min version.After we first viewed the 123 min version, there wasn't a single person in my class that wasn't amazed by what they had just seen. It is an amazing story of the magic of film and the cinema, highlighted by great performances and some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen. There are very few films that I consider to be near-perfect, but the 123 min version of Cinema Paradiso has made that list. Some people complain that the 123 min version leaves a lot unanswered, but the beauty of it is that it doesn't matter. Though love and Toto's relationship with Elena are involved, they aren't the focus of the 123 min version. The focus of that version is on the relationship between Alfredo and Toto, and their shared love and enchantment with the cinema and film.It is a powerfully emotional film, but, sadly, this level of emotion is lost in the director's cut. In attempting to clean up any loose ends or unanswered questions, the film is considerably bogged down by details and the magic and emotion of the 123 min version is lost. The focus of the entire story is shifted, and rather than solely being the story of the relationship between Toto and Alfredo, the film takes on the extra task of juggling the story of the relationship between Toto and Elena as well. In doing so, both storylines suffer, and the power the 123 min version holds is greatly reduced. The result is a complicated mess of answers (many of which only raise more questions), that after seeing leave you wishing you hadn't. In the end you crave for that initial sense of magic and emotion the 123 min version provided to come back, but for some it is all too late. I know it's tempting to watch the director's cut, but this is one occasion where you shouldn't indulge your curiosity. Sadly, the 170 min director's cut version taints the beauty and magic of the 123 min version of Cinema Paradiso, and that is one treasure that should never be lost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1988 Oscar winner for Best Foreign Film is, for all its incidental charm, every bit as mushy as the movies it celebrates, elevating a passion for movie-going in a small Sicilian village to a magical experience able to cure any distress, allowing even a blind man to 'see'. The mood of the film is warm and sentimental but its message is, at best, inconsistent: movies, it says, may be wonderful, but are no substitute for experience, and yet after reaching maturity the young protagonist spends thirty years in limbo before reclaiming his childhood innocence in the censored outtakes saved by his now deceased mentor, kindly old theater projectionist Philippe Noiret. Even worse: the films of his youth are presented as escapist daydreams, but his entire life (revealed in flashback from childhood to middle age) is no less an illusion, transformed by nostalgia into a heart tugging, romantic tearjerker. Life, it seems, not only imitates art, but often improves upon it, inadequate dubbing notwithstanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shortly as always; Acting isn't too good.. sounds that people produce seem artificial. This is a film about a boy growing up in the vicinity of a movie theater. On the background there is a war ongoing but the episodes of the film don't make much connection to it. Story is a bit boring at least from a Finnish point of view.. Only one or two episodes made me smile a bit but the humor isn't too intelligent. Maybe this film is good for some people that can imagine beyond what is shown. For me; characters didn't matter much. Music is more happy than melancholic and I could probably compose something more touching.. :D. Maybe this was a good movie 20 years ago but today you can see much better films with more atmosphere and with a better script.-WarraX-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well i really wanted to like this movie, and i was ready for a treat. but unfortunately, it never came. movie starts promising, base for the story is laid down wide, and it looks like it will grow into a masterpiece. but it doesn't. phillipe noiret deserves recommendations for his role of alfredo and young salvatore cascio is nothing short of a brilliant in his role of salvatore as a child. other than that, everything is mediocre at best. story, while full of potential, is presented in an utterly corny and clichéd manner, acting is (besides those two honorable exceptions) amateurish and overplayed, and plot is (as expected) non-existent. filmed 4 years after "once upon a time in America", this flick at the moments resonates the great masterpiece, and i kinda expected old salvatore to look through projection booth while recalling his childhood :)while i can always swallow eternal-love type of story, this one is too shallow, too unfocused and watered. i haven't missed any of the movies messages, they are just too obvious and pathetic, and could appeal to me only if i was 18 again. for a 1988 movie that pretend to be something more, i find that inexcusable. there a tons of beautiful films, much older than this, dealing with same subjects in much more profound and original manner. this one settles with portraying love for art with endless clips of old movies, and shots of people watching them. for most passionate lovers of cinema and celluloid magic this might be a great movie as they can find their favorites in every clip featured. i personally don't like cinema as a whole nor it's "magic" nor do i respect every "classic". what i do like are good stories told in a good way, whether spoken, written or made into movies. and i don't like the way this one is told so i would probably give it 2 stars if there wasn't for legendary morricone that can singlehandedly elevate experience of every movie with the simplest of his tunes. watch and forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I see the end of this movie, I dissolve into tears. A beautiful film that captures the magic of the movies and the beauty of friendship and the way in which the experiences in our childhood plant seeds that bear fruit later. What a triumph in film making. I am NOT a deep thinker. I am NOT a foreign movie buff, though I have seen many. I am just an average Jane. To me, that this movie could mean so much to someone who is just "regular folk" says a lot about the way in which it was made. I have a really hard time describing this movie to recommend it to people. I pretty much just say, "Oh, it is magic. Incredible. You will love it." But then when I try to explain the plot, I realize it is such a simple plot and most people look at me like I am an idiot. As if, "what could possibly be interesting about that?" But there is just something about this movie and the way that it moves, the music, the way that it is shot, makes it so powerful. So powerful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso is an homage to those whom really love the 7th art. The history is involving, seductive, and yet, simple to the core. It is one of those stories told in such way that will captivate you to the screen, and when you'll the credits rolling you'll have the feeling that it actually could've been a longer film. It is just told in lines explained by the friendship of an old theater projectionist and a little boy, grown to be a filmmaker himself, from his love for movies when he was just a boy, eager to know more about movies than be just a spectator on the audience. All done in one of those flash of moments we all have from time to time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema paradise : what a wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema paradise was one of the best movies I have ever seen because in Toto I saw my self and secondly was a very touching movie that made me look back and think different things about my life.Tornatore combined humorous elements with the nostalgia for the past. The one thing that I want to complain is the character of Elena was poor acted. She is a daughter of a rich father who removed in the small town of Toto because of her father's job. I wanted to see her not only refusing Toto's love but she should act like she is ''detesting'' him . We mustn't forget that is a postwar period and then riches and poors were 2 different worlds which it was unacceptable to mix them . Elena's father didn't show the anger because her daughter fell in love with Toto.Also Tornatore didn't show how the relation between Toto and his sister and mother grows. Did Toto feel some anger for the cruel behavior of his mother? I saw only his sister at the beginning of the movie saying that he won't come again to see them even if Alfredo has died. Also I believe that Alfredo reminds the director a person who had a close contact with him and he might affect his whole career by showing the way and the choices that he should do. Alfredo was like that father that Toto wanted to have.After seeing this movie I had to asked my father if the situation was like that in my country Greece. He said me yes. Just like Spain people centering to see a movie with a humorous and relaxing mode . After their work they knew that going to cinema will have some rest there by laughing, sleepping and more. Each one of them he is trying to rest as he wants that makes tragicomic states because the children of the small town are making fun of them.Cinema paradise was a movie that responds in the requirements of reality and this makes it much better because Tornatore showing the simple things of life ( love , poorness ) created a masterpiece without displaying something excessive and extreme.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I revisited this movie recently after many years. I remember enjoying it when I first saw it, but this time I was totally blown away with it.It is one of the most charming and delightful movies told in hindsight about a young boy growing up in a small town in Italy. The story goes back to before WW2. The young boy is in love with the films shown at the local movie house. Most of the townsfolk use the cinema as their main source of entertainment watching Hollywood movies that have been dubbed into Italian.The young boy builds up a lifelong friendship with the projectionist and becomes his protégé. There are wonderful snippets of the quirky inhabitants of the town. As the young lad matures, he's encouraged to spread his wings and make something of himself in the world - eventually he does.Many years on, he has reason to return to his old home town which he hasn't seen for twenty years. It gives him a chance to reminisce.The story is so cute, beautiful, tender, heart-warming and funny. It's a must-see movie for any movie lover. It's rare for me to rate a movie 10/10, but I have no hesitation with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a doubt, one of the best movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso, is by far one of my favorite movies of all time, along with Schindler's List. Both movies give me teary eyes for different reasons. Schindler's List is a sad movie, while Cinema Paradiso is not really a sad movie, and yet it is impossible to watch it without feeling emotional or nostalgic. There is no good verses evil in this movie. In a way, it is all good.As many others mention in their reviews, Cinema Paradiso is a celebration of movies. But it is much more than just that. It is about love, friendship, mischievous acts, life, and above all, nostalgia. Regardless of what your life background is, you feel very connected with the story and relate to it. We all had things we loved when we were kids, and loved someone as we became an adult. So, we were all like Toto in a way as we were growing up. The story may even be more relatable if we immigrated from our childhood city to live somewhere else.More details, with some spoilers:1- There are 3 phases of Toto's life in the movie, played with 3 different actors. The kid Toto is full of life and excitement. It is a joy to watch him. The young Toto is also excited, but about other things in life, mainly about a girl, while he shows some frustrations and negative emotions too (like when he is on the phone and screaming and yelling). The older Toto is somewhat emotionless. He is an important man in his field of work now, and yet his life feels empty with no joy. This is something that happens to many of us as we grow older, we achieve more in life, and get excited less and less.2- The moment that the old movie theater is imploded, is an amazing and yet sad scene. You see in the faces of the old people watching the implosion, a sense of loss. The movie theater symbolized all their past, their youth, their memories; and at that moment it was all gone.3- The friendship between Toto and Alfredo develops in the most natural and beautiful way. It is like a Father/Son relationship, but also a Mentor/Protégé, and definitely as just two friends. Both of them are quite likable.4- Ahh, the last scene. The kissings. It even makes the emotionless Toto have teary eyes while smiling. One of the best endings in the movie history, and what makes it even better is Ennio Morricone's amazing soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film for the Ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A village comes to life as a man dreams of a character who directed his entire life. He was a projectionist a run down movie theater which formed the center of entertainment in the community. We are introduced to Toto who lives with his mother who waits for her husband to come home from the Russian front. He is a scalawag who disobeys her and finds ways to spend time with Alfredo, the protectionist. He is in constant trouble but always comes to this man for direction, even though the guy finds him to be a pain in the butt. One night, the movie projector catches fire as does the film (nitrate film did this in the early days) and blinds the old man. Toto becomes the projectionist, even though he is but ten years old. He also becomes the eyes of his friend. He stays at the job, ignoring school, and eventually makes some modest films himself. As he does this, he sees a beautiful young woman with whom he falls in love. This whole film captures the essence of the city. We get to know a multitude of characters because their lives revolve around the movies being shown at the Cinema Paradiso. Toto (not his real name) returns to his home when his mother leaves a message for him that Alfredo has died. He has really cut off ties with the place and it is a painful trip back. But it pulls at our hearts. Things are almost magical. One of the best films every made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema Parasiso - An Inspiration to Filmmakers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching Cinema Parsdiso, I was just a film buff, watching, analyzing, and finding out the concept behind making a film. After watching this movie, I literally cried because it was the story of my childhood. That is how I exactly spent my childhood. I immediately realized that I ain't just a film buff, I am a Filmmaker. Coming to the review part of this movie, the story telling style of Giussepe is so unique and nostalgic that while you see the people sitting inside Theater reacting to on-screen emotions is classic and makes us feel we are part of them inside Nuovo Paradiso Theater. Alfredo is a great teacher and projectionist who lived Films all his life. Toto at the same time has just discovered his love for cinema. The beauty of cinema Paradiso is on one hand there's Alfredo who dreams to become a filmmaker however he couldn't because he's the only projectionist in Town and on the other hand there's Toto who's desperate about Films and wants to become friends with Alfredo to watch &amp; learn films. However A school exam decides whether they gonna be friends or not. Adult 'Toto' recollects his memory and childhood experience in the village. The Gift Alfredo had kept all this while for Toto is Alfredo's experience as a single audience. Cinema Paradiso is a beautiful experience that you will remember all your life. Thank you Cinema Paradiso for making me realize my passion for Films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certain films transcend the pages of the script and the screen and become something greater. Certain films become something that turns your eyes from just watching it play out, to experiencing the film through your entire emotional state. I guess what I mean is that Cinema Paradiso to me meant more than just another film. It made me feel unlike I ever had before. It's one of the best films for pure film buffs. Not only is it a deeply emotional experience but it's also a joy to watch.It tells the story of Toto, a famous filmmaker who looks back on his time growing up at a local movie theater and his deep bond with the theaters projectionist, Alfredo. There are plenty of great unlikely relationships in movies but none really moved me as much as Toto and Alfredo's. Even with the actor who played Alfredo having to develop chemistry with three different actors who portrayed Toto, it works. There's something to be said about that person in your life, family or not, who inspires you to become who you are and teaches you the do's and don'ts of life. Alfredo was that to Toto. As much as I loved that aspect of the movie, I was surprised to see just how well they were able to tell the history of film as well. Whether it was the film that burned, the excessive censorship, or all of the famous movie plus and references throughout, it was a masterful directing job.The film is also complimented by an all time great score and main theme. Most notably as Toto goes through his memories back at the Paradiso. A subtle romance story with Toto and Elena is also worth mentioning. It's just one of those movies that impacts you more than you think. I don't why it took me so long to actually watch the film. It's a great bittersweet story.+Father-son bond +Perfect for die-hard movie lovers +Score +Balances everything really well 9.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite simply, my favorite movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally speaking, no one can really say what their favorite movie is, but when I am asked the question, the first movie that comes to my mind is "Cinema Paradiso".I am not sure whether this is the movie every filmmaker wished they had made, as some people claim, but without a doubt it has to be the most beautiful movie ever made about the love of cinema! The last scene is simply scintillating. Toto, now an adult, is handed a box with film cut outs of kissing scenes that were banned when he was a kid. And Alfredo wanted him to have them after his death. When he plays the video, alone in a cinema, and Enio Morricone's music starts, you feel elevated and invaded by all sorts of emotions. I was at the cinema for the 25th anniversary of this film, and everybody was crying by the time this scene started. Me included. It's just a magical piece of film making that everyone should watch at least once. After Cinema Paradiso, you may find it hard to enjoy the majority of movies you watch. It's just that good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Lovers' Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso perfectly captures the obsessive and domineering power cinema has over its dedicated fans and their lives. Just like how our main character Toto becomes enchanted and engulfed by the movies, Cinema Paradiso is a movie which succeeds in doing just that. The movie follows the relationship of a child, Toto, with Alfredo, a projectionist at the local cinema, who becomes a father figure for Toto. Alfredo himself is very much a mythical character; he has no back story or even a surname, yet he succeeds in being one of the most unforgettable characters in film history, wouldn't we all want an Alfredo in our lives? Although he is a man who appears to have never made much for himself in life, ultimately a bit of a loser. This is one aspect of the story which really punches me in the gut; Alferdo prevents Toto from going down the same road as him, but as the cost of never having to see him again. It works, and especially in the director's cut in which we learn Toto has become a famous filmmaker.Cinema Paradiso is my favourite foreign language film, and what a rich experience it is. The music, scenery and vibrant architecture of Sicily immediately draw me in; I simply enjoying the essence of being there. Like the stamp of any truly great film, Cinema Paradiso is a movie which you don't want to end. I recommend wearing a life jacket while watching this movie or you will drown in your own tears. This is one few films that gives me teary eyed goose bumps even thinking about it, or by listening to Ennio Morricone's score. In fact it has just been brought to my attention that scientists have proposed a new theory that rising sea levels aren't caused by melting ice caps but rather by people watching Cinema Paradiso.For the original Italian release or director's cut, the film had a run time of 173 minutes, for the international release it was cut to 124 minutes. I have to say however I greatly prefer the cut version. The director's cut examines the romantic relationship between characters Toto and Elena in much more detail, turning what is a sub plot in cut version into a main focus of the story, and while interesting to see the loose ends and the explained justification for Alfredo's actions, it does cause the movie to drag and in turn creating a version of the film with less emotional impact, where as the cut version is a perfectly paced film. It also takes away some of mystery posed by the shorter version, showing that some stories are best left untold, not everything has to be explained. I still feel the longer version is worth watching, I has made me dubious of director's cuts.Anyone passionate about cinema can't afford to miss Cinema Paradiso (that being unless you're a hardcore cynic, then this film will send you into a fit of rage), but aside from being a tribute to cinema, the film is full of emotions for nostalgia of childhood and youth, love and the losses we have to deal with during our lives. The cut version of Cinema Paradiso is Cinema Perfecto.International Cut ? 10/10Director's Cut ? 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Colorful and moving flick dealing with a wonderful friendship between a little boy and a solitary projectionist . However , being overly nostalgic , too sentimental and overwhelmingly sweet . Attractive and sensitive picture with stirring drama , ravishing cinematography and enjoyable musical score . A filmmaker (Jacques Perrin , he subsequently became a notorious director) recalls his childhood (Salvatore Cascio , Toto , who celebrated his eighth birthday during filming) , when he fell in love with the movies at his village's theater and formed a deep friendship with the theater's projectionist (Philippe Noiret who said all his lines in French) at Cinema Paradise . The director goes back home to his Sicilian village for the first time after almost 30 years and is reminded of his first love (Antonella Attili) . It is an interesting celebration of youth, friendship, and the everlasting magic of the films . Nostalgic and sensitive picture with thought-provoking drama , ravishing cinematography and moving musical score . The picture contains drama and nostalgia completely wrapped in an agreeable story between a lone man and a boy . The flick relies heavily on the relationship between an older man and a kid , subsequently teenager , but this does not get bored or spoils the tale . Slightly overrated but excellent all the same time , the picture is enjoyable and entertaining , but overlong . The story is narrated with great sense and sensibility , the intelligent screenplay was written by the same Giuseppe Tornatore . Giuseppe's intention was that this movie should serve as an obituary for traditional movie theatres and the movie industry in general , after the movie's success he never mentioned this again. This excellent and enthralling picture ¨Cinema Paradise¨ was starred by extraordinary actors such as Philippe Noiret , Jacques Perrin and Marco Leonardi . Good acting from remaining cast , just like Antonella Attili , Enzo Cannavale , Leopoldo Triestre , Agnese Nano , Pupella Maggio, among others . Glowing cinematography with scenarios colorfully and stunningly photographed by Blasco Giurato who reflects splendidly the cinema , streets , square , village and many other things . Rousing as well as insistent score musical , including a continuous leitmotif from the beginning to the end ; being efficiently composed by the veteran master and prolific Ennio Morricone . The film won several nominations and awards , Oscar included .This weeper picture was very well directed by Giuseppe Tornatore . He is a writer and director, known for making similar nostalgic films including good actors , such as ¨Malena¨ with Monica Belucci , ¨ The star maker¨ with Sergio Castellito , ¨Baaria¨ with Raoul Bova ; and ¨La Leggenda del Pianista Sull'Oceano" (original title) or "The Legend of 1900" or "The Legend of the Pianist on the Ocean with Tim Roth . Being his English-language debut feature titled ¨The professor¨ with Ben Gazzara . Cinema Paradise Rating : Better than average, well worth watching for exceptional cinematography , first-rate acting and marvelous score .</fullReview>

The normal run time is 155 minutes but there is an international version mainly for Americans. They felt an American could not sit longer than 2 for a movie that didn't contain gunfire, car chases or tits. So they made an edited version for us that runs 121-124 minutes. I won't tell you exactly what is missing from the 2 hour version versus the 155 minute one, but just imagine watching Starwars and never learning Darth Vader was Luke's father.

		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso had been on my list of "must watch movies" for years. I did enjoy it but think it does not deserve the very high ranking it gets in many greatest ever movie lists.The movie deals with how our experiences in our youth can have an indelible affect on the rest of our lives.I won't go into the story in depth but it begins as the young Toto, living in a Sicilian village, befriends Alfredo, who loads the film reels in the local cinema. We then follow Toto as he grows up and there are plenty of funny and touching incidents involving the people of the village. The film is unashamedly sentimental and at times perhaps even melodramatic.I watched the "Directors Cut". It is nearly three hours long but I cheated by watching in three sittings so I can't comment on whether this version is too long or not.The closing scene is one of the best in the movie as the director leaves it up to the audience to decide whether personal happiness or the creation of great art is more important.</fullReview>

If you have never seen this beautiful film, avoid the Director's cut at all costs. If you have seen this movie and loved it, do not ruin the experience by watching the bloated Director's cut version with, not only unnecessary story elements, but whole new story lines that ruin the appeal of the original and make the main character less sympathetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you are a cinema lover, you'll love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As any cinema lover, Cinema Paradiso is on top of my list. This great Italian movie takes us on a trip through the life of Salvatore (aka Toto). Salvatore recalls his childhood when coming back to his hometown for the funeral of Alfredo, the theater projectionist. The relationship between Salvatore and Alfredo is the center of the story and we can't help to be warmth by it. Alfredo also passed to Salvatore all is knowledge about traditional cinema helping him to make the first steps in cinematography.Salvatore also remembers his first love, Elena, and tries to understand why they didn't stay together. When he finally understands it, he is devastated.The movie give us also a hint of the beginning of cinema for masses, church restrictions on cinema and changes in cinema through time. The last scene is one of the best ever made: emotional and beautiful. I always feel my eyes wet.After the movie, I only could think: Do we really have to choose between two lives? Does someone have the right to choose a life for us?http://movieadviser.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening strains of the strings that accompany the opening shot, I am forevermore mesmerized by this movie. Chance encounters with the fairy dust of this movie - a poster image here, a mention of an actor's name here, the haunting melody - immediately transport me to its world. As I write this I see Toto and I smile. In my mind I sit on a stool and learn from Alfredo as well; I smell his soup warming by the projector and hear the sounds it makes. I hear the squeaks in the floor as Alfredo moves around. I can see the wonder on Toto's face as his friend Alfredo makes his magic. I love many movies but this is my favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Example of expert storytelling, and film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmm, how do I start this? One thing I look for in a movie is depth. I like good character development and long drawn out backstories. Movies that excel in this usually don't have the quick pacing that keeps my attention. I've been looking for movies that have a sort of middle ground, you know, well roundedness.Upon reading the plot/synopsis, It was easy to say that I wasn't impressed. It didn't sound like a great subject, or something that'd keep my interest. But then again, I felt the same way about Shawshank Redemption. I was like "What? A prison movie? Not even an action movie? Wth?" ; and you know how Shawshank turned out.Cinema Paradiso is about a poor boy who lives with his mother and sister, his father KIA in 'the war'. The protagonist (boy) develops a relationship with a guy who works film projectors. He teaches the kid the ropes or projecting, and sneaks him into the projector room to watch all these classic movies for free. The movie goes through this father-son relationship over the span of 20+ years. This kid eats, breathes, and sleeps movies. His life's events, appropriately, mirror themes from classic movie story lines. Sounds like a bore, I know.This movie was made with care. The version I watched ran almost 3 hours. It felt like one of the LOTR movies in the fact that the length wasn't obstructed by dull long-and-drawn-out scenes. There was enough stuff going on, and enough layers to the story to keep me squirming in my seat.Well, there's a lot I'd like to say about this film - but i'll keep it short and sweet for your sake.If I were to make a top 10 movie list, this would be an easy addition.I'd like to think that I'm just as casual of a movie-goer as anybody else. This movie isn't some pretentious artsy flick that art school kids would boast as their favorite *cough "Eraserhead!"*. It's easy to watch and has something for everybody. Lots of comedy, romance, drama, etc. I feel like the grandpa from Princess Bride when he's explaining the book.So yeah, I highly recommend this movie. I've yet to see a movie as full and resourceful. I know it'll be a long time before I find another like Cinema Paradiso.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful film on life, friendship and love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Toto, a young boy living in a small town in Italy, is passionate about the small theater and the company of its projectionist, Alfredo. The movie shows the growth of the boy into a man, showing us all the relationships with the place of his youth and how all those things would be forever a part of him.The cinematography, directing and acting are all so good, they don't even matter. This is one of those movies that play better without caring for details, without trying to dismantle it, because every piece proves essential for the big picture.And that is it's greatest beauty, how we're shown bits and pieces throughout the movie, enough to keep us interested but never enough for us to fully comprehend it. That is until the final scene comes and then all is clear, not sad or happy, just the big picture of life seen through the past and present of this man. A story about an imperfect man in an imperfect world, a story about all of us.I can't recommend this movie enough, so just go and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is exquisitely poignant. Giuseppe Tornatore expresses his overpowering love of movies by giving his viewers a genuinely magnificent movie to love and treasure. The final scene is a perfect blend of film editing and soundtrack music. Anyone whose eyes are still dry half way into that glorious scene needs to see a cardiologist ASAP. Cudos to the great Ennio Morricone &amp; son Andrea. Many reviewers insist that the shorter, theatrical-release version is superior to the director's cut. The full-length version makes a central character morally ambiguous, in contrast to the uniformly benevolent father figure depicted in the shorter version. In the long version this character commits an act similar to but far crueler than the behavior of another character who is ridiculed early on. Most new viewers will watch the full-length film. The shorter version is more satisfying for those who secretly prefer fairy tales in which the good guys &amp; bad guys are consistently good guys &amp; bad guys. Viewers who can handle a realistic dose of moral ambiguity owe it to themselves to see the real reel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very emotional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't remember the last time I watched a film like this one. Its strength comes from emotions instead of popular actors, big budgets, etc. I felt compelled to recommend this title since it is a unique movie that almost any one can relate to.The story is about friendship, one of the most important things in life. But unlike most movies about this matter, their connection felt genuine. Although this film is a little sad, it delivers other moments that are not. Just like friendship does. The main characters did a terrific job, and the photography helped also. Even if the movie is a bit long, it is still highly enjoyable. An absolute must watch for every single person that claims he/she knows about movies, and for everyone else also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Movies Influence Our Lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard of "Cinema Paradiso" for so long, but ironically I have not seen it yet. I am glad I finally got a chance to watch this Giuseppe Tornatore masterpiece on DVD.The story starts in the present time with Salvatore "Toto" Di Vita, an acclaimed film director, receiving news that a certain Alfredo has passed away. From there, the movie goes into flashback mode, and recounts Salvatore's life as a child and a teenager, and the lasting influence his surrogate father Alfredo had in his life.The first part of the flashback takes us back to Giancaldo in Sicily, and recounts how young Toto was so entranced with the movies being shown in the local movie house, the Cinema Paradiso. He constantly hung around Alfredo's (played by Phillip Noiret) projection room. Eventually, when Alfredo gets disabled in an accident, the child Toto took over the projectionist job.The second part of the flashback recounts the teenage Salvatore (played by Marco Leonardi) still doing his film projectionist job, while beginning his fledgling career as a movie maker. A lengthy part was devoted to his ill-fated obsession with the beautiful Elena. This unsuccessful love affair makes Salvatore take Alfredo's advice to leave Giancaldo and make something out of his life.In this Director's Cut DVD that I watched, another subplot was restored, which was cut out in the international release that won the Oscar Best Foreign Film back in 1988. This involved the older Salvatore (Jacques Perrin) going back to Giancaldo for Alfredo's funeral, and getting the chance to reunite the older Elena. This afforded a further revelation that gives another bittersweet dimension to the influence of Alfredo in Salvatore's life.Despite the 170-minute running time of the Director's Cut and the subtitles, Cinema Paradiso is indeed a modern classic that must be seem by everyone who loves the movies. The cinematography is lush and breathtaking. The Ennio Morricone score is very romantic, haunting and memorable. And the ending that shares with us the gift bequeathed by Alfredo to Salvatore after his death is very touching yet glorious at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Life isn't like in the movies. Life is much harder."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmmakers often possess a deeper passion that is noticeably reflected in their work. However, there is one passion that all directors inevitably share, and that is for cinema itself. Films like Woody Allen's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985)' and, more recently, Michel Gondry's 'Be Kind Rewind (2008),' exhibit such affection towards movies and movie-making that no film-lover can help but like them. In 1988, Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore released 'Nuovo cinema Paradiso / Cinema Paradiso,' his personal ode to the magic of movies and the humble small-town cinema. After a poor local performance, the film was sheered down to 123 minutes (from 155 minutes), and subsequently went on to win both the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and the Best Foreign-Language Film Oscar. In 2002, a 170-minute director's cut {marketed in the United States as 'Cinema Paradiso: The New Version'}, which restored all of the original future, was released into theatres. As the director's cut was the only version to which I had ready access, this was the one that I watched for the first time. The director's cut is notable in that it greatly expands on Alfred's role in Toto's life and career.In the hustle-and-bustle of modern Rome, acclaimed film director Salvatore "Toto" Di Vita (Jacques Perrin) returns home to a sad message from his elderly mother: "Alfredo has died." During the night, the man reflects on his childhood, when, as a bright and fervent young boy (played by Salvatore Cascio), he used to frequent his small town's local cinema, where the friendly projectionist, Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) taught him, however reluctantly, the tricks of the trade. Flash forward several years, and Toto is now a mature and intelligent teenager, falling for the first (and only) time into the throes of young love. Though I have not seen the shortened theatrical version, from what I've been able to gather, the story doesn't delve too deeply into the adventures of the adult Toto. In the director's cut, most of the additional running time is dedicated to his home-town return, as he is drawn almost overwhelmingly into the regretful ghosts of his past. These sequences are, of course, not without interest, but Tornatore is at his strongest in the first act, with Toto as an impressionable young boy immersed in the joy of cinema.Philippe Noiret is wonderful as the warm and occasionally brusque film projectionist, and his interactions with Toto (especially young Salvatore Cascio) develop into a powerful father-son relationship. The director's cut intriguingly suggests that Alfred deliberately mislead Toto about Elena (Agnese Nano, later Brigitte Fossey) in order to preserve his chances of succeeding with his #1 love of all, movies. Alfred suspected that, had Toto married Elena, he would never have been able to become an accomplished film director ? as a beloved father figure for the boy, he made the difficult decision that Toto could never have made. The ethical complications of Alfred's decision are problematic, but one can at least follow his logic, and his motives, however misguided, were certainly well-intended. At the film's end, as the adult Toto is doubting his love for cinema, his passion is reassured with a wonderful montage of the romantic moments that the town's prudish priest had once sliced from every film to be screened in his theatre. This is the magic of cinema. It's not just the films themselves, but also the flood of personal memories that accompanies each forbidden screen embrace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come Fall in Love with Cinema! Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso is a cinema must for everyone who wants to fall in love with movies or re-ignite their lost passion. A movie about movies cannot get any better than this masterpiece in every sense of word. Simple characters build around a theater only source of entertainment for people in a small province of Italy during WW II period, and a love story of main character first with movies, then with a girl, is simply beautiful, especially the passion of the kid with movies, is simply astounding. Another relationship depicted in the movie that of Toto and Alfredo is beautifully developed and equally well played by actors (3 played Toto, kid, young and mature old). The Kid artist who played Toto is amazing and played the role with equal panache as does the Alfredo. Other various artists are good in their roles, well suited. Music is very good and blends with every scene very well. Direction is superb and the photography too is top-notch, dialog's too are very well written. Watching crowd in the theater watching cinema is a pleasure moment for me as a viewer, it takes me back to old days when I use to enjoy a movie so much in theater, now its usually on TV, DVD, theater magic is not like that anymore. 10/10, must watch, irrespective of foreign language. I myself don't know any Italian and yet enjoy these movies completely. I, a passionate fan of Cinema sees no boundary in languages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Five minutes after I have watched this movie,slowly calming down,I am now writing my feelings down and you must know how much I want to share it with everyone who loves this movie!The movie "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" moved me greatly and the feelings are so strong that I can't even describe it.As they say,Beauty in terms of human words is meaningless.It is a movie about movie,a story about love and friendship and everything that a living human being can feel.A lovely and smart child ,living with a desperate mother waiting for her beloved husband at war,grew up with movies and finally became a famous director.He once loved a beautiful woman and the woman loved him too.However,as we all know,love is fragile.Love immediately comes to an end the moment it meets with marriage.So,is there a way that makes love eternal,always smiling at you when you open your eyes in the morning? I had guessed the beginning but I didn't get the "fine".That's why it's such a great movie. "The soldier stop waiting and go away at the very 99th day,when a day after he would probably have the princess' heart." Maybe sometimes the best thing to do is to walk away,leaving the memory lasting forever.The last fifty minutes of the movie,particularly I think, is the best part.The climax comes when the man and the woman meet each other again thirty years after their inevitable miss.I cant help burst into tears cause I can't hold it anymore after 2 hours' living together with the excellent characters.It's not until this day,by this movie that I am successfully convinced A man can really hold his love for as much as 30 years!Life is like a movie,but it's harder.</fullReview>

Rare is a masterpiece, where you cannot needle that acute and beautiful pain the movie is causing to you, but yet, you succumb and cry.The music, especially, though based on a common theme, is heart rendering.

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece restored.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You should approach any movie with the term 'director's cut' with caution. It can mean that we are now seeing the film the way the director intended it to been seen before the studio hacks got their hands on it or it could simply mean a lot more of the same, the unchecked ego of its creator. When "Cinema Paradiso" was first shown here it ran a very serviceable two hours and told the story of a boy, Toto, in Sicily whose love of cinema is instilled in him through his relationship with the elderly projectionist in the local movie house. The movie was told in flashback as the boy returns, a grown man and now a famous director himself, to his home town for the funeral of his friend and mentor. A sub-plot involving the girl he loved and lost to someone else was completely jettisoned.Now the film has been re-issued with this sub-plot restored to its rightful place and rather than detracting from the film's main theme it adds to it and deepens it. Now we can see that the boy's life was not only influenced by Alfredo, the projectionist, by making him aware of the joys of cinema but more directly, in a much more personal fashion. In a way it's like seeing a different movie but a much more rounded and mature one.Both versions are, of course, superb but while the shorter version plays heavily on the sentimentality quotient the longer version is a darker and sadder affair and allows Jacques Perrin to fully develop the character of the grown Toto, (in the shorter version we can only guess at his motivations). In this version Perrin's performance is just one in a trio of brilliant performances. As the child Toto, Salvatore Cascio holds the cuteness factor at just the right level while the great Philippe Noiret is perfectly marvellous as Alfredo. The shorter version will, of course, appeal to anyone who loves cinema, even remotely, (and Alfredo's 'gift' to Toto is director Giuseppe Tornatore's gift to us), but the longer version is a masterpiece that engages us on a much more profound level. However, neither of them should be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a masterpiece. It just touched my soul when I watched it because it had such great symbolism which is hard to see at times but, when you see it, you feel as if your in a different world. Now your probably wondering why i was crying and laughing and crying again and it was because the movie was bad then good and then bad again, no no no...don't get me wrong this movie was absolutely a masterpiece through-and-through. The reason why i was crying and laughing and so on was because the movie made me feel so many different emotions at one time and it changed so quickly but, the way they changed it was flawless. I may be saying this in a really complicated way but i think that anyone at any age should be able to watch this. I know it says rated R on the front but all the partial nudity and innuendos are adult stuff and younger children would not understand...and no there is no sex. In conclusion, I've been writing in a mashed up manner and that is only because i can not explain how much of a moving, touching, and just flat out unbelievable movie this was...PLEASE WATCH IT...</fullReview>

I have found the history of attainment of the maturity and have lost the love one lesson in the life. Every time that I have seen this film griderei for the last average hour. The all changed of the Cut of the director this. The film originates has had them a wonderful rhythm and a flow. The old additional scenes of the film in the cut of the director do not add some value. The little added scenes of the character in first part of the film, comprised the loss of the virginity in the theatre, serv of the Toto in order to reduce the film. It was enough for knowing that it has been developed in on in the theatre, we has not had particular need of the additional one. The passing and the loss of the Elena were a life part. Our first love is always powerful and the relative loss us standard many things, including like still loving. To carry it newly within the history is to change the film. The participation of the Alfredo to its preoccupantesi passing moreover changes to its character from one figure of the father to a old man of meddling. To the conclusion of the extended version, the risente found one that of the coil of the kisses instead screaming approximately a lost love. The entire message of the film has been changed. They are crushed in order to see these changes. I hope that that one to watch the release still originates res-establish them the magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had owned the DVD of the above movie for quite some time but was not getting an opportunity to see it. I saw it, finally, last night. The movie surpassed all my expectations and was a treat to watch. I guess, there is something about the Italian cinema that truly fascinates me. Especially the movies that deal with the people of small towns, going about there lives in a lazy manner. I guess it may have to do with the fact that we live in a very fast and noisy world and probably find our escapes in the movies. I would love to trade my position (I am sure many of us would) with these simple people of the last century, living their simple lives, laughing, chatting, playing guitar....Well, coming back to the movie, it is based on a beautiful relationship between an old man (Alfredo) and a small boy (Toto). Alfredo is the cinema-keeper in a small Italian town theater. Toto is his friend and keeps coming to his place quite often. Toto is besotted with movies. Their friendship deepens after an incident in which Toto saves Alfredo's life. Alfredo looses his eyesight, and Toto, the only other person in the town who knows how to operate the projector, gets his job. Toto grows older, falls in love, and the drama continues...The movie is actually in a flashback mode, where Toto has grown up to become a very successful movie director. And he starts thinking about his past life when he comes to know that Alfredo is no more.The Story line is simple yet holds your attention, excellent camera work (the images captured are wonderful), good direction and melodious background score. Its a movie made from the heart and will appeal to all those people who like good cinema.</fullReview>

He is good friends with Alfred (Philippe Noiret) and always tries to go up the projection room to check how things work there. As time goes by, Salvatore (now Marco Leonardi) keeps his love for the cinema and starts working there. His friendship with Alfredo continues and they're like father and son.

		<fullReview>What criticism can I give this movie? Was it overly sentimental? It was the sentimentality that made this such a fine film. The character "Alfredo" says it best when saying goodbye to the young Salvador, "Don't give into nostalgia." The film is about what is lost in time. It's about coming home again. The Italian film Cinema Paradiso is about the life of a Fellini-esc movie director who must return to his home village after leaving thirty years prior. The film is told from his perspective with memories and flashbacks of his time as a young boy and through his teenage years. What is most remarkable about this film is that in his years away from his home village, the world he new so well (and one that I think he expected to be identical to his memories) has changed so dramatically. The movie house, The Cinema Paradiso, once the center of the village and where he first found his love for film and met his friend (and surrogate father) Alfredo, is now no more then an afterthought. Nothing more then a forgotten ruin waiting for the wrecking ball. It is as if with the death of Alfredo, his link with the past is cut for good; only to leave the now grown up "Toto" truly alone.The first time I saw this movie my feelings were that it was good and entertaining but otherwise unremarkable. Then came THE END....In the center of the world that is Rome we find the great "Director Salvador De Vita", busy at work. Almost as an afterthought he hands over an old, worn out film reel left for him by his dead friend "Alfredo" to view. With this the film is catapulted into greatness.This film, if not for anything else, is interesting to watch. We see a portrayal of an Italian village and lifestyle as it was. It was a closed world that relied on itself for life, religion, news, and entertainment. The world today with its cheap and easy transportation and mass communication makes "Toto's" meager village more of a suburb of the global world. Lost is the community of "Alfredo", and with him is lost a simpler way of life for us all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nuovo Cinema Paradiso is the most perfect film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider Nuovo Cinema Paradiso is the most perfect film because of all three of the major ingredients in films of this century are considered important. One, the acting was exceptional good, in the way the very young "Toto" was very convincing in acting his age in post war Italy and then the teen-age "Toto" was excellent in showing a boy becoming a man in war time Italy and showing a beginning interest in the wonder and love of films, by experiencing the films shown in the town's only movie theater and even making them himself and then the adult "Toto" was also excellent in the end of movie when it was apparent that he has to have films to survive his everyday world of making them too. The second one is the direction and I am including the third one, the writing one here too. The director was very correct in showing us the life of this town surrounding the nightly showings of the movies in the Cinema Paradiso theater. I am very involve in this movie each time I see it, I start daydreaming that I am actuals a member of that community and seeing the movies at Cinema Paradiso movie theater in that same Italian town, in which "Toto" grew up in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flawless: a word that does Cinema Paradiso total justice. Everything about it is perfect. This coming-of-age film is extremely thought-provoking, poetic, and evocative. It makes you feel as though you are a part of the movie and that you actually live in this small town in southern Italy and know all of the characters personally. My advice to anyone who has not seen it before is first of all, to see it as soon as possible, and second of all, to make sure that you are in a relaxed mood and you are in quiet area with no distractions around before watching. After that, just sit back, unwind, and truly grasp this remarkable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Note From Someone Of 14...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not exactly that old. I'm not exactly a film buff or anything, but I watch films that my dad brings and tells me are good. Sometimes my sister has something interesting to offer too. When my dad showed me this film, I thought; 'Oh dear, another one?' but proceeded to watch it with him. It pulled me into a world where dreams can come true. The film was fascinating, I watched it with the kind of reverence children save for The Teletubbies. I watched the film and it opened within me a new kind of person, someone who won't give up, someone who is constantly trying to get better at something. But the part of the film that struck me most was the part when Toto returns home and goes into his bedroom and we see his first film reel, the pictures of the young Toto and Alfredo. It's like Alfredo was almost a father figure for Toto. That's the only part of the film that made me cry. Another similar film I saw recently was "A Touch Of Spice", a Greek film that my sister brought home. It is also very heart-wrenching film, much like Cinema Paradiso, but with a different storyline. I highly recommend this film; but I won't talk about it any more and spoil it! Cinema Paradiso is honestly one of the best films I have ever seen, something Hollywood has really got to learn from. The thing that makes a good film is emotion, not special effects or famous actors or actresses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sincere, absolutely no money making machine, pure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tornatore had a genial idea. He would never have expected such a success worldwide. During the Cannes and international awards he was sincerely surprised. It's very very difficult to get such an international recognition with the poor budget of Italian movies in recent years.What made it big was sincerity, honesty and passion. It's not just another Hollywood billion sponsored movie. This is sincere and true.Sicily can be Australia, USA or Germany as true people share the same feelings all over the world.This movie was not "built" but just the passion of feelings of the actors and all of the team. They did just follow their heart, without thinking about money. This is why this movie had such a great international success.I much prefer these movies like this made in Italy, with an heritage of 2500 years of culture, then "king kong", a pure matter of speculation and multimillion special effects with a multimillion marketing budget to promote it. I prefer passion to money... sure this movie will give you much more true feelings and brain food. Please, if you have the time rent it. You will not be disappointed... it's in the top 100 movies of all time on IMDb, with an 8.4 rating (based on more than 16000 member evaluations)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Final Scene in Cinematic History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A love story, pure and simple. Not, as one might suppose, the doomed young love between Salvatore and Elena (a love he fails to recapture), but the pure father/son love between the local cinema projectionist, Alfredo and the fatherless Salvatore. The essential beauty of this film-long relationship is brought home in the greatest final scene any film in history ever had (IMHO). This has the hairs on the back of my neck stand to attention every single time I've seen it.With the themes this film addresses, it could so easily have been a gloop of mawkishness sentimentality. Sure, it has sentiments but there is a difference. The first time I saw this film I couldn't think or speak for over an hour afterwards (still a record).The Theatrical version is the one to see, for me, because the director's cut, whilst it adds information, does not add anything artistically at the cost of 50 extra minutes. In either version, the final scene is still the pay-off of sublime beauty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic wonder that will put you under the spell!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are not yet infatuated with movies, this dazzling masterpiece will definitely sweep you off your feet, and who knows, perhaps, imbue you with love for the art of film for the rest of your life. Yes, yes, yes! The cinema paradise will play the same trick on you as it did on Salvatore, the main character, grabbing you and never letting you go.My own crush on movies grew into a strong and staunch feeling, the one that a seasoned admirer might have for an object of his long-time affection despite some random disappointments (e.g., Star Wars series). Nuovo Cinema Paradiso proved to me anew that your "watching" efforts of a loyal and a patient film viewer will always be rewarded with such cinematic gems, coming out now and then not from the cinematographer's vanity or greed, but from his heart.Incidentally, this cinematic paradise reminded me of another heavenly creative piece by Giuseppe Tornatore, - his newer film "La Legenda del pianista sull'oceano". Whatever imperfections some nit pickers might find in them, those two films share the same quality of being strikingly beautiful and extremely melodious, giving pleasure both to your eye and your ear. The harmony, which the director creates between the different film elements, disarms you completely, leaves you dazed some time after the last shots are over. Both films also have similar story structure: the events are unraveled as a string of reminiscences, prompted by some critical point, which usually forms the climax (usually, smth' or smb's demise) and brings about the end of a certain important period in the character's life (the one that most influenced the kind of personality the character has become when we first meet him in the film). This structure is by no means boring and, mastered skilfully by Tornatore, serves its purpose of showing the character's development very well.The paradisaical subterfuge of Tornatore's art is also such that the film manages to move you to the very deep of your heart without resorting to artificial sentimentalism or cheap pathetic. It just garners the quintessence of those little darling moments in real life and on screen that most of us cherish.Much to his credit, Tornatore has proved to us with this and his other films that he is a worthy heir to the Great Masters of the Golden Age in the Italian cinema: Fellini, Visconti, Rosselini. One man is not enough to start the Silver Age but can definitely be a national treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A celebration of what the movies were, are, and hopefully can be again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From beginning to end, Cinema Paradiso is, of course, about various forms of love, but my favorite element of the story is not just the way movies are portrayed, but the way old movies are portrayed. I have a particular fondness of older films (and a particular distaste for the shallow, exploitative and unimaginative garbage constantly cranked out by Hollywood these days), and one of the biggest themes of this film is the loss of purity and truth and innocence that movies once had.Obviously, I'm not talking about the glory days when kissing scenes were edited out of the projected version of a film, but the days when even a film that had the kissing and even minor, minor nudity scenes cut out of them would still draw a frantic crowd so eager to see films that they would sit for 30 minutes waiting for the second half the begin. Today, audiences would be up and asking for refunds within five minutes, and if there was no sex or explosions or car chases in the movie, many of them wouldn't be there in the first place, which is truly sad and is exactly what this movie rails against.I particularly loved the scene where Toto finally goes back home when he learns about the death of Alfredo (which would have been a spoiler, except that you learn of Alfredo's death within the first five or ten minutes of the movie), and his mother tells him that just before he died, Alfredo asked her not to tell Toto, not to ask him to come back. In the next scene Toto is walking through the ruins of the Cinema Paradiso and sees how cruel time has been to it and, even worse, how cheap and derivative the movies have become that are now played there.Alfredo didn't want Toto to come back because he saw what movies were becoming, and that is a direct message to the film industry the likes of which has never been seen like this. Cinema Paradiso owns that message, and it's one of my favorite lessons about film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CINEMA PARADISO: THE NEW VERSION / Italia 2002 (3.5 STARS)November 2003: While I agree that the New version does bring about the closure that the original lacked I feel that some of the magic of the film is lost with the telling of the whole story - I therefore prefer the original version for the way it tugged at the heartstrings in the face of an unknown and lost world. . Mise-en-scene: It was delightful to watch Toto in scenes that were new - I had grown so fond of him that watching him in new situations was like bringing alive a now dead character and seeing him do things he hadn't ever done. . I didn't enjoy the sex scenes - they took away from the nostalgia and the innocence of the flashback - may be this is cultural but I thought the original suggestions/subtlety was better than the explicit display. . It was heart-wrenching to see Toto's girl as an old lady - the irony of how they missed each other was very moving. However the old lady didn't quite have the charm of the young girl - and her character lacked the same conviction - though her lovemaking was a bold move given her place in life. . The part where the narrative was furthered compellingly was in the director's revealing to us just what an impact Alfredo had had on Toto, when he chose to separate the two lovers - the impact of that decision ultimately made the difference to Toto's life . I preferred the Old version for Toto's old character - he spoke less, was more reflective, had more aura. While the latest version makes him more human, and we can better understand his character, I feel that in sharing his vulnerabilities the director also makes him more common-place - the old guy was almost mystical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was around eight my dad said, honey I want you to see this movie. My father has always been a diehard film fan and made one out of me. We watched Cinema paradiso and at the end I told my father that I wanted to work in films. More than a decade later I am a senior in film studies. The beauty of Cinema Paradiso is that it rings true on so many levels. It manages to be sweet and touching without being saccharine, it is sincere. The story of a young boy growing up with facism and without a father. He finds a father figure in a cranky projectionist. In it's essence this is a film about the power of films. It also touches on the fact that in life we have to give some things up to achieve others. Cinema Paradiso hasone of the greatest endings in any film, a beautiful montage of light and film imagery. To this day it grabs something in my soul and lifts it. This is a film for parents to watch with children, friends to show each other and lovers to bond over. One of the great bittersweet coming of age stories. This film was my father's greatest gift to me. If you enjoy Cinema Paradiso check out Medditerranio and Bread and Tulips.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cinema ParadisoWhat a wonderful movie. With a taste for Early 50's Italy, small town life is seen honestly through a young boy named Toto. His father, off to war for so long, is unknown to him. His mother is stressfully attempting to raise him.Escape is found through the movies and the mentorship of the local cinema projectionist, Alfredo.Life becomes a relentless pursuit of film, both in technical production, and love of the art.Characters ranging from the local mentally challenged Denizen who warns all that this is `my square', to the priest who plays so central a role to daily life, he is the town censor. Pepper the landscape with other characters who reward us with laughter and depth of feeling and you have an idea of this film.Alfredo is the heart of the movie. The scruffy projectionist, without child, who becomes both teacher, and guidance councilor to the young waif Toto. The movie moves thru various stages of Toto and Alfredo's life, greeting both tragedy and comedy with equal aplomb.This is a sure winner for those willing to enjoy an Italian film made with grace and sincerity.Sit back and enjoy a sure winner!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'm a bit of a sucker for sentimental films, but in my eyes this has something extra. First time around, this film was a wonderful experience. The whole film very gradually works towards a final scene which pushed all the right buttons and had me in tears (as those of you who know the film [and me] may well expect). Now, I can understand why some people might think that this film is engineered for the effect of the last scene but, for me, its wonder lies in repeat viewing. This film is about nostalgia. It can be felt reliving Toto's childhood on each viewing. Together with the characters ("the square is mine!"), the familiarity of the Sicilian village, and the evocative music score, the film improves each time I watch it. It's difficult to describe just how involved you become in such an uneventful (plot-wise) film. But it isn't about the plot - it's about the experience. Give it a try and become part of it.</fullReview>

I once worked in an old movie theater, and I found myself at times finding secret places within it, where things had been hidden or stored. It was a magical place.

It adds to the charm already so inherent in this wonderful masterpiece of story-telling.Here is the deceptively simple plot: Boy loves movies, Boy idolizes old man, Boy loves girl, Boy leaves home, Boy returns.Oh, but what happens in between those lines will leave your heart captivated for a long time. Let me not leave Morricone's finest musical score. The music will remain in your mind and heart long after - if you heart it again - the entire movie comes back to you and dare I say - you will cry once more at the poignancy of this movie.The last scene has been called many things - but as far as I am concerned - that last scene is the most touching ending I have seen in many a year. Just writing about it now - well...you know what I mean: there is a lump in throat and the room suddenly appears misty.Go see it, Go rent it, Go buy it! You will never forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magical celebration of cinema, love and growing up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso is a powerful and touching tale of a man losing himself in the tales projected on the big screen in his village theatre. It is through immersing himself in those flickering images that Toto discovers his destiny and then plunges headlong towards it encouraged by the wonderful Alfredo. The movie makes one realize how the cinematic medium can lift you beyond the platitudes of life into a realm of glorious impossibilities. It can make you dream impossible dreams and mayhaps even make you reach towards them, especially if you have a mentor like Alfredo.The movie has a wonderful subplot about Toto discovering love. The desperation of claiming your love, the wrenching agony of thinking you have lost her, and the heights of ecstasy to hold her - they are all portrayed beautifully. But in the end, Alfredo makes Toto realize that he has to flee this small backwater and make his destiny in Rome which is what he does. But his small village calls him back to attend Alfredo's funeral and come face-to-face with his past. As Toto lowers Alfredo's coffin into the grave, as Toto watches the womb he grew up in - the Cinema Paradiso - come down in a heap of rubble, he loses a cherished part of himself that he knows he cannot find in all the success and all the women "whose voices do not have love in them". In fine, Cinema Paradiso is an enchanting celebration of the world of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing I liked most in this Italian production is its sincerity. A grown man (Toto) looks back on his childhood he spent in a peaceful little village in southern Italy. We can see young Toto growing up without his father. Alfredo (the local cinema operator) watches over Toto and provides him with advice in love and life. The phases in life we all go through allow us to relate easily to the young Italian struggling while growing up. The score by Ennio Morricone could not have been more breathtaking. The changes from happiness to grief and from joy to pain are accompanied with exactly the appropriate sounds. The movie succeeds in dealing with issues like: hope, yearning, disapointment, love and loss without being sentimental. For me without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most gratifying piece of film making I have ever seen, "Paradiso" is one of the few films that I can watch time and again. Director Tornatore brings a passion to the film which seeps out of every frame and invites the viewer to revisit their youth, their hopes, their dreams and the crushing truth of reality. You will not see a more beautiful, haunting film than this. Phillipe Noiret gives the performance of his life (one which he played a subtle riff on in " Il Postino") and Ennio Morricone's score ranks right up there as his best. For true junkies like myself I would highly recommend getting a hold of the director's cut in which an additional 50 minutes of material is added. While as a whole it is not as good a movie (Tornatore clearly needed a forceful editor) it does provide insight into what happeneed to Toto's beloved Elena and surprises viewers with a heart-wrenching plot twist which was cut from the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Passion exuberance in every frame of the film. A rarity and a great tribute to cinema itself.When love, passion and intelligence come together a genius is made and precisely Cinema Paradiso is that. Giuseppe Tornatore is a genius too. This is just his second feature film and he does an exemplary job. The nuances of a child from helping friends to learning things, growing up as juvenile and falling in love, then as a man who does his own thing. The life of a person is shown beautifully with wonderful fine moments. I love the scene in which Alfredo tells him not to trust a blue-eyed woman and how he uses a dialog from an old film is wonderful. From Keaton to Chaplin to Clark Gable to many more. There are wonderful references. The aficionados will love this as there are many montages of the good old films. The genius lies in a scene where the frame of the pass through the walls of the projection room and the film is showed on a wall of a street. Wonderful thing that and hats off to the writer director Tornatore for that.I must specially mention Ennio Morricone and his score. What music does, we all know it adds up life in a bland moment. It adds emotions, it reflects emotions, it fills silences. Ennio Moricone does it all and more he adds life to movie itself and how much ever I praise Morricone, it would be less by all means.The acting is fine be it of Alfredo, the projectionist played by Philippe Noiret, Salvatore Di Vita (child) played by Salvatore Cascio or a host of others. The boy and Alfredo have a charming chemistry which is wonderful, it gives a smile and at times there are feelings echoed my own of the way I respected my childhood teachers.A word about Giuseppe Tornatore, he really knows how to show kids and adolescents in the film. The earlier film I watched of his, Malena too had shown adolescent feelings wonderfully and here too, he knows how wonderful a kid can be and precisely depicts that with even more sensitivity. Kudos to him for that and I shall be indebted for him in many ways to have made two of my favorite films. This one and Malena.To all the film lovers, this is a must watch film and one of those that you must surely watch before I pass away. I am lucky to watch this and wish there shall be many more lucky ones. A 5/5 for this, one of the greatest films ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those of us whose lives have been enriched by those magic moments we have spent in a theater can delight in this beautiful story of a man and a boy that loved movies. The fantasy medium that allows to escape into other places, other cultures, is the subject of this wonderful picture from Italy. Nuovo cinema Paradiso" takes a view at two people so different, yet so alike, because their love for this type of entertainment.The story of Toto, a young boy who loves to escape to the local movie palace and his relationship with Alfredo, his friend, and mentor, is one of the most beautiful films that have come from Italy in recent memory. We watched the film when it first opened in New York, and were lucky enough to renew our joyous experience not long ago when a friend lent us a copy on DVD format.Giuseppe Tornatore, the director, created a film that will never die as long as there are fans for pictures such as this one. The story about the golden days, not only of Hollywood, but the Italian cinema after WWII is captured in vivid detail. The casting proved also to be a lucky break for the director. Phillipe Noiret, one of the best actors of his generation makes a wonderful Alfredo. Salvatore Cascio steals the heart of the viewer just by being himself. The legendary Leopoldo Trieste appears as the priest who censures any picture that will show at the Paradiso. It was a joy to revisit an old friend!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was beginning to lose faith in humanity. Many of the films I had seen in recent times were so badly conceived that I was beginning to lose my passion for film.I had heard about Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, because it was on people's favourite movie lists, and was a top IMDb film. When I saw it on sale, I bought it, and that's when it all happened. I fell in love with cinema again.I'm not going to go into the details of the many characters and situations in this film. Suffice it to say, it is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. I have the largest film collection of anyone I know, and this film is without a doubt in my top ten. It is full of love, nostalgia and beauty.Both versions of this film are great, but angle the overall piece in different ways. The extended version (director's cut) concentrates a lot on the aftermath of the love story, and is essential viewing for anyone who loves this film. You can easily fall in love with this film watching the shortened version only, however.Overall, I am back in love with cinema, and this incredible film is the one and only reason for this. The word "masterpiece" was created for this movie.</fullReview>

The casting also helps, the 3 Totos are dead-on and Noiret stand out,beautifully supported by the rest of the cast.Needless to say that I cried at the end,and I'm not usually emotional.Fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warm, nostalgic, funny, moving. Deserves its reputation. (suggestive spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I am not giving up on watching brainless rubbish, I have recently been making a lot more effort to make sure I re-watch a lot of "classics" that I have not seen for decades and thus not written any thoughts down on them for my own benefit. Doing this has seen me change my opinion on a film because I realise that I am speaking from accepted wisdom ? not firsthand experience. I could not remember Cinema Paradiso and maybe I have never seen it but just remember the bits I remember from the fact that everyone has seen them, whether they have seen the film or not. However, whether watching it or re-watching it, I found myself instantly caught up in the energy and colours of the film as we jump back to the boy Toto starting his father/son friendship with Alfredo and his love of the cinema. This part of the film is hard not to love as it is funny and full of life ? I hate to use national stereotypes but, let's be honest, it is very "Italian" (in a good way).That this works is important because, to make the second, teenage, phase of the film work, the audience needs to share the passion of the characters and to care about them, so it is key that we are won over. Whenever the film enters into the teenage and adult stages of the story, I will say that the gear change is slightly jarring, even in the three hour director's cut that I was fortunate enough to be able to watch. It is here that the film gets more serious but, despite my initial concerns when the change comes, it doesn't do anything different in terms of quality because it stays high. What it does do is build on the warmth we already feel for Toto and those in his life by bringing in the challenges and changes that teenage life brings. Not even a slightly weak turn from Leonardi can hurt it as it moves forward. The look at the formative years comes full circle with the adult phase to the film as we get to look back and understand things with the 20:20 of hindsight and it is responsible and moving. The final gift from Alfredo is memorable and moving and is one of those scenes that everyone knows, even if they haven't seen the film! What helps make this film work for film fans is obviously that the "device" that serves as the base for this tale of development and growth happens to be cinema (although it could easily have been anything). The sense of nostalgia in regards the magic of the cinematic experience is something that will unsurprisingly appeal to many people who still use IMDb despite being in their thirties and at a point where they should probably be spending their time doing something better. I loved the way the film captured this as a specific but also the way it used it within the story to make sure we can relate and understand the importance of it. In regards the media of cinema, I will repeat others by saying what a great job as director Tornatore did. The film has plenty of great shots but also the warmth you feel as a viewer is also somehow visually there as well ? I cannot describe it but I loved the way the film looked.The cast make it and, although he is technically a supporting character, Noiret is large over the film with a great performance of warmth and wisdom. OK he is slightly idealised in terms of the film, but it is carried by the general sense of warmth and nostalgia and thus forgivable. He works particularly well with Cascio, who is cute and funny enough to avoid falling into a condition I like to call Culkinism ? which is the state where a child actor pushes for cuteness and loses naturalism and gains a saccharine precociousness instead. Cascio is really well directed in the film and he is an engaging and lively child. Leonardi is not as good but in fairness he has the hardest job of the three actors and he manages to make it work; perhaps what I took as stiffness was just part of him being a teenager ? not the best stage in life for confidence and flowing naturalism! Perrin is a solid presence to draw the film to a close and he is helped by the level of engagement we have in his character by the time we properly reached his parts. The support cast provide a lot of the comedy and have too many great characters to mention and, although they are often broadly painted, this again fits the tone of the film.Cinema Paradiso is one of those films that you are supposed to have seen because it is a "classic" and frequently makes people's "best of" lists, however this is not necessarily a guarantee that you will enjoy the film or see what others see ? sometimes films have just managed to get reputations they do not really deserve. In this case though it is very much deserved as the film is a warm and moving joy; delivered in a typically "Italian" fashion it is as cheerful as it is cheering and I find it hard to imagine that some would think this was not a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Word: "Beautiful"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guiseppe Tornatore's 1988 foreign language classic "Cinema Paradiso" reigns in my mind to be the finest film ever made. The movie itself is a love story to cinema while serving as a memory of a time when going to the movies was a big deal. The film offers a collection of memorable characters of the Sicilian town of Giancaldo while focusing mainly on the relationship of theater projectionist Alfredo and Salvatore whom he calls Toto.The film opens with Salvatore learning Alfredo has died. He begins to reminisce about him and we are introduced to a nine year old Toto, being something of a thorn in Alfredo's side at the theater when he visits the projectionist booth during the town priest's regular screenings to cut out objectionable material, which just so happens to be any form of kissing. Here, Toto and Alfredo's relationship begins and later expands to a point when the nine year old learns to project. Having been surrounded by movies for a good portion of his life, Alfredo, being the Dumbledore to Harry, the Gandalf to Frodo, instills his wisdom into Toto using the movies- quoting American legends. When a tragedy leaves Alfredo blind the theater destroyed, Toto becomes the new projectionist when the "nuovo Cinema paradiso" opens.The film transitions to a 18 or 19 year old Salvatore, still called Toto by some of the townspeople. Alfredo is still there, but has stepped back from the projection booth, and instead becomes Toto's mentor. When Toto falls in love with Elena, in what becomes the most beautiful love story ever told on screen, Alfredo guides Salvatore in his effort to conquer her heart. The love story unfolds gracefully and becomes a pleasure to be engrossed in, but it ends abruptly and mysteriously. In the director's cut, it is learned the relationship was ended by a third party, in what he considered to be an act of love for Toto. Soon after, Toto leaves for Rome with advice from Alfredo to never come back and that if he does, not to visit him, he won't let him in. The film transitions to the third act after this.We find out Salvatore is now a famous film director and has come back to Giancaldo for the first time in 30 years for the funeral. During his visit, he finds out the Cinema Paradiso is to be demolished in a couple of days to make way for a new parking lot, almost as if the upcoming demolition was the last nail in Alfredo's coffin. After the funeral, Mr. Da Vita, as he is now called by the townspeople except for his mother, sister, former boss, and Signora Anna, at his insistence, he visits Signora Anna, Alfredo's widow who reveals to him that Alfredo loved him as a son and was very proud of his accomplishments. There, she gives him a film reel from Alfredo.In the final scene in what is presumed to be his screening room, Salvatore asks his projectionist to load the film and play it. In one of the most memorable montages in film history, Toto discovers the film is a compilation of all the "obscene" kissing Alfredo was forced to cut from the movies when he was the projectionist. Salvatore sits there, in his seat, tears streaming down his face, and realizes this to be the most profound act of love he has ever seen. The reel finished with a "Fine" and the credits start to roll, ending the finest film ever made.My props go to Tornatore for his excellent direction, particularly notable in the theater scenes. His screenplay manages to honor the movies with sentimentality, but he doesn't overdo it- it never becomes sappy and melodramatic. But my highest praise goes to legendary composer Ennio Morricone for what is the greatest score ever written. The music is able to instill in the viewers senses of pain, love, happiness, and every other emotion one is to feel throughout this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautiful film that celebrates life,love and the magic of cinema. I just watched the original version on TCM, and loved every minute of it. There were no scenes that dragged (for me), and the subtitles did not distract me from the wonderful camera work and cinematography which sometimes happens to me with foreign language films. No repeated viewings are needed to understand and enjoy this film. Robert Osbourne of Turner Classic Movies spoke of the new version that is available with over 50 minutes of added footage, but said that he thought that this is one film where added footage did not improve on the original, though he left it to the viewers to decide for themselves by watching them as they are both available on DVD. I for one can not see how this film could possibly be improved upon,but I will of course have to see for myself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film touched my very heart and soul from the very beginning to the end. As a young boy I went to the movie theater with my Mom every Friday afternoon at the Lefferts Theater on Liberty Ave., in Richmond Hill, N.Y. and grew to love all the films just as the young boy in this film. It is very easy to see why this film received so much wonderful praise and awards. There was plenty of funny comedy when the Roman Catholic Priest censored all the films shown in the theater that showed any form of kissing or physical contact between a male or female. It was a great down to earth film which words cannot describe fully, and can only be appreciated by people who love to escape into the World of Film and stories. The Actors, Producers and Directors out did themselves with this great masterpiece of JOY.

		<fullReview>This is a lovely, sensitive film which evokes a variety of emotions, leaving the viewer with a sort of satisfied exhaustion, like after a good session of yard work. Its focus is the power of love to shape our lives over the long term. The protagonist's passion for the cinema and his youthful immersion in "first love" are intertwined, and become mutual symbols each for the other. What constitutes success and what failure? What is or must be sacrificed to achieve our goals, and how are we to know in advance which life goals will prove worthy and enduring? All these dilemmas move beneath the surface of an engaging tale, but without detracting from its drama. Let me point out too an important word of warning that may be missed: When an adult's help and guidance of a young person, no matter how lovingly offered, crosses the line to making decisions for them without their knowledge or consent, the consequence often may be suffering for which no one would have wished.</fullReview>

I wanted it to validate my own love of escapism, so wonderfully woven by incredibly directors who take us to such wonderful places that even our imagination couldn't have dreamed of. With such a grandiose name, the (lack of) family, village square, theater and boorish patrons fell short of endearing and, at times, fell short on many levels. Meaningful bits went on too long carried to 1970's made for TV levels by a overindulgent soundtrack. The actors played their parts, but with such inconsistent overdubbing, I felt for none of them. Yes the boy and projectionist bit was sweet, but not enough to carry the film. The older Totos' added no depth to the little boy. Conceptually nice and the scenes reenacting the crowds reaction to the theater and its limitations worked even if they were crude, but did we find a way to connect to movies as a character. I don't believe it was introduced until the final scene evidenced the character shunned from them by the church and I just couldn't relate, just like the film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First half is great, but that's it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Italian motion picture achieved notorious fame, comparable to the equally famous and more recent Italian movie 'La Vita ? Bella'.Like that one, this one is also very good in its first half, but after that it becomes a movie of bad taste. That's really too bad, because this movie (and 'La Vita ? Bella') had potential to be something big.'Nuovo Cinema Paradiso' can be considered a homage both to cinema and films. It shows us the pinnacle of the cinema as an industry of entertainment and as an escape for those who go there to watch the movies, making them forget the hard reality of poverty and war. Besides the cinema's success, it also shows its progress, its bankrupt, its decadence and its sad ending.This is a very simple film. However, simplicity doesn't necessary mean something bad. Plus, the brilliant and memorable soundtrack by Ennio Morricone adds lots of emotion to the film, particularly in its first half, which is without a doubt the best part of the movie.One of the biggest charms of this movie is the fascination and enthusiasm of Salvatore (whose nickname is "Toto") on the cinema and the projectionist job. He wins the friendship of the local projectionist, Alfredo, who also teaches him all about that job. As you can tell, "Toto" is a very intelligent kid and a very quick learner. Plus, he is mischievous, cute and hilarious.Of course, even the first half has its minor faults, such as the pranks of bad taste - for example, that pig who spits to the audience and the prank with a bug on the sleepy guy. Pranks aside, I also don't like at times the behavior of Salvatore's mother: she slaps him a number of times.As for the good of the first half, well, just about most of it. And this without forgetting Salvatore's dumb classmate. He's a poor dumb kid who doesn't know what 5x5 is. Whenever he answers that question is hilarious, as each answer is dumber than the previous one. In the 3rd time, he goes as far as replying «Natale!» (which is "Christmas" in Italian) - when he said that, I practically died of laughter!As for the 2nd half of the movie, most of it is wrong and seems quite rushed and forced. Salvatore is no longer charming as a grown up. The love story between Salvatore and the girl of his dreams is frustrating in all ways, not to mention that it's ridiculous that Salvatore spends entire months waiting for her to open the window as a sign that she fell in love for him. There is no comedy or charm as in the 1st half. An animal is stabbed. Salvatore joins the army. And Alfredo's attitude later is puzzling: forcing Salvatore to leave that town forever, never look back, never return (not even to visit, going as far as saying that if he returns he won't receive him in his house), never let nostalgia hit him and never to even write or think about them.I clearly prefer "Toto" as a child than as a teen or as an adult. "Toto" is far more charming as a child. In fact, the moment he grows up, for some reason the movie looses its initial greatness.Phillipe Noiret gives a great performance as Alfredo, but little Salvatore Cascio steals the show as little "Toto".I never saw the Director's Cut version. And frankly, I've got no interest in watching it. It's about 30 minutes longer, making it a too long movie and it certainly makes one view the film differently, as many of the mysteries are revealed (which might not be a very good idea). I saw the shorter version which isn't even that short, as it is nearly 2 hours long. But I can handle a movie of 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>heard great things about this film, but</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard great things about this film and never would have watched it, but it came highly recommended. I did enjoy the film, but I watched the directors cut which was close to pushing 3 hours. I am not sure what got added, but I think a lot of the films power was lost with additional scenes that slowed the pace down. I loved the idea and I got the message, but I just did not feel it at the end. There were scenes that I loved and they made me smile and there are some great lines, but in the end I did not feel that it was terribly inventive and did not create that sense of awe and love that I have for cinema. I loved the scene when Elena comes back during the showing of the movie in the outdoor cinema and it starts raining. It was cliché, but it worked and was perfect for the movie. It has always been hard for me to enjoy movies about the love of movies because I feels as if few of them can capture the emotion that we as viewers derive from movies. I think part of the reason I missed some of the movie was it was only recently that I really started enjoying movies. Growing up I did not really look forward to watching them and they were nothing special. The love story aspect of the movie was weak in my opinion and did not need to be fleshed out as much as it was. I would have liked to have imagined that they just missed each other and not it told me exactly how it happened. I also guess I did not agree with Alfredo's idea that he could never return and that Toto was bound for greatness and that could only be achieved with a complete separation from his roots. Going back and revisiting the past at an early point of his life might have brought Toto more closure, I know it did for me. I know this movie is rated really high in the all time list and I am not sure if I agree with it, but I don't think I saw the version that most people voted for. Also I think I was lost on the fact that I did not know any of the movies that were shown in the theater at any point, which is in a way sad to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Affecting, Romanticized View of Cinema in a Sicilian Village</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this on DVD just now, I had not seen director/screenwriter Giuseppe Tornatore's internationally renowned hit movie - at least the 123-minute version - since its initial 1990 release in the U.S., but I remember having mixed feelings that ran the gamut between being moved by its genuine poignancy and being resentful about what I felt at the time was its shameless heartstring tugging. Nearly two decades later, as I have gotten older and closer to the adult Salvatore's age, I have softened considerably in my opinion of the film, an open-hearted tribute to cinema and its transcendent impact on people's lives. Granted it is awash in sentimentality, but with its unique combination of storytelling elements inspired in equal parts by Chaplin and Fellini, there is a burnished, nostalgic glow to the whole venture as most of it is designed as a flashback.The plot begins with Salvatore ensconced in middle age as a successful film director based in Rome. Unexpectedly, he makes plans to return to his hometown in Sicily for the first time in almost thirty years. The reason is two-fold: the funeral of Alfredo, the projectionist who first introduced Salvatore to films, and the demolition of the Cinema Paradiso theater where they showed films to the enthusiastic denizens every Saturday night. This triggers memories of Salvatore's childhood at the old theater with Alfredo and then his adolescence and young adulthood when he falls in love with a beautiful local girl named Elena. In true Romeo and Juliet fashion, he is separated from his one true love by her disapproving father, a wealthy banker, and I have to admit this is the part of the film I still find a bit predictable with Tornatore's Baroque sense of romanticism in high gear. The scenes that really have enduring impact are those between the young, energetic Salvatore, nicknamed "Toto", and the surly but lovable Alfredo. Tornatore captures the magical bond between the two, including a tragic episode that forces them to reverse their roles in the projection room.Interestingly, the 174-minute version presented on the second disc of the 2006 two-DVD set fills in the blanks about Elena's fate. The older Salvatore is reunited with Elena and finds out the truth behind their separation. While I enjoyed and appreciated the longer director's cut, I feel overall the additional scenes don't add as much dimension to the story as the nearly three-hour running time warrants. I think my preference for the heartwarming Alfredo-Toto scenes gravitate me more toward the 123-minute version presented on the first disc. The central performances are memorable with the obvious standouts being Phillipe Noiret (Il Postino) as Alfredo and cherubic Salvatore Cascio as Toto. Looking like a Neapolitan Josh Hartnett, Marco Leonardi (Like Water for Chocolate) takes over as Toto and brings youthful, hormonally-driven fervor to the role, and Agnese Nano brings the requisite dreamy quality to Elena.As the older Salvatore, Jacques Perrin (Z, The Young Girls of Rochefort) bears so little resemblance to his younger counterparts that his performance feels somewhat removed. In the longer version, his performance resonates more, especially as he shares the screen with Brigitte Fossey (Forbidden Games) as the older Elena. The famous screening room ending is in both versions - the showing of Alfredo's gift to Salvatore, a reel of film clips highlighting kissing scenes excised by the local priest - though I find just as touching the theater demolition scene with the now-aged villagers looking on in a most resigned manner. Blasco Giurato's cinematography is stunning throughout, and enough cannot be said of Ennio Morricone's memorable music score, one of cinema's most beautiful in evoking the movies aura of romantic nostalgia.Beyond the director's cut of the movie, the 2006 Limited Collector's Edition DVD has several extras of note, the best being an informative, somewhat academic commentary track from Italian film historian Millicent Marcus interspersed with periodic personal recollections from Tornatore, as well as a fifteen-minute retrospective featurette, "Exploring a Timeless Classic". Of more anecdotal interest are a four-minute short on how Baltimore's Little Italy neighborhood has embraced the film with an annual outdoor showing encouraging more than a few romances; two theatrical trailers - the original and the director's cut released in 2002; and most inconsequentially, a Food Network show with Napa chef Michael Chiarello with recipes inspired by the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exquisite nostalgia that any movie fan can identify with...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a difficult film to describe in words because all of it is heartfelt emotion. However, it must be noted that the three central performances are beyond reproach: the child Salvatore (played with rascally charm by Salvatore Cascio), the brusque projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) and the adolescent Salvatore (Marco Leonardi). All three are masterful in creating the viewer's emotional attachment to these characters. The relationship between the tough but tender projectionist and the little boy is what carries the first half of the film and it continues when the boy becomes a lovesick adolescent. It is only the last half of the film that seems to drag a little with scenes of the adult Salvatore (Jacques Perrin)contemplating returning to the little village where he grew up in the shadows of the movie theater and those wonderful silver shadows on the screen.All of the scenes involving the movie theater and its rowdy audiences are wonderfully realized with crude humor and insight into the kind of characters who thrived on whatever entertainment films could offer. Ennio Morriconne's music is charming throughout, always totally in keeping with the images on screen and the intentions of the story.By all means, well worth seeing and treasuring as one of the great foreign films to come out of the 1980s. I watched the abbreviated version on TCM which comes to a little more than two hours and is the version shown in the U.S. theatrically.</fullReview>

Well, once again I'm so convinced that this is what outstanding movie making is all about. You name it: excellent performances of all the cast, impeccable cinematography and editing, amazing soundtrack, ideal use of flashbacks and story telling ... and I could keep on naming all the variables and every one of them is better and gets better with time. I wish Tornatore did more films because he's really one of the best directors in the world. I won't reveal any part of the story, even though the film was released in 1989.

		<fullReview>By the end of this tribute to the movies, there shouldn't be a dry eye in the house. "Paradiso" is a beautiful film, a movie that takes a simple story of a very special couple of people and explores how the most intense emotions in life shape the best films, and how censoring our dreams can lead to incomplete existences.Watching Toto grow up from an innocent who is drawn to the movies, though he might not be able to express the reasons why. As the film continues, Salvatore's life takes unexpected turns, some of which leave him emotionally scarred for life.The film moves along nicely, giving us very rich performances, a solid story line, and one of the most wonderful music scores to ever compliment a film. If there ever was a true gem of cinema, here it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What words can possibly be added that have not been written 100 times before. If you have not seen this movie then no words can do it justice. If you have seen this movie than you know it's beyond words. This movie speaks to each viewer in a silent language. A language that only one film in every decade or two speaks. A language that stirs your soul and causes you to re-examine your own life and your goals. A language that is universal across all races and countries. It speaks to that part of you that you rarely show or share with anyone other than yourself. It speaks of loves lost, loves found and loves yet discovered. It speaks to the creative part of you that instinctively knows that doing something without passion and intense love is not worth it no matter the reward.It's a shame that this film had to be butchered down to 2 hours just so American audience's notoriously short attention spans would not be tested. There is only one true Cinema Paradiso. That is the 3 hour version originally released in Europe.That said, I would recommend anyone new to this movie to watch the 2 hour American version first. Then settle back and get ready for the ride of your life by watching the 3 hour original version as the director intended you to see it. If you do not speak Italian use the sub-titles. Do not however replace the Italian with any dubbed version. That will kill it. The Italian voice inflections are what makes this film a poem translated magically to the screen.How long would you search for your passion until you gave up? How empty would your life be without that passion? Could another passion ever take the place of the original passion? Slip this DVD in your player, turn the lights down low and discover for yourself the magic of an all consuming passion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching story and at the same time technically brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest I've ever seen, Tornatore pulls off masterfully a movie which is technically brilliant and at the same time pulls at the viewers heartstrings! Viva La Tornatore! Grande! Later Tornatore directed MALENA, it is also a great movie, but it never reaches the greatness achieved by CINEMA PARADISO. The movie shows the diverse nature of the crowd present at a movie theater, people in all kinds of moods, as Roger Ebert said,"Romances are launched in the darkness of the theater, friendships are sealed, wine is drunk, cigarettes smoked, babies nursed, feet stomped, victories cheered, sissies whistled at..."! The movie sometimes reminds us of Fellini, especially when in the long shots someone suddenly appears in close up. Like Truffuat, Tornatore gives a special place to posters in this movie. 'This film captures the essence of a man's life, gently bringing us from childhood to middle age believably and beautifully.' There is a presence of warmth and humor in the movie, from the fainting lottery winner to the zealous censorious priest, and the madman who goes on saying, "This square is mine"! It is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes poignant but it's always warm, wonderful, and satisfying. It is one of a kind. Salvatore is present in all of us. And when Alfredo says, "Living here day by day, you think it's the center of the world. You believe nothing will ever change. Then you leave: a year, two years. When you come back, everything's changed. The thread's broken. What you came to find isn't there. What was yours is gone. You have to go away for a long time... many years... before you can come back and find your people. The land where you were born. But now, no. It's not possible. Right now you're blinder than I am." --- it applies to all of us on a universal level. And the music? It is brilliant, romantic and never fails to touch the heart, kudos to Ennio Morricone. The movie is perfect, beautiful and to describe in one word: BELLISSIMA!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Cinema Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few days ago, I watched the "Director's Cut" version of the film that the critics have called "a gift to the the admirers of movie and cinema" for the first time. And I can already tell that this is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. It's a well-known film that was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscar Academy-awards, and won the Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1989. But it's not a very long time since I heard about it for the first time, and when I read that Ennio Morricone made the music for the film...that's when it really attracted me.We follow a man by the name of Salvatore through his life, and it begins with his childhood, when he used to spend his time at the local cinema, admiring the projectionist Alfredo. Salvatore's dream was to become a projectionist of his own some day. Later in his teens, we meet his first and biggest love...Elena. This girl was going to change his life..."Cinema Paradiso" is truly a film to be appreciated by film-lovers like me, and a film that I feel I should have seen a long time ago. It is full of beautiful scenes and moments that I almost can't wait to see again. It never bored me, and the characters went straight into my heart. All of the actors in this film did a very good job, but the ones who caught the most of my attention were Phillipe Noiret in his role as Alfredo and the charming Salvatore Cascio who played Salvatore as a little kid. Giuseppe Tornatore's script and directing were also well done, and it is always a joy to watch pictures from the beautiful country of Italy.Ennio Morricone's score never let me down either, and hit me right from the beginning of. I haven't got the chance to fully see any of Sergio Leone's Spaghetti-Westerns yet, but I have seen Leone's Gangster-Epic "Once Upon A Time In America" (1984), which is one of my favorite movies. The music Ennio Morricone made for that film is probably the best film-score I've ever heard. In "Cinema..." he once again makes some beautiful, seductive and unforgettable music, and it really helps to set the mood through out the whole film.What lets me down in this movie, is the last part of it. ***Spoilers Following*** After watching the childhood and teens of Salvatore, the part when he's a grown man comes. He returns to his native village as a successful film-director to take part in Alfredo's funeral, and he is also reunited with Elena. ***End Of Spoilers*** Even though it contains some scenes of good directing and is very interesting to watch, I didn't feel like this part was THAT necessary. And except for a few details, that's the only reason why the film didn't give me the "Top Rated Masterpiece" feeling. I've read that this part has been cut out in the regular shorter version of the film, so maybe the Director's Cut version wasn't the right one for me. But I'm definitely going to purchase this movie and add it to my DVD-collection, and maybe I'll go for the regular and not the director's version.But no matter which version, Giuseppe Tornatore's "Cinema Paradiso" is a highly enjoyable film that I know I will be watching many times for the rest of my life. It has numerous of memorable scenes and lines, and the film's theme is to remind us about the appreciation of cinema and film-watching. You'll laugh and you'll cry while watching it, and in the end you'll be thankful that films like this has been made.9.0 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>superb art-house movie about the movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Cinema Paradiso', in both its versions, is a wonderful movie all about movies, the love of the movies, movie images, and movie influences. It is also about growing up, friendship, young love, regret, and the pursuit of happiness.We follow Salvatore (Toto) from being a young child, eyes wide with wonder at the world projected on the big screen, through his hesitant adolescence, to adulthood as a successful film-maker in his own right. Playing Toto at the three stages of his life are two outstanding actors: Salvatore Cascio as the child, and Jacques Perrin as the adult still searching for the missing piece of his life's puzzle. The teenage Toto is portrayed less well, by Marco Leonardi, perhaps because of his lack of screen time - although there is one sequence in particular concerning his character and that of Elisa which stands out.Also in the cast is the excellent Philippe Noiret as Alfredo, the cinema projectionist who becomes the sage, the wise voice of reason within Toto's life.For me, though, the best sequences are the ones which take place within the Cinema Paradiso - the snatches of famous films which play before us, the reactions of the audience, the whole ambience of a little flea pit. And the famous final montage with the screen kisses is superb. The extended version of 'Cinema Paradiso' puts back around an hour, mainly concerning Toto and Elisa on his return to the village after many years. This is interesting, but the short version packs a considerable punch too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This ranks as one of my all time favourites. A celebration of the cinema and of life, Cinema Paradiso is beautifully crafted and one of those rare few that manages to touch on so many global themes (while lesser films struggle to find any theme). A coming of age film about (among other things) friendship, family, love, loss, war, religion, and politics, set against the rugged beauty of the Sicilian countryside, Paradiso transports the viewer effortlessly to that place, as if we had lived there all our lives. Like Hallstrom's "My Life As A Dog" and Robert's "My Fathers Glory", Tornatore has surrounded his protagonist with quirky characters in perfect balance; i.e. the kinds of people-you-know, and people-you'd-like-to-know. This alone makes it the type of universally transferable movie everyone can enjoy. But for me, the masterstroke was Toto's love of movies. This added another more subtle level to an already well rounded flick. Of course the Paradiso was a metaphor for change/progress, a symbol of community spirit, etc. However, to try and analyze this film too much would be doing it a supreme injustice. It is simply a beautiful piece of cinematic history, a film for all true movie-lovers.</fullReview>

It's irony that this new version was actually the `original' version. However, I feel lucky that I actually saw the shorter version first. The shorter version is very tender and sweet, the longer version is rather dreadful and not convincing. I strongly recommend everybody to watch the shorter version first before you go to see this `new' release.My vote: 10 out of 10 for the 123 min shorter version; 7 out of 10 for the 170 min (2002 US) release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arguably the best foreign language film and definitely one of the greatest films of all time, "Cinema Paradiso" was quietly ignored by most in Italy when it was released in 1989. But those in the Academy saw it and it won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar for that year in a no-brainer decision. The film starts with a phone call to famous director Jacques Perrin who learns that a dear friend of his has passed away from the Sicilian village where he spent his youth. What follows are flashbacks to his youth in Sicily and his friendship to a middle-aged man (the amazing Philippe Noiret) who happened to run the projector at the local movie theater. As a young boy (Salvatore Cascio) we see the character being given pieces of film that are cut from the movies due to what the local priest believes to be questionable material (people kissing). The nostalgia the young boy feels will directly create a genuine love and respect for the world's greatest medium. As he becomes an adolescent (Marco Leonardi) he experiences love and the possibility of war. Together he and Noiret go through many triumphs and tragedies together, but as much as everything changes the love for movies stays a constant always. Then there comes a time for the youngster to create his own destiny by leaving the village, but he takes more than anyone could ever imagine with him. "Cinema Paradiso" is excellent in every way possible. The story is arguably the best the cinema has ever experienced. It is easily the greatest homage to the power and love of movies. Giuseppe Tornatore's amazing direction and writing prove to raise the movie into a classic level. Ennio Morricone also created perhaps the best soundtrack a film has ever sported. There is nothing negative I can say about this magnificent movie. I love it and it is a film that is close to my heart. Beyond excellence. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It shows the love of movies...and how a frustrated old loser can ruin your love life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are 2 movies here and I give 8 to one and 2 to the other. The first is a touching fable about the movies of our lives, how they affected us, how they moved us; the other one is the sad story of an old fart ruining the love lives of two young people, who even feels proud of doing it--for those who haven't seen the director's cut, it wasn't Elena who disappeared, but Alfredo who told her to forget Toto and even hide a note from her. The reason for my 2 is because, instead of presenting the story as a cautionary tale for young, impressionable, minds not to trust old pricks, NCP celebrates it (!) even with all the emotional devastation it causes appearing evident.The 1st film, I said, is a nostalgic look back at a time when people had little more entertainment than a weekly visit to the cinema. Now, some question here if peasants could really appreciate Visconti, but the truth is, people had no choice then but to see what was available; and anyway for those who didn't even have TV just watching live images on a wall was thrilling enough. Here, more than Toto or Alfredo, the main character is the Paradiso, the one allowing people socialize, sleep, fall in love, even settle accounts, many times aping the action on the screen, as when the spitting bourgeois receives some gross stuff in the kisser while some workers fix I Vitelloni's Alberto; or when a mobster gets his just desserts. Characters other than the leads are not much developed, which is logical as we see them as part of Toto's recollection, not as autonomous participants in a lineal plot. The cinematography is rich, with many long shots spiced with sudden close ups and with some outdoor scenes screaming Fellini! specially in the town square. The pace is sustained even during the slower parts, as they come combined with some more intense action elsewhere. Morricone's score is appropriate, although not anywhere near as reminiscent as that of Vitelloni IMO. The writing is superb, especially during heart to heart dialogs, and the acting going from great--Cascio, Attilli, Noiret--to decent--Leonardi, Perrin et al.About the 2nd film, I can't understand how people rave about Toto's story, not realizing how sad, tragic, it is. The scene of him watching, teary eyed, the screen kisses is touching, but for all its sadness. How would you feel if for 30 years you had lived in a emotional vacuum every night going home to an empty bed--or to one where is waiting for you a woman who doesn't even like you--to be told then that all that is because a man who you trusted more than God chased away the love of your life; and who, as a consolation prize leaves a few screen kisses so you can mentally masturbate and find some comfort? Wouldn't you curse him to Hell? Sorry, I love movies but to pretend that in any way the viewing of such scenes can repair the damage done is nonsense. Life is life, something REAL, that no movie, however great, can replace.The 1st part, though, when Toto's still a kid, is great and even funny in occasions, specially at the school or with the priest. It contains the best cinema scenes also: the kids jerking off while watching a naked BB; the censoring priest; the crowd following the drama on screen word by word and crying; Toto watching the cursed kisses from behind a curtain, pestering Alfredo...but he loses his spark when becoming a teen and what little remains of it Alfredo &amp; Elena take it away. She's rather dull, honestly, I wonder how interesting would have been his life with her...anyway, Alfredo had no right to push him into realizing his own version of success. A true friend would have just told him his opinion and let him be. His mom was right; he should have listened to her. That burning film in the street scene was a sign; he should have abode by it and kissed the bum off. And why did he have to leave? He could have stayed. Did you see how successful the locals are 30 years later; the Fiats, the nice clothes, the buildings? And why he had to dump Elena to be successful in life; in which way she was an obstacle? Nice, serviceable Alfredo was after all nothing but an egoistic, manipulative SOB capable of ruining anyone's life just to make up for his own failures.I'd have given this one 8/10 if it only had ended with Toto cursing Alfred--like Chuck did it in POTA--but as it doesn't, that's a 5.0/10. Oh, BTW, if there was only the short version, my rating would be 8 or 9. There.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the praise for this film seems inexplicable. The acting is one dimensional, just like the characters, and the pathos and the writing. It's a series of cute and fun vignettes with a few hardships thrown in for sympathy. Life is going too good at the cinema paradiso and the whole cute Alfredo as angry old man and Toto as precocious young boy has become played out, therefore, fire. Next, we see a shallow adolescent who falls in love with someone he doesn't really know. The relationship is not believable as being anything other than a juvenile infatuation and yet this is what later causes him such sorrow when he returns. Nothing is really shown about him being in the army except a comedic montage and the only time the main protagonist seems to get angry is near the end in the car, otherwise, always swooning or happy. The scene in the car is about the only interesting scene in the film yet it is not believable as following from the relationship they had. The film is thus emotionally vacuous, too long, and clichéd. It had some potential but nothing was sufficiently developed for it to be anything except hollow and unnatural.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sentimental, jumbled mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I appreciate what this this film was trying to do, but I think it's entirely to big, clumsy, and sloppy to be of any real value. I actually sat through this monster twice and I can say that it doesn't even get any better the second time.The theme of the movie (that is, maturing and allowing yourself to move on with your life, as opposed to the pretty picture movies portray) is admirable and comprehensible. However, there are some major problems that overwhelm this strength. First, the film is entirely too long. It feels like the director just tossed in every single "growing up" cliché he could think of and the result is that the movie takes up waaaay too much of your life. Second, in spite of the first problem, this film has huge story gaps that took place as a result of massive editing (as I understand it, this film was originally well over three hours). Third, the film makes no real attempt to establish empathy with the audience. It instead makes the erroneous assumption that we will just see Alfred and Toto and be instantly smitten with these lovable characters. Wrong again. I too often found them annoying and ridiculous (especially Toto) to have any real emotional bonds with anyone.The ending is decent, but it would have had more effect had all of the previous clutter not been strewn about the film. All in all, this was just way to mushy and bloated for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It isn't often, we as the audience are able to accompany someone in a films which not only entertains us, but often allow us to share their lives through their entire progression. This is our reward as we view a very young boy named 'ToTo' (Salvatove Di Vitoe). As he becomes enamored with early films shown in his tiny Italian Village. The Projectist is an old man who tolerates his visits. Day after day the boy not only becomes a help to the old man, but soon develops a love for films, but learns to appreciates them throughout his life. His own life is filled with love with a young beauty and events which effect his town and it's people. As these events parade through his life and his family, he never loses his life for movies. Through each event his own life takes it's toll as we see him age, while he learns the value of love and friendship, plus the price each has on him. 'Alfredo,' The old man (Philipp Noriret) Gives the boy some advice which doesn't always pan out. Still the film garners many awards from around the world. Interesting enough it is rated R and after seeing the film twice I can't see why. There is nothing in the film which promotes all the objections such as overt nudity, sex or violence. And yet, the village priest see's to it that not even Kissing is allowed to be viewed by the audience. Never the less, it wins many awards and is worth keeping as a movie. The actors have given us a view of their lives and we can't see an reason why the family shouldn't see it as well. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that will have a special appeal to lovers of film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso does deserve many plaudits and I can see the appeal of it . It is sentimental, but it works without being mawkish. It is also nostalgic, but it is not a blinkered nostalgia. It does hint at darker things, and also a particularly traumatic moment which effects the entire tenor of the film after it happens. It is a beautifully judged film and there are scenes which are justifiably famous. In one of them the projectionist of the local cinema, turns the projector around so it can be seen on the walls of the outside town. It is a truly magnificent scene, albeit with a very dark ending.By setting the film in Sicily and basing it around the local cinema, as well as setting it after the second world war, the film explores poverty, censorship, and loss of community. It does all of the above in a poignant, and often wry way. I think the term masterpiece is a little overstated, although I can see why people think it deserves the accolade. The very moving scene at the end is a wonderful peon to friendship. I think the film is coy about some of the more dubious aspects of Sicily, but that really is a small gripe although I still think worth mentioning.It is a lovely film though with enough edge to restrain it from becoming too sentimental. This is a film you can safely be assured is a quality entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a poignant ode to Cinema's Golden Age, but a powerful invitation to discover our own...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw « Nuovo Cinema Paradiso », I was about the same age of its young hero, 'Toto" and I enjoyed the film, for at least half of it. The fire scene marked a departure from the joyful insouciance of the early memories to a succession of situations I found hackneyed even at that time. Indeed, once the pretty girl get in the picture, I started yawning. Quite an ironical paradox that a movie resurrecting childhood magic and the power of imagination couldn't appeal to a child because of the very parts that needed to abandon the optimistic tone of childhood.My brother was just born at that time and now, he's 22. Naturally, the film felt like a totally different experience, and I was even surprised that it lasted two hours as I recalled it being longer, funny how memories tend to distort reality. Still, I wished the theme of childhood had been more central to the plot, as the apprenticeship of young Toto was more powerfully drawn by the fact that he was a fatherless boy (the film opens in post-war Sicily) without as close ties with his mother as he had with the movies. Naturally, the local cinema projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) was the perfect counterpart to his father, and naturally, spending times watching movies was more exciting a premise as staying home. "Cinema Paradiso", on that level, is the stuff passions are made of.And one can understand from the perspective of a young altar boy how a passion for movies can easily grow. The kid probably didn't spend much time doing kids' stuff, working with the priest and having to endure hours and hours of silence, sermons and slowness, but at what price: the total opposite actually, watching the film like in premieres while the priest is ready to toss his bell anytime a kiss or passion is expressed passion, signaling Alfredo to put a mark on the reel and later cut the offensive parts, leaving sad relics of celluloid in a bucket, that naturally, young Toto want to keep. As a film about and for people worshiping movies, it is funny that the churchman is the blasphemous one. Again, Cinema is God, Alfredo is the 'Holy Father' and it's up to 'Toto' to find the 'Holy Spirit'.Speaking of Alfredo, we can all relate to that mentor relationship, the little glow on our eyes when we listened to the one figure that incarnated our dreams. And Alfredo is all the more appealing because he does his best dissuading Toto to do his job, which consists on repeating the same movements, watching the same films over and over again, suffocating in summer and trembling in winter. He makes the job sound like hell, but for 'Toto', this Cinema is his 'Paradiso'. But it's not as 'black-and-white', so to speak, Alfredo enjoys watching people laughing or crying, he feels as if he's the one generating these emotions. And that's subtle genius, as one of my all-time pleasures has always been to show movies and I could watch the same ones over a week, if I could earn the satisfaction of making a friend or a relative discovering a gem, it was all worth it.This generosity reaches its emotional climax when Alfredo pleases the townspeople by projecting a movie in a big wall, foreshadowing the drive-in movies. This is the most magical moment of the film, and I always regret that it has to foreshadow the tragic fire scene that would partially destroy the theater but permanently cut Alfredo out of his job, as he would (another tragic irony) turn blind because of the chemical fumes. Things could have been worse, as it was little Toto who pulled by the strength of his love, the big Alfredo out of the flaming room. And this shows how ungrateful a job this is, being the man in the shadow, the projectionist would have been totally forgotten, if it wasn't for the only boy who got interested in his job, so (no pun intended) it made natural that the torch would be passed to Toto.This is the part where I lose the track a little, and I don't think the film is perfect all the way, but the truth is that, for all the little unnecessary moments, there are some magnificent exchanges with the older and wiser Alfredo, as we finally get to understand what he meant by dissuading Toto to do this job. It is one thing to show movies, but you'll never get the same credit as if you were making them. In fact, the soul of a projectionist is to make movies, and Toto soon turns out to be Jacques Perrin as Guiseppe Tornatore's alter ego in the film, an established filmmaker, that was the only way to close his characters' arc. And this is why, as a guy who enjoyed making people discover movies, this sentiment has built up to the desire of making movies. And I guess, this is what the final extraordinary kissing montage exhilarates, the immortalizing power of Cinema, encapsulating passion and love and all human feelings like no medium has ever done, "Romeo &amp; Juliet", "Tristan &amp; Isold" are iconic love stories but do they hold a candle to the visual memories provided by, say, "Gone With the Wind" or "From Here to Eternity"? Perrin crying while watching the iconic kissing montage is like he'd just revisited the roots of his passion, Cinema's Golden Age..Or was he also revisiting his own Golden Age, purely and simply, letting his inner child enjoying with the same eyes, and heart, the magic of the lost past. As unlimited as the Cinema is, maybe the "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" transcends the limits of Cinema and is about something more deeply rooted in our hearts, something called nostalgia, our own personal Golden Age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>spoilers warning Film Review of Cinema Paradiso A renowned filmmaker obtains news of a longtime friend who had died in the Sicilian village that happens to be his hometown. The filmmaker recalls good old memories of Alfredo who happened to be a projectionist in the Cinema Paradiso (a local auditorium). A young Salvatore falls in love with a beautiful woman from the locality. Memories elaborate his childhood life where the passion for film making started. The filmmaker also reminisces on hours spent at the auditorium to perfect that art of filmmaking that currently is Salvatore's career. The film highlights cover various cinema art elaborating the dying trade of conventional filmmaking, the editing perspective and screening skills. Alfredo encourages young Salvatore to leave the village in pursuit of his dreams in filmmaking. The early 19th century presents a civilization theme evident in the film through various themes evident by attributes to World War II atmosphere. Romance is a strong theme in the film evidenced by the love between Elena and Toto. Additionally, Salvatore observes Alfredo cutting scenes of kissing an occurrence that enlightens the young filmmaker of various world attributes. The film also addresses a strong theme of religion evidenced by the scenes where Afredo, who is a priest, edits romantic scenes to contain the villages' traditions. The family theme is also evident in "Cinema Paradiso" as illustrated by Toto's mother and sister relationship. Another significant theme in the film is affluence as illustrated when the townspeople acquire lotto. The film gradually gains momentum when love brews between Elena and Salvatore. A disapproval of the unity between the two by Elena's father further propels the film into another climax. Alfredo convinces Elena to avoid Toto who eventually joins the Italian military as custom of the Italian law for every young male. The military enrollment separates the two lovebirds for a long period. The eventual delivery of the film showcases Salvatore's return from the military to find a married Elena. The unfortunate turn of events results in Salvatore leaving the village to Rome where he perfects the art of filmmaking. A later return by the Salvatore presents a captivating scene where he quickly recognizes Elena's daughter who aids in the location of Elena again. A confrontational scene between the two early lovebirds generates a conclusive extract of the film when Elena confesses the occurrence of events. Cinema Paradiso's parting shot showcases Salvatore view the cut kissing scenes from a film left behind by Alfredo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A filmmaker recalls his childhood, when he fell in love with the movies at his village's theater and formed a deep friendship with the theater's projectionist.In many ways, this film anticipates "The Long Day Closes" and "Hugo". While "Cinema Paradiso" is probably not the first movie about enjoying movies, it is easily the most successful and critically acclaimed. Terence Davies was likely influenced, and there is no doubt that Martin Scorsese was."Cinema Paradiso" was shot in director Tornatore's hometown Bagheria, Sicily, as well as Cefal? on the Tyrrhenian Sea. This makes the film somewhat more interesting for Sicilians in Wisconsin, as they largely trace their roots to Bagheria.</fullReview>

As the times improved in Italy during 1960s and 1970s most of that kind of film making disappeared. They were replaced by more optimistic and joyful films like this one.This film does not necessarily follow that dark path, but rather optimistic one. It shows so well Italy of those times, magic of the films and their attractions to the public. It is a real tribute to the film industry and its success in the 20th century.Acting is excellent, plot is interesting, cinematography excellent!

		<fullReview>This movie blew me away. It is one of the best foreign movies ever and righteously won the Oscar for best foreign film.The film begins with Salvatore's mother trying to call him to tell him about the death of an old friend. When Salvatore, now a professional film maker, here's the news, he remembers his childhood in the recently panic-stricken town (from world war 2) that he grew up in, his love for cinema and the life long friendship with the cinema's projectionist, Alfredo, and his teenage love, Elena.This film struck me in a personal way, as I am a movie buff. Never before has cinema felt closer to me before watching this. The last 5 minutes will be most enjoyable to those who, like me, know a lot about cinema as this features clips from some of the greatest motion pictures from the early golden age (don't forget to look out for the mini scene with Charlie Chaplin in one of his early short films).The cast was well picked and has a great director who actually knows how to move people in a deep way, unlike a lot of modern day directors.I have also heard there is an extended edition, which I have not seen and I have heard it does not have the same emotional impact as the original. But I will still watch this because there are some questions I am still pondering over, even though I watched this 2 weeks ago.Please watch this, it'll do you a lot of good.</fullReview>

Try as I might I can't think of a single mediocre performance, let alone a bad one, the principals are beyond superb and what a joy, for example, to find that an adult Brigit Fossey is just as bewitching as an adult as she was as a six-year-old in Jeux Interdit, and how full circle that she is playing an adult in another film about childhood innocence. There's something of the Pagnols about it as Tornatore creates a whole community and peoples it with living, breathing people, just as Pagnol before him did with the Midi. It's such a joy to find a film celebrating Cinema and all it stands for, all it means to children everywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema Paradiso</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the films listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die have interesting and good sounding titles, including the foreign language ones, and this Italian one I was very intrigued by because it sounded like something I would love, and it was rated well by the critics. Basically, in 1980's Rome, Salvatore 'Toto' Di Vita (Jacques Perrin) is a famous and successful Italian film director, and returning home late one night his sleepy girlfriend tells him that his mother telephoned to tell him that his someone called Alfredo has died, and it is obvious he has shied away from committed relationships and his family in Giancaldo, Sicily, and the story flashes back thirty years to see who Alfredo was. After the Second World War, highly intelligent and mischievous six year old Salvatore 'Toto' Di Vita (BAFTA winning Salvatore Cascio) has a love for films and spends most of his time going to the local movie house, Cinema Paradiso, and there he gets to know the projectionist Alfredo (BAFTA winning Philippe Noiret), who for a while finds his presence annoying and he gets frustrated. Slowly though Alfredo takes a shine to Toto and they form a close friendship, as the projectionist allows him to watch movies from the projection booth, and he teaches him how to load and operate the film projector because of his fascination with his work. They often hear the audience boo when sections of films are missing, especially those where characters in the movies are embracing romance with kissing, meaning the film jumps these moments, these scenes have been cut out under the orders of local priest Father Adelfio (Leopoldo Trieste) who wants the films "censored", all of the scenes are piled on the projection room floor. One night one of the movies, made of the routine highly flammable Nitrate film, catches fire and causes some of the movie house to burn, Toto notices this and manages to save Alfredo's life, but a consequence is that the explosion of burning film burned Alfredo's face and permanently blinds him, eventually Cinema Paradiso is rebuilt by town citizen Ciccio who invests his football winnings, and as the only capable hand child Toto is made projectionist. A decade passes and adolescent Salvatore 'Toto' Di Vita (Marco Leonardi) is now in high school and still a projectionist at Cinema Paradiso, and he still has a strong relationship with blind Alfredo, he often takes his advice about his personal life, such as being in love, and this advice is given with him quoting classic movies. Toto has started experimenting in his own filmmaking using his home movie camera, and doing this he meets and is attracted to wealthy banker's daughter Elena Mendola (Agnese Nano), and he wins her heart with his charm, but her father does not approve and forces them apart, and when her family is moving away at the same time it is compulsory that Toto serves in military service. While there he tries to communicate with Elena with letters, but they are returned undeliverable, and when he eventually returns Alfredo is urging him to leave Giancaldo permanently with no explanation, only that if he wants to achieve his dreams for filmmaking the town is not big enough, and if he does pursue his ambition he should go and never return, and never write. Back in the present, Salvatore has obviously obeyed this, but now that Alfredo has died he is desperate to return to Giancaldo for the funeral of his friend, and he finds that the town has changed a lot, and he finds out why he was told to leave. Salvatore is told by Alfredo's widow that he followed his film directing career with high interest and pride, and his dying gifts to his friend are an unlabelled reel of film and the stool that he operated the projector on. The sad news is that the Cinema Paradiso is being demolished to make way for parking spaces, many of the people in the village have gathered to watch as the building comes down, many of whom the film director recognises, and it does collapse to the ground is a crash of dust. The end of the film sees Salvatore return home to Rome, and he takes the reel of film he was given by Alfredo to a cinema to be put and played in the projector for him to watch, he discovers it is every romantic scene cut (including The Gold Rush and His Girl Friday) by the priest put together in a special montage, in floods of happy tears Salvatore has made peace with his past. Also starring Pupella Maggio as old Maria Di Vita, Antonella Attili as young Maria Di Vita, Isa Danieli as Anna, Enzo Cannavale as Spaccafico, Nicola Di Pinto as Village Idiot, Roberta Lena as Lia and Nino Terzo as Peppino's Father. Noiret gives a really nice performance as the at first grumpy but then absolutely lovable projectionist who is an inspiration to his young friend, and the supporting cast members all do their parts well also, especially Cascio as the five year old wannabe filmmaker that grows up to achieve this ambition. The story is easy to follow, the characters are lovable, the plot lines including inside the cinema and love stories are fun, and if you are a big fan of watching films this picture really expresses the magic of escaping the everyday world and entering the spirit of movie going, it is a most enjoyable drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, it won the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, Best Original Film Score for Ennio Morricone and Andrea Morricone and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Direction for Giuseppe Tornatore, Best Editing, Best Make Up Artist and Best Production Design, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

		<shortDescription>Celluloid nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To those of us who live in places less beautiful than Sicily, and which have lost connection with their peasant heritage much longer ago, there's a natural appeal to stories from that island. 'Cinema Paradiso' provides a nostalgic look at post-war Sicily, and also of Italian cinema during that era; in the story of how progress led to television, the death of the cinema as a social institution and the individualisation of people's lives, it recalls 'The Last Picture Show'. There's similarity as well in the conflict between attachment to one's community and the desire to escape, although it lacks Peter Bogdanovich's film's sense of overwhelming claustrophobia. Indeed, the emotional temperature of the film is actually quite muted, in spite of the surface colour and vigour. I enjoyed it, but (especially in a setting with such a complex historical and political backdrop) it could have benefited from a shade more intensity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a perfectly pleasant film about the friendship between a mischievous youngster and a weary old film projectionist working at the local cinema. This is also a film about film, a genre which I've always found a bit too self-indulgent.Except I think this film ? about the importance and magic of an actual cinema house ? is one that is becoming more and more relevant today. People are going to the cinema less and less frequently ? they're downloading films online, with poor quality, not paying, and, importantly, watching them on screens that are getting smaller ? or at least thinner ? in their own homes. What Cinema Paradiso reminds us of is the magic of leaving the house, paying for a ticket, sitting in a cinema with others, laughing together, being frightened together, getting choked up together.Nonetheless I still feel that this film is just a "nice" film ? for the most part. It's perfectly pleasant and sweet, quite bittersweet in parts. Heartwarming, sure, but is that enough to make this film great? No. What makes this film immensely popular and well-loved, in my opinion, is the very last scene. It is surely among the most brilliant endings to a film I have ever seen. No spoilers here ? but, for me, just because the final moments of a film are 10/10, this does not make the film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film about 22years after it was made. I do not think the appeal of this film has slightly deteriorated with passing time. It tells several stories. First and foremost portrays the magic of Cinema, which is one of the cheapest entertainers. With advent of television, fall of Cinema. Human story is about a fatherless boy who develops an attachment to a projectionist who becomes his father figure and helps building his character. There is a love story of first love. I find this story is a Morden transformation of a fairy tale with immense presence of reality. The projectionist Alfredo's character is that of a wise man, who does not demand anything of Toto, but continually feels him with signpost. Amazingly he does not demand to see Toto before he dies. I am now keen to see extended version, which may have expansion in love story. If you have not seen this film, I thoroughly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a well crafted, powerful film which evokes a variety of emotions, leaving the viewer with a sort of satisfied exhaustion, like after a good session of yard work. Its focus is the power of love to shape our lives over the long term. The protagonist's passion for the cinema and his youthful immersion in "first love" are intertwined, and become mutual symbols each for the other. What constitutes success and what failure? What is or must be sacrificed to achieve our goals, and how are we to know in advance which life goals will prove worthy and enduring? All these dilemmas move beneath the surface of an engaging tale, but without detracting from its drama. Let me point out too an important word of warning that may be missed: When an adult's help and guidance of a young person, no matter how lovingly offered, crosses the line to making decisions for them without their knowledge or consent, the consequence often may be suffering for which no one would have wished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies we just can't help but fall in love with. Such is the case of Cinema Paradiso, the touching story about a boy growing up in Sicilly and how his life is influenced by the cinema in his small rural town. This boy, Toto, builds a deep friendship with the cinema's projectionist, Alfredo. The film begins with Toto as a grown man, now a successful filmmaker, reflecting on his childhood and the things that influenced him in order to get him where he is today. This is one of those movies that is truly beautiful. It is so moving, so powerful, and, like I already said, one can't help but fall in love with it.Cinema Paradiso is the kind of film that seems simple enough on the outside. It is a film about a boy growing up. But the film weaves so many things into this boy's life and we grow a strong connection to him and the people around him. We develop a deep understanding of all the characters in this film and what roles they play in Toto's life and how they all change and grow along with Toto. The relationship that builds between Toto and Alfredo is one of the most compelling and touching tales of human compassion you'll ever find. It molds Cinema Paradiso into a bold and beautiful film with such a strong heart and powerful mind.This is one of those films that moves along with such grace and such delightful ease that your love for the film only grows as the characters grow. It is a wonderfully paced and exquisitely scripted film that moves along at a light hearted pace, never faltering and never becoming stale or redundant. It is a consistently moving tale of human emotion and connection that hearkens back to a simpler time of cinema, a time filled with more grace, love, and compassion towards human beings. I feel that this is a film that resents the gritty violent world of cinema that today's generation has created. Cinema Paradiso is a film about love. It is one that casts out hate and stifles modern cinema's dark disposition. I personally don't take Cinema Paradiso's side because I love dark and gritty films, but I still respect this film for the high quality piece of art that it most certainly is.It's not to say that Cinema Paradiso is all flowers and rainbows. It certainly has a side to it that isn't necessarily dark, just realistic. It deals with the simple facts of life that tragedies occur and people die. You can't avoid these things and Cinema Paradiso isn't a disillusioned film that thinks the world is all fun and games. And that relates back to how human of a film Cinema Paradiso is. It is an incredibly moving story that doesn't find it necessary to be melodramatic. It is dramatic, of course, but in such a way that highlights its beauty and brings out all the positive qualities of this film's story. It is a truly excellent film. Even if it isn't your cup of tea you can't say that you don't realize the beauty and artistic quality of this fine film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This isn't just a movie. This is someone's life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso is an Italian film based on a young boy and his fascination with cinema. Starting as a, now famous, film director, Totto receives a call from his Mother, the Mother he hasn't seen for nearly thirty years. She tells him that his old friend Alfredo has passed away and then asks if he will return. From here on we get a flashback story of how Totto met his friend and how he changed his life.As a boy Totto would go to his local movie theatre, the Cinema Paradiso. The world of the movies intrigues him and he uses the as a way to escape his awful reality, the death of his Father and the poor treatment he receives from his Mother. At the theatre he befriends the older projectionist Alfredo, who takes Totto under his wing and teaches him the values of life through the world of the movies.Unfortunately a dreadful accident takes place and the theatre burns down leaving Alfredo blind and only alive due to the young Totto's heroism. From here on in Totto becomes the projectionist and learns how important these movies are to the rest of the community. People come to this theatre to escape their poor reality. People live in the theatre, die, smoke, spit, fight even self pleasure, especially after the Priests stop having the kissing scenes cut from a movie. This theatre is people's home away from home where they can enjoy the world of celebrities from John Wayne to Charlie Chaplin.This is where the movie really takes hold. The friendship between the boy and the projectionist is heart warming and believable, with the acting and the script really bringing the audience into this relationship. Even after the accident the couple seem to bond further and the now blind Alfredo teaches Totto that life isn't a movie but how many wish it was. However I felt myself slipping out of the film when Totto moves into adolescence and falls in love with a local girl, who ultimately leaves him, ripping his heart out. The film seems to change here and all the important themes of before, friendship and loyalty, seem to disappear, making the film harder to enjoy. It's only until Alfredo send Totto away from the village that we understand the older Totto's reasons for not wanting to return to what seemed like his life.The old Totto returns to the village and the story grabs on again as once more the acting grips you and shows the meaning of their friendship. Totto is now a big director and through Alfredo's wisdom managed to capture his dream. The final scene is meaningful in that it makes you realise that life isn't a movie and however much you cut out it will still resurface. Totto never finds love in the film after cutting his love out his life and the ending makes him see that love is important and that you should never let it slip.The film is enjoyable and will have people laughing, crying and clapping along with the audience on screen. The only shame of it is the small section of the teenage Totto where the tight plot seems to lose its way, which is a shame to an otherwise lovely film. Don't expect to watch this film to see a movie; you really see someone's life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please note this is a review of the 123 minute 1988 release. I have not seen the extended DVD cut.Cinema Paradiso was made for people who love movies. Everyone who frequently visits this site has one movie (maybe more) that had a huge impact on their lives. Salvatore, commonly known as Toto, represents people like us, except he took his love of films and became a rich and famous director, but that's beside the point. The film takes place in a small town in Sicily shortly after World War II. Toto's father had been killed in the war, and his mother never remarried. The movie theater becomes Toto's home away from home, and he is fascinated by the projection room. Alfredo, the projectionist in the local movie theater, becomes a surrogate father to Toto and teaches him how to work the projectors. This starts one of the most touching friendships you will ever see in a movie. Ennio Morricone's score certainly helps with that, but Philippe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio (young Toto) have good chemistry and Cascio was one of the better child actors I've seen, but maybe that's because I don't speak Italian.When Alfredo is blinded by a fire, Toto takes his place as the projectionist, but they maintain their friendship. As Toto grows up, he falls in love, but Alfredo encourages him to pursue a career in film. He leaves the prospect of a happy life in his own town for the sake of a successful career, something that many of us don't do when faced with the decision. When Toto reaches adulthood and becomes a successful filmmaker, he has not found a woman that matched the girlfriend from his teenage years, but the ending reinforces his love of movies and reminds him why he made the decision in the first place. The last scene is too good to spoil so you will just have to find out for yourself! I have to admit the first act of the movie where Toto is a child is superior to the second and third act, but the first act is so strong it really does not matter, and the ending just makes it even stronger.The scenes inside the movie theater are the highlight of the film for me. Cinema Paradiso brings people back to the days when movies were EVENTS. Young people might not understand this today, because movies come out on DVD four months or so after they leave theaters. Even in 1989, movies were not as monumental as they used to be, what with the invention of the television and the VCR. In Cinema Paradiso, when the theater gets a new movie, the whole town sees it and interacts with it as if the actors can hear them. The theater's central location in the town gives it the importance of a church, as Roger Ebert noted. The destruction of the movie theater at the end of the movie symbolized the death of an era. It is only a matter of time before a movie studio releases a movie on DVD while it is in theaters, but hopefully, movie theaters will never die, because there is just no substitute for the big screen experience.If you're an American and you've never seen a foreign film before, this is where you should start. This was my first exposure to foreign cinema (I was in grammar school) and I loved it. Don't be intimidated by the subtitles!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am going through an interesting project at the moment. After joining a film club I am ordering films that I haven't seen from the 'Top 500' list from Empire. Last night I watched Cinema Paradiso. Well, I loved it. As everyone else here reports, it's a wonderful treasure set in a beautiful, if stifling, little town in Italy. The characters are warm,wonderful and totally believable and I loved it from start to finish. I went to bed last night dreaming about it and woke up with it swimming through my mind. I have a feeling it will occupy a soft spot in my heart for years to come. If you can lay your foreign film prejudices to one side and park your Hollywood frames of reference in a quiet corner, then grab yourself a beer or glass of wine and settle back to watch one of the best films I have seen in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films, timeless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have enjoyed this film since it's release. Sat down to watch my old VHS copy last night. The edit on film was a bit wobbly, should get the DVD and see if it is cleaner. My copy is the original, shorter version, not the longer one that came out later.What can you say about this film? You don't have to like Italian cinema to savour this films joys, but it helps if you do. There is a long tradition in Italian movie making to highlight the pathos, struggles of the poor and the humour in odd (but mostly Italian) behaviour. This film plays to that tradition. Sentimental recollection of what was left behind in poverty stricken Sicily as a local boy, energetic in his obsession with films, leaves his history and family behind him only to become a great success. At an unanticipated moment he is brought back home to mourn the loss of his most beloved mentor and father figure. The closer he looks to drink in all that has changed in his home town during a 30 year absence the more it seems to him that nothing has changed. Perhaps just the outer layers have added different coverings, but underneath it he wonders what has changed especially in himself.There is almost nothing lacking in this film. Certainly one of Ennio Morricone's most haunting and heartfelt soundtracks move one to laughter and tears and we welcome it all. The chemistry between all cast members was perfect, especially between the beloved Philippe Noiret and both actors who played Toto as a child and young man. Antonella Attili's role as Toto's mother is given depth, tenderness and suffering without over indulgence. Her issues speak for themselves and as a young Sicilian mother trying to raise a small family without a husband we fully appreciate why she cries in anguish.This is a masterpiece of storytelling, evoking the depths of the human experience while maintaining an over all subtle sense of optimism. One can rise from a seemingly stifling environment and find fulfilment. A film to be watched many times, enjoying the tears and laughter. Superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 170-min director's cut, the early part that focuses on the relationship between a gruff but good-hearted projectionist and a little boy who loves movies is the best, although there are way too many scenes of movie screenings. The middle part, dealing with Toto's teen years, is a corny romance that drags the film down. The final part, as the middle-aged Toto revisits his home town after a gap of 30 years, is affecting if overly sentimental and manipulative. The acting is generally good, particularly Noiret as the projectionist and adorable little Cascio as the young Toto. The cinematography is beautiful and Morricone provides another of his wonderful scores.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War II has just ended and life in the Sicilian village of Giancaldo centers around the Cinema Paradiso where townsfolk gather to see the exciting and glamorous life outside. Young Toto spends all his free time sneaking into the theatre for the movies and most especially for the old projectionist, Alfredo, who loves him like a son. Toto wants to grow up and show movies just like Alfredo, but one night, there is a terrible fire in the projection box.This movie is simply perfect. It's nostalgic and sentimental and quite touching. The actors are uniformly excellent, especially adorable,wide-eyed Salvatore Cascio who plays Toto as a child and Marco Leonardi who gives a sensitive performance as teenage Toto. Philippe Noiret is the wonderful old projectionist who teaches Toto about life. In some ways, this movie is similar to "The Last Picture Show;" it's about the passage of time with the one constant being the local theatre. We watch as Toto grows up and the town modernizes, but the villagers retain their close bond with one another.The soundtrack alone is enough to send you running for tissues; it's simply beautiful and heartbreaking. The direction is outstanding, with nary a single wasted moment. In Italian with English subtitles, it's a timeless and universally-appealing story of a boy who falls in love with movies. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Senitmental celebration of cinema that takes no prisoners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An epic celebration of some great Italian staples - love and cinema. This terrific film takes in three generations over three acts: growing up; falling in love; and revisiting the first two.Salvatore Cascio as the child Salvatore is the pick of the flashback actors, perpetually wide-eyed in amazement and full of life (indeed, he won a BAFTA). Later life Salvatore and Elena are playing well by Jacques Perrin and Brigitte Fossey who, I reads between the lines, doesn't appear in the standard theatrical cut at all.This is a pity but not a detrimental loss. The great performance that hangs in the background of this detailed, well-observed and loving film is that of Philippe Noiret's Alfredo. His big heart and sagaciousness give the tremulous whole context, depth and a palpable humanity (he is the angelic counterpart of the malevolent Papet of Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources).It has imperfections but they are unmemorable in Tonare's (Morricone-score abetted) full-on assault of your heart. Beware of the final five minutes which are merciless; you will weep until your skull is sand. 9/10(I watched the 170 min director's cut)</fullReview>

All the actors who play Salvatore are wonderful, including the little boy, Salvatore Cascio. Philippe Noiret is great(as usual) in the role of Alfredo, the projectionist of Cinema Paradiso. And the ending, when Toto watches a compilation made by Alfredo of all of the censored scenes is so beautiful, so emotional...A great and wonderful masterpiece that deserves to be adored to the end of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Movie !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you first see the interaction between Alfredo and Toto, you begin to question why this man has so much patience with this kid-but that is crux of this story-of human relations-a projectionist, who is childless with not much contact with the outside world as he himself claims, finds solace and friendship with this kid. The story is told mostly inside the Cinema house with a few shots of Rome to build the story. There is a sublime intricacy and mystery to this story that does not manifest till the end. Yes, the movie is very convincing, very real and very touching. All the Actors are good, but the one's who stand our is Alfredo and the older Salvatore. The scene in the car will bring tears since any one with any hint of romance in their heart has gone thru this before but never seen that well expressed or enacted. The older Elena, is very impressive and when she says "with us there is no future only the past" that brings the final set of tears,tears that are well worth it since the movie taps into the basics of life and living-family, childhood, love and romance.</fullReview>

Cinema Paridiso does not disappoint in that regard. This is a brilliant movie in that it is both romantic and nostalgic. It reminds us of youthful love. It brings back memories of long gone friends.

A heart warming tale of a small town boy, Toto who grows up to be a famous director and comes back to his hometown to attend the funeral of Alfredo, the projectionist in the old cinema house. Shows very poignantly the influence of cinema in the everyday lives of people. People flock at the local cinema theater to forget all their grief and sorrow in everyday life. The movie is truly a tribute to old fashioned cinema houses. Alfredo's character has to be one of the most memorable characters ever created. He plays a father figure, friend, philosopher to young Toto. The most memorable part of the movie has to be the mysterious story of Alfredo to Toto, about a young soldier who falls in love with a princess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Example of Italian film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of this comment should correctly convey my feelings for this movie. It is a beautiful example of foreign film making and contains many ideas and themes that many U.S. directors should utilize more often. I love this movie because of the ideas to do with innocence, happiness, love and loss and how they affect ourselves and how hollow people can become if exposed to either too much or not enough of any of these things. a highly commended mention for the score, brilliantly executed and fitting the mood perfectly, the music is the proverbial icing on the cake that gives this movie even more of a soulful atmosphere than it would have had with out it. The story flows seamlessly, and the main characters are genuinely likable, and one almost feels a sense of loss when the movie is over every. every character, no matter how small a part they play in the film, all have their own sense of belonging, embellishing the story line from start to finish. It is the characters, even the smallest one that keep the story moving, from the village idiot to Salvatore himself, and, despite the fact that I don't normally like movies that are generally longer than 1.5 hours, 2 at a pinch, I was able to watch this movie and keep track of the story, and still be able to empathize with the characters. a truly touching moment is when Salvatore discovers what Alfredo's final gift to him is, especially with how the music tied everything together produced a brilliant movie moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>classic cinema analysing its own roots...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 30 years of success in the big world, Salvatore, now a famous film director, is summoned back to the Sicilian village of his birth to attend the funeral of an old friend and mentor. Before his departure, in a series of poignant, very funny and genuinely tragic flashbacks, he reminisces about his life in the village, his family, his initial fascination and introduction to the wonders of film in his local 'flea-pit' cinema (the 'Cinema Paradiso' of the title), early friendships and life-lessons, and last but by no means least, a lost love.This is one of those films you hear made reference to many times and think, yeah, I must catch that one day. People who have seen it can't believe that you haven't, so you tell yourself again, yeah, I definitely must catch that one day. Unfortunately that day kept passing me by, but I now believe this was meant to be, for when I did finally catch it a week or so ago, it was a very different film than everybody had been going on about. I was invited by two ardent fans of the film to watch it with them and we opted to watch the Director's Cut, with a whopping 50 minutes plus of extra footage, which they had never seen. Normally when you see these boasts of extra footage, they tend not to make a great deal of difference to the end result (here I cite Dances With Wolves as a prime example). Not so with this little beauty. I sat watching absorbedly but also listening to the occasional gasp of 'that wasn't mentioned before', and 'they didn't tell you that in the other version' etc., etc., and apparently there's almost an entire third act reinstated which delivers several revelations about some of the main characters that adds a darker edge and considerably more depth to events depicted in the version released theatrically. My friends were unsure about this new/original version. I of course knew no other (apart from the large hints given by their commentary) and was entranced. The most enjoyable moments to me were the scenes with the child Salvatore (real name in fact Salvatore), or Toto as he is known in the village. A little acting marvel, his face truly lights up brighter than the cinema screen with which he is enraptured, and his scenes with Philippe Noiret as projectionist Alfredo are touching and magical without being overly sentimental (Spielberg could learn a lesson here). I could also have easily believed he would grow up to be the older Salvatore (French actor Jacques Perrin) who returns to the village. The adolescent Salvatore (Marco Leonardi) however bears no resemblance to these two whatsoever and, if I have a complaint, this is it, and so my disbelief was unsuspended for a while. This notwithstanding, the film is beautifully framed, lensed, and is enhanced immeasurably by an exquisite score by the Morricones which has become a favourite soundtrack for collectors. As with many of Morricone's scores it was composed based simply on the script and before any filming took place, so that the actors could perform and react to the music and tempos being played in the background of their scenes, a la theatre. According to Tornatore 'Some of the themes that are now in the film were composed right in front of me during those first few days. His music was an inspiration to everyone', whilst Morricone himself states 'The music was born of my collaboration with Giuseppe. It reflects how I was inspired by the story of a boy, in love with a beautiful woman and coming of age in a small town in Sicily. After reading the script I attempted to write music that would aid the film in its slow transformation from comedic and ironic to heavily dramatic'. He succeeded beautifully.The story goes that the original 1988 release received a poor reception with test audiences in Italy and producer Franco Cristaldi insisted, to director and writer Tornatore's displeasure, that cuts be made. But Tornatore, as a relative unknown, was indebted to Cristaldi and complied by coming up with a two hour version of his story, and it is this version which won the Cannes, Academy and Golden Globe accolades.Moments to watch for (and there are many) include Leopoldo Trieste's wonderfully measured performance as Father Adelfio, a fastidious local Priest who piously previews upcoming films to be shown at the early Cinema Paradiso, and who rings a bell as an indication to projectionist Alfredo as to which scenes are to be excised from future public screenings, invariably an on-screen kiss (or anything approaching it), and the powerful and emotional film dénouement where Salvatore receives and views his bequest from Alfredo ? a reel of film containing all of these censored screen kisses. This is classic cinema analysing its own roots and its effects on its audience and I could go on and on about this rich, gorgeous and vibrant film, but I'll take a tip from my friends, who finally decided that less is more, and preferred the version they had originally seen, but with the reservation that the extra footage had thrown new light, and in one case a form of closure, on various relationships. Whichever version you choose to watch, which of course you can with this particular presentation, you are assured of viewing a great film (and I don't use that term loosely).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memory Inducing!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a handful of films, which at their core, allow us to view things in the manner reminiscent of when we were all kids, and where emotion and spontaneity are the fundamental pillars. Nuovo Cinema Paradiso allows to temporarily abandon ourselves to innocence, and at least in my case, always causes a smile to lurk up.Some may think its portrayals of love, loss, and friendship are naive in their presentation, but it helps guide you through the persona's journey, which in certain instances resembles the emotions we go through at different points in our life. The film itself is fairly simple in its delivery, which in turn, helps the viewer identify with the characters thoughts, struggles, and emotions.I strongly recommend this film for anyone who appreciates simplicity, and wishes to experience a film that has the ability to make you laugh, cry, think, and reminisce on the moments in our life that you will always treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tornatore's Purpose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening shot of the film, Tornatore metaphorically suggests that the story is going to be about the journey and progression of a human life. How does he accomplish this? The viewer is first exposed to a close-up of a garden pot sitting outside amidst a summer breeze. Inside the pot grows a small and simple leaf. While continuing to show this leaf, the camera begins to slowly dolly backwards into a home. At the end of the dolly shot lays a basket of fruit?implicating that every human life begins as a small and humble seed. Through a progression of time (suggested through the dolly movement), the seed grows, developments, and eventually becomes a basket of fruit. In other words, time is what allows people to grow into something more mature as they learn to bring forth the fruits of their labors.Having mentioned the fruits of one's labors, Tornatore suggests that one of those fruits that has to be worked for is love. There are three predominant themes of love throughout this film?cinematic love, romantic love, and restoration of love.Cinematic Love: The assumption that Tornatore seems to make is that those who like this film are also those who love going to the movies on a regular basis. Ironically, the lead character is also a person who loves going to the movies?we're watching a movie about a boy who loves watching movies. Salvatore seems to be a tribute character based off the real life of the director?hence the reason why Tornatore made this film (it's his own tribute to the love he has for cinema). There are other characters in the story who represent stereotypical friends the viewer might have while watching certain movies (i.e. the man who always falls asleep during movies, the man who has memorized every line from his favorite movie, and the heckler who spits on people below the balcony while watching movies). If the audience has love for any of these characters, it is because they relate to them on a very truthful level. They might actually know people like the ones portrayed in the film.Romantic Love: Tornatore not only shows the love Salvatore has for movies, but also the romantic love he has for Elena. As mentioned earlier, this love is demonstrated when he proves himself by waiting day and night for ninety days?through rain and sunshine?outside her house. His purpose in waiting is that he hopes for her to develop a love for him. This is a beautiful sequence because earlier this story was told to Salvatore by Alfredo as a simple anecdote with no real meaning. Salvatore, however, believed there was meaning to it and becomes an active participant in bringing the story to life?thus acquiring him love.Restoration of Love: Despite Salvatore's love for movies and Elena, there seems to be a void of love in his life that he wishes to restore throughout the film. In the beginning, the absence of his father's love causes him to look to Alfredo, who acts as his surrogate father. Later in the story when he loses Elena and moves away from home, the relationships he has with other women deteriorate. He moves from one woman to another in hopes to restore what he once had with Elena but never quite filling the void. Both of these loves (fatherly and romantic) are beautifully restored to him at the end of the film. Alfredo leaves behind a spliced reel of all the censored kisses that were taken out by Father Adelfio. These images were ones that Salvatore wanted as a child but were never given to him. The reel not only represents his love for film, but also his love for romance. Because it was spliced specifically by Alfredo, Salvatore's love is once again restored and he feels he is complete.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in a Spanish class in high school (my teacher must have loved this movie so much and we had nothing to do) and it really opened my eyes to foreign cinema. Cinema Paradiso is about a boy in love with the cinema and a girl and how his adult friend, the film operator in the local theater, wanted the best for the boy. The movie has a theatrical version and a director's cut. I would suggest watching the theatrical cut, which is actually my favorite, before watching the director's cut. The director's cut answers a lot of unanswered questions in the theatrical cut, but in my opinion it went a little bit too far in explaining certain things. Telling the story in flashbacks of his early youth and later teenage years was a fine way of developing the characters. My favorite part of this movie is the ending, which still and probably will always remain my favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bittersweet Tenderness in Cinema Paradiso</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>recognizes the ennobling effect movies can have on viewers, and then proves this maxim by inspiring tenderness in the viewer. Though the story aptly concerns itself with the bitter effects of war on a family, the modernization of small towns, the distortion of culture, and the loss of young love, its lasting impression is the positive effect a loving mentor can have on the life of an individual despite such hardships. Salvatore's adult life does not reflect much outlet for emotional development, so the audience can infer the importance that his childhood, particularly Alfredo, held for him and his maturity. This loving relationship is most poignant for the audience because it occurs between believable individuals. Neither Toto, nor Alfredo, nor their town is reflected as perfect. Rather, they are all shown to have their flaws, their pompousness, humility and crazy characters mixed in with their beauty, compassion and adoration. This film is well balanced and will warm any audience, at any time, with its ageless story of humanity, regret, growth and love.The film style of Cinema Paradiso makes the audience feel the love between Toto and the other characters, particularly Alfredo. Lighting and sound create a storm whose ear-shattering thunder and bright lighting during Salvatore's life review make the audience imagine how deeply he's responding to what he has been told: that Alfredo has died. Also, close-ups of adult Salvatore's face during the same time reveal these deep emotions. The music of Cinema Paradiso is perhaps the most touching element of film style used. Throughout the entire film, variations of the same song are slowed down or sped up during fitting times, and played with varying instruments. This is highly metaphorical, revealing the connection between the bitter and sweet times of life and perhaps, the continuing influence of Alfredo's love throughout Salvatore's highs and lows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A In-depth look of Cinema Pardiso. (Review based on a viewing of the international version in its original language with English subtitles)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso is a film about a filmmaker named Salvatore, who remembers his past when learns of the death of Alfredo, the Cinema Paradiso's projectionist, with whom Salvatore formed a deep and lasting bond with as a child, and through this relationship began his trip down the film-making and movie pathway. While by no means nonfiction, this movie could effectively be perceive as a documentary or reenactment of key turning points of Salvatore's life that have been coordinated with music and minor special effects to make it highly entertaining to an audience. This movie's plot is so immersed in realism that it makes a person feel as if he or she are actually there in that small Sicilian village; they learn of its community's ins and outs, from its' more devout religious priest to its crazy homeless guy who insists that the square belongs to him. The viewer grows to love these quirky characters and, for the most part, enjoys watching how the characters change or remain unchanged as time progresses from Salvatore's early childhood years to his adolescent years, his young adult years, and finally his adult years. Cinema Paradiso thus appeals to those who seek quality character development and the kind of community provided by the movie.On the other side of the equation, the viewer should also be forewarned of the realism of this movie, it is armed to move its' viewers. The viewer has to endure Salvatore's adolescent years, whereupon the problems of love come up, and endure more severe tragedies within the childhood years of Salvatore's life. Cinema Paradiso also has nostalgia woven into its core, and once again uses its ability to connect with its audience giving them a sense of nostalgia for the Cinema Paradiso, the Sicilian village and its' people. This opens up an opportunity for the movie to show the unforgiving consequences of the passage of time, which, through the nostalgia, has the potential to deeply move its viewers. For those who do wish to be deeply moved, Cinema Paradiso might not be the best movie for them to see, yet for the moviegoer that prizes a movie's ability to movie its' audience, Cinema Paradiso is a must see movie. Cinema Paradiso's plot is such that it does not need special effects or flashy stunts to be successful. It uses a blend of lighting, camera angles, and music combined with very well done acting to achieve, from a purely technical standpoint, a well balanced movie. All in all, Cinema Paradiso is a movie that overcomes language barriers to appeal to wide range of audiences across the world by touching those universal traits that make people human.</fullReview>

It has absolutely everything, in all areas and dimensions, and the 250 plus commentaries have said it all or nearly all. I agree completely with those who believe this to be the most romantic love story ever filmed, ever. Let me add one observation. The structure of the Director's cut allows you to complete matters in a way which would have derogated a bit from the absolute excellence of the theme had it actually been pursued. Salvatore's final comment after the parting telephone conversation, the promise rediscovered in the dusty operator's booth note, and the inexpressibly moving montage from Alfredo tell it inescapably.</fullReview>

Now being an Indian I am used to watching films that are well over 220 minutes length, But the only complain i have from this awesome movie is the pacing.There were some really wonderful moments in the film. Virtually every scene between Alfredo and Toto was nice,especially the one where ALfredo saves him from his mother, and the one where he comes to give an exam.and the Final scenes where the Cinema Paradiso is dynamited to the ground and the subsequent film that Toto sees which Alfredo had left for him. There is no denying about the level of the subtleties of the emotions conjured and the delicacy of the treatment.Performance by all the Actors is very believable, especially Alfredo and Little Toto.There was a similar movie that was made in India which had the same feel. It was Swades. I mean the movie had an altogether different premise but some of the emotions it evoked were familiar to the one Cinema Pradiso Did.I would give it 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I assume before you get to this, if you do you'd have read for quite a while. But if you do you'd know the story line quite well by then, I won't help you very much. My comment is more of an "homage" to Philipe Noiret whom I keep calling Jean Noiret? Who passed away 2 days ago and so creates a big vacuum to fill in the cinema industry. Reading a few comments I was rather surprise to see no reference to Philipe Noiret as a French person in an Italian movie. This shocked me almost as much as I recognised him when I went to see this wonderful and quite talked about movie in Sydney (yes Australia) open air screening in the city botanic garden, (I think during the Sydney Festival that is the month of January...some years ago). One comment I read, said "Phillipe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio give the kind of performances usually associated with much more recognizable actors. Is it very french to feel like sneering at such a remark? Perhaps but I do so without hard feeling just realising that in this (Bill Gate) anglophone world it's excusable; but also feel so privileged to have had some 20 years of french culture before leaving it for ever. Well! August 2011 and I decided to put my VHS tape onto a DVD As I watched a little of the dubbing I was very stirred by this lovely story. I guess if my dubbing is not to perfect it won't matter as a little aging is very much in the grain anyway. I was amazed, whilst reading some more reviews about it, that some people could find it "cliche" and or boring, most other reviews were so full of compliments about it as I think this story deserves. I don't know how it would go with younger people who have no idea of what these days were, and what made those days. I too have to say this film rates very much on the top and with the best films available.</fullReview>

The basic message is, if you love movies, you will understand. I often think of the "Hollywood", my childhood theater which still stands, but is in horrible disrepair. If I had the cash I'd love to refurbish it to entice a new generation to what movies should be.I am glad I saw the "shorter" version. I was not all that interested in Salvatore as a 50-ish adult, but he was fascinating as a child and young man. I'm sure the longer version would have just been a chore to get through.</fullReview>

It is a coming of age story about Toto, a child who loses his father in the war and is befriended by Alfredo, a local movie theater operator, who is pivotal in ensuring his later status as a famous director. They are there to save each other's life. The other village residents progress over time also, so that one sees them age, mini stories within a story! The village madman, the romantic couple, the censuring priest, Toto's grieving mother all play a role in making Toto a success in life. The ending is a touching tribute to Toto from now deceased Alfredo, a loving gesture of devotion that will make the tears flow. Who hasn't lost someone without a final goodbye?

It leaves so many questions and has such mystery and innocence. All of the questions which it left (and which made it so fantastic) were answered by the Director's cut. When I saw the Director's cut (by accident) I was so disappointed. I had looked forward to watching the film and being warmed by the innocence and sentimentality but instead I was left feeling altogether different. The Director's cut may have had scenes of great passion but for me the film isn't about sexual passion but about an intense love (of film and of romance) so for me the short version of this film is the greatest...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a definite masterpiece, a classic if I must say. This film is about choosing a life of love or money gives us a beautiful story about this young boy who grows up to become a successful man in the movie industry. The film starts with the protagonist as a wealthy man living in the big city. He immediately gets a telephone call from his mother saying that Alfredo is dead. With that, he relapses into a state of dream to show us his story, a story of his time with Alfredo, the man who works with the movie projector, and a story of his one true love, Elena. The story also has family elements and we can see the way that the relationship between Toto (the main character) and Alfredo grows from beginning to end. The soundtrack is also a heartwarming collection which really adds to the imagery and tone. The tunes in this movie have stuck with me and are stuck right into my mind, but I don't mind because they are artistic pieces which remind me of this delightful and insightful movie.</fullReview>

The whole history is just like a dream with painful and good memories. And you don't need to know if the history is out in screen. It is into you. Everyone lost so many thing as a child.

		<shortDescription>The 30 Greatest Films Ever Made, Continued</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a film comes along that moves us in ways we don't see coming. Films like Imitation of Life, and Cinema Paradiso. I cried during Cinema Paradiso. There. I said it. Happy? I'm not going to say it again. And mind you, I didn't cry a lot, just a little bit at the end.Just try and watch it yourself and not cry. Because nostalgia is the saddest thing in the world.It has a happier beginning though. Cinema Paradiso begins sometime in the 40's in a small Italian town where the priest censors out kissing from all the imported Hollywood films (he calls it "pornography"). The theater projector, Alfredo, is the one in charge of cutting the scenes out. And a little boy named Salvatore visits often to ask if he can run the projector himself and maybe steal a few of the edited clips. A bag of them in his room catches fire and nearly destroys his home. His mother instructs Alfredo never to let Salvatore near the theater again. At first, he does. But the boy's love of the movies brings him constantly back, and Alfredo's heart warms to the boy.In one of the more magical scenes in the movie, a small crowd gathers outside the theater when the theater is full, asking to see the movie before it gets too late for them to stay up. Salvatore watches as Alfredo removes the back of the projector and uses a mirror to reflect the movie onto the wall of someone's house, where the audience brings chairs and watches contently.Salvatore grows older. As a teen, he mainly runs the projector, (the theater is no longer censored by the priest - now it occasionally shows porn), takes photographs and falls for a wealthy new girl in town. The film is predictable in plot, but not predictable in the way it makes us follow it s storyline eagerly. The film is scored by Ennio Morricone (who reuses a theme or two from "The Untouchables") and is directed by Gieuseppe Tornatore. After a stint in the army, Salvatore comes home and finds the town lonely, desolate. Alfredo tells him: "Living here day by day, you think it's the center of the world. You believe nothing will ever change. Then you leave: a year, two years. When you come back, everything's changed. The thread's broken. What you came to find isn't there. What was yours is gone. You have to go away for a long time... many years... before you can come back and find your people." Alfredo tells him to leave and become a movie director...and never look back. Salvatore does so, and we cut to him in his 40's or 50's, when he learns that Alfredo died. And so he returns home.Some films are great because they are filled with nostalgia for a forgotten era. Like the popular teen films "American Graffiti" and "Dazed and Confused" which were homages to eras the directors hadn't forgotten when everyone else had. Cinema Paradiso is so filled with this nostalgia that you feel as if you had lived in this small Italian town yourself. You can almost smell the sweaty theater in summertime. The "Cinema Paradiso" screens Jason and the Argonauts, Humphrey Bogart films, and plenty of small, mostly forgotten Hollywood romances. It also screens joy, love, disappointment, sadness, nostalgia, friendship, laughter, and magic."Cinema Paradiso" is a film for the ages, and for all the ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director's cut is a very different movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Cinema Paradiso is my personal favorite of all time. I've just recently seen the Director's cut, and I can't emphasize enough how very different it is from the original, in theme. It does far more than just fill in plot gaps you may have thought existed in the original.I noticed at least one poster pointing out that the Director's cut is darker. I think that is an understatement. Alfredo's love for Toto is no longer pure and innocent, but instead misguided, and maybe even intentionally destructive. Afredo's underhanded efforts to keep Toto and Elena apart from each other were like the manipulations of an overprotective parent who, believing he/she knows what's best for the child, alters the course of the child's entire adult life without the child ever realizing it.Alfredo made a choice that should have belonged to Toto. Career over love. Alfredo didn't believe true love exists in real life, but only in the movies. And in the end, all that Alfredo has to offer Toto are those glimpses of movie love that can never be real. I find this incredibly sad.Amazingly, that very same final scene in the original version, rather than being the tragic result of a life-changing deception, is a celebration of Alfredo's pure love for Toto. I say "pure" because, in the original, Alfredo is not responsible for the separation of Toto and Elena; that comes about merely because of chance or fate. What we are left with then in the original, regarding Alfredo, is what I believe to be the ultimate act of love a parent can give a child: after preparing the child for life, pushing the child away, into the real world, at great pain to the parent. This Alfredo does, and it's portrayed with great emotion.The Director's cut has to stand on its own as a very good film. But the original remains my personal favorite for its joyful portrayal of a man's struggle to live life with the help of a loving surrogate father -- a life whose hard edges are not the result of a betrayed trust.</fullReview>

I'm a young writer, and watching this film always fills me with the resolve to create a singular masterpiece that will unite every sensibility and belief I wish to espouse into a timeless whole: memories, comforts, desires, ideals. From the first frame it's clear that "Cinema Paradiso" is a deeply personal labor of love, and it deserves a spot on the cinematic landscape next to films like "Gone With The Wind," "Citizen Kane," "To Kill A Mockingbird," "8 1/ 2," and "Schindler's List." This film glows with passion and heart and is universally romantic (read: heterosexual men will be touched too, I think). It is a fitting tribute to a medium able to unify and diversify, repel and educate, entertain and enlighten. The final scenes are as moving and memorable as anything I've experienced, and that includes real events in my own life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie made me cry because it managed to arouse powerful feelings and thoughts about life - the things you learn from it, the people that have an impact on you, the experiences that build you as a person and the way you understand to live it. Toto, the boy fascinated with the cinema and the old man Alfredo, that shows him around the cinema's secrets at it's beginnings, make a wonderful example of friendship. They help each other, learn from each other, laugh together and enjoy life at its fullest through that one thing that connected them in the first place - the cinema. Italian movies have a roughness and a freshness that make them real, away from clichés and well designed everything as the American movies thought us it should be. This film reminded me of "La vita e bella" with Roberto Begnini, where another boy discovers life (and stays alive) being influenced by a grown up. And if you're looking for more humor and surprising situations, don't miss "La vita e bella".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film really touched me - maybe it's because I live in Greece that has many similarities with Italy, but I dont think it is just that.It reminded me of the innocence of childhood, the true excitement of first love, the bittersweet taste of growing, the love of a mother to a child and it also reminded me the magic taste of cinema -haven't had this pleasure for a long time from a film...Well, it seems as if all these things are at one point fading and what remains is pieces of film stitched together that makes us cry, like Salvatore. Yet their existence we can never forget, since it's a part of us, part of what we are. We carry our childish soul for a long time :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I LOVED it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At my school we have foreign language week and during that week we watch a foreign film and this year it was Cinema Paradisio. The previous years, the movies chosen were not so great and I was bored throughout the entire movie...but this movie was touching and tear jerking. I thought it was the sweetest movie that I have ever seen and it is towards the top of my favorite movies list. It tells a great story about friendship and understanding between a young boy and an older man. I sincerely recommend seeing this movie. I think it's right up there with Life is Beautiful when it comes to foreign films. You will not be wasting your time with this movie. See it, you will be missing out if you don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Original Theatrical Cut (118 min version)Salvatore (Toto) is a successful filmmaker who gets the news that his oldest friend Alfredo has died, having not seen him or his home in 30 years he reminisces on the past. We are told in flashback of Totos childhood and how he became friends with Alfredo, the projectionist at the local movie theatre ? Cinema Paradiso.The first hour of this film is a delight to watch, Toto and his relationship with Alfredo is adorable and the scenes of crowds desperate to get in to see movies, and their wonderment when they do makes you realise how spoiled we are now with our home cinemas which we take for granted.It is once the story of Totos childhood is over and we move to his adolescence that the film becomes less appealing. Marco Leonardi as the teenage Toto had no chance of being as watchable as Salvatore Cascio who plays him in his younger years, and the love interest seems dull and unconvincing in comparison to what preceded it. It is worth persevering though because once we are brought up to date the film returns to the central story of the friendship between Toto and Alfredo and though the ending may be predictable, it is no less moving for it.Note: The DVD I watched also has an extended directors cut which includes an extra 50 minutes of footage that the producer insisted should be removed. I am yet to watch it but am led to believe that the bulk of this footage revolves around Toto and Elena. This may or may not change my opinion of that storyline.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm happy to know this one has made it into the top 100 or so of the IMDb list.When it was first released, I hesitated to see it in the cinema. (Too much buzz, as they say now.) Then, when I did, I was moved left and right all the way through. At the end, I recognized 'Platinum Blonde' and I couldn't believe it!This film is what cinema is all about: our own memory connecting to the memory of a filmmaker - but this film takes this idea one step further. I own the VHS version and I have watched the last clip many times with such joy. (I haven't seen the new version. Maybe I will, but I suspect I'll still feel the same.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two great films in one!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loved the original (1989) version: the story of a young boy growing up fatherless and precocious. It took Salvatore (Toto) through his life: his childhood, his first love, his success as a film director (which seemed to have happened because Alfredo gave him the gift of loving the cinema), and a special gift from Alfredo after he died, which showed how things had literally come full circle.The New Version is a completely different film. All of the 1989 film is there, but with the real story of Elena and Toto, and Alfredo's meddling in their love and lives. I liked this one just as much, perhaps even more, granted though it may be because of somewhat personal reasons. Anyway, the scene when they finally meet up again is very haunting and well worth the investment if you own the old one. (The New Version actually has both: one on each side of the DVD).I highly recommend this film: it will stand the test of time!!!Buon Natale a tutti!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film tailored to make you feel better. It has its moments, but its strongest point is the build-up of the relationship between Toto and Alfredo. Fantastic work and marvellous acting. Unfortunately it doesn't try to avoid getting corny and Tornatore picks at times the easy way of emotional manipulation. Nice after a bad day at the office but watch out for lots of cliches.</fullReview>

The director's cut is tempted into inserting the mundane and tedious that in real life would not make the "Rememberer's Cut."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the DVD at home. At first, I didn't expect this to be so interesting to watch, I was planning to watch something else after 10 or 20 minutes, because it seems to be so long (almost 2 hours). Once I started the movie, I just can't stop watching till the end. Then I found out that on the side B, it has over 50 minutes extra in the new version. Now I wish that I could have just watched this new version instead. Anyway, this is definitely a timeless classic. I am surprised to find out that it was made in 1988, and today is August 23rd of 2003. The film still hasn't lost its freshness and attraction, as you probably know that different films in different years have quite different art directions. The music is distinct, and was used at the right times. They are similar to the music in `Life is Beautiful.'  It is indeed emotional, and touching. However, the bottom line is that it is just an ordinary story about one ordinary person. At the end, I don't think that it has inspired anyone to do great things in the future, etc. There is not much real ups or downs. It is very similar to the Chinese movie called `Shadow Magic.' And I also liked the story that Alferdo told the Toto about the young man waited for 99 days then left on the last day. I like movies that end with questions, and unfinished romance. It makes me wonder what really happened to the girl that he loved....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant example of sentimental film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film shows how friendship and love can defy even the greatest logic. The love for film, which almost kills his sister and the friendship of the projectionist which makes him return home, even though he vowed he never would. The film is timeless, and well constructed. Unlike the other reviewer the key moment for me was not the young boys masterbating but instead the sentimentality displayed throughout the film. One point to note is that the projectionist does not die in the fire, he is only blinded, an ironic symbol, taking away the one thing that allowed the old man pleasure, watching the films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't but reiterate that this is simply one of the most magical experiences I've ever had watching a movie. The idea that this film is filled with clichés is reviewers being familiar with the tropes but not being able to, or not trying to understand the film on anything but a completely superficial level. CP is homage to the power of movies and a lyrical riff on formula. The story has elements of magical realism that inform the narrative with an almost surreal quality at points. Man, I love this film. The denouement at the end never fails to bring me to tears. I have seen thousands upon thousands of films, and believe me this is as good as it gets... Though not as playful, or clever as Ameile Poulain it is cut from the same cloth. It's seems important to note in lieu of some of the other comments that I have not seen the director's cut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, the "director's cut" is the ORIGINAL version. We Americans saw the "edited version"....It's funny, I recommend the "cut version"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW**The director's cut changes the motivation of Alfredo's character. Although you may understand where he's coming from...Alfredo plays "God" with Toto's life and it makes me sad. For me, it's still a nice movie, but not as sweet as when I first saw it as the "edited version." The "edited version" leaves some issues hanging which makes the ending that much more fascinating and tender. The "director's version" ties up the loose ends...and in many ways, you may become angry. Cinema Paradiso has went from one of my top 20 movies and dropped out of my top 100.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Italians do it better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure there are a plethora of "coming of age" flicks out there, but nothing like this. In fact I find it difficult to categorise Cinema Paradiso, as it has so many ingredients which blend almost seamlessly into the narrative arc - drama, humour, pathos, suspense, romance, plus depictions of the ever changing religious, familial, political and social environments in the Sicilain town of Giancaldo. At its core, Paradiso's main theme is obviously the love of cinema. The film celebrates the medium's ability to bring a group of rather disparate people together for a couple of hours to indulge in a pastime that, for some, is a nice escapist diversion. However, for Salvatore Di Vita ("Toto"), it becomes his passion.*** POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT ***Seemingly abandoned by Elena (his first love) and prompted to broaden his horizons by his mentor Alfredo, twentysomething Toto leaves Giancaldo and eventually becomes a succesful filmaker. The original (ie shorter version) suggests that Salvatore has abandoned his his hometown merely to further his career. The director's cut adds more subtextual layers to the plot, and confirms that Salvatore has shunned his past because in some ways, it was too painful to face. Therefore we see a more wistful, regretful and perhaps even cynical Salvatore. His reunion with Elena gives him some closure, yet, despite his success with his first love (film), he still longs to find true love and fulfillment.Nobody can convey emotional honesty on film more effectively than the Italians, however, Paradiso's sentimentality is not as obvious and therefore manipulative as the so-called sentiment in most English speaking dramas (Forest Gump, Patch Adams, etc). Rather, the emotion just creeps up on you - the score and the cinematography are continually affecting, absorbing, and evocative. For lovers of film and hopeless romantics (like myself), the release of emotion Toto exhibits in the final scene will stay with you for days. No matter how many times I see it, the sheer power of the scene always gives me goosebumps.With excellent characterisations realised by superlative acting, a compelling and moving story, and a finished product which is technically (editing, mis en scene, score, etc) A1, I cannot recommend this film enough.So very few films offer the viewer the opportunity to temporarily inhabit another world, whilst at the same time perhaps, contemplate their own lives - their pasts, their passions, their dreams. The stack of international accolades the film has won (seen at the start of the Directors cut) speak for themselves. Cinema Paradiso is a rare, timeless gem.Ratings: ***** for the original version, ****1/2 for the more sombre, reflective directors cut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For all those who love film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film resonated deeply for me. Here were themes I can see in my own life, and I would say most lives- (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)- unrequited love (Jenny Hughes, second set maths), a lifelong passion for films (eight years as a cinema projectionist/box office assistant) and a gruff father figure to nurture that love (Colin Blasney, the area manager of the chain I worked for). Of course, this film is in Italian, and my life so far has not been.The film takes place over many years. The story is also set between the 40s and the 80s. But seriously, one might notice the length, especially with a director's cut that takes the running time towards something that Lean might recognise. Under the Italian sun- as seen in 'The Talented Mr Ripley'- a village grows, and adapts to such things as the war (it is never specified which), 'il boom', and the advent of video. This journey is seen through the eyes of a boy, as he becomes a man.Such a film might be sentimental. This avoids the danger, by including plenty of death and one blinding. 'blinding' might sum up the whole film. Like the (POSSIBLE SPOILER) director the main character grows up to be, it and everyone involved with it deserves all the awards they have (the ones to do with film, anyway). If you enjoyed movies about movies- 'State and Main', 'Last Action Hero'- you'll love this. In fact, you'll love it anyway. Come away feeling a deep sense of recognition, and a very Italian spring in your step. Unlike the main character, who is very old by the time the film ends.</fullReview>

There is now a new, full version of the film being shown in the U.S. Unlike many re-released movies with extra footage the new movie is taken to new heights. It helps to reconcile his relationship with Elena and allows the kissing montage at the end of the movie to take on a much greater significance.No matter how many times I see this film, it moves me equally with each additional viewing.

		<shortDescription>Two movie in one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a great fan of this film from a long time. Few movies had such an impact on me, than this wonderful tale. Tale about wisdom, love, friendship and bitter-sweet melancoly about TIME. Yes, it is, how we change, how could we change in flow of time? Nobody could do it, but on the screen it can turn to reality, that someone clearly sees his/her role in past. Time-levels are crossing each other in a stormy night in a director's mind, revealing long forgotten dreamscapes about his childhood, about his developement in friendship, love and life at all. The story is well known, so there's no point to recall it again. The ending is really fascinating, sad and something so delightful, that it couldn't be told better, and feelings could be deeply stormed. The story is a whole, telling us, makes us feel that although all went wrong in one hand, at the other everything is rewarded. That's the Oscar-winner one. Sooner i saw the director's cut version. Everybody, who liked the short version was upset about that one, telling us about vanishing and ruining the whole story with those added scenes. I can only admit, that anybody who really loves the international version will be very delighted by the director's cut. Why? 'Cause this one is the 'grown-up' version of the movie. The short ver. is much like a fairy tale with some perfect like, idealistic human characters with some feelings in one, or another side, but weaknesses are far away from then. The long ver. teaches us some very serious things about how human interacts with time and enlighten the whole story much sharper, giving us a feeling, that we are seeing a movie reminding us good old 'Cinema Paradiso' and it is damn good, anyway...I don't think, that either version is better. Not the question it is. The question from some point of view is that which one will teach and educate us better? It's your task, you have to decide it. See both versions (first the short one) and make your decision about your view of life. You won't be disappointed, either version you vote with your simpathy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good as Movies Get - and more...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it is virtually impossible to improve upon some of the reviews here, of the original 123-minute US release of NUOVO CINEMA PARADISO(1988), after viewing the 2002 "director's cut" version, one is compelled not so much to rebut or elaborate, as to offer an update. Seen in its entirety, Giuseppe Tornatore's masterpiece of sentimentality is no longer simply a visual love letter to the movies intertwined with a fable of the pleasures and pains of youth. With 47 minutes restored to the Academy Award winning version, what was once an engaging, light-hearted childhood story with an adult ending is now a deeper, more thought-provoking piece. Through the additional footage, the loveable characters are further developed, leaving us that much more time to sit in the darkened theatre, getting to know them in a new light and pondering their choices. It is as if we are time travelling voyeurs, going back to look into the lives of people that we thought we knew and then learning that their story was not all that it seemed. We are also sorely reminded of the missteps of our own youth and how as adults, we long to be able to rewrite our own stories. For those who have never seen the originally released version, there is now even more to appreciate in this film. For those who have seen it time and time again and are somewhat leery of a change, do not be afraid - your imagination still has much room to roam. And the moving, heart-tugging ending that you already know and love is now a powerful event that will leave your whole body aching for days after you have left the theatre - and then yearning to feel that same, sweet pain yet again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good film. It has all the charming elements which British and American viewers expect from a continental European movie; the cute kid, the grizzly old guy with a heart of gold, the rambling script, the beautiful - but not too beautiful - photography. However, all this talk of it being "one of the greatest films ever made" is really just frantic hyperbole. Yes, it's fun to watch (in parts, but can be boring too), yes, the characters are well developed (but not all, what about Elena?), yes, the emotion is there, but not poured over like treacle (except, as has been pointed out, the cliche cornfield shot).The only truly, truly wonderful thing about Nuovo Cinema Paradiso is the score - Morricone's music is utterly lovely, and well worth watching the movie for.So - a nice movie, yes, but there are a lot of nice movies out there. Try and watch it without gushing over everything just because you think you should, because someone told you it was the greatest movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I swear, the people who call this film one of the greatest of all time must not have watched the second half. The first half - when Toto is a boy - is pure magic, and one of the best love letters to the movies that has ever been written. Every shot, every scene, rings true. But then Toto grows up, and the film loses its focus. The magic continues in scenes of Toto and Alfredo talking, but too much time - far too much time - is given to the love affair with Elena. This would be okay if it actually led somewhere. But it doesn't...Elena leaves, and that's the last we ever hear of her. (note: this is the cut version from 1988 I'm talking about, not the director's cut. I understand that Elena's story is brought to an actual conclusion in the director's cut) And the scenes we do have with Elena are nothing new...we've seen this kind of "first love" story in countless movies before, and many of them did it better. (Whisper of the Heart comes to mind) Honestly, we even get the old "happy couple running through a field" shot. Throughout this sequence of adolescent Toto, there are countless little vignettes. But instead of helping to paint a picture of the town and how the movies effect them (as the excursions in the first part did), they're just sort of...there. It's like the director decided to throw stuff at the screen and hope it sticks.Then suddenly Toto leaves and we're brought to the present. But what I don't get is why we're supposed to think that his leaving was a good thing. Yes, the adult Toto is successful, but he's also unable to maintain a meaningful relationship, and seems to be extremely lonely and unhappy (not to mention virtually mute). We finally get the magic of the beginning back in the finale with the reel of kisses.Cinema Paradiso is as heartfelt a tribute to the movies as has ever been made, but as a human drama it falls flat in the second half. I was more heartbroken when the theater was demolished than I was when Elena leaves Toto. With the exception of Alfredo, the Cinema Paradiso itself is the only truly memorable character of the film. I'm still anticipating the "new" version however, since it seems to address many of my complaints.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New "Director's cut" is tedious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2002 "director's cut" is being shown in L.A. in June 2002. Having fond memories of the original I wanted to see this new version. Unfortunately, it was tedious and challenging to stay until the end (lopes in at over 2-1/2 hours). The original version only hinted at the future, and it was more enjoyable to let your own imagination fill in the details. The elongated director's cut spins it all out, tying everything together unbelievably. It also becomes a self-homage to an Italian FILM DIRECTOR. In short, the charm has been diluted and even the lovely soundtrack becomes repetitive. As with most things, stick with the original.</fullReview>

I remember renting the video many years ago and being taken by its flow that merged a coming of age theme of a young boy captured by cinema in an Italian town and his friendship with the theater operator. The operator was a somewhat mentor for the boy, and the film created an envelope around us -- the viewers -- as we watched a story on three parts. These parts were that of the young boy, that of the same man as a teenage, and that of the same as a mature adult who returns to town thirty years later. Once viewed, you must think about how your were manipulated by the director to actually be part of the film itself as you laughed at those in the film who emoted and cried, and yet at the end we, too, were that same audience.If you have a soul, and one that loves, and one that infinitely hangs onto past loves, or lost loves, or missed opportunities for a perfect love --- this is your movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Cinema Paradiso*The first time I saw Cinema Paradiso was last week. It was raining outside and nothing was on so I turned it to the old reliable Sundance channel. It was just starting. Immediately I am drawn into the atmosphere. When it was over I was left stunned, and my eyes full of tears. I watched it a second time today and I loved it even more. This time I noticed the characters, all so likable and charming. The feeling you get when you watch this movie is a feeling I have never experienced while watching a movie. I was swept away by the score, acting, directing, everything! When I think about it, theres nothing I can complain about this film.It won best foreign film the year Driving Miss Daisy took home best picture. Honestly this movie is a great deal better than Driving Miss Daisy and every film nominated that year. The romance between Toto and Elena is both heart warming and heart wrenching. Their kiss in the rain is the stuff movies are made of. And the score... I recommend this movie to anyone who loves movies. It's the ultimate ode to film.*10/10*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Cinema Paradiso in 1992, recommended by someone who was an avid fan. I liked French films so I figure a nice little Italian film wouldn't hurt.... Oh was I wrong. It immediately became my all time favorite (next to another sentimental favorite: Close Encounter of the Third Kind). Since then, I have watched it many times, and each time I was moved just the same.Granted, I am a sentimental fool, but I also resent overtly manipulative movies (e.g. Titanic). I know Cinema Paradiso is sentimental, and manipulative, but in a very nicely done way. The film worked for me at different levels. Sure, it's a lovely, simple story about innocence, growing up, first love, love, and loss. The poignant ending was simple yet extremely powerful, because it's built on the rest of the movie. I cried every time during the final frames...I have seen the long version with extra footage. While I appreciate the explanation and some very nice moments, I do prefer the shorter "theatrical release" version because I think it's more powerful, especially not knowing "whatever happened to Elena"... I know from a story-telling standpoint, you want to tell the audience what really happened, but from a dramatic standpoint, I think the director made a great decision by leaving things out the way he did.You will never know what ever happened to Elena, and that's the way it should be, I believe.The movie specifically worked for me because I shared many experiences that Toto/Salvator had:1. I love movies and grew up in movie houses (not cineplexes!! Movie magic is somehow lost in those tiny 40-seaters).2. I left home when I was 18 and didn't go back until years later -- I truly appreciated the nostalgic aspect of the story3. When I left I lost touch with my first girlfriend -- I never heard from her again, and as in the movie, I wonder whatever happened to her....4. What Afredo told Toto: "Go and make a life for yourself, and never look back" That's what I did...5. The relationship between Alfredo and Toto reminded me of the one between my father and me...So you can see that this movie speaks to me in a very personal level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie simply has something more than the rest of all the movies. It touches your heart, but not in the way that other movies try to do. This movie seems to manage brilliantly with no effort at all and the answer to how it manages lies in the fact that it is AUTHENTIC. I only know of another movie that manages this (my Personal #2) - 'Central Station'. The only difference is that one is so authentic in 1950's Italy and the other in Brazil.For this movie and 'The Legend of 1900' alone, in my opinion, Tornatore earns himself a place in the list of the top 10 directors of all time. I Fully Recomend this movie to all those who know how to appreciate a genuinely good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nuovo Cinema Paradiso is an unexpectedly beautiful and nostalgic film about the life story of an Italian director. The cinematography is superb, the acting flawless and the music is simply fantastic, suiting the story, appropriately used in the right moment. The film's duration seems too long, only because one thinks that this movie is about childhood upon viewing its first half, while in truth, it is rather a biography. It does seem, though, as if the director just cared more about the film's ending, rather than the film in its entirety and that he aims at our sensitivity in order to make us sentimental and wet-eyed so that we *like* the film. But, what the heck, we all need to be a bit sentimental sometimes, don't we?8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie theatre in the small town Giancaldo, Sicily, Italy, is what mesmerizes a young boy, Toto (in the years following WW2). He pursues a friendship with the crusty but warm hearted projecionist, Alfredo, who is played by Philippe Noiret, a French actor. He is, since the early sixties, one of the leading character actors in French film. We follow Toto and Alfredo through happiness, disaster, Toto's first love and the life of the villagers of Giancaldo. Captivating, bittersweet film, with a perfect finale; Noiret and the boy (Salvatore Cascio) are wonderful.The director Giuseppe Tornatore also wrote the screenplay for this Oscar winning film. After abortive Italian release in 1988 (at 155 minutes), film was shortened by a half hour and at the film festival in Cannes, 1989, Cinema Paradiso was awarded a special jury prize. Music was made by Ennio Morricone and Andrea Morricone. If you like movies like Dead Poets Society, The Remains of The Day etc, then this is absolutely a movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About a month ago, I saw that Cinema Paradiso was coming on the Sundance channel and noted that it had three and a half out of four stars. I also remembered seeing it listed on the IMDB top 250. But I had plans that day, so I wasn't able to see it. The next time that I saw that it was coming on, I had to be at work. I decided I'd tape it, though, and watch it when I got home. By the end of that evening, I was tired and was in no mood to stay up for an additional two hours. And since that time, I've just had the tape sitting in my room, waiting to be watched. I just finished watching it, and now I'm kicking myself for not watching it sooner. What a beautiful film this is. Everything about it was wonderful, particularly Noiret's Alfredo. His "speech" at the train station when Toto was leaving had me in tears. There are so many other great moments in this movie. It really shows you what we're missing in the States. Don't wait to see this movie like I did, watch it NOW.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the "magic" in movies is all about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since it's opening in North America 11 years ago I have managed to see this film no less than 15 times and I never grow bored or disinterested in it. (In the theaters I have seen it about 5 times, the rest on video/dvd)It may not be the best acted, or original in terms of story and characters, but a movie about the admiration for movies can only heighten the enjoyment for the viewer. I was so engrossed by the wonderful photography of the town and for it's inhabitants that I actually thought this place was real and that this little boy lived and worked there. I came out thinking that I had grown up there myself and was on a first name basis with all of the characters. It's a wonderful comment on the power of motion pictures, where they've come from and where they have gone. But what I am specifically draw to is the tragic yet tender closing of the main character's relationship with 2 people from his past, Alfredo the projectionist, and Elena his first true love. Sweeping and elegant, the film seems to take elements from classic European and American films and uses them to perfect the interactions between Toto, Alfredo &amp; Elena. Even though we have seen these kind of friendships/relationships in films many times over, the director manages to make them fresh and unique.A question I always had with the film was within it's closing credits. They use footage from the film as the credtis role past. But the very last scene shows a grown Toto looking behind himself to see a modern day version of his love Elena. This was what made me seek out information about another cut of the film. My first confirmations were through a Japanese movie magazine which showed stills from scenes not released in the 2 hour North American version. Years later the director's cut (162 mins) was released in the UK and I managed to get a copy. What a diference between the two! More footage of Toto as a teenager showing how he and his friends were just like any other "horny" teenagers. The footage also showed a darker side to Alfredo the likes of which were never even hinted at in the shorter version. But the one storyline I was waiting for was the grown Toto meeting Elena and finding out just what happened those many years ago. These added scenes gives the film a much more mature feeling and darker quality to it and really can not be compared to it's shorter companion.</fullReview>

So of course, I just had to watch it, and I'm so happy I did. It's a wonderful story of growing up, broken love, memories, dealing, family and changes. It shows how a young boy befriends a movie projectionist, becomes a teen and tries to capture the love of a girl his age and as an adult goes back to his hometown for the first time in years. Most people, especially Americans (and no offense) are just too lazy to read subtitles, but that's just their loss.If you're too lazy to read subtitles you'll be missing out on so many great films, including the Italian Oscar Winning 'Life Is Beautiful' and Brazilian Award Winning "Central Station", trust me, it may not be in English, but it's so much better than a lot of movies that are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite part of the movie is the story that the projectionist tells the boy about a soldier who waits outside a princess's window for 99 days, then leaves. The princess had promised to marry the soldier if he could prove his love for her by staying for a full 100 days. The projectionist ends the story by asking the question, "Why does the soldier finally give up when he is so close to his goal?" No answer is explicitly given in the movie, but I felt that the search for that answer was central to understanding the deep emotions that the movie stirred up in so many viewers.Another question is why the boy did not return to his home town sooner, despite requests from his aging mother. The movie engaged me with these questions that wouldn't leave and kept me searching for the gold, insights into life and love. It's a movie that gives back as much as you put in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite its numerous awards and nominations, this movie was not the impressive or striking drama it is supposed to be. It seems to drag on forever without plot or purpose or exposition. You keep on hoping for some merest sort of climax but there is (disappointingly) none. Its bad enough having to watch people watch movies when you have to watch a movie about people watching movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful in Every Way......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was only 10 yrs old when this film was nominated for an Oscar then in 89'. I remember watching a clip from it being shown during the ceremony and immediately it grabbed my attention....maybe it was the music, or the little boy....whatever it was, i wanted to watch that film.Years passed and somehow the film eluded me...until one night a few yrs ago, it was shown on TV. However i missed the whole film EXCEPT for the finale ( which i will not disclose )! So I scoured the whole island looking for the video but to no avail. Until one day it was released on DVD........This film is a simple one. It tells the story of a "father-son" relationship between a boy (Toto) and a cinema projectionist(Alfredo). Much of the story takes place in and around the local theatre:Cinema Paradiso. However, director Tornatore is able to use this backdrop to weave a beautiful tale of coming of age and life. Other than the growing relationship between the 2 leads, the lives of other characters are also brought into play as we follow them through the years; we laugh and cry with them as they watch their movies and also as incidents unfold upon them. Their films change from BnW to colour and genre to genre. Life lessons are learned as Toto grows up, falls in love and eventually leaves the small town in search of greener pastures. Along the way, Alfredo teaches him a thing or two about love and life, and peppers his sayings with quotes from movies. Sadly, the turning point arrives when Alfredo, all old and weary, runs out of quotes n urges Toto to leave "..this cursed place.."This film has no special effects, violence or sex. Every scene is beautifully lensed and accompanied by a great soundtrack. Filled with unforgettable moments, esp the Finale, it gets better with each viewing. Words would do no justice to such a gem. I highly recommend this film to anyone who watches movies....see it, U WILL NOT FORGET IT. Its Pure Cinema at its very best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cinema Paradiso" is an amazing example of a film. If the fact that this film is spoken in Italian has kept you away from this film, disregard that. You'll soon forget about the subtitles as the world this movie draws you into its wondrous world. Anyone who has ever believed in the magic that a movie projector can create will feel a tinge of nostalgic joy as this film shows a love of movies, friendship, romance and life that is simply not represented in every film. The musical score is emotional and romantic, and adds even more to the story. The story itself fulfills every expectation that a hopeless romantic could hope for. The ending has been mentioned repeatedly in other comments, but it's as memorable as what everyone praises it is. It never fails to touch me."Cinema Paradiso" remains one of my favorite movies of all time. A very warm and nostalgic movie that touches a person in a way that few films can. A Must-See.</fullReview>

The celebrations and the sorrows underscored by Ennio Morricone's unparalleled soundtrack make for exquisite, once-in-a-lifetime film-making. If you don't find yourself weeping with both joy and sadness for the latter half of the film, be sure you revisit Cinema Paradiso after you've acquired some more life experiences.

		<fullReview>The starting point for this movie must be the director's own experiences in southern Italy during the post-war years. The poverty is palpable. The boy lives his life, and has his life experiences, without specific reference to that poverty. This is very engaging--very childlike.The boy is caught up in the running of the village's theatre. The director transforms the theatre into a metaphor of life itself. The effect is quite subtle and, for me, long-lasting. I think about this film regularly.</fullReview>

This is no action packed thriller, it is poignant, sentimental and nostalgic, but so what. It is very atmospheric you can almost feel the heat of Sicily coming off the screen.This is another film to see on the big screen, don't bother with the video or 'horror of horrors' a dubbed version.

		<shortDescription>Wonderful homage to old-fashioned cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Motion Picture Academy got it thoroughly wrong. Cinema Paradiso should NOT have won the Oscar(tm) for best foreign picture; in fact, it should not even have been nominated for it.That's because this beautiful, warm, funny and heartbreaking film should really have been up there in the Best Picture category. Whether it could have beaten Driving Miss Daisy, or My Left Foot, or any of the others, is a moot point - but to relegate a film as wonderful as this one to a 'lesser' category, simply because the dialogue isn't in English, ought to be unacceptable.The story centres around one boy, but is really all about a love affair with the cinema. As such, the two main characters are Alfredo, the outwardly gruff man who runs the local picture house, and Toto, the little boy who works his way into Alfredo's affections. Both of them love the cinema, and there are many wonderful scenes inside the palace, which is clearly one of the main focal points of town life.There's not much plot - the by grows older, falls in love (which goes unrequited), goes away to do his stint in the military, and eventually moves away and becomes a successful businessman. He returns for Alfredo's funeral, and the whole film is one long reminiscence.But reducing this film to a precis of the plot is to do it a disservice. This was clearly a labour of love, and it has resulted in a remarkable film. The casting and acting is as near perfect as you could ask for; the ending is so funny and so meaningful it moves me to tears each time I watch. This is a film where you care deeply for the central characters, and even the picture house itself.I couldn't imagine watching a dubbed version of this; I don't speak Italian, but I think it would ruin much of the film's atmosphere. Please, if you get the chance, see this film - but only with subtitles!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hymn To Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso is a film about growing-up as much as it is a homage to the cinema; the pains of growing-up, the compromises and, eventually, the separation that it involves from those we love and the familiar surroundings that have helped to shape us. And in a real sense, despite what Varlaam (in an earlier comment) said about 120 minute popcorn ads, it acknowledges the role of film as fantasy, a fantasy that cannot last. But what a beautiful fantasy! Anyone who knows Italy well will recognise the emotional warmth that permeates the film, and in that sense, like Fellini's Amarcord, the film is inescapably Italian. But it is also universal in it's acknowledgement of loss through the inevitability of change. This is a beautiful homage to cinema, but also to the ties of friendship and community that help people to develop as fully-rounded human beings. That we see little of what the townspeople do is not the point. We don't need to. One advantage of films like Cinema Paradiso and Belle Epoque is that they may encourage many people to watch subtitled films, and to appreciate that a film robbed of it's original language and sounds is a film castrated. To those unaccustomed to subtitles, that alone is a reason for seeing this wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Rome, in the 1980s, famous Italian film director Salvatore Di Vita returns home late one evening, where his girlfriend sleepily tells him that his mother called to say someone named Alfredo has died. Salvatore obviously shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily in 30 years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo is, Salvatore flashes back to his childhood.It is a few years after World War II. Six-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Toto, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the movie house Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start off on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the fatherly projectionist, Alfredo, who takes a shine to the young boy and often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing when there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing a critical romantic kiss or embrace. The local priest had ordered these sections censored, and the deleted scenes are piled on the projection room floor. At first, Alfredo considers Toto a bit of a pest, but eventually he teaches Salvatore to operate the film projector.The montage ends as the movie house catches fire (highly flammable nitrate film was in routine use at the time) as Alfredo was projecting The Firemen of Viggi? after hours, on the wall of a nearby house. Salvatore saves Alfredo's life, but not before some film reels explode in Alfredo's face, leaving him permanently blind. The Cinema Paradiso is rebuilt by a town citizen, Ciccio, who invests his football lottery winnings. Salvatore, yet a child, is hired as the new projectionist, as he is the only person who knows how to run the machines.About a decade later, Salvatore, now in high school, is still operating the projector at the Cinema Paradiso. His relationship with the blind Alfredo has strengthened, and Salvatore often looks to him for help ? advice that Alfredo often dispenses by quoting classic films. Salvatore has been experimenting with film, using a home movie camera, and he has met, and captured on film, Elena, daughter of a wealthy banker. Salvatore woos ? and wins ? Elena's heart, only to lose her due to her father's disapproval.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of *those* movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't really think of many other movies that fit the same category as Cinema Paradiso. Right now I can only think of "It's a wonderful life" and "Amelie". But they are movies with a special spark. Movies that after the first few scenes you know that, regardless the development of the plot, you're now become completely involved with the story and the characters. You are *in* the story. It is often said that great movies are the ones that manage to convince the public that what they are seeing is reality, that the spell they cast is so well-carved that you don't notice that on the other side of the screen there's actors who leave their characters after the director shouts "stop", and people who work on the make-up, lightning, script. Great movies are those in which you forget that what you are watching a movie. Now, movies like Cinema Paradiso,, take it to a whole other level. It is not only that they make you believe you are watching reality, but that it's a reality deeply close to your heart. Two hours ago I'd never heard of Salvatore, Alfredo and Elena. But now they already seem like old-friends, people that know the purest of me, people that I don't want to believe that actually never existed, and were simply actors repeating the lines written by a guy. I actually want to believe they are somewhere in this real world. Movies like Cinema Paradiso completely blur the line between that side of the screen and us.It is therefore completely senseless that I spoke about the direction, the magnific editing, the outstanding performances and the touching music. Because that would mean to accept that Salvatore and Alfredo never existed, and I refuse to do that. At some point, Alfredo says that life is much worse than in the movies. But right now, after having just finished Cinema Paradiso, I want to believe it is not. I want to believe I am right now in that world where magic can happen, a world where, somewhere in Rome, Salvatore is kissing Elena.I don't usually cry in the movies. There have been some movies that do make me cry, though. Holocaust movies like La vita ? bella are especially good at that. But most of the movies that make me cry are because they are particularly sad. Few movies have made me cry of happiness the way Cinema Paradiso did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso is a film about a man who remembers his childhood and how he fell in love with the movies. I think the reason Cinema Paradiso works on so many levels and so well for movie lovers is that many can relate to the story. We see this boy grow up and fall in love with film, we see him fall, rise, make friends, have a mentor, his first love, his first heartbreak. And haven't we all felt that? Haven't we all wondered what if? This movie goes through all those stages in the man's life, and it's wonderful.The ending is so perfect, because throughout the last act, we notice that Toto feels insecure about his decisions in life. Did he do the right thing? And he wonders if Alfredo was right in telling him to go away for good...because, who is he to tell him how to run his life? But in the end, Salvatore, now a famous director, watches all the kiss scenes that were cut out that Alfredo was holding for him since he was a kid. He realizes his love for film, and that he needed to leave in order to become the man he is now. He watches the reel in tears, realizing he owes everything to Alfredo.Cinema Paradiso is a film that most movie lovers will enjoy, I am sure of it. It's full of homages to the movies and it reaches with warmth even to the hardest of hearts. It's funny, sometimes sad, but throughout, beautiful. It is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie could truly touch any movie-lover. It is a story of a film director reminiscing on his years growing up, his involvement with movies, the theater, and one particular mentor and friend. Even if it isn't in your native language, the story was sentimental and holds something that everyone can directly relate to, whether you are from a different time period, background, culture, or country. It covers events like the changing of the times, first love, family hardships, friendships, and moving on with your life to bigger and better things. I think this is one of the most well made movies I have ever seen. The acting was incredible (especially the youngest version of our main character), the story charming, the music complementary, and the homage to the world of cinema was astounding.

Plus, the apparent moral of the story (Alfredo's philosophy) is possibly not such a great philosophy.However, you will easily forget the flaws once the movie is over.

It's one of those towns where everybody knows everybody else in the town and seems like an incredible place to grow up. Toto, eventually moves out and makes it as a Big Filmmaker in a big Italian City but realizes the experiences he had growing up as a child where so precious and profound and could never be replicated. I think because of this he could never go back to his hometown. It would be to painful to recall such precious and lost relationships.

The man who plays Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) does a brilliant job of portraying his character as the man behind the movies; and when the fire occurs, that whole scene with Alfredo and Salvatore 'Toto' invokes tears into all the viewers eyes. I know I spent a good portion of the rest of that movie with a Kleenex box next to me. I myself am of Italian nationality and it was truly wonderful to see a good Italian movie, with a great story line as well as great actors and comedic relief where it was needed. The nice thing is that if you don't want to watch it with subtitles, you can change the language. Although, I do recommend that you watch it with subtitles as it keeps it more authentic when watching it in Italian. I have personally watched this movie at least 10 times and never seem to get tired of it. All in all a truly great movie, 100% worth your time :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing, thought-provoking, deeply-insightful, emotionally-riveting winner!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well. Wow. Let me absorb this all for a moment. Alright. So that was... one of the best films I have seen in who knows how long. It is definitely on my all-time favorites list. Such an amazing film about film... but so, so much more. It is about friendships- the very best two people can share. The multitude of ways one person, one place, one passion can change your life for eternity; without which you would be a different person altogether. This film makes me want to experience the small town life that I never have, in any way before- to have so many people who know you so well; who grew up with you or watched you grow up; who can be proud of everything you have become; who love you in ways people who have not known you since you were a baby; A place where you can return decades later to find that everything has been the same after all these years, yet, at the same time, changed. This film inspires in me a love of films than span lifetime(s) in a way that very few others have. This film makes me think about so many things: redemption, regret, love, hope, friendships, trust, appreciation; how clinging to the past can be such a rewardingly bad tendency, how so many things we have no power over are so blatantly unfair, how, in the name of love, the most difficult decisions are inevitable made. I would kill to have a friendship like Toto &amp; 's. I am regrettably obligated to clarify that, however. Alfredo's decision regarding Toto &amp; Elena made me so upset that... I didn't know whether I could like his character anymore. His decision and actions were out of place, mean, and wrong. In the end, though, I suppose I can only say I respect Alfredo less, as I know, in his heart, he wanted what he felt was best for Toto. I emphasize, what he felt. And that's my point exactly. Because it was not his place and therefore not his right to do what he did- his sincere care and love for Toto irrelevant in this case- although mitigating the severity of his wrong. I agree that in some ways what evolved was best for Toto- but for his career. And I am an adamant believer that love is always the No. One priority in these lives of ours. At the end of the day, financial woes, careers, daily nuisances aside, love is what matters at the end of the day; at the end of a lifetime. Toto shares this philosophy, as made obvious several times. Secondly, why in heaven's name didn't the two of them rekindle their rare, genuine love at the end? I understand that some things in life can become too late t retrieve, but, again, I agree with Toto- they should have resumed it. I know neither of them ever loved anyone else, vows or not, anywhere near as powerfully. And, despite what I may say, contrary to all logic, I wish for a love like Toto &amp; Elena's. As the saying goes, "It is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all." I understand that times were different then, but, perhaps unfairly, I am upset with Elena. For not choosing true love over her family's unreasonable demands (although she did redeem herself). For not agreeing to set things right at the end. The only other issue I have is with the plausibility of some specific details. First, falling in love without ever talking, at first sight? And then Elena reciprocating, but, almost even more unbelievably, only after watching him wait outside her place for a year? Secondly, Toto's devotion to waiting outside is as unbelievable as the "soldier's" to the princess. Men like that could and would not ever exist. I would have identified so much more had it been more realistic. "Of course I remember you..." "Life is not what you see in films... Life is much harder." Amen to that. So extremely, heart-breakingly sadly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying, being a film lover, this story was incredibly powerful for me. I thought the cast was excellent, every performance touched on all the right points, the writing was superb, the main characters were well developed?and I never knew would have thought that scraps of film put to together would make me cry. This was a film that I never wanted to end. It is a multi-layered love story and and really just a story about how life unfolds. The way that many things are brought up in the film casually and then used later for emotional impact is quite beautiful. I know some people are "afraid" of foreign films, but if you watch only one ? make it this one. I highly recommend this film as an example of how meaningful films are constructed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen a better movie in my life. This movie would make you cry if you have had a good childhood. It's a movie about nostalgia, reality of life, and about the importance of relationships we develop during our early days. It happens in a small town. As I was born and brought up in a small village I can relate to every aspect of this movie. It talks about love, sex, tenderness, comedy, disappointments and achievements. A must watch for everyone with a heart. The characters, the story, the direction, story telling and casting are just amazing. The actors did a wonderful job. It is a movie where the characters foresee what's going to happen. It's a movie with so many different levels. Simply breathtaking. Even though the pace slows down a bit towards the end, I would not consider it as a drawback.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this when it came out in the 80's. Loved it so much, and never forgot it. I've probably seen it once or twice since then, and having watched it just now one more time, I can say that it's a film that simply never gets old. I've seen many amazing movies, but none of them have ever created emotions inside me like this one. The joy of seeing life in the old days, in a small Italian town full of colorful people and life, the look on little Toto's face when he was with Alfredo watching movies, the pain of regrets in later life and coming back home. It's just an unbelievable movie, nothing else like it.I just wish we could have more movies like that. Alfredo is one of the most lovable characters I've seen in cinema, a perfect father-figure played so well that it's practically flawless. The music is the cherry on top. The way all the elements have been brought together is nothing short of magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Offers Issues About Youth, Coming Of Age And Reflections In Adulthood About The Past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso, is an Italian drama film written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore. The film stars Jacques Perrin, Philippe Noiret, Leopoldo Trieste, Marco Leonardi, Agnese Nano and Salvatore Cascio; produced by Franco Cristaldi and Giovanna Romagnoli, and the music by Ennio Morricone along with his son, Andrea.Shot in director Tornatore's hometown Bagheria, Sicily, as well as Cefal? on the Tyrrhenian Sea,and told largely in flashback of a successful film director Salvatore to his childhood years, it also tells the story of the return to his native Sicilian village for the funeral of his old friend Alfredo, who was the projectionist at the local "Cinema Paradiso". Ultimately, Alfredo serves as a wise father figure to his young friend who only wishes the best to see him succeed, even if it means breaking his heart in the process.Cinema Paradiso offers a nostalgic look at films and the effect they have on a young boy who grows up in and around the title village movie theater in this Italian comedy drama that is based on the life and times of screenwriter/director Giuseppe Tornatore. The story begins in the present as a Sicilian mother pines for her estranged son, Salvatore, who left many years ago and has since become a prominent Roman film director who has taken the advice of his mentor too literally. He finally returns to his home village to attend the funeral of the town's former film projectionist, Alfredo, and, in so doing, embarks upon a journey into his boyhood just after WWII when he became the man's official son. In the dark confines of the Cinema Paradiso, the boy and the other townsfolk try to escape from the grim realities of post-war Italy. The town censor is also there to insure nothing untoward appears on screen, invariably demanding that all kissing scenes be edited out. One day, Salvatore saves Alfredo's life after a fire, and then becomes the new projectionist. A few years later, Salvatore falls in love with a beautiful girl who breaks his heart after he is inducted into the military. Thirty years later, Salvatore has come to say goodbye to his life-long friend, who has left him a little gift in a film can. Still rapturous after all these years, Cinema Paradiso stands as one of the great films about movie love as it is seen as an example of "nostalgic post-modernism",the film intertwines sentimentality with comedy, and nostalgia with pragmatism. It explores issues of youth, coming of age, and reflections in adulthood about the past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paradisiacal cinema? - Tornatore did it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you love movies you owe it yourself to see "Cinema Paradiso" made by the Sicilian director Giuseppe Tornatore. It contains about everything that the cinema is about (or maybe better: once was), and more. Tornatore also wrote the screenplay for this film and it can be felt throughout that the material comes from his heart, drawing from own experiences and those related to him - the director even has a cameo appearance as a projectionist in the final minutes. "Cinema Paradiso" is as powerful as it is not only because of its topic, the direction and the screenplay, but also because of its scope - spanning the whole lifetime of the main character -, its memorable imagery, Ennio Morricone's brilliant score and of course the carefully chosen cast headed by Philippe Noiret. By the way: Even grandmaster Fellini might have made it into the movie, intended for the role of the mentioned projectionist at the very end. But he replied to the director's request: "At such an important part of the movie putting a face so bulky like mine could be distracting to the audience. I suggest an unknown person instead: Let Tornatore do it!" Well, so we've still got a master of cinema up there at least - the one who made "Cinema Paradiso".To sum it up: Here we have not just any film about the cinema, it's the definitive one - and in the 50 minutes longer director's cut an already great experience becomes perfect. If you are reading reviews like this and still haven't seen it, you better finish this sentence and then be off to get it. Quick!</fullReview>

Seeing this film is more than an enjoyable experience, it is a visit with my relatives in the old country.The early flashback with Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) and young Salvatore (Salvatore Cascio) was the best part of the film. Alfredo is a surrogate father to Salvatore and the theater is his mother.Those who love film will love this movie as it is a celebration of all that is good about film. The excitement of the people, the way they were captivated, the part the movies played in their lives, is all there to observe and cherish.Film is not life; it is how we escape life.

The last scene i.e the collections of kissing scenes can arguably be termed the best movie scene ever in the annals of movie making. The relationship between Alfredo &amp; the kid would remain etched in ones memory forever. In the part when the theater catches fire &amp; all hell let loose, people running madly, how this kid rescues the projectionist is depicted wonderfully &amp; leaves an indelible impact on the viewers.

		<fullReview>I'll start by saying that I am a film lover and a hopeless romantic, one of those weirdos that would be happy to sit on their couch with popcorn and a movie all day. Now as a film fanatic, I see my share of terrible movies (Knight and Day). I see my share of mediocre movies (Kindergarten cop. I see my share of good movies (Pope of Greenwich Village). Then, sometimes, I see a movie that shakes me to my foundations. Usually, I watch a movie and if I enjoy it I'll say so and maybe mention it to some friends. However, when I see a movie like Cinema Paradiso, the next day I find myself sitting in my room, obsessively thinking about and Googling it. This movie (and of course its soundtrack) have haunted me from the day I first saw it (maybe eight months ago). I won't give anything away, but watch this movie! That said, I would like to make one thing clear: DO NOT RENT THE DIRECTOR'S CUT! The director's cut of this film takes a perfect piece of cinema and turns it into a pointless soap opera style piece of garbage. Rent the original cut, it's my second favourite film of all time (behind Amadeus) and you won't regret it. Now why are you still reading this? Go rent the movie!!</fullReview>

When the final 'Fine' appeared on screen, all six of us were crying our eyes out. Not just a couple of tears running down our cheeks: Sobbing like a bunch of two-year-olds. We were all still crying and hadn't said a word long after the credits finished rolling.I just watched it for the second time with my girl, and we were both crying even harder and longer than the first time.Being an artist myself I can only dream of ever creating a work as complete and moving as Cinema Paradiso.</fullReview>

Indeed, there is a maturation of the boy to a young man and finally an adult. He is adorable as a child, and rugged as an adolescent. When finally he becomes a prominent film director, he charms the audience with his looks as well as his pensive stare. There are moments of laughter that help to relieve the tension of a passionate love story. The The cinematography is displayed to perfection. The colors are a very attractive pastel that blends with the Itallian surroundings. All of the film shots in the movie house in his small town and captivating. This film is a must see to all serious moviegoers, and it should be placed at the top of one's list of films. It is definitely "two thumbs up" in the Hollywood vernacular. So sit back, relax, and be entertained with a brilliant portrayal of love, tragedy, comedy and just plain fun. One will likely find oneself thinking about the deeper meanings long after the show is over. Bravo to "Nuovo cinema Paradiso".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Makes European Cineam Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso is at the crux of everything that I believe makes European cinema superior to American. Cinema Paradiso is the reminiscence of a middle-aged Italian filmmaker, Salvatore who, upon learning of the death of his mentor, a projectionist named Alfredo, remembers his childhood in postwar Sicily and the movie house, the Paradiso, and the ways in which classic cinema is intrinsically tied to his memories and his life. When Salvatore returns to his village for Alfredo's funeral, he sees the old, abandoned Paradiso and watches it be demolished. He then returns to his life in Rome and watches a reel Alfredo left him of all of the classic movie kisses he had edited out of films over the years at the village priest's bequest. The major element that this great film has that is invariably absent from American dramas is subtlety. If Cinema Paradiso had been an American film, Salvatore wouldn't have reminisced much about his childhood; it would have been glossed over in a seven minute short leaving us with no character development. When he returned to his village for Alfredo's funeral, he most likely would not have been the thoughtful, taciturn man that we see, but some sort of vigilante ready to hatch some last minute, hair-brained, against-all-odds scheme to save the old Paradiso. He would have dealt with some stuffy bureaucrats looking to demolish the Paradiso for unclear personal reasons and he would have had to rally the town to save the theatre of his childhood. Also, in an American version, his childhood sweetheart, Elena, would have somehow returned after thirty years and he would have somehow overcome her distrust to win her back in the end. An American director would have inevitably found a way to destroy any pathos in the plot and turn it into a good-time film. However, Giuseppe Tornatore played his cards right. In the version that is known and loved, Salvatore reminisces with some sadness about his lost youth, returns to his village, attends Alfredo's funeral, says nothing as the Paradiso is demolished, and goes back to Rome. Nothing explodes, he doesn't get the girl, there are no heroes, but Salvatore comes to a subtle personal epiphany about his own life. And that is enough. Perhaps this is the way that European cinema depicts life more closely to the way it is and not in the way it should be as in the American cinema. American cinema never lets its viewers get too emotionally close to its protagonists because they are always in situations in which we never realistically find ourselves and are, therefore, always distanced from their actions. We, as humans, gage our lives by our memories and, in that spirit, Tornatore's tale of a man for who film was the defining factor in his life, brilliantly evoke these tender sentiments for us. A great watch.PS Get the director's cut if possible, the sub-titled, American version has long portions cut out that greatly add to the continuity of the plot and explain things more clearly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nostalgic homage to Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something magical and timeless about the movies. The stars that inhabit them are like fixed points in a firmament created out of the imagination; ageless reminders that despite the fact that our bodies deteriorate during the passage of time, in our minds we are forever young. Images projected across the distance and onto a screen like ghosts from far off memories have the ability to take us back through time like bookmarkers for important events in our lives. Giuseppe Tornatore's glorification of the movies in CINEMA PARADISO is really a celebration of life and the limitless possibilities for the individual with determination and imagination. There are really three protagonists in this film; Salvatore, the principle character who's story is told primarily through flashbacks; father figure persona grata, Alfredo, projectionist and Salvatore's mentor; and the theater itself, Cinema Paradiso, that refuge for the weary. A place where dreams, if only for a couple hours, can be found. A place where, laughter, sadness and joy can be shared. Paradise! Salvatore is fatherless and Alfredo childless. The two will form a special bond and remain virtually inseparable until Salvatore is a young man. A bond forged primarily in the projection room of the Cinema Paradiso, and fired by their mutual love for the movies. The years will be marked with tragedy, love won and lost and the realization that perhaps "life isn't like in the movies." Alfredo, having lived most of his life through the movies, encourages Salvatore not to make the same mistake, urging him to "Get out of Dodge" and direct his own destiny. "I don't want to hear you talk anymore. I want to hear others talk of you. Don't come back. Don't give into nostalgia." When Salvatore finally does leave, making it big as a successful and respected filmmaker, it will take the death of Alfredo to bring him back after an absence of 30 years. A trip back in time that will inflame old wounds, but also provide an opportunity for them to heal, and after the final kiss of CINEMA PARADISO's inspirational last scene, any lover of the movies will find it almost impossible not to give into nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Note: These are just segments from an analytical paper I wrote for my History of Film class. I had to trim it down from its original state. Enjoy!Cinema Paradiso is an Academy Award (1990) winning film that portrays the 'coming-of- age' of a young boy from a small Sicilian village. The film brings to life a young boy's passion for movies and relentless pursuit of the girl of his dreams. Since its debut in the late 1980s, this timeless film has made audiences worldwide fall in love with the cinema. It encapsulates a renowned filmmaker's nostalgic flashback to his younger years and the people and events that left a profound impact on the course of his life. Salvatore is a precocious young boy who befriends a middle aged film projectionist at the onset of WWII. In the small Sicilian village, Salvatore serves as an alter boy in the Catholic Church, but he always has only one thing on his mind. Movies. The young boy is completely mesmerized by the movies of the era and often sneaks into the local theater, cinema paradiso, to watch as the priest censors the films for the townspeople. It is quickly made evident that the paradiso is not merely a movie theater, but rather, it serves as the fabric that binds a closely-knit and diverse community. The often frictional, but primarily tender, relationship between Salvatore and Alfredo grows when Alfredo takes his young friend under his wing and teaches him how to operate the film projector. As Salvatore grows into a young man he divides his time between attending high school and operating the film projector in the new cinema paradiso. It isn't long before a beautiful girl moves to the village and Salvatore falls head-over-heals in love with her the second she catches his eye. At first, Elena does not reciprocate Salvatore's affection, but after he woos her at every chance he gets, she finally embraces his love for her. As Salvatore and Elena's romance blossoms, Salvatore finds his desires and natural talents inhibited by the 'small town life,' while Elena prepares to continue her studies at the University. The height of his frustration is depicted in a scene where he is works as an intern film projectionist at an outdoor theater in small coastal village. While lying on a dock he looks up at the stars and utters, 'When will this bloody summer end. In a film it'd already be over. Cut, and there's a storm. Wouldn't that be great?' Within an instant it starts to pour and Elena suddenly appears to ease away his pain. In the background, a film is portraying heroic characters overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles to succeed in the end. The scene is symbolic of the struggles that Salvatore had to endure as he matured. For instance, the loss of his father during WWII, his frictional relationship with his mother, coping with the loss of love, prolonged military service, and the building up of courage to leave his small town to realize his true potential, are all examples of some of the personal struggles that defined his character. It isn't long before the summer comes to a poignant close and Elena departs for University. Even though he is blind, Alfredo truly sees that the small town life is not the right fit for Salvatore and he advises him to leave, do not return, and, 'never give in to nostalgia.' It was director, Giuseppe Tornatore's, intention to create Cinema Paradiso as a sort of 'eulogy' for the way great film-making used to be done. In his masterpiece, he pays homage to the works of Renoir and Visconti by presenting a tenderly nostalgic piece done in a genuine and unpretentious manner. The film conveys its message in a simply eloquent manner without subjecting viewers to over dramatization. Throughout the film, the superb cinematography of Blasco Giurato is accompanied by an emotionally inspiring score by Ennio Morricone. The music is seemingly tailored to each particular scene and reflects and evokes specific emotions. Cinema Paradiso is nothing short of flawless.Cinema Paradiso is a sentimental tribute to the Hollywood romances of the 'Golden Age' of cinema, woven around the tragic love saga of a renowned filmmaker that missed out on a true 'Hollywood ending.' During a moment alone with Salvatore ('Toto'), Alfredo sums up the basis of the film, 'No, Toto. Nobody said it. This time it's all me. Life isn't like in the movies. Life is much harder.' In a humble fashion, the film presents a bitter sweet story that, in one way or another, audiences can relate to. The personal connections and string of emotions evoked by Cinema Paradiso is proof that it is truly more than just a movie; it is a classic among classics. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better late than never I finally saw the director's cut on DVD and it fills in a few blanks - most notably what happened to Elena and why she didn't show up/disappeared. That was satisfying for me. I loved this when I first saw it and I enjoyed it even more in the director's cut -- I cried more at the end. Also the mature Salvatore (Jacques Perine?) had a lot more scenes in the longer version. I liked seeing him talking to his mother and trying to reconcile his childhood memories with the man he'd become. Just an overall beautiful love story of films and unrequited youthful love! The music adds a great deal to the emotion of this film too! Also as an Italian-American, and half Sicilian, I got a glimpse into what life in a small village was like for my grandparents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Cinema Paradiso' is a wonderful movie that tells the story of a filmmaker Salvatore (Jacques Perrin) who looks back on his youth when he was friends with a theater's projectionist. We see how the projectionist named Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) gets blind and how the boy Salvatore, or Toto (Salvatore Cascio), becomes the projectionist. We also see him in his teenage years (then played by Marco Leonardi) falling in love with a girl named Elena (Agnese Nano). We follow the boy through the years and the longer the movie takes the more we like him.The movie is beautiful and funny too. The best funny moments come from a priest (Leopoldo Triest). He watches every movie for the theater first and makes sure everything that is related to sex (even a sweet kiss) will be censored. He rings a little bell when the projectionist needs to cut that part from the film.Although the movie is long (the new version plays for 170 minutes) it is never boring. The movie is engaging in every single moment. Because it is also about love for the movies it becomes even a little more engaging. Near the end is a montage that belongs to the wonderful moments from the movies.</fullReview>

My whole family watched it and we were all dabbing away tears near the end.There is nothing sad about this movie, it's just a gloriously crafted film that celebrates having dreams and growing up. If you have ever looked at your past with or without regret and happiness, if you've ever looked at the past and thought about what could have happened and how terrible things could have been, then this is the movie for you.It's all about fate, it's all about the things that have shaped your life and why your are here doing the things you are right now. This is more then a sweet family movie, it has a lot of depth and makes the viewer think about their own past and upbringing. Added to this the direction, acting and cinamatograpy are near perfect. My only complaint is that this movie is not long enough, and could have gone into greater description into the upbringing of the characters. This is nitpicking though and even a backhanded compliment.GOD BLESS THE GUARDIAN</fullReview>

First, the theme of having mentor, or a father image whether he be wise or unwise. Second, a man's first love (which fails 99.9% of the time) and its way of haunting him years later. Third, the trade offs one gives in order to succeed (leaving behind things familiar to search for greener pastures). These are the nostalgic thoughts one gets when one watches the film. I believe these themes in a man's life are very universal. Interestingly, it touched more of my male friends than lady friends.</fullReview>

I remember seeing this for the first time about 5 years ago, sleeping through most of it (because i was tired...NOT because it was boring) and still loving it. I have seen some of Tornatore's other work, and this is by far his best. That dude Alfredo looks like Walter Matthau.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About as good an Italian film as you can find</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the exception of a few of De Sica's films during the Neorealist days of the 40s and 50s, I think this is the finest Italian film I have seen. It is highly reminiscent of Fellini's Amarcord, though even better (and that's saying a lot), because it offers a wonderful and nostalgic look back at how life used to be. And, it is told so gently and affectionately that you can't help but love the film and the characters. The film is named after the local theater because it is the focal point for this community through the many years the film encompasses. Gentle, beautiful and full of humor and grace--this is a wonderful film for pretty much the entire family and you can't help but admire all those associated with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfection achieved by simplicity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A delightful film that brings together all the aspects of story telling. There is no need for murder, sex or humour to bring this together, all it required was a a small town and a simple relationship between a little boy and a man.The movie leads you on in such an easy and enchanting way that you are compelled to the screen to see how this all unfolds. Over my years I have had similar experiences and can fully relate to the story line.The secret in this story is that nothing was wasted, all aspects had an eventual meaning and the ending was shear delight. Hollywood should take a closer look at this movie and perhaps learn how perfection through simplicity can be achieved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I probably don't have words to describe what happened to me after having seen both versions of the movie. I was taken away so much. I wept and was real sad for a while. This movie is a closest thing to the perfection in movie making art. A beautiful story, perfect direction and acting. I loved the script so much. Lot of people differ on their opinion about original version Vs. shorter version. I watched both of them and I just want to say that their is no point in watching shorter version after all you have to see longer version anyway because you don't want to miss out even a bit of what this movie is about. The last conversation with grown up Toto and his old mother made me wept and it was so real and genuine it sends shivering in me. A movie has everything in it, Toto's kid life story that has school life, street life, home life and social life and as an adolescent everything around him has been shown and of course the grown up Toto is just awesome. Alfredo is another character in the movie who is so impressive and real. One thing I liked about the movie is that director has done a marvelously job of keeping thing connected. Every little scene has its impact on the movie. There are no vague things. Movie is bit sad and sentimental in the end but in a beautiful way, no killings or rape or poverty kind of stuff. A rare natural sadness that emerges automatically, we don't see this thing in movies very often.Little events in the movie are shown so beautifully, like the one -when Toto's collections of films (he stole from Alfredo's place) catches fire and his mother is trying to put it off to also consoling her little daughter- was so well done and directed. The movie is full of details and goes very smoothly and you will never want it to end.Even if you hate watching movies, watch this one. Steal money to rent this movie if you need to. You will never forget this movie for your life time.-Vishy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On occasion most serious movie-goers experience that sensation while watch a movie for the first time that they are experiencing something extraordinary. In my experience that has happened only a handful of times and Cinema Paradiso is certainly one of them. I experienced this in 1989 during it's first North American run. I have just experienced it again watching the DVD. It is a movie filled with melancholy, nostalgia, wounded hearts and broken dreams. The heart of the film resides in the sole source of entertainment in the small Italian town of Giancaldo - the local cinema. Here the town's folk assemble every night to watch the latest cinematic fair from melodramatic Italian to swashbuckling American. It is at the movies that mostly uneducated adults and precocious children find escape from their simple lives. To most of them there is no such thing as a bad movie as long as it transports them to exotic locales or into dramatic stories. The director, Giussepie Tornatore, takes us on this nostalgic trip through the eyes of Toto, an urchin of especially mischievous and daring nature and Alfredo, the cinema's crusty, yet lovable projectionist. Few films have captured that sense of wonder and love for the movies and the evolving friendship of the young and the old. And few directors have such skill in taking the audience to the edge of melodrama and sappiness without plunging over into ruin. I also think it is the film's "Italianness" that draws the audience into this love affair. There zest for life, their emotional unabashedness makes the rest of us (certainly me) feel dull and lifeless in comparison. The actors imbue their characters with passion and believability. (My only quibble with the movie is casting Jacques Perrin as the adult Toto. He's a fine actor, but doesn't look remotely like Toto as a child, or teenager.) The movie soars the highest when Ennio Moriccone's lush and dramatic score sweeps the story off the screen and into our hearts. This is surely one of the greatest movie scores of all time and Morricone has consistently produced stunning works making him one of the greatest composers of all time. The movie is full of messages, some subtle, others not so, but the one that impacted me most was when Alfredo tells the teenaged Toto "Whatever you do in the end, love it!" Meaning, love your work, love your life. Cinema Paradiso is surely one of the greatest movies ever made and few can resist it's charms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Haunting Voice of the Past in All of Us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso is a magnificent film. In spite of its at times somewhat sugarily charming indulgences, the movie contains a powerful element of tragedy. As a director, Giuseppe Tornatore deals with his favorite subject, which our popular and public culture simply prefers to ignore and glance over -- the price of progress, the price of change. Cinema Paradiso focuses on the torments of change, on the moral and emotional dilemmas which it raises. Though, the overall spirit of the movie is life-affirming, the deeper message is masterfully broadcast to the viewer: superficial happiness of the present conceals under its thin veneer the tragedy of those we "leave behind" to slowly fade away into the mists of the ever more distant past. Salvatore's mother sums it up brilliantly when she refers to the people from Salvatore's past as ghosts. The destruction of the cinema theatre at the end is yet another confirmation of the same message. As the popular cliche would have it, "life goes on." But we inevitably (whether justifiably or not -- could be endlessly debated) are forced to betray our past, to turn it to ruins (literally and figuratively) so that we could later on sweetly reminisce about it. The lessons of this movie are multiple but one of the most important and frequently neglected is that of loyalty, of respecting, remembering and understanding those who lived, loved, suffered, thought, and fought before us. Cinema Paradiso is about how much we owe to those who preceded us, who shaped us with their wisdom, who sacrificed for us (maybe naively), who allowed us to be what we are. Let us REMEMBER!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely superb. But what about the director's cut?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I completely adore this film. It probably has more depth of emotion then any film that I have ever seen. Period (as you Yanks say).I'm not going to whitter on about the general stuff concerning this film. There are enough other reviews already here, most of which I agree with.My comments concern the 160-odd minute "Director's Cut".I remember taping and watching the original version on TV. A UK TV magazine picked it as 'film of the week' so I thought I'd tape it and watch it some time. I did tape it and although I was only half-heartedly interested in it before putting it on, by the end of the film I was in tears. A few weeks later I watched it again. The tears still came. This film was awesome.I decided to buy it. But I looked for the DVD and there were two - the regular version and director's cut. I was skeptical about buying the director's cut. At 45-minutes-or-so longer it wasn't just the case of the odd scene added or extended, this was a different film. I went with the director's cut.In a nutshell I was pleased with the new version. I'd say 85.6% of the new footage actually adds positively to the original film. There are a few 'new' scenes that make me think "Hmmm, why has this been added? It seems a bit pointless." But generally, the extra footage just adds to the depth of the original.POSSIBLE SPOILERS...Most of the added footage comes in the later part of the film. There are new some scenes when Salvatore is a teenager but most occur when he is an adult returning home. For example, there is a scene with Toto and Alfredo where we learn Toto's interpretation of Alfredo's story about the soldier who waited for 99 days. Most significantly, whilst Toto is at his home village for Alfredo's funeral he notices (sort of) and eventually meets back up with Elena. This scene is fantastic (barring a one-second camera shot in which the director loses his faith in himself (injustifiably) to put the viewer inside Salvatore's mind).Like I said before, the director's cut adds to depth of the original 2-hour cut, particularly concerning Alfredo's character. This cut reveals Alfredo to be a much more eccentric and enigmatic character, especially where the relationship between him, Salvatore and Elena is concerned.So, the original cut is superb and like many great films has a brilliant and uncannily apt and beautiful soundtrack. The director's cut is for the most part, even better. If you get the chance to see this film, you must see it. It's as simple as that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are You Kidding Me?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should have known to stay away from this movie when it was recommended to me by someone who wouldn't normally be caught dead watching a foreign language film. The best way to describe the kind of movie we're dealing with here is to say that if you liked "Life Is Beautiful" you will like "Cinema Paradiso." People who don't like foreign movies like this one because, if you take away the Italian subtitles, this film is as fake and schlocky as the worst piece of sentimental clap-trap churned out by the Hollywood myth-making machine. Not one single moment of this movie rang true for me. Subtlety was passed over on every occasion for the the most manipulative of cinematic tricks, and the love story that anchors the film is boring and completely missing any sort of sexual spark.I have a feeling that this movie is so beloved because people who in reality have pretty low-brow movie tastes can watch it and feel like they're cinematically smarter. A double feature of this and "Life Is Beautiful" might just be enough to make me lose hope in serious film forever.Grade: D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*This is a review of the original 2 hour cut.People who love cinema will likely enjoy this very much. How film critics, film professors, normal movie goers, etc. got interested in movies can be a very nostalgic memory to think about. That's why I was interested in seeing this movie as its plot showed some promise. It was a pretty good experience watching it.After a famous filmmaker named Salvatore "Toto" Di Vita gets a call that a friend of his as a child named Alfredo died, he recalls his childhood. The film shows how he got into film, how he became friends with Alfredo, a theater projectionist, and other things he experienced as a child while growing up.His friendship with Alfredo continued to grow throughout the film. At first, he didn't like his presence and tried to get rid of him. However, as the film continued on, he began to value his company. Their friendship was very interesting. Since Toto's father wasn't with him, and since he supposedly died in the war, he looked up to him as a father figure, and he viewed the theater as his mother. If his mother were to tell him not to visit Alfredo anymore, he would disobey her, and continue to do it. This was an interesting way to show how movies were a very big part of his life.The part of the film where he bonded with Alfredo was the best part of the movie. It is full of delightful touches such as Toto stealing a frame of film behind Alfredo's back or Toto helping him cheat on an exam so he'll let him back into the projectionist booth. The movie theater is displayed almost as a centerpiece where everyone would like going to it late at night to be entertained. The people who go to them are interesting. There are people who always sigh when a kissing scene is censored out of the film by order of the priest. Also, there is a man who only goes to the theaters to fall asleep, causing the kids to wake him up. After the viewer sees how unruly the crowd can be, it makes them wonder how they'd really act is the movie were to ever show a kissing scene. Also, the first act ends with a memorable scene where Alfredo projects the movie onto a wall outside the theater so a group of people can watch the film even after the theater closes. What follows that is a scene which is a perfect way to end the film. I won't spoil it though, because it's best to see it come as a surprise.After that, the film moves forward 10 years into the future to show Toto as an older teen. The movie still manages to maintain its charming moments such as the scene where 2 boys are told to stop touching themselves by their father after the theater finally shows a kissing scene, only for him to do it a bit as well. Also, there's a scene where Toto is having trouble getting a movie to start. The people in the audience grow anxious to watch it. One person tries to tell everyone the plot to the film as he's already seen it before right as someone drops something on his head from above to get him to stop. These are many delightful touches which makes the viewer really like the lovable audience, despite how unruly they are. These comedic touches help the film, because they give the viewer extra reasons to enjoy the film.However, the main part of the 2nd act is to build a relationship between Toto and a girl he loves named Elena. This isn't necessarily a bad thing for movies to do as it could give them further charm. However, I really didn't care for the scenes with her. This was the part of the movie where it started to feel a little cheesy and schmaltzy. I felt like some of the scenes from their relationship were a bit corny. One scene was where he waited outside Elena's house every night, hoping for her to change her mind as she said that she didn't love him when he originally asked her. He did this to imitate something that Alfredo told him in a short fantasy story he heard once. The story didn't sound all that bad when Alfredo said it. However, what works in one medium might not necessarily work in another. If someone were to do that in real life, it would look disturbing. There were a couple other scenes that I didn't like as well. However, I think that the biggest issue I had with their relationship was that while it didn't appeal to me, it also took a lot of Alfredo's screen time out of the movie. If the romance sub-plot was done very well, I might not have had an issue with it in limiting Alfredo's screen time, but since it wasn't done very well, it obstructed the movie's impact on me even more.In conclusion, this was a very great film well worth my time. The relationship between Toto and Alfredo was done very well. The theater scenes had charm to them, and they provided some brief comedic relief at times. It managed to keep this throughout the majority of the flashbacks. Even though the romance sub-plot didn't appeal to me, I still liked this film a lot. Once you get to the very end, the famous final scene lets you walk away from the film in a positive manner by showing you a well-done montage. Overall, this was a pretty nice movie which I thoroughly enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful movie about childhood nostalgia and a mentor who'd do anything to protect you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian movie Cinema Paradise (1988) written and directed by Guiseppe Tornatore is about childhood reminiscence and a man's efforts of trying to come to terms with the passing time, passing people, and good, lively days when he fell in love with the movies. It has nice countryside Giancaldo shown with people going on about their daily chores, living a slow, peaceful life; the dark, rainy nights on the roads of a small town reminded me of 'Midnight in Paris', and sometimes even 'Sawariya'. Alfredo, the village theatre's projectionist, beautifully played by Phillipe Noiret and Toto(child version), played by Salvatore Cascio has a mentor-student kinda relationship. After the news of Alfredo's passing away, the movie is in flashback, and you get a feeling that sometimes there is nothing but nostalgia- nostalgia and remembrance of the past, of people in your past, of the place of your birth where you haven't been to since years, of the simpler and purer times, of the presence of a soul (mentor) that would always protect you. It's a beautiful movie, with which you could relate to if you ever felt the urge to go back in time and revisit the lively, easier world of childhood. The movie has a human touch, for sure. It also seamlessly includes the history of World War2 and the many deaths that it took. The background music needs special mention, which made the movie right on spot with generating tension, suspense, or a tug on your heart strings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great way to induce nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has its story open up nicely successfully building up curiosity. The move to the earlier time in the chronology sets the story to settle in nicely, and having the scene go back to the present Toto helps brings back the audience to the present condition and tie up the story until the finale moment come. The nostalgia effect is very nice in this movie. It's done through portraying the high fondness of people to watch the cinema, especially a very good movie. I really like how the movie tells the story of a man since his childhood until his older days. The movie also nicely instates a patron character without instating the usual hard characteristics. The acting is nicely done, although a little bit hyperbolic at times. In overall, the acting was able to make the movie live out as a whole. It's only too bad that the romance isn't really finished in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Friends, this cinema is for you."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sincere love of film and attention to detail is readily apparent in director Giuseppe Tornatore's "Cinema Paradiso". I was struck by the many creative elements employed in the picture, like Alfredo's (Philippe Noiret) decision to broadcast a movie on the side of a building and how the mother's crocheting unraveled as she went to answer the door for the returning Salvatore near the end of the picture. Earlier, when Salvatore/Toto was still a child and anxious about his father returning from the War, his mother's response was "It takes years to go there (Russia), years to come back". But then when it was confirmed that the father died in the War, the pair pass by an advertisement for 'Via Col Vento' - "Gone With the Wind". For young Toto, it was as if his father never even existed.I also got a big kick out of the parish priest Father Adelfio (Leopoldo Trieste), who deemed himself the final arbiter of holiness and good taste in censoring every movie scene that dared to show intimacy between a man and a woman. Doesn't everyone know someone who takes this moral high ground? As a somewhat humorous aside, I had an aunt like that once, who made similar judgments because of her upbringing and religion. Before she passed away, she left me some money which I used to purchase an artist's rendering of a female super-hero, something she would not have approved of. I swear, for the first few weeks I had it displayed with other pieces of art, every morning it would be slightly askew from it's original position, like she was disapproving from beyond and letting me know. I kid you not.What's truly magical about the film though, is the special relationship developed between Alfredo and his young ward Toto, how he takes him under his wing and nurtures the boy's talents and inspires him to move away from Giancaldo to make his own way in the world. With his blindness, Alfredo sees better than Toto himself that his job as projectionist at the cinema is only temporary and that he must make more of himself.There are so many nuances in the film that it would be impossible for me to discuss them all here, in fact it takes repeated viewings of the movie to catch the many insights Tornatore provides. He constructs his story with little hints of what leads to the cleverest of conclusions when Salvatore watches the reel that Alfredo leaves for him upon his passing, a touching commentary on life and love that the old man conveys to his former student as a keepsake and reminder of their time together.</fullReview>

This is a goof film, as you have already guested seeing it in IMDb 250, good feel movie. It's very solidly acted, directed. Music is wonderful. Currently this film is in IMDb 57th place, and i believe i could find many pictures who are far better and are placed in the lower places, but nevertheless this is a good picture. It's sort of reminded me of "The Artist" - they both share love to movies, and a times long gone - "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" plays more like a memories. Overall,good picture, not overwhelmingly good in any way or very touching, but very solidly constructed good - feel picture: must see to movie goers and for all who love true cinema.</fullReview>

Salvatore Di Vita has become a successful film maker in Rome and hasn't been home in 30 years. Alfredo was the projectionist for the cinema. He befriends young Sal nicknamed Toto. Alfredo becomes more like a father figure to Toto since his father died in World War II. We watch Sal's life as reflects upon the loss of Alfredo. The film has a great cast and crew. It's absolutely heartbreaking by the end. The cast is superb with Jacques Perrin as the older Sal. I don't cry but I did today. It takes a lot for me to cry.

		<shortDescription>A sweet little Italian film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso is a movie about a little boy who works in a theater with an old man, to put it in a short summary. There are several positive aspects of this movie, but also a few negatives.Cinema Paradiso is very simplistic. It isn't overly complicated, so it is relaxing to watch. It didn't try to be more than it was. The acting by the older man and the young boy Toto (and teenager when he is older) is well done. The ending scene could not have been more perfect to close the film. The main problem I had with this film was the actor who played the adult version of Toto. He looked nothing like the child or teenage version of Toto, so it threw me off a bit. Also, some parts of the film were much too slow or pointless and could have been cut out. The overall running time was a tad too long to keep the movie interesting.Cinema Paradiso is a nice, if somewhat forgettable, film that I think most would enjoy watching. It is far from any sort of masterpiece, but its innocence and view on life are to be admired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all have had moments when we seemed to cling to past sensations or childhood memories, we feel a certain comfort re invoking these thoughts into mind. That is exactly what Cinema Paradiso portrays in an almost 3 hour long movie all through which you don't budge. Allow me to explain : The past is an ambiguous word but to clarify, let's consider the past as the numerous events that lead to NOW, the present. Having said that, the movie is a picture perfect depiction of the influence of the past on one's present and future. Childhood, teenage crisis, first love, the search for one's roots etc.. I shall detail these headlines. This movie represents the main character Salvatore Di Vita,a bright little kid who, never met or had any kind of interaction with his father(a soldier in the Italian army). And Alfredo, an old man with no kids who takes care of film reels in the Cinema Paradiso. (The only downside of the Cinema Paradiso was that films were censored and scenes involving physical contact were cut from the reels). Many actions lead their relationship to strengthen throughout the movie even though their bond had an inherent tendency to grow because each of them found in the other what he was lacking. Alfredo soon becomes the father figure Salvatore longed for as a kid and the little boy starts seeking counsel with the elder in matters that he couldn't understand. He becomes the prominent person that represents Salvatore's childhood along with the Cinema Paradiso, the place where Salvatore cultivated a love for Cinematography. And finally Elena, Salvatore's one true love draws the final stroke on this amazing portrait : Giancaldo, Salvatore's home village. Outer Circumstances force Elena and Salvatore to be separated, and their attempts to communicate fall on deaf ears and they lose all kinds of contact. A while after that Alfredo's counsel leads Salvatore(Toto) to leave the cradle of his childhood in order to pursue his dreams. He returns several years after to attend Alfredo's funeral and starts to rediscover Giancaldo from an other point of view and is finally able to make peace with his past with Alfredo's posthumous help. Finally i would like to add that the movie has an air of innocence to it and an immensely frivolous atmosphere giving all the characters' feelings a sincerity that i have never seen in any other movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Italian classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This heart warming and uplifting film takes us on a nostalgic adventure into our youths, through the innocent and untainted eyes of a young boy, who still sees the world for all its beauty and promise, even throughout the birth and death of a picture palace that holds so much lure and magic to him. Cinema paradiso is regarded as not only one of the greatest Italian films ever exported, but one of the greatest foreign films ever! But I would strongly disagree, as far as to say it is an insult to label this majestic testament to the beauty life, as just a foreign film! It's more than that, much more. A story told in flash backs, from the perspective of a highly successful film maker in his 40's (Salvatore Cascio). Upon receiving a call from his mother to inform him that his child hood hero had unfortunately died, it forces him to recount his entire youth. Telling the story of a young Salvatore living in a run down, poverty stricken and grim war-torn, post ww2 Sicilian village with his baby sister and his harassed mother who is as free with a slap as with a hug. But finding refuge from all the pain and misery, in a cinema paradiso, a local picture hall, provides him with an idyllic paradise where his love for cinema and adventures can run free. There he soon strikes up an unshakable life long bond with a aging projectionist, serving as a father figure and confidante, then after a fire robes him of his sight, Alfredo (Philippe Noriet) encourages Salvatore to take over at the new paradiso, but eventually he would push the now young 18 year old Salvatore, tainted by his first heartbreak by his true love Elena(Agnese Nano), out of the confines of this dead beat village, to a world waiting to be explored and conquered , Only returning 30 years later, to witness the burial of Alfredo and the demolition of the cinema paradiso. Giuseppe Tornatore provides us with a poignant and almost, spiritual reminder of how the simple things that we held so delicately in are youths can almost be forgotten and misplace in our older years, as we replace the magic with vain perceptions of success and obsession with money, when we should actually try and reconnect with our youths, and again enjoy the personal cinema experience that promises so much. As soon as the end titles rolled by, I couldn't help but feel sad, as a big cinema paradiso shaped whole was left in my heart. Cinema paradiso is a film that stirs up a lot of home truths, a great watch for brave individuals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nuovo Cinema Paradiso is a movie for movie and cinema fans. In this movie you will understand the true meaning of love of the cinema. When I saw this movie I loved it because I think it represents the love for films that every movie fan has. I liked very much the performance of Salvatore Cascio as young "Salvatore 'Tot?' Di Vita" and of course the performance of Phillpe Noiret as "Alfredo".I also liked very much the true love between Marco Leonardi/Jacques Perrin as a teenager and adult "Salvatore 'Tot?' Di Vita" and Agnese Nano / Brigitte Fossey as a teenager and as adult Elena Mendola. I saw the extended movie of 155 minutes and not the "cut" movie of 121 minutes and I think that it worth it, I did not get bored for even a minute instead of it I really liked it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am the kind of person that usually never tears up for a movie, but here i just can't help it. Cinema Paradiso is one of those rare movies you just have to see. And if you are a movie fan yourself, like i am, the movie would quickly be at heart. The best thing about foreign films is that you never know the actors since you have never seen them in any other movie. It is as if your watching real people go by their lives. This is the kind of movie that everybody has to see. I don't know why this movie has an R rating but the version I saw, the original 1988 version, is suitable for everyone. ENJOY</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There are only ghosts here."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Passion inspires great art in a young Toto, but as his age shifts, so does his perspective on his life machinations in a small Sicilian community. With the help of the local theatre projectionist, Alfredo, he is able to recognize his potential and move out into a wider world. But what keeps this film from simply being a sentimental ode to Italian cinema, is the reflection of a much older Toro coming to terms with the sacrifices he has made to become the man he is. Were they mistakes? Or are his past regrets still threatening to cloak his accomplishments as an individual?Despite a somewhat obtrusive score by Ennio Morriconne, this film sends a strong message about life reevaluation, and how past decisions can segue into the present, in often unexpected, but beautiful ways. A small gem of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paradise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso is one of my favourite movies. It left me working out if Alfredo was right to do what he did. I watched the released version first and even though I could discern some large plots of the movie missing, it had just the right amount of information for you to fill the rest up. With the director's cut, Alfredo's character is portrayed in much more negative light. Either ways, he is vindicated by the final scene of the movie, which is one of the best I have seen. Just as Salvatore began to ponder on the What-ifs, came this montage of the cut out kissing scenes reminding him of his first and biggest love, the Movies. Portrayal of a young Salvatore, madly in love with the movies and Alfredo's company, is both innocent and charming. The teenage Salvatore, who falls in love with a blue eyed girl and attempts to woo her, has also been very well played. While many meanings lie beneath the scene where the Paradiso finally falls, the one that comes across strongest is that echoed by Alfredo. While attachment to loved ones and feeling nostalgic to one's home and past is natural, it takes true love and devotion to pursue one's passions and calling in life and achieve success. While this 'Sacrifice love for true passion' expression might not resonate with some, it is much easier to understand why Alfredo acted in the manner that he did. He knew that Salvatore had great potential and could go on to do great things in life but at the same time, his attachment to things would always peg him back and restrain him from exploring the possibilities that lied far from home. The two scenes when Salavatore cries are the ones when he sees his love on the projector and the montage at the end. He realizes that the sacrifice had to be made for him to be where he was and was grateful for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2 different movies: the 1990 cut version is best; the restored version is next</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The majority of people (but certainly not ALL) writing "User Reviews" that have seen both the US cut version from 1990 AND the recently restored 'director's cut' 3 hr. version (from 1988)--those people prefer the shorter version much more and recommend watching it before seeing the longer version. I strongly agree (and so does Roger Ebert).They are 2 different movies and to appreciate both, you need to see the shorter version first. I rate the cut version 9 of 10 stars and the longer version 7/10. So I'll average it out to an 8/10. The 2 hr. cut version is amusing, tender and nostalgic, the story of how a life-long fascination with movies developed in a boy's (Toto's) childhood and led to his life work.The original 1998 Italian (now restored) 3 hr. version elaborates, in far greater detail, on many of the losses and sacrifices that accompanied Toto's fascination and, for some/many viewers, in so doing it effectively wipes out much of the tenderness and nostalgia experienced in the shorter version.In the original, longer (restored) version, we find that Alfredo, the projectionist, who served as the functional father figure to Toto (Toto is the film's central figure), was instrumental in keeping Toto from connecting with Elena, the love of his young life. Alfredo believes in and instills in Toto the belief that the world operates on a "one at the expense of another" principle such that IF Toto loves movies and wants to make them, he MUST give up all other loves: Elena, and warm relationships with Toto's family, and even his relation with Alfredo. It's as if people can reach for and achieve only one important thing in their lives: a wife, or family, or supportive friends -- or an achievement. But IF it's for an achievement, then ALL else, all other wants, yearnings, must be sacrificed.Is this a rule in life?There's an interesting thread in the Message Board of this film titled "Is Alfredo the most evil movie villain ever?" In it many people, especially "Obsidian451" and myself discuss this in much more detail.I think that some will find reading those comments helpful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nostalgic look at films and the effect they have on a young boy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A famous film director (Jacques Perrin) returns to his Sicilian village for the funeral of its cinema projectionist (Philippe Noiret), and recalls their friendship that gave him a love for films. The film is often credited for reviving Italy's film industry which later produced Mediterraneo (1991) and Life Is Beautiful (1997).Cinema Paradiso is an affectionate, nostalgic film that trades on its love for cinema, and particularly for cinema-going in a bygone era. It's effective as a rites-of-passage piece, as an affable study of village characters, and later, in a melancholy aside, as a reminder that fame and success can make one's emotional life more complicated than films often suggest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sentimental master piece...but the director's cut is just too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only watched the 3 hour director's cut. In my very own opinion it's not necessary to be that long. This long version explains a lot about love and life, but sometimes it's better to let me have my own imagination. The main idea of the film can be very well explained with the story told by the projectionist. A soldier fell in love with the princess and expressed his love to her, she was impressed and told him that if he could wait 100 days and 100 nights under her balcony, she would marry him. The soldier waited and waited, but at the 99th night, he left. In this version, the boy gives his explanation of the story, "In one more night, the princess would have been his. But she also could not possibly have kept her promise. And it would have been terrible. He would have died. This way, however, at least for 99 days, he was living under the illusion that she was there, waiting for him." According to his explanation, the soldier is only a coward that dare not face the truth, thus he does not deserve the love from the princess. Personally I would like to regard this story as the contrast of dream and reality, that the soldier wants to keep the happiness brought by his illusion for ever and won't let the reality break it.The long version also includes the confronts of the former lovers when they meet again after 30 years. They accused each other for not coming to their last unaccomplished meeting, only to discover the truth that they both went. It was the projectionist who persuaded the girl to leave the boy. I think this part is ridiculous. It turns the projectionist from a likable tutor into a selfish old man that made the decision for the boy without his own permission. Besides, I don't like the idea of their one night stand after they discovered the truth. After all, she was a married woman already. The reckless passion only made their love less respectable. The ending is definitely the best part of the whole film. The soundtrack suites the scene so well, really very sentimental. It expresses the love for movies, as well as the happiness of illusion and the touch of memory. Movies, illusion and memory are some sort of distant beauty. The most beautiful things in this world are always those you will never be able to possess, thus you'll never get disappointed for the depressing truth. The movie showed us the truth, but ended with such a sentimental beauty, making it an unforgettable master piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sentimental but very memorable tribute to anyone who loves to go to a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso works very well because Giuseppe Tornatore, for all his schmaltzy moments with his characters, loves cinema incredibly and especially the communal and personal act of going out to see a movie. It also works because for all the sentiment, he makes it a story essentially about a boy, Toto, without a father after the war who finds a surrogate-cum-mentor with Alfredo, the projectionist at the theater. Their bond makes for the emotional core of the film, as the grown-up Toto comes back to the town he left so long ago for Alfredo's funeral, and looks back on his childhood and adolescence in this small down of Giacardola.The clips of the films are one of the strong-points, and just the scenes inside of the Paradiso, where there's lots of warm human comedy coming out of the fun poked at the 'old-days' of repression (i.e. ringing the bell for a kissing scene), or just the reactions to the different genres and styles (everything from Visconti to Chaplin to Bardot is screened). And there's a whole host of characters Tornatore has that makes a lot of the first half of the picture pretty special.It's maybe in the second half that it got a little too 'adorable' for its own good, or just too much of a similar one-track kind of narrative with the teen Toto falling in love with a girl whom makes it his first real roller-coaster of a relationship. But, as mentioned, Tornatore keeps it simple, particularly with respect to Toto and Alfredo (the latter actor, Phillipe Noiret, is incredible in the part, even when blind for half the running time). It's also a given that maestro Ennio Morricone delivers up the goods and makes this really rousing, the sentiment not false for a lot of the time as one of his best scores.If I didn't find it overall a masterpiece for some of its sappy bits and occasional over-the-top performance that doesn't click (most of them do, it's Italy after all), it's an exceptional effort for what it tries to accomplish and what many films end up being simply sappy can't quite reach. The film earns its keep by making it very relatable, and reminds us why some of us love movies and movie-going very much. It's the 'shmoopy' of Italian cinema lovers everywhere, and its worth the view even in the truncated Harvey Weinstein cut that played at the Rialto theater near my town; a fond goodbye at a fondly remembered theater. 8.5/10</fullReview>

The movie passed 1/2 hour of time and now I made up my mind that I would like this movie even if the climax is going to be absurd.The effect of a movie is best explained in the movie itself and the music score is an added credit for the movie. I have seen movies based on various genre like romance,drama and the like but this movie has also got an additional genre that is unheard of(according to me). I would name the genre as 'IDON'TKNOW' because it is something that you cannot associate with. Its not an anguish, its not being happy,its not annoying its something I don't know and may be you don't know too. This is what I felt when I watched this movie.</fullReview>

One day he saved old projectionist Alfred from the in-fire projector room. After that he became the assistant of Alfred. So he could watch movie as he wished. The only unsatisfying place was that Alfred always cut "indecent" film.Step and step Salvatore formed father-and-son-likely relationship with Alfred. However Alfred did not want to keep Salvatore in the small town. He destroyed Salvatore's first love and forced Salvatore to leave the town. Finally Salvatore became a famous film director. After hearing the death of Alfred, Salvatore came back to hometown after nearly 30 years. To his surprise, Alfred left him an iron box.A good movie does not need having complicated plot. Cinema paradiso just is a good example. Phillipe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio conquered me with their plain performance.

		<fullReview>"Everyone should love a movie about loving movies, right? Seriously, if you're a true movie buff, an homage to movies should get an automatic spot in the top 250 or something." It is true that it would be easy to overlook the difficulties in a movie that's so lovable as Cinema Paradiso, but, although the film is wonderful in some respects, it maybe does not deserve the great praise we have heaped upon it.Cinema Paradiso focuses on a boy, Salvatore, who loves movies more than he loves his own life, which seems to be falling apart due to his father's absence and his mother's harshness. Salvatore also works as an altar boy, half-heartedly, though, because he always falls asleep on the job. Yet his friendship develops with Alfredo (played brilliantly by Philippe Noiret), who controls the film as it is displayed upon the screen in the tiny theater. Soon, Alfredo begins to teach Salvatore how to control the reels and the story develops further.The film does a great job of comparing the hopeful atmosphere brought on by film-watching to the hopelessness of a world without them. Both Salvatore's and Alfredo's characters do have a lot of depth, and it is a great joy to watch their characters develop. Also, Ennio and Andrea Morricone's music adds a great dramatic/romantic feel to the film, while Tornatore's direction is also very good. The story and screenplay are brilliant too: heart-breaking, involving, moving, and amusing all at once.However, two elements detract greatly from the film's resilience. One of these is the poor acting by young Salvatore (Salvatore Cascio). Although I have come not to expect much of anything from young actors, this performance just did more to make me think twice about seeing movies with much footage of children. The other element that takes something away from the film is the lack of focus during the first part of the film. I can understand that the action revolves around the movie theater, but the film at first seems to be a mere collage of scenes that take place at that location.Nevertheless, this film is very worth your time, because its highlights overshadow (for the most part) any difficulties. So, as you watch, be reminded of the magic of movies and their power to provide an escape, be it ever so temporary and imperfect.Final Grade: B+.</fullReview>

It has certainly made me appreciate art house foreign films, which I would like to watch more of.Does anybody else think that Alfredo was Toto's Father, with the odd clue along the way i.e. his description to the young Toto of his Father when asked, almost describing himself and near the end of the film when it was said Alfredo did not want Toto's Mother to ever tell him and his wish that Toto move away and never come back.

I expected little from it, but with every minute that goes by, the film draws you deeper and deeper through its charm alone. It's sweet and sentimental, romantic and a tad cynical ("Life is not like the movies - It is much harder and difficult") First love leads to lost love, memories serve as sad reminders of happier times, the ones you love are fading away. These themes are all played out in a charming montage of sublime scenes, each lovely word of dialogue revealing the pain and loneliness we all feel, the very loneliness which continually draws us to the movies to begin with. It is the movies which are some of the happy moments in life, it is the cinema which literally brings us all together, and for one transcendent moment, it is paradise.</fullReview>

Not a single scene, shot, piece of soundtrack will make you think "Ive never seen that before" If you enjoy making films then you will find yourself identified with this, but that doesn't make it a masterpiece like everyone says it does. The relationship between Alfredo and the boy never feels natural. He didn't seem to teach him that much or show him a lot of appreciation, yet we are told that they love each other. All the other relationships in the movie are the exact same, never quite completed. The good soundtrack and some very good scenes make up for all the dullness enough to give it a 6. So if you say this is one of your favorites movies Im fine with that, but you shouldn't really call it a great movie. OK and enjoyable at parts, but nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The magic of the movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso is a very simple movie with one particular theme that makes it special: The magic of the movies. The storyline follows the path of a famous Italian director and traces his career back to his early childhood days, when he spent countless hours with his adult friend Alfredo in the projection room of the little cinema in their village. The two of them grow quite close, and it is fair to say that Alfredo becomes a kind of real father for little Toto, whose natural father died in World War II. After a horrible incident that leaves Alfredo blind, Toto himself becomes the projectionist, a job he performs for many years.The movie further extensively elaborates on Toto's first love and on many subtle themes, such as Alfredo fatherly guidance and Toto's time in the army. Throughout the proceedings of the story, the magic of movies plays an important part. The inspiration and impact on ordinary people in those early days of the cinema, the way people were emotionally stirred and how they participated actively with cheers, laughters and even tears, all these aspects are transformed into the movie in a way that is maybe a bit over-subscribed and occasionally a bit corny, but very authentic and with a marked nostalgic edge.Cinema Paradiso is a very subtle and slow movie. It is a typical Italian movie in terms of pace and camera work. I was occasionally reminded of Once Upon A Time in America and Martin Scorsese's narrative style. It is a very nostalgic movie with lots of sad moments that make you aware of the passing of time. At the same it is the story of Toto and his relationship with Alfredo, who was more a father than a friend to him. It is maybe a bit two long, and some moments could have been made more interesting and more helpful for a quicker proceeding of storyline developments. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director's Cut Changes the Entire Meaning of the Film - more about life than the movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see the first cut of "Cinema Paradiso (Nuovo cinema Paradiso)" because everyone said it was a schmaltzy nostalgia tribute to growing up watching old movies in a small town that happened to be in Italy. This original director's cut changes such a description; it's now a full autobiographical take on an artist and what drove him from and back to Sicily. This cut restores 51 minutes that the distributor chopped off the end of the movie -- that's more than a third of the film. It now has more in common with "Last Picture Show."We now see the full sweep of post-war development in Sicily, as the town piazza slowly goes from a wide expanse with the occasional horse-drawn funeral cort?ge, to a car park. While what captivated audiences originally is still entertaining -- the precocious child actor who plays the artist as a smart-aleck small boy-- now we also see him as a love-struck teenager, soldier, young man with only existential choices and a gray-haired adult coming to terms with the people in his past.This original cut is essential because it provides clear-eyed re-interpretations of people we saw him with as a child; now we learn the truth about them through adult eyes. The director says he always intended it to be a love story, not just about the movies.Why did it take so long for this cut to appear? How could the director have tolerated such a massacre without screaming to the press? Contractual obligations? I saw the movie with a friend who has been exploring her Sicilian heritage; in 1995 she visited the town where the movie was shot and says it still looked like that then, and felt it was truthful to the people of the area.

		<fullReview>Quite simply, perfect. It is a far better and more complete cut than the original release - which restores Jacques Perrin's towering but understated performance from a small walk on part to the major role it always was. It also reinstates a crucially key scene which was deleted from the original and is fundamental to the completion of this much darker version. I cried in this version even more .... The effortless control of crowd scenes both inside and out make it hard to believe a crew is ever present. The young and old Toto are particularly impressive along with the ever reliable Philippe Noiret, and Morricone's score is quite wonderful. There's a big difference between overwrought sentimentality Hollywood style and sentiment which in this case is really pathos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best films of all times. If you can see it without crying you should see a mortician as you're obviously dead. It resonates with all that is best about movies, and at the same time creates a visual language all its own. It also explores a relationship that we rarely see in film--mentor and charge. A beautiful, moving experience every time I watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming details don't add up to a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** This review may contain spoilers ***It would be best to see this film without knowing how warmly it was welcomed by critics and viewers at the time, or how many people still take it to their hearts. It does hold many charms in its details, but when it tries to give us a story of Life and Love it becomes banal and contrived. It also takes an oddly careless approach to the aging of its characters.Nuovo Cinema Paradiso opens with a framing story in which a middle-aged man hears that someone named Alfredo has died in his hometown and begins recalling his childhood. In the flashbacks that form the main body of the film, the setting is a town in Sicily in the decade following World War II. A small boy is irresistibly drawn to the local cinema, a world of enchantment, and to its projection booth, the heart of that world. He befriends the projectionist, Alfredo. Alfredo discourages the boy, Toto, from following in his footsteps as a projectionist and eventually encourages him to pursue his love of movies on a grander scale. We're soon prepared to learn that the grown Toto who is recollecting these things has become a famous director.In the first phase of the flashbacks, we follow little Toto in his childish peccadilloes while following the community in its avid response to movie magic (a funny exception being the gritty social realism of post-war Italian cinema, which proves as impenetrable to Sicilians as to much of the world beyond). This phase ends with the cinema destroyed by fire and Alfredo rescued by Toto but blinded for life.The Toto of the second phase is apparently in his late teens, perhaps twenty by the end of the flashback. Childish peccadilloes have given way to amateur film-making, running the projector at the rebuilt cinema, and love at first sight with a girl whose social position poses an obstacle -- in effect, a princess. As always, the life of the community and that of the film are centered on the shared joys of escape in a darkened cinema. Toto's personal life is disrupted by a period of military training, after which he finds that he can't pick up where he left off. He loses touch with Elena, his love, who has moved away. Finally, he takes Alfredo's advice and leaves town himself to make his way in the world.Very well, but it's unbelievable that he then absolutely neglects his mother for thirty years, even to the point of not returning her phone calls, although they were on good terms when he left. The only reason seems to be that the film requires a complete break with home so that the middle-aged Toto can feel he's stepping into a past world when he returns for Alfredo's funeral. Still more unbelievable is the casting of characters at different ages. The twentyish Toto is distinctly short, but the fiftyish Toto towers over everyone else in the funeral procession. Conversely, his mother changes from a tall young woman to a tiny old one. Then there is the aging of characters who are played by the same actors throughout. Alfredo's wife, who was middle-aged in the first place, only turns gray-haired and gray-faced while the transformation (by casting) of Toto's younger mother rivals that of the queen in Snow White. Indeed, slapping gray paint on actors -- while removing an obvious hairpiece from one -- is all the movie magic Tornatore offers in the framing story. Is he trying to tell us that he has decided to wash his hands of film-making as a labor of love?The many delightful moments in Nuovo Cinema Paradiso are really just so many vignettes strung together in the abrupt, sometimes bewildering manner of the 1980s. To the extent that these moments achieve a unified effect, they suggest the benign human comedy of Rene Clair. Yet they are mixed with stink-bombs of bad taste that would have puzzled Clair as to this director's intent. That, too, is a mark of the 1980s.It may be best to look for the appeal of this film in the ways in which it differs from most other films of the 1980s and many since. It does come down on the side of benign human comedy. It does cherish the magic of Golden Age film-making, even as that magic slips through its fingers. It does become an oasis of entertainment if you come upon it in a personal desert of dissatisfaction with films generally. The trouble is that if you have had the good fortune to drink from the springs of Rene Clair and other masters, Nuovo Cinema Paradiso turns out to be a mirage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, 2003, and I hadn't seen Cinema Paradiso, then I noticed it was on TV, so I gave it a go.I heard a number of good things about this movie and tend to like more non main stream films more and more as I am getting older, but to be honest I was very disappointed with what I saw.Cliché after cliché. Stupid unbelievable characters and then a fairly tame soap opera story. Where was the depth, where was the profound message, basically there wasn't one.In the end this could have easily been produced by Hollywood. There was a real sense of passion missing. Toto wanted to be a film maker, but didn't really demonstrate his passion for films other than wanting to be a projectionist. Tag on a predictable love story and a bit of sentimentality, that seemed out of place. What was the big deal, yes people liked the cinema house, but I can't say they felt any true love for it. Then at the end you see this scene of great nostalgia, which seemed out of place.I'm sorry I didn't like it, I genuinely thought I would, but the film really missed any maturity and lacked any real sentiment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso is an extremely touching film about the relationship that a boy has with the town's projectionist. Salvatore is a mischievous young boy who develops a passion for cinema. The film's projectionist Alfredo mentors the boy and becomes a surrogate father to him. It engages wonderfully with themes of community, growth and nostalgia. There is very strong emphasis in remembering where you came from. One thing I didn't like though was the love story they gave Salvatore. I felt that this was contrived and unnecessary. it didn't add anything to the plot.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/vtbGiX</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supposedly moving, but unconvincing (yet)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems there are twos aspects of this film that appeal to many people's emotions.1) Nostalgia: After thirty years of time during which Toto kept himself physically and mentally away from home, it is understandable that the memories from the distant past flood into Toto, although personally I did not feel particularly nostalgic by watching that.2) Love: According to many, the ending is meant to fill Toto with love he lost, but this interpretation is not plausible because it refers to different kinds of love. After his loss of relationship with Elena, Toto left home and had relationships with many women in search for a better heterosexual love, while the ending scene only means Alfredo's paternal love. These two are qualitatively different; the latter kind of love cannot be taken to compensate for the missing former. Considering the special emotional attachment given by Toto to Elena, it is implausible that Toto finds any true love with any other woman, which is precisely why he has had many relationships ever since he lost Elena. An interpretation of the ending scene as a demonstration of the former (heterosexual) kind of love is also implausible, because it is only a film projected on the screen, not real for Toto himself. In a shorter version of this film at least, therefore, Toto is left with Alfredo's enduring paternal love but without heterosexual love with a woman. This aspect is incomplete.These two aspects were emotionally not convincing to me. Perhaps all I need to appreciate its true value is a couple of more decades of life experience, long enough to look far back into the past and be nostalgic. For the time being, 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema Paradiso</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso, is an Italian film but I was able to see a dubbed copy of it in English whereas it is originally in Italian. The film is set in Italy in the early years of cinema. It is about a young boy named Salvatore (who is nicknamed Toto) who daily goes to the theaters to watch movies. He becomes friends with the projectionist named Alfredo. The two of them bond and Alfredo teaches Salvatore about film and how to use the projector and the film shows their friendship and Salvatore's life and how he grows up and the impact film and Alfredo has had on him. Winner of the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film at The Academy Awards; The BAFTA Award for Best Actor (Philippe Noiret, who plays Alfredo), Best Actor In A Supporting Role (Salvatore Cascio, who plays Salvatore as a child), Best Film Not In The English Language, Best Original Film Score and Best Original Screenplay at The BAFTA Awards; The Grand Prize Of The Jury for the film's director Giuseppe Tornatore at the Cannes Film Festival; The Best Film Award at The Cleveland International Film Festival; The Cesar Award for Best Poster at The Cesar Awards; The David Award for Best Music at The David di Donatello Awards; The European Film Award for Best Actor (Philippe Noiret) and The Special Prize Of The Jury for Giuseppe Tornatore at The European Film Awards; The Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film at The Golden Globe Awards; The ALFS Award for Actor Of The Year and Best Foreign Language Film Of The Year at The London Critics Circle Film Awards; The Mainichi Film Concours Award for Best Foreign Language Film at The Mainichi Film Concours; The Robert Award for Best Foreign Film at The Robert Festival and The Special Award for Best Young Actor Under Nine Appearing In A Foreign Film (Salvatore Cascio) at The Young Artist Awards. Before I start my review let me say that the version I saw of the film was the original version running at 121 minutes. A year or two ago a new version was released with extra footage that runs about 174 minutes. One of the reasons I saw Cinema Paradiso was because I always read good things about it and it is often talked and praised about on different movie sites and message boards. Another reason that I saw this film was when I was in a small independent video store once that carried a lot of foreign, independent and offbeat films. I saw this film on the shelf and on the corner there was a note from one of the workers of the store that said something like "This is the reason I opened this store". After reading many good reviews and after reading this note I decided to see the film. Cinema Paradiso has good direction, a good script, good performances from the two main actors and a good supporting cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing and good production design. The film is a good looking film and it is sweet and touching. The film has a nice story and nice characters that you begin to care about and you want to see how the film progresses and what happens to them. This is a film that I think people young and old will enjoy because it is a coming of age story and it will appeal to many. The film is well made and is just generally a well done feel good movie that hits all the right notes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a pleasant enough movie, I guess. But really not noteworthy in any substantial way.There's a movie theatre that is obviously a set. There's a whole stable of stock characters and lots of forced emotion, but there's just no meat on the bones. And then there's all those questions unanswered.Why did little Toto (who's a really cute little kid) act out towards everyone, no matter how hard they tried to befriend him? Why did Toto's mother treat him so poorly and beat him so much? Why did Toto's father leave? Why did Toto's girlfriend leave? How could Toto be so much in love with a girl he didn't even know? What happened to his girlfriend? Why did he never come back to his hometown? Why did his life end up so apparently empty and unsatisfying? And there's more I haven't even touched on. All of those questions and no answers are even attempted for any of them.All there is is a token tearful scene here and there and a few oddball philosophical parables and the rest of the script is basically left blank. I found it rather odd. Odd and unfulfilling. I think most people would expect more from a story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like a story without action or bum-bum and love nostalgic/romantic movies this is one for you. There are lot of emotional scenes with lot of humor and a little love story. The music was so fine that takes your breath away and it is well tuned to each scene. Director Giuseppe Tornatore created a nice Italian and original story about a typical cinema in the 40/50ies that was located in South Italy. The little boy and Philippe Noiret did a great job here but every actor made a solid casting. Sometimes I had some nostalgic thoughts about my own country. The rating on IMDb with actually 8.3 is okay and not overrated. There was no doubt that it won the Oscar for the best foreign movie and also for many other international awards. My vote with my wife is 7/10. Go and see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing short of an all-time classic - a cinema milestone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of the life and times of a small Italian community told through the eyes of a cinema-loving boy destined to be a film famous director.There are film reviews where you say all you want to say in three paragraphs and there are film reviews that you could write about a thousand paragraphs and not get everything in. This film belongs in the later category but, ironically, I'll keep it short!This is a great viewing experience because it is - for me - why cinema is a great art form. All the art forms coming together to deliver something that is more than the sum of its parts. You are taken to a time and place that you never were (in most cases anyway!), and given it has now gone, cannot possibly go to. This film takes you there and lets you sample it, taste it and believe it - before the lights go up and your real life returns."Great cinema" is rare and often somewhat disappointing. For example, The Godfather is uneven and immoral (the first one anyway) and while the Shawshank Redemption and Se7en are great, they only warrant one viewing unless you actually bought the thing. Even in the IMDb Top 100 there are films that are little more than video games. Maybe have too many little clichés: Happy couple running through the fields, moments of happiness underlined by tears (and background violins), the scarifies done for the (perceived) greater good, people growing old together, the innocent past being superior to the corrupted present. All be done with panache, but you know they are cribs from other people's work.Maybe the confusing romance (there is a hole that the director's cut claims to fill) was an effort to steer away from the tried-and-trusted. Hard to say anything about it without being a spoiler though. Thankfully it puts something back in to pot with the finale that is as original and brilliant as anything I have ever seen! I won't spoil it - but a real leap of the imagination. While we see the man/boy relationship as being key to the opening scenes of the film, I couldn't get totally inside it. You respect older people because you think that they "know something" when you find that they don't your relationship changes. Equally film directors tend to be from a certain background or have a natural authority about them - the leap from being up able to project a film to being able to make one is large. And not as obvious as portrayed here.What knocks this down from a classic to a minor classic is sentimentally. Olivier said that you have to disguise your technique and he hadn't done it well enough at times. This is also true here. This wants your tears and emotions, but at the same time I can see the wheels going round and know how the trick works.There are harder hearts than mine to break, but a bit more solid and even plot and little bit less emoting (not all of it totally reasoned) would have delivered a better product. Nonetheless a very happy memory and a film worthy of the IMDb Top 100. Lets hope it stays there.Review is for the original cinema version, not the directors cut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is obscene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema Paradiso plays like a two-hour infomercial for the movie industry, and not a particularly good infomercial at that. The Hollywood studios should have hired a different ad agency to produce this "nostalgic comedy-drama".According to Cinema Paradiso, we should all live our lives vicariously, structuring them around what's playing at the local Bijou. Does anyone in this ridiculous town have a job? No one is ever seen *producing* anything, and that's the point.We'll all be happiest when we're passively glued to the screen, immobile, consuming studio product while sitting in our toilet chairs like the one Homer invented on The Simpsons. In Anthony Burgess's book A Clockwork Orange, and later Stanley Kubrick's film, Alex was subjected to this situation as part of his rehabilitation and we saw what a horror it actually would be.Popcorn ads used to be projected subliminally a frame at a time. This time around they made a 120 minute popcorn ad and people catatonically paid to see it. A shepherd drives a flock of sheep through the town square after the Paradiso burns. I think that's the director's wry joke. He's depicting all the suckers who flocked to see this self-serving piece. Baa-a-a.We shouldn't be sad at the end when the rebuilt cinema is demolished, because as the film makes clear we are now passively consuming TV and videos instead, and in greater quantities than ever before.</fullReview>

Hereby,people should learn this culture. Also we should mention the performance of Ugur Yucel who is also one of the best actors of Europe.So instead of watching this silly movie about a young boy and a old fat blind man who thinks he knows everything about life; watch Bandit.We are all Mediterranean people and the movie Bandit depicts the Mediterranean culture better than any movie, including this movie called Cinema Paradiso.Bandit is the Godfather of Europe and Cinema Paradiso is the Vertigo of Italy.

His interaction with all the characters ? particularly with the projectionist - is something to behold. He is an impish child and keeps us enthralled. This constitutes the first half of the film. It is also a tribute to the world of cinematography ? the wonders of the movie. Everybody loves to be held captive by a movie. That about sums up the best part of this filmNot So Good:However Salvatore's later reincarnations as a young teenager and a "successful" adult are completely uninspiring and totally un-engaging. These reincarnations hardly represent the young lad that we saw previously who was bubbling over with energy.There is a romance theme with the teenage boy that is merely a rehash of the standard boy meets girl and gets jilted. This has been done I don't know how many times. It's cloying. What is also cloying and over- extended is when he returns in his adult incarnation back to his native village for the funeral of the projectionist. At this point the film just wilts like a dead flower ? all the joyousness has dried up.There is suppose to be an even longer version of this at 170 minutes; I found the 2 hour version much too long (as in its time to fast-forward). For whatever reason, this film ? in my opinion ? is highly over-rated on IMD.</fullReview>

That said...There's an interesting *idea* for a movie here, but ultimately it's just not about anything. The whole film is a flashback from a character we hardly know -- had we a better idea of who this guy was as an adult, then his formative childhood/adolescent experiences might mean something, but since he's a cipher, why should we care about how he got there?Even the much-lauded montage at the end (that's all I'll say about it) is kind of clumsy, and too-little too-late. There's nothing more painful than *not* crying in the last reel of a tear-jerker, and that's how I felt at this film. (And if someone like me fails to respond to a sentimental film about a person whose life was molded by the movies, trust me, something is very wrong.)I'd like to see Tornatore's original edit, though -- I may just be responding negatively to the chopped-by-Miramax version. (Check out the director's very anti-nostalgic "Everything's Fine," which acts as an enema to the saccharine of "Cinema Paradiso.")</fullReview>

And, yes, I know that accuracy is not an important parameter of cinematic quality, but the creative side of the film industry should, at least, know a little bit about how their work is shown, and people wishing to be regarded as serious artists should NOT rely on sentimentality to elicit emotion.Worse, this is suspiciously close in theme to a truly great film made a few months previously by Ettore Scola - namely the wonderful 'Splendor'.And guess what...

Like The Piano (1993).The Cinema Paradiso is like this. There's no real plot; basically we follow the life of a boy who becomes a man. There are endless slow-moving scenes of how much he loves movies. It can throw you into a real funk. And the ending doesn't resolve the biggest mystery of the film. I won't spoil it for you but it involves romance.Who should see this film:-- Anyone who liked Forrest Gump, a film I personally loathed-- Arty film types, you have a real racket going in making the rest of us feel inferior for wanting our movies to have plot, pacing, conflict.I'll give Cinema Paradiso a surprisingly low 5 out of 10.

Two hours of clumsy sentimentality, in which nothing happens; a coming-of-age tale which tackles none of the problems of adolescence; characters who spend most of their time simpering over each other, yet they never bother trying to make them connect with the viewer; child acting so dreadful a wooden puppet with its strings cut would have been a better replacement...I resent the laziness of the film, they thought they could rely on its magic formula of nostalgia, saccharine and being foreign so they thought "we don't need to bother building up any genuine feeling for these characters". The story starts with an incorrigible young tyke (who i found extremely irritating) befriending the local projectionist. That's about all you need to know, what there is of a plot that develops from there doesn't really matter - it doesn't offer any interest, it doesn't put any of the characters in a dilemma, it all just dissolves into the steady flow of sap. With a plot development occurring every twenty minutes or so, thank God that we're anchored to the motif of the cinema by lengthy footage of people sitting around in it, making entertaining comments which make us just resonate with the warmth of the Italian people. More sugar anyone? Perhaps if I had a very fragile and elderly relative - I mean several centuries old - for whom trying to follow a plot that wasn't totally linear might get their blood up, who was too mentally impaired to take a character at anything but face value, for whom nuanced was just a seven letter word they weren't sure how to spell, then I might recommend to them Cinema Paradiso. Although the possibility that their heart might stop mid-way through, making me culpable for their death, would make me think twice. In fact I think I've got it, Cinema Paradiso might be a very good film to die to. Especially if you've been incapacitated waiting to die for a very long time, and would like to assure yourself that other people have been subjected to something of what you're going through.The Spirit of the Beehive (La Espíritu de la Colmena) is sometimes presented as Cinema Paradiso gone right, again centred on a cinema in a small town and a child's reaction to it. Sure it's slow, and makes no concessions to commercialism, but it is beautifully directed and in an understated way develops the viewer's empathy for the characters. Exactly the opposite of the crass tedium of the film I've just had the misfortune to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monkey Wrench</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comment contains spoilers. I really like foreign films. For a long while in my movie watching career, I thought just the "good ones" made it over to the U.S. Cinema Paradiso has thrown a monkey wrench into my theory. This is a terrible movie with bizarre events that make no sense, even in an artsy way. Part of it might be my hatred for "the life of" movies, where some terrible child actor plays the first 1/3, another actor plays the adult, and another actor plays the "old man" at the end. As a side note, I have an extreme hatred for the "old man makeup" trick (Like in "A Beautiful Mind"), which is ALWAYS distracting - much more distracting than the changing actors trick. Part of it might be the fact there are too many moviehouse scenes. Part of it was the bizarre contrived sentimentality the filmakers tried to force into the movie with the old projectionist character, especially towards the end.I really wanted to be pretentious and like yet another foreign film, but I couldn't even pretend on this one. There was one very very cool scene that was so out of place, it felt like I was watching a different movie (the scene with the mirror and the projector). Oddly enough, about a week after seeing this one, I saw a similar film that was far superior to this one: "La Lengua de las Mariposas". Search for it on IMDB.com, watch it, and compare. The acting done by the child is the best I have ever seen, especially at the end. It has the unforced dynamic the filmakers in "Cinema Paradiso" were trying for. "Cinema Paradiso" has taught me one important thing: bad movies don't just come from Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lots of tears for this too much emotional film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this film, I did not think that this film was so emotional. And actually, I have been quite disappointed with the story. Even if the actors are good, the poor story can't save the film. However if you like crying and being touched, see this film. I can't say that this film is bad, but I think that that is poor in truth, and Tornatore just tries to makes us cry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible! A good stomach pumping would be more enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie received such high and glowing praise that I was really looking forward to seeing what was purported to be such a touching and insightful window into the human spirit. What I got was two hours of maudlin, weepy, melodramatic prattle that almost descended to the level of farce it was so bad.What the heck is the big deal with this movie?Basically there's an impish, disobedient child who befriends a rambling old man who works as a projectionist. Then there are tons of clips from movies so old and so poor as to be irrelevant. And that's about it.If you like pointless coming-of-age movies that meander all over the map, by all means whack yourself in the forehead with this one. Otherwise, save yourself the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kept getting distracted by my foot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't seem to focus on this stupid movie. I kept getting distracted by my foot (which proved to be immensely more entertaining). The music was sappy, the story was boring, and aside from one or two painfully obvious but weak jabs at political innuendo--not enough to form any substance but evidently enough to impress those predictable judges at the Cannes Film Festival--there was no theme at all.First let's talk music. Imagine the syrupy sweet drivel from a Hallmark greeting card commercial. Now repeat it for 2 hours. Now shoot yourself in the head. For 2 hours.Next let's talk about plot. It indeed has a plot, but not one worthy of 2 hours of your life. Unless you have no life. In which case, I repeat: shoot yourself in the head asap.Lastly, let's talk theme. Major strikeout. This film had so much potential; the metaphor of a lonely projectionist was brilliant. But instead of boldly proceeding with that challenging idea, the film spiralled into a morass of lukewarm humor, unconvincing romance and unconnected randomness. Fans of Virginia Woolf (stream-of-consciousness) may love this film. (But didn't Ms. Woolf end up shooting herself in the head? Hm, I sense a trend...)I could've spent 2 hours listening to Kenny G and watching a Nat'l Geographic documentary on corn instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the... NO!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are spoilers in this review. Consider yourselves warned.OK, so here I am, sitting around on a Sunday noon with nothing to do. So I set my mind on completing the watch of the Top 100 of all time (the bottom of the list fluctuates too much in order for med to think it's worthwhile). Next stop: Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, at number 96 (it was there when I watched it anyway). Three HOURS later (except for Lord of The Rings, I have a very low tolerance for long movies), I just wanted to cry. That time is never coming back, and I spent it watching some depressing Italian movie, about a guy who gets some extra money when he's in his forte's (and by that time, it's too late to enjoy having a lot of money, as all we youngsters know), but never gets the love he wants.The only funny thing about this movie was that the Italian priest who works as a censurer at the Cinema Paradiso looks exactly like the orderly at the school where I work. I'm betting you don't work at a school with an orderly that looks exactly like the priest, and therefore I'm guessing you'll get NOTHING out of watching this film. So... I'm warning you to do so! 1 out of 10.PS. Many people go on about how beautiful and pitoresque the Sicilian setting is, but I just have to disagree with that. Hey, Italy is even more beautifully depicted at the map "cs_italy" in the good IL' online shooter game "Counter-Strike"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is possibly the worst film I've ever seen. I'm quite a big fan of foreign language film, but this gives the "genre" a bad name. It's about an annoying little s*** of a boy annoying an old man, stealing things, etc. And it has boys chugging in the cinema, and a couple going at it hammer and tongs.Good films contain things that you might remember positively or which affect you. The only affect this had on me was wanting to never go to Italy and smashing the DVD into little bits with a huge hammer. It doesn't even make sense.I got this free with a newspaper and it's not even worth that. Horrific.</fullReview>
