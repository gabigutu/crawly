		<shortDescription>Aptly Named and Surreal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what may be one of the most aptly-named films at this year's festival, Slow West is in no hurry to tell the story of Scotsman Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and his continent-spanning quest to find Rose (Caren Pistorius), the long-lost love from his hometown. Things get complicated when a desperado named Silas Selleck (Michael Fassbender) decides to accompany Cavendish on his journey?possibly to cash in on a bounty that hangs over Rose's head. Taking a cue from neo-westerns like Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man, Slow West uses the chaotic landscape of the American frontier as an allegorical exploration of love and death. There is something surreal about seeing the old west interpreted through the lens of New Zealand where the film was shot, and it added to the story's dreamlike tone. The immensely watchable Fassbender exudes some serious Han Solo vibes as he guides Cavendish through the unforgiving wilderness while trying to act like he doesn't give a crap. McPhee's boyish, innocent appearance is ideal for a character whose belief in true love has guided him so far into the lions' den. While the film's ending is sure to polarize audiences, it was a ballsy way to emphasize the point that the frontier was an ecosystem all its own, indiscriminately filling some hearts with purpose and others with bullets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Western love child of Wes Anderson and the Coens.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing I noticed about Slow West is how much better Michael Fassbender's American accent has improved, especially in comparison to his drawl in 12 Years a Slave. There are still traces of his foreign heritage in his voice, but he's got the cadence and timbre of it down-pat here, which is certainly a boon here, as he also adopts the role of narrator in writer/director John Maclean's tough yet quietly funny romp through the frontier. Why is it tough? Because Maclean doesn't hesitate in showing that the West was unforgiving; people die with almost alarming suddenness and violence, and not a single one of them gets a languishing death soliloquy. It's all a great shock to young Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit- McPhee), a Scottish émigré who ventured out West not to seek fame or fortune, but rather the love of his life, who fled their homeland after an accident Jay feels responsible for. Jay, the upper-crust scion of a well-to-do family, is unprepared for the harshness of the climate, and the opening credits have barely begun to roll before he's looking down the barrel of a gun. It's only by the grace of God and the quick reflexes of gunslinger Silas (Fassbender) that Jay gets out unscathed. Silas, a gruff and opportunistic sort, takes the job of "chaperoning" Jay through the territory, ostensibly to make an easy buck?but there are truer, darker intentions lurking within him. See, Silas is a bounty hunter, and his target happens to be one John Ross (Rory McCann) and his daughter Rose (Caren Pistorius), the latter of whom happens to be Jay's inamorata. Neglecting to mention that his beloved is a wanted fugitive with a $2,000 price tag on her head, Silas tries to instill Jay with enough street smarts to get him through the journey. Unfortunately, some lessons take more quickly and harshly than others. And yet, the film has a light touch of humor to it that, when paired with the frank grimness of the West, works wonders. Maclean peppers the film with sublime sight gags and, in one instance, an outlaw's recollection of a former colleague's disappointment at not having his own wanted poster that could've come right out of the works of Mark Twain. Maclean's film also owes a debt, I feel, to True Grit; the two films feel like they could be spiritual twins. Unlike most of the genre, Slow West doesn't revel in the wide-open Leone-esque expanses of the frontier. Instead, it's squared off in a narrow frame by cinematographer Robbie Ryan, giving it a more intimate flair. Nevertheless, the film is quite lovely to look at. The color palette is striking and, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought Wes Anderson had decided to saddle up for a Western. Certain shots pop, like young Jay wading through the ashen remains of an Indian camp or of a character being abandoned in the desolate prairie with nothing but his longjohns and a blanket. Smit-McPhee, quickly proving himself to be able to transition from his child actor years to adulthood, stands his ground admirably in the part. He also has a skill with silent comedy; most of the audience's guffaws came at Jay's befuddled reactions. Fassbender, who I feel works best when he isn't trying to crank up the intensity, feels very relaxed, giving perhaps his best performance in years. The bulk of the film focuses on just these two actors, although occasionally they share screen time with some colorful characters, including Ben Mendelsohn as a wily, cigar-chewing outlaw. Mendelsohn has been a personal casting choice for a Blood Meridian adaptation, and this would make a hell of an audition reel for it. Despite its humor, Slow West does have an air of solemnity to it. There is the air of lost love, and not just in Jay's desperate struggle to reunite with Rose. There is also a somber sense of loss for that world. In one crucial scene, Jay meets a German anthropologist out in the wilderness, who openly laments the oncoming extinction of the native tribes in the area and the damages of white expansionism. At one point, the man smiles forlornly and says, "In a short time, this will seem like a long time ago." That line, more than any other moment in the film, lingers in the mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I just loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the reviews here seem to be written by contributors who take their cinema VERY seriously (not that there's anything wrong with that, as Jerry Seinfeld would say!). However, my take on Slow West is that I just loved it. It was a beautiful story with a great ending and it was a pleasure to see it all condensed into 84 minutes and not follow the new 'value for money' 3 hour epic scenario that a lot of films seem to be going for these days. All of the actors were superb and I loved the occasional quirky characters that showed up, especially the Congolese trio singing away in the middle of nowhere! So, in my humble opinion, Slow West is a good traditional enjoyable Western movie and that's it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An accomplished and satisfying directorial debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't be misled by the title: this western may start slowly but sure picks up pace with an explosive finale and, while it is set in 1870 Colorado, it is shot in today's New Zealand. Like the twice-made western "True Grit", the story teams a younger person on a search with a cynical veteran: on this occasion 16 year old aristocratic and Scottish Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit-McPhee), searching for his lost love, and the rough, middle-aged, Irish gunslinger Silas Selleck (a superb Michael Fassbender), seeking something more pecuniary. First-time writer and director British John Maclean has crafted an admirable film with atmospheric music, fine pacing, colourful characters, terrific scenery and a compelling narrative. By turns touching, surreal and shocking, at just 84 minutes, every scene counts and drives the story westwards and onwards to a satisfying conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wry exploration of the human condition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review, I wanted to save it for a movie that I was touched by and one that gave me something I didn't expect, in essence a film that gave me everything that I thought it wouldn't. Slow West magnificently portrays the human condition, with all it's defects and strengths. It rather wonderfully and in a very subtle way exposes it's capacity for love and betrayal, loyalty and mistrust, fear and courage. It reveals to us that desperate good people do terrible things to survive in hard times, how hard bitten and essentially broken souls have the means and wherewithal to do good and be forgiving. It shows how we can be innocent and naive and yet still be able to teach, how we can be overly aggressive and yet protective, greedy yet also so very giving. The true wonder of this film is to me is that it exposes to us that all of us can be all of the above at some point in our lives, that we all have the capacity for evil or good and sometimes it is only circumstance that turns us either onto or away from a particular path. It's theme to me is the delicate balance between success and death in the American west during that period from the standpoint of choices made, and to my mind I think it succeeds in portraying this exceptionally well.Many of the reviews I have read on here in regards to this film say it is far too slow, I don't think it is at all, it is a journey, a gradual layering of the story building to a climax, it is not supposed to be action and bells and whistles from the off, I think it is a film that ultimately is trying to make you think; you are invited to explore who we are and what we are capable of as humans in hostile conditions. The performances are excellent all round, the thoroughly underrated Ben Medelsohn particularly as the 'realist' outlaw and Michael Fassbender who commands the screen in all his scenes, as he so often does. I think the writing of the dialogue is fantastic and nuanced, the humour dry and cleverly interspersed and the attention to period detail almost faultless. My only gripe is that there are a couple of scenes that don't seem to fit the narrative, maybe that is what slows this film down for some.I understand that that this kind of western or period drama for that matter is not to everyones taste, that for many 'action' is the byword by which these films stand or fall, well to that I say to each their own. If however you are keen to watch a movie that attempts to reflect back to you just what it means to be a person with all a persons flaws, and how circumstance can shape us into the judged or judgemental, then this very well may be a worthwhile watch for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique and revisionist Western with an outstanding cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A jack rabbit in a den of wolves."After their collaboration together in two short films, John Maclean and Michael Fassbender team up for the director's feature debut in this originally fresh take on the Western genre. In Slow West we get a different glimpse of the West, avoiding the typical Americana style confrontation between cowboys and indians. Here we are introduced to a world where immigrants are trying to force their way through this lawless land. Surviving in this place has nothing to do with how well of a shot you are, it's more about luck and being at the right place at the right time. The story, which was written by Maclean, follows the journey of a 16 year old boy named Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who has traveled from Scotland to the West in search of Rose (Caren Pistorius), the woman he's in love with. Along with her father, John (Rory McCann), they had to flee from Scotland after an incident with Jay's father. Jay is clueless about the West, but determined. He runs into a former bounty hunter named, Silas (Michael Fassbender) who offers his service as his chaperon realizing he will need protection if he wants to survive in this place. What Jay doesn't know however is that there is a bounty for Rose and her father, and there are many people interested in collecting the reward. Among them there is the eccentric Payne (Ben Mendelsohn) who is an old acquaintance of Silas. What the film does extremely well in Slow West is balance the western genre with a dry sense of humor. There are plenty of surprisingly funny moments in this film that help build the story. Through a series of fortunate (and misfortunate) events we follow these characters through their journey. Kodi Smit-McPhee and Michael Fassbender share strong chemistry together and keep us hooked during the slowly paced scene. There is a memorable scene that takes place in a store/bar during the first half of the film and a fantastic final shoot out at the end, which stands out from most Westerns. The film has a unique taste to it and some interesting characters, but the gorgeous cinematography is what stands out in this immense landscape. It's only 84 minutes long, but it is a perfect fit for this movie which ends in memorable fashion. It took its time to grow on me, but the more I think about it the more I end up liking this film. I've always been a huge fan of the Western genre, and adding Michael Fassbender to that mix only makes this an even more rewarding experience. Slow West is stylish and uses its gorgeous landscape very well (it was actually filmed in New Zealand), but it also includes a dreamy atmosphere and plenty of humor. There is a scene during the beginning of the film where Jay is looking at the night stars and pointing his gun towards them and as he imaginarily shoots at them, they light up. There are plenty of dreamy sequences like this one, but there is also plenty of dry humor as well. There is a narration over a camp fire about an outlaw who wants his very own wanted poster. Ben Mendelsohn's eccentric coat is also a feast for the eyes which adds its comedic touch. Slow West has a great cast and it is a film worth recommending. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow and steady won this race.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slow West may live up to it's title but it also proves that a slow pace does not mean it can't be action laced, fun and exciting.Michael Fassbender does an old school style western that reminds me of Eastwood in his glory days. He portrays a man helping a boy from Scotland find his sweetheart who had to skip the country and head to America's West.The movie was visually stunning as the filmmaker used a lot of cool camera tricks to make the Frontier look like colorful art work.Went to see the movie cause Michael Fassbender was in it and I got real nervous as the picture started and I realized how slow it was going, but even though the pace staid slow the energy of the movie does not.Slow west is filled with all the good stuff you loved, with Michael Fassbender playing the anti hero and Ben Mendelsohn playing the colorful villain. Even the fact that it was shot beautifully in New Zealand is a homage to the old school westerns that were shot in Italy.Nothing but cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Quality Different Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a quick review here, Slow West is one of those Indie films in redbox I have wanted to catch up with before I do my best films of 2015 so far. Anything with Michael Fassbender in it is worth seeing and am also a big fan of the always gruesome Ben Mendelsohn. Violence is present throughout.Slow West is an unusual Western about a young Scottish man/boy, Jay (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who is in love and due to a tragedy that he claims to be his fault, his love had to flee to the West. On his way to the west Jay has a run in with some men having a "hunting party" for Indians. At gunpoint and not knowing what to do, Jay is rescued? by Fassbender's character, Silas. They agree to a deal where Silas will protect and lead him to the West for a hundred dollars. Along the way the audience learns that Silas is truly just using Jay in a diabolic way, and that Jay's love Rose and her dad, have a $2,000 bounty on their bodies and Silas wants to collect.On their way, encounters with Bandits and people of many kinds are frequent. Silas also learns a lot about Jay and sometimes seems to becoming fond of him but you are never really sure if Silas is using or helping Jay. Narrating, Silas says about Jay "That kid was a wonder. He saw things differently. To him, we were in a land of hope and good will." The uncertain relationship and even at times, a seeming mentor-ship between Silas and Jay is a component in Slow West that outright works. Will Silas help Jay save his gal or will Jay unknowingly lead Silas to his gal? Slow West is propelled by its great characters and cast. First time writer and director John Maclean has full control of this film and while it may be too slow for some, he succeeds in getting the audience to its inevitable finale caring about the characters and their fates. Overall throughout the film I was only mildly compelled by Slow West and without the intriguing characters, I would of been uninterested. That's what Fassbender and McPhee are their for, tremendously portrayals of their well written characters.While Slow West will most likely miss my top 5 of 2015 so far list, it was an interesting and different look into the West. Hold on and focus on the characters to get you to the extremely effective and absorbing ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better Westerns of the 21st Century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slow West may be a pretty straightforward western on paper, but what makes it stand out is that everyone involved in the film gives it their best. From the acting to the gorgeous scenery, the movie looks great. Some have bashed the movie for being slow paced and too simple, but that seems to be the point of the film. We slowly explore the various obstacles that the west had to offer, whether good or bad. And having the main character come from the far east (Scotland) with a different, more optimistic perspective on life, makes his interactions in the American West quite interesting. That being said, the movie holds multiple surprises and enjoyable scenes that showcase the deadly west.At the heart of the movie, this is a character drama where interactions between characters are meant to be the shining points of the movie. That being said, the movie works because Fassbender and Snit-McPhee are phenomenal together. This is a different take on the western genre (this isn't your father's western), Fassbender plays the typical nomad, but Smit-McPhee plays a fish out of water. He truly does not belong in the west and the movie shows us multiple times where he is flat out helpless. And yes, there is a shoot-out at the end of the movie (can't be a western without a final showdown), but it is the events leading up to this moment that makes the movie pleasurable. Simple western scenarios are spun in a different manner because the characters in said situations aren't made for the brutal western lifestyle.In an era of film where westerns have become a thing of the past (though they seem to be making a comeback), Slow West is one of the better westerns to come along in quite a long time. And since the movie is only 84 minutes long, the movie is short and sweet and gets to the point very quickly. There is not much to dislike here, especially the beauty of the New Zealand countryside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow pace builds to an energetic ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slow West tells the story of Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit-McPhee), a naive and courageous kid who embarks on a dangerous journey to the West, determined to find his love, a beautiful young woman, Rose (Caren Pistorius). He meets and accepts the guidance of Silas (Michael Fassbender), a laid-back gunslinger versed in the ways of the West.Jay, an idealist and a neophyte to the perils of the wilderness, illustrates a touching contrast between his educated, delicate nature and the wickedness around him.The director (John Maclean) controls and carefully addresses all his characters, adds purpose and exquisite emotion, portraying the fragile yet ambitious Jay in a story set with a glance of surrealism.It is not a typical action-packed western, but it is a treat with its stunning cinematography, framing intimate and colorful scenes, both subtle and vivid comical situations and characters, a well-paced feel-good experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don Quixote and Sancho Panza Go West: a Fable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fable: "a short tale to teach a moral." In this case we clearly have echoes of Cervantes: a Don Quixote idealist (McPhee) paired with a Sancho Panza realist (Fassbender) in search of Dulcinea (Pistorius), who may not exist -- at least, as they imagine her. Fables don't require complexity of character, and these are pretty much one dimensional.Two things stood out for me: (1) Fassbender's performance: so at ease, so natural; it made me realize how he's been wasted. We should see him far more often.And (2) New Zealand added a wonderful, dream-like otherness.Who is telling this story? The voice-over purports to be the Realist/Fassbender. But the camera, the scenery, and the music express everything from the POV of the idealist/McPhee. What's going on?I think that Fassbender's character, as he tells the tale, tries to put himself into the character of the kid, and, as realists will do, he exaggerates the kid's simplicity and naivety. Maybe that's why so much of the dialogue comes off as Becketlike hokum.Unfortunately, the effect is to lose the audience. The young man was played so dumb I lost any sympathy for him. But maybe that was the point. In one scene, he is shaved by Silas (Fassbender). For a few moments he looks like a more mature person. He is about to become a man., But half way through they are interrupted and he doesn't make it. Presumably sentimental innocence can never grow up.The narrative structure explained some other oddities, particularly in the case of the Girl/Pistorius. In the young man's remembrance she's presented as a romantic idol. But there's a hint of a different reality when she declares to him that he is "like a little brother," On the strength of this questionable sentiment, though, he journeys all the way to the West. But how does the narrator know this? Is he reconstructing from the kid's narrative and from what the girl may have told him later? Incidentally, that's probably why the background story set in Scotland is so sketchy.When we see her through the Silas' eyes, though, she's the opposite of conventionally "domestic": she can shoot a rifle but she can't figure out how keep butter from melting:.Is Silas a reliable narrator? I think he really killed the kid, and probably the other suitor as well.The Moral: the Realist, not the idealist, gets the Girl.</fullReview>

A lot of what would have been emotional attachment to the story was left on the table by only hinting at the plot line.At one point I didn't know if they ALL weren't out for the money.The journey (and that's all it was) ended with an explosion of events that seem to come before the story was finished telling itself.What would drive a 16 year old to travel across the world, risk his life and go through that for a girl? I don't know... Its only lightly touched on therefore the movie has little emotional pull. The story progression was lacking but the cinematography and quirky scenes leave hope for next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Your Typical Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not your typical Western film as, at times, it has rather a farcical and fantasy-like tone to it. There's a top-notch cast here and, overall, I enjoyed the movie, as it kept my interest throughout wondering how it would all turn out.Set in 1870, Kodi Smit-McPhee stars as Jay Cavendish, a terribly na?ve and idealistic Scottish teen, of blue blood heritage, who's ventured to the Wild West of America. He's in search of whom he regards as his one true love Rose (Caren Pistorious), who has fled Scotland with her father John (Rory McCann) after a scuffle outside their home led to the accidental death of Jay's father Lord Cavendish.On horseback in the dangerous Colorado Territory, Jay is saved by the veteran outlaw Silas, portrayed by the great actor Michael Fassbender. Silas quickly sizes up the precarious situation Jay is in and offers his protection for a price, to guide Jay to Caren.Alas, though, Silas discovers a wanted poster, at a trading post, offering a huge bounty for Rose and her father, either dead or alive. The question will be if Silas will lead Jay to Rose and John and then capture or kill them all. However there's another bounty hunter ahead of them, plus Silas' former gang of outlaws, led by Payne, played by the fine actor Ben Mendelsohn, is trailing them as well, all looking for the huge reward. You can see this is all leading to a wild and very violent finale, which will also contain some surprises.All in all, if you expect this rather farcical Western, capably written and directed by first-time filmmaker John Maclean, to have completely credible plot elements you may become frustrated. However, led by some fine acting, along with some humor, I found quite a bit to like here, and, overall, it was entertaining to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The narrative of John Maclean's first film Slow West never entirely convinces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While stylistically unique in imagery and tone, the latter wavering between gritty and darkly comic, the narrative of John Maclean's first film Slow West never entirely convinces. It is possibly due to the minor running time of barely eighty minutes long. Set in America in 1870, the film is about sixteen year old Scottish lad Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit-McPhee), a well educated, multilingual and determined fellow who's out of his depth in the violence of the West. While Indians are being slaughtered by Americans and their camps are being burnt to the ground, Jay searches for Rose (Caren Pistorious), the girl he loves. Rose and her father escaped Scotland after an accident involving Jay. After walking through the woods and being held at gunpoint, Jay is rescued by Silas (Michael Fassbender), an outlaw who shoots a soldier dead while still holding a cigar in the corner of his mouth. For a fee he escorts Jay across the countryside to find Rose and is surprised by the boy's optimism. His voice-over states: "To him we were in a land of hope and good will. The way I saw it, kick over any rock and a desperado will knife you in the heart." Their contrast in attitudes to the West reflects their life experience. Meanwhile, Silas' former gang, led by Payne (Ben Mendelsohn), continues to stalk them.After making a short film with Maclean, Michael Fassbender opted to star and produce this debut film to guarantee its financing and exposure. There are however noticeable problems with the context of Maclean's script. An early twist in the piece is that Silas is using Jay to lead himself to Rose. There's a bounty on the head of herself and her father that Jay doesn't know about. The twist builds dramatic irony because we wonder if Jay will discover Silas' intentions. But it's contrived and implausible the West somehow knows about people all the way from Scotland, including having them on a wanted posted, and that Rose would be wanted dead or alive for something that wasn't her fault. Similarly, how Silas came to discover Jay's whereabouts is sketchy, hastily explained through the voice-over which says he's been tracking him. The weak exposition and geography of the characters continues into the bloody finale. Rose is living with her father and an Indian in a cabin in an open field, which isn't secluded for people in hiding. She is also more world-weary and skeptical of people than her father and a crackshot with a rifle. Even though this is a movie about adaptation, the story shapes Rose not through progression but as it pleases. Additionally, the brief flashbacks to Scotland show how Rose and Jay are from different classes of family, and how she only sees him as a brother, which is another good twist, but the brevity of these scenes suggests this was a longer film cut right down to size.Some will argue Slow West isn't a film to be judged on authenticity or realism. It was filmed in New Zealand, which proves an attractive substitute for a typical Western location. The woodlands here, photographed through wide and long shots, characterise the narrative as a fairytale where a young man finds himself in the physical danger and metaphor of the forest. The film is aiming to become a semi-comic, tragic love story and a Darwinian examination of those adapting to the West. Jay meets a writer in a travelling caravan who tells him it's a new world for them and the Indians. Like the Indians who die, some will not survive the brutality of the West where money and personal ambition leads to uncontrollable violence. But adding surrealism is an obtuse stylistic goal, only for art-house posturing. There are strange unexpected shots in the film like a low angle to the sky where Jay aims his gun and makes the stars appear and weird episodes like Jay's encounter with the travelling writer. Also bizarre is a dream sequence with Rose and a baby, where I wasn't entirely sure if the dream belonged to Jay or Silas or both men collectively. While you appreciate the originality, it feels showy or lacking in purpose and meaning.The two lead performances aren't hugely stretched by the minimalist dialogue and characterisation but work best in close-up shots. Smit-McPhee is a good young actor and while it's not a role that shows a huge spectrum of emotion, it's in the tighter shots like when he is being interrogated by Payne that he shows nervous energy in the character. Michael Fassbender is a solid presence whose best technique here is acting without dialogue, using his eyes, but there aren't that many close-ups in the film to give him the opportunity. His character changes, unlike Jay who doesn't have an arc but persists with his goal. Even a desperate immigrant he kills in a strong early scene is superfluous to the emotion or the interior of his character. The climax of the film robs him of learning anything or reaching a point of understanding about the West. The ending is also implausible and convenient, adjoining two characters who barely know each other. Could it be another dream? Maybe it's a case of the film being too brief because while it touches on immigrants, adaptation and change, it doesn't always seem credible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A philosophical Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm unsure what genre this film would be: it is sweet and dreamy yet contains emotional turmoil and tragedy with absurdist humour thrown in for good measure. It could be best described as an existentialist action flick. It is set in the wild west days of northern America where the western frontier was abound with lawlessness and where life was cheap. The main protagonist is a thin, pale Scottish lad, Jay, with large blue eyes. He has arrived in America and is heading westward in search of his lost love Rose Ross. Rose and her father John were falsely accused of murder and fled Scotland. They came to start a new life somewhere in the west.Jay is a romantic pacifist without a single violent bone in his body. He looks at the stars, ponders about the natives on the moon and recites poetry. He doesn't know how to shoot a gun nor has the gumption to use it; he is completely hopeless out in the wild. Jay meets Silas the lone ranger by happenstance and the two make a deal where Silas will escort Jay safely across the western frontier to Rose in return for a sum of money. Silas is a man of few words that carries a lot of loneliness and pain. He grew up with a gang of bounty hunters but peeled himself away from them to seek a life of peace while at the same time creating much danger to himself as the gang wants him to come back.Initially Jay doesn't entirely trust Silas and attempts to make the journey himself a couple of times. In his final attempt, he gets seduced by Werner: a man of knowledge and wisdom who also ponders about the world like Jay. There is a segment of a philosophical discussion that takes place between them. Werner is in the process of capturing the knowledge on the lives and culture of the native Indians as, in his opinion, once they are near-extinct and become the minority to the Europeans, their culture and existence will be romanticised and exoticised without any objectivity The two spend the night wondering about time, the universe and fleeting human existence.The scenery in the film is simply stunning and the white clarity of the sunlight adds a surreal feel to the film. It is fantastic to see the New Zealand landscape presented in its raw beauty without adulteration by any CGI which sometimes happened in other major films set in New Zealand.As Jay and Silas continue on in their journey, we discover that there is a handsome bounty on Rose and her father and all the bounty hunters are heading out west alongside Jay and Silas. It is a matter of time before they are found dead or alive as $2000 sits on their heads and Jay and Silas must get there before the bounty hunters.I am unsure what to make of the humour in this film except to compare it to the likes of Park Chan-wook's films (especially Old Boy). It appears at the most unfitting and inappropriate times and it is so fun and childish. For me the humour was what enhanced this film to a thinking piece rather than a western action flick; as the humour made light of the violence and carnage it brought the focus to the journey of mind and body. Overall this film far exceeded the expectation I had from its rather lacklustre title . It is stunning in its looks and its story and I would highly recommend it without a hint of patriotism.This review is taken from www.amateurreviewspace.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Super Average Western with a Few Problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really go into this with any expectations. I figured I'd enjoy it at least, considering the decent ratings. For the most part I did, but it still wasn't that great. The plot is simple. A boy is traveling west to find the woman he loves and a more experienced cowboy joins him. No real problems there.The characters are a big problem in this movie. Some of them, specifically Fassbender's character, has a major sudden change in heart that really isn't ever explained. At least I didn't hear one. They were never really well-developed either. It actually felt kind of realistic, neither character was actually talking to each other until the end. But then suddenly they're friends or something. Whatever their unclear relationship was it came out of nowhere. Some other parts of the movie were a little confusing. Characters getting shot with no one around to do so and other small things that just don't add up. The movie would have benefited from a longer run-time. With the 84 minutes it had it ended up coming off as a little incomplete. I think that there was a good movie in there somewhere, it just needed to be stretched out so that it felt like an actual journey and not just a longer walk. Overall Slow West is just okay. The plot is fine, but the characters are lacking, explanations are needed, and it needed more time to develop everything. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie. It's really just nothing special at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perpetually odd and surprising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The filmmaker's obsession with the Old West never seem to cease, whether it be the rough-and-tumble tales of black vs. white of the 50's, the sweat-drenched stand-off's of the European low-budget efforts of the 60's and 70's, or the revisionist approaches that enjoyed a re-emergence in the mid-2000's, the harsh plains of America's darkest period seem to fascinate every new generation, all of which have a different take on a period that has taken on a mythic quality. Following a couple of successful shorts working with Michael Fassbender, Man on a Motorcycle (2009) and Pitch Black Heist (2011), director John Maclean from The Beta Band makes his feature- length debut with Slow West, a suitably slow-burning and simple tale of lost love, set to the backdrop of violence and a country in unrest.Scot Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is an opportunistic young dreamer who arrives in America in the hope of claiming his lost love. We first meet him at night aiming his gun at the stars, pondering the possibilities of this new land. He then witnesses the execution of Native American's for sport by a gruff Union leader, who is then killed by a skilled bounty hunter named Silas Selleck (Fassbender). Silas agrees to take Jay under his wing, and as their story develops, we soon learn that they are hunting for the same thing for very different reasons. Through flashbacks, we learn that back in Scotland, Jay fell in love with a beautiful girl below his social class, Rose (Caren Pistorius), who could only return platonic love. Along with her father (Rory McCann), Rose fled her homeland after a bounty is placed on their head.Slow West depicts an America that is simultaneously familiar yet unfamiliar. It is the dusty west of the revisionist westerns of recent years where violence comes as second-nature to its inhabitants, and the mountains and woods are filmed with the same sense of wonder and impending danger that has become synonymous with the genre. Yet, the landscape is also alive with colour and natural beauty, as if the flowers were blooming with as much fruitless optimism as Jay's quest to rescue his love, which is frequently placed in peril by the likes of Swedish bandits or the ever-looming Payne (Ben Mendelsohn), a fellow bounty-hunter in a ludicrous fur coat who clearly shares a history with Silas. The decision to film in New Zealand adds to the sense of displacement, as if Jay imagined the world he read about in stories only to discover that it's only half-true.Although the film is as slow-moving as the title may suggest, the relatively short running time means that the pace is brisk and the narrative is never boring. It often feels surreal, like Jodorowsky on a mild day, producing some moments of oddball comedy juxtaposed with the spattering of bloodshed. It's also ludicrous at times - though not always in a bad way - and Maclean frequently explores the themes of man at their most primitive done many times before. But the climax is the work of a director with promise, as the bullets fly and walls become smeared in blood, it's a shoot-out that manages to retain control of the drama happening in between, as well as delivering a truly exciting set-piece. Fassbender says little but has the presence of an old soul, and Smit-McPhee, similar to his role in John Hillcoat's The Road (2009), is effective as the sad- eyed child caught up in a world he doesn't fully understand. Perpetually odd and surprising, Slow West is the melancholic work of a director to keep an eye on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow West is a beautiful, emotionally charged love letter to film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slow West stars Kodi Smit-McPhee as a young Scottish boy who is traveling through the 1870's west in pursuit of the women he loves. Michael Fassbender plays an estranged outlaw who acts as s guide. Obviously Fassbender is incredible. His sense of mystery and confidence makes his character very intriguing and hard to look away from. But the surprise of the film is Smit-McPhee and his ability to go toe-to-toe with Fassbender. A breakout performance from a promising young star.The first thing that jumps out at me about this film is the cinematography. Despite the setting being a raggedy, barren west, this is a beautiful looking film. Every scene is gorgeous western eye candy. That coupled with the slow-burn, unpredictable, surprising script that is full of dark humor. The humor is gritty and shocking, and it definitely added another layer to this film.It's hard to believe this is director John Maclean's first film. He way he slowly reveals certain plot elements without losing interest is very well done. He also pulls off some beautiful symbolism that is both heartbreaking and grounded. I can't wait to see more from Maclean, because he is off to a fantastic start.Slow West is definitely one of those films that you will either love and be able to appreciate as a throwback to old westerns, or a film that bores you and fails to hit home. I definitely love this film and deeply appreciate what it goes for and accomplishes.Overall, Slow West moves at a gradual but intriguing pace, using beautiful cinematography and knock out performances to produce one of my favorite films of 2015 thus far. This movie definitely shocked me and I highly recommend you seek this film out and give it a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A display of contrasting moral and deceptively funny journey to the west.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slow West is a very humble and honest title, the movie delivers exactly that, a road trip in the wild west with an innocent man, a bounty hunter and all sort of outlaws. The pace has a resemblance to Tarantino's movie, surprisingly Inglorious Basterds not Django Unchained. It has a deliberate screenplay that focuses on few characters at a time and calmly set the tone for western thriller.Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a man searching for his lost love. Alone in the cruel western frontier, he immediately crosses path with Silas (Michael Fassbender). Silas has been exposed to the way of the gun for too long and he's pretty sarcastic about Jay's quest.Nevertheless, he takes a sum of money for protection and the two ride off to west while meeting unsavory characters at every stop. These two leads produce strange buddy chemistry due the contrast in personalities. Viewers would easily be sympathetic to the worn out Silas and the incredibly optimistic Jay.The pacing and screenplay are splendid, it's admittedly not fast, yet it introduces the sequences with laid back attitude. This is a very refined approach, since there are heavy themes like murder or abandonment in evidently lighthearted manner. However, the movie never becomes too melodramatic or theatrical, keeping a very accessible tone, down to its darkest scenes.It's unequivocally good how it even maintains some nifty humor along the way. From the proverbial and literal salt on the wound to some near slapstick moments, they never seem to deter the seriousness. In fact it goes hand in hand with the rather brutal tendency, in which there's a plenty of it here, glorious gunslinger action and all that chaotic blood, this is still the wild western frontier.Slow West is the type of movie one can pick up and be immersed in the journey. It's an indication of how sophisticated the production is, delivering heavy subjects and still able to create satire and adoration for the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taking a look on Netflix UK,I discovered that on the same day that Netflix's Adam Sandler Western (!)The Ridiculous 6 was put on the site,that another 2015 Western had appeared,which led to me getting ready to enter the Wild West?.slowly. The plot-1870:Leaving Scotland behind, Jay Cavendish travels to the US in search of his missing lover Rose Ross.Surrounded by Indians with bow and arrows, Cavendish is saved by bounty hunter Silas Selleck.Impressed by his skills, Cavendish hires Selleck to protect him during his search for Rose Ross.As he travels around protecting Cavendish,Selleck spots a wanted poster offering a reward of $20,000 for Rose Ross and her dad.View on the film:Making his debut,the screenplay by John Maclean (who directed a music vid for his brother David's band Django Django) soaks the film in a dour,Gothic atmosphere,with Maclean's opening of flashbacks to Scotland giving Cavendish's search for Rose Ross a doom-laden coat.Keeping the movie to a handful of characters, Maclean counters the warm sincerity of Cavendish with the rustic grit of Selleck,who sees Cavendish's love as a road to a fistful of dollars.Helping to bring the film into town after working with Maclean on a short film,Michael Fassbender gives an excellent performance as Selleck,with Fassbender placing a gap between Selleck &amp; Cavendish with a firm belief that the rules of the West outlaw everything else in life.Finding himself alone in the Wild West, Kodi Smit-McPhee gives a great performance as Cavendish,thanks to Smit-McPhee's keeping Cavendish's love-struck warmth burning to the titles parting shots.Opening with stars dashing across the screen, Maclean &amp; Robbie Ryan gives the Wild West a superb,strange atmosphere.Set in the US (with Scottish leads) and filmed in New Zealand,Maclean and Ryan give the title a tense supernatural atmosphere,with "paper windows" and mysteriously disappearing outlaws placing Cavendish's search half way into an alt world.Showing the beautiful New Zealand landscape (does it ever look bad?) in stylish, restrained shots,Mclean gives the movie a starkly haunting post-apocalypse appearance.Avioding any salons or bar room brawls,Mclean makes the outdoor locations look like nature is reclaiming the Wild West,as Selleck and Cavendish find themselves surrounded by wilderness for miles,with brittle gunshots being the only thing to break the silence of the slow West.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pleasant Surprise For Western Aficionados!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Splendidly photographed, methodically paced &amp; brilliantly directed, Slow West arrives as a pleasant surprise in the genre of westerns for it features a very straightforward premise but beneath that simple-looking plot lies hordes of themes that one usually associates with the legacy of the Wild West and for a debut feature, it's a pretty impressive final product.Set in the 1870s, the story of Slow West follows a young Scottish fellow who travels across America in pursuit of the woman he loves and after an unexpected incident, finds himself in the company of a bounty hunter who's willing to take him to his destination. As they further head into the West, it soon becomes clear that both of them are looking for the same thing but for different reasons.Written &amp; directed by John Maclean, Slow West marks his filmmaking debut and there's no denying that it's a very impressive start to his career. Maclean's work exhibits a restrained, careful &amp; patient approach in handling the scripted material and despite the simple setting, his subtle addressing of the American West themes offers some nice food for thought. And it's gonna be interesting to see where he journeys from here.The exotic, lush locations of New Zealand stand in for the American West and is exquisitely photographed by its camera. Its colourful surroundings are beautifully captured and its fab use of bright colour tones only adds greater enhancements to those images. Its 84 minutes of runtime is deliberately slowed down to provide a more immersive experience, and finally, the background score stays in congruence with the unfolding action.Coming to the performances, Slow West features a fine cast in Kodi Smit-McPhee, Michael Fassbender, Ben Mendelsohn, Caren Pistorius &amp; Rory McCann, and all do an adequate job in their given roles. Smit-McPhee is still unable to express any other emotion than the ever- afraid one which at times suited his character here. Fassbender is the real deal and does a terrific job with what he's given, and the input from the rest of its cast is good enough.On an overall scale, Slow West is definitely amongst the better indie films released this year and begins Maclean's filmmaking career on a promising note. Crafted with care, composure &amp; precision craftsmanship, smeared with wry sense of humour, even more augmented by its gorgeous backgrounds &amp; ingenious use of camera, carried by an assured performance from Fassbender, and succeeding as a rich, refreshing &amp; riveting example of its genre, Slow West is a surprising delight for western aficionados.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new take on the Western genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The genre of the western hasn't been all that prevalent in the 21st Century. The last true western masterpiece was Unforgiven in 1992. Since then traditional westerns have become a sort of lost art. Slow West attempts to go back to the roots of the American western and does it with great success. Slow West stars Kodi Smit-McPhee as the na?ve, Scottish, Jay. We follow him on a journey across the American frontier in search of his sweetheart, Rose. Due to a misunderstanding with the law back in Scotland, Rose and her father John had to flee to the United States. The young lovers are separated and Jay is determined to get back to his girl. Along the way Jay hires the outlaw Silas, played by Michael Fassbender, to guide him across the Colorado territory. As most great Westerns, Slow West is about a journey of self-discovery, betrayal, and the grey area between the good and bad. Silas is the rough and tough, hit man of the old west. He's cynical and trusts no one. Jay is young and hopeful and still believes in the goodness of man. This movie does a wonderful job of showing the two contrasting ideologies play off one another. As the film progresses, we see how both men have been proved right and wrong in their respective beliefs. Both characters grow to respect one another's viewpoints and begin to see how each other is right. Jay sees the brutality and ruthlessness of man. And how some people would go as far as to hurt the innocent for his or her own gain. Silas sees how sometimes the good in people can trump the evil. The film is unusually short, at 84 minutes. But the pacing does feel uneven at points. Films that barley hit the 90 minute mark should be fast paced and to the point. Slow West takes its time to get the ball rolling and, in turn, hurts the pacing. However slow the film may get, the audience is always treated to gorgeous scenery. The lush green grass contrasts beautifully with the bright blue skies. The wheat farms, with mountains as the backdrop, make every frame pop. Most westerns tend to have a dark filter over them. Where the greys and dark yellows and blues take over the screen. Slow West changes things up by saturating the bright greens and blues that gives the film a much more dreamy quality to it. The acting is across the board, wonderful. Michael Fassbender has yet to give a bad performance and Slow West is no exception. Smit-McPhee plays innocence and general confusion brilliantly. The chemistry between the two shines where it's needed but isn't the strong suit of the movie. I can't say I'd recommend this film to everyone. It's a slow burn and is more for fans of westerns rather than someone relatively new to the genre. But for those fans, Slow West is a great addition to the lengthy catalog of stories about the American West.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One's a falling angel - the other one's a rising devil.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slow West is written and directed by John Maclean. It stars Kodi Smit-McPhee, Michael Fassbender, Ben Mendelsohn, Caren Pistorius and Rory McCann. Music is by Jed Kurzel and cinematography by Robbie Ryan.It's the late 1800s and a teenage Scottish aristocrat travels to the American West to track down the girl he loves with all his heart...There has been a number of modern day directors who have not only refused to let the Western genre die, but also to not be afraid to take it to a harshness of the West level. They have chosen to strip it back to a sense of realism, with no frills and bunting, just a show of tough times populated by tough people and people tough out of luck. Slow West is one such Oater.For his first full length feature, John Maclean has chosen to make a genre of film he clearly knows something about. It's got some familiar tropes - greenhorn, grizzled bounty hunter, deadly gang et al, but Maclean has still made a fresh picture, one that not only intrigues and excites, but also humours by way of some black comedy inserts.Essentially it's a travelogue piece, McPhee's lovelorn Jay Cavendish ends up being escorted on his journey by Fassbender's mysterious tough guy Silas Selleck. It's an odd yet engaging pairing, and as they are pursued by Selleck's old gang, and they come across a number of eccentric or devious characters, you may find yourself hoping that all the hidden agendas - the secrets bubbling away in the background - do not shatter the surrogate relationship neither was looking for.His heart was in the wrong place.Ah, but yes! Maclean shows gumption to go all mud and blood on our butts, building everything to a quite terrific final quarter of film that has rode in on a black stallion straight from noirville. No printing the legend here, it's a bitter commentary on the romanticised view of the Old West. Western fans keen of ear will pick up on some historically spiky dialogue exchanges, whilst also noting the nods towards the immigration angles, where Maclean doesn't pull punches as to how desperate the Old West was for many of those who travelled hoping for a better life.Predominantly filmed in New Zealand (superbly standing in for the American West), the panoramic cinematography is stunning, while it's great to see the backdrops are not just mountainous desert scapes, this journey goes through forestry as well. Cast are on prime form, Fassbender seems to be a given these days and it's hoped he will do a Western again, and McPhee plays off of him with genuine conviction. Then there's Mendelsohn, who has to be one of the finest Australian character actors working today, he's perfectly cast here, so his fans know exactly what they will be getting.The poster art is hugely frustrating, showing Caren Pistorius with a big beaming smile on her face, that is very much a bum steer. You would be wise to take more note of the faces of Messrs McPhee, Fassbender and Mendelsohn on that poster, for their facial portraits are more in keeping with this cracker-jack Western. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A competent coming-of-age tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a grueling journey from Scotland to America on a quest to reunite with his beloved, Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit-McPhee) crosses paths with a mysterious drifter named Silas (Michael Fassbender) in the forests of Colorado. It's fortuitous timing, as Jay has gotten himself into a bit of trouble, and Silas understands that violence is necessary in order to survive in the west - a concept which the timid youth struggles to grasp.For a price, Silas offers to accompany Jay on his journey to locate his sweetheart - although as we learn through a series of flashbacks sprinkled throughout the film, Rose (Caren Pistorius) may not be terribly excited to see Jay again. But she'll almost certainly be less excited by an introduction to Silas, who knows that a reward has been offered for the capture of Rose and her father (Rory McCann) in relation to a crime that occurred before their journey to America.Further complicating matters is Payne (Ben Mendelsohn) and his group of bounty hunters, with whom Silas has a prior relationship. After crossing paths with Jay in the woods, Payne and his men seem to always be lurking just out of sight, lending the latter half of the film a near-constant sense of foreboding as we keep waiting for them to strike.Slow West gradually peels back the layers of its narrative while constantly remaining focused on the burgeoning friendship between Jay and Silas. Despite his distaste for ferocity, Jay finds himself becoming increasingly reliant on Silas and his wisdom, while Silas tries to fight a growing desire to protect the boy from the dangers of a world he isn't prepared for.Director John MacLean (who also wrote the screenplay) gives the quieter moments just enough room to breathe before punctuating them with instances of absurdly black humor or sudden, brutal flashes of violence, both of which seem to have been influenced by the likes of Quentin Tarantino and the Coen Brothers. Of particular note is a tense, riveting shootout during the film's climax, featuring a moment so farcical that I burst out laughing in spite of the on screen carnage. It's the kind of thing only the most competent of filmmakers could get away with, and MacLean absolutely nails it.But despite MacLean's prowess as a writer and director, Slow West ultimately succeeds on the strength of its cast, with Smit-McPhee as the wide-eyed innocent and Fassbender as the grizzled, trail-weary wanderer. Mendelsohn deserves a nod for being suitably creepy as the flick's sort-of villain, but at its heart, this is a coming-of-age story about a young man in need of a strong role model and father figure, who finds it in the most unlikely of places.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nope, I'm sorry, all the high reviews are from people that never saw a real western. This movie is so bad because it tries to be a western but with the mentality of today. The script it's ridiculous, basically it's everyone dies. People get shot and have arrows pierce their hands but everything is OK, like it doesn't hurt. The only thing good in this movie is the landscape, and the horses. All the clichés of cowboys bad, American Indians good. Immigrants good people that only steal because they have families starving. I mean common, does this movie has any original idea? anything new? no, it goes on and on with clichés, good bounty hunter(we don't know why the all movie) drinks with bad bounty hunter(we don't know why either), no story behind the characters. The only bad guy that starts to be likable, the priest with a rifle inside a trunk(cliché), dies 1 minute after he starts shooting people with the rifle. The Scottish family that supposedly has some background story(cliché), and that we don't know, and nobody tell us what it is, I mean ridiculous! how do you want us to care for anyone if we don't know what everyone does in this movie? or more important, why they do it? The best part of the movie is the bounty hunter story at night, I mean that 5 minute story is better than the all movie in terms of script, actors, and action. I can't believe even that so much good actors signed for this movie, the actors it's not the problem really, that's why I give it 2 stars, 1 for the landscape and scenery, and another for the actors, but that's it. We see Indians but they're just this mystical people that comes and goes and disappears and don't say anything important. I sincerely can't believe that people gave this movie more than 5 stars, or even 5 stars, have they watch westerns in they're lifes? are these people from the movie, or with any connection to the filmmaker or the country it was filmed? give me a break, Fassbender did charity on this one, but this is definitely a movie I won't see ever again in my life. Now I have to wash my eyes with Once Upon a Time in the West because of all the crap that I've just seen...</fullReview>

He encounters native villagers who are hunted by Indian fighters. Silas Selleck (Michael Fassbender) rescues him from the ruffians. Silas insists on traveling with the naive boy. Silas discovers that Rose and her father have a $2000 bounty on their heads. Payne (Ben Mendelsohn) leads a ragtag team looking to take the bounty.It's a New Zealand/UK western. It's a slow burning road trip. There are big explosive scenes but mostly it's quiet. Kodi Smit-McPhee and Michael Fassbender are a low energy duo. The robbery of the general store is quite intense. The action scenes are shot stylistically rather than with intensity. I didn't really get involved with the characters but there are a couple of good scenes. It's the first full-length feature for director/writer John Maclean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the Western genre. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is one of my all time favorite films and I'm always on the lookout for a modern western that can kick-start the genre. I was hoping this would be the film but unfortunately I don't think most people will find it appealing. The acting is top notch, especially from Fassbender and Mendelsohn, but ultimately the pace and the melancholic ending will leave most people wanting more. If you liked the look and feel of The Homesman or the slow burn of Meek's Cutoff check this film out. If your looking for an action western with a Hollywood ending then this is a film you should skip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going across the Atlantic to find the lost love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A western movie set in the 1870 United States, but entirely shot in the New Zealand. The story of a 16 year old boy, Jay, from Scotland embarks a journey in the New World in search of his love, Rose. Later a bounty hunter joins him and makes sure his safe travel. Technically, it was a road movie, but reveals the plot from the other angles as well in the spare times like during camping at the nights.The narration was too slow and the story was ordinary, but it was enough for me to get engaged. If you wait until the final scene, especially till you figure out the puzzle of the romance theme, you may like it better. The end was so good, just like what a western movie fan looking for, a gunfight. Interestingly, that was not to be heroic, except all the earlier disasters pushed for the finale and the post finale. It is rated R, because it is so brutal in some way and for being faithful to the genre.It might not be a dream debut for the director like the big cast, the high budget and a great commercial success, but giving a satisfying movie in a simple way was his accomplishment in his first attempt. Kodi Smith-McPhee is almost 20 and he's yet to play his independent and powerful enough character that will bring acknowledgement. It was a close one, the narration started like it was his, and he was everywhere in the movie. Then going further, especially when it nears the end, he was kind of fading. But he was awesome, along with Michael Fassbender. Not a must see, as well as not refusable if you get a chance to see it.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just be true (the way you do)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one to see from a distance of affectation for me, it doesn't abet more. It's not that it rearranges the western that keeps me, that's fine; there's no higher truth in the vocabulary of form for anyone to venerate it, that is just the tool by which we bring to life.Westerns were always nostalgic attempts to cultivate purity anyway, what people thought as such at the time; a world rife with anomie, but the actions of the individual set it right and the wide expanse of desert and sky crystallizes with clarity. It is life revealed with purity I'm after and this maker is striving for purity in his own way, by skewing the form of the story. A boyish hero who will take no other action than to drive on through lawless country to see his loved one again. The purity is that there might not be love on the other end but the struggle to be there for it is beautiful and worthy.(I want to say that this is all as far removed from Kit Carson's world as the notion of 'westerns' but something keeps me. It seems to me that the boy's cause - notions of noble love and death - would be more familiar to that time than Wayne's blustering swagger.) But just as I don't want form as relic, I'm also just not satisfied when it becomes about mere difference. Endearment is thought to suffice here. It does endear and I applaud the chance taken. But I want the jolt of awakening and this doesn't.The world of difference can be traced in the two influences used to make it, Wes Anderson and Herzog. The encounter in the desert with the itinerant thinker studying the absurd nature of the land is a nod to the latter, his voice tailored to be Werner's from his own studies of the same. But these are different worlds. It's not so much that one stylizes and the other not, they both do (every film); it's that one decorates walls, the other tears them down or puts them up to awaken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lyrical western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westerns are back the last decade but with a different approach. They are more lyrical and sentimental with nice photography and music. "Slow West" is a movie with all this characteristics and has even more benefits as the performances are great - I didn't expect anything less from Michael Fassbender. I enjoy more the last half hour of this film because it is more adventurous, the story flows quicker and finally you think that something is happening. On the contrary, the first hour is boring and slow - of course the title of the movie rings a bell - and looks like a documentary. If you are a fan of westerns is not a bad choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautifully Shot And Acted Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young Scottish man travels across America in pursuit of the woman he loves, attracting the attention of an outlaw who is willing to serve as a guide.Slow West is a beautifully shot and acted tale about the search of love and meaning in 19th Century Frontier America. We are given a whole new perspective of the Wild West from the eyes of a young optimistic and determined "Jay Cavendish" played by Kodi Smit-McPhee who bring a likability and a sense of honesty to the role. His straight taking, no nonsense guide "Silas" is played by the supremely talent Michael Fassbender.This is John MacClean feature length directorial debut and I am excited to see what comes next from his fledgling talent. The story flows and the cinematography is incredible which manages to capture the true beauty of its landscape much like Dennis Hooper's masterpiece Easy Rider. "Jay's" flashbacks give us an insight to his emotions and the love that acts as his motivation for the journey. Fassbender's "Silas" begins to understand "Jay" which allows him to progress and have his own personal arc. The final shootout of the film is thrilling and kept me right at the edge of my seat not knowing what would happen next.The film does get confused in certain scenes and personally I felt MacClean could have increased its run time to have a more eventful sequence in the forest. Although the two leads are fully realised and developed other characters don't have enough screen time for the audience to truly buy into their motivations, "Jay's" love interest "Rose Ross" and her father "John Ross" are intriguing characters that I wish I could have seen more of.Overall Slow West is a well-crafted and executed film with fantastic cinematography and compelling lead characters. I am going to give Slow West an 8.4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent western flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Western is not a genre anymore that is on par with the likes of drama, comedy, animation etc. in terms of quantity. So it's nice to see a western film here and there that is actually a decent watch. It would be great to have at least one quality western per year. Last year we had Mads Mikkelsen's "Salvation" and even if "Slow West" is not as a good, it is still a contender for best western film of 2015. The cast is pretty multi-cultural. Smit-McPhee is Australian just like Mendelsohn, Fassbender is German, Pistorius (still fairly unknown, but bound to rise) is from New Zealand. The film's director John Maclean is British and actually worked with Fassbender on a short film before, but not the one that won Maclean a BAFTA. For him it's the first full feature movie as writer and director. He has written songs, however, for feature films in the past."Slow West" only runs for 84 minutes and that already includes 5 minutes of closing credits, a pretty short movie. That is not a problem at all as it is significantly better this way than with including a couple more pointless scenes and having it run for 100 minutes. The cast was good as a whole I might say. Fassbender may have been the best, but there was no real standout just like nobody was bad either. You could maybe divide this film into 3 sections, the first one being about the two main characters going closer and their journey, the second one being about Mendelsohn's character entering the picture and the last sequence being the finale with the duo (and their tail) reaching their destination and the final spectacular shootout scene. However, apart from that one and a couple more scenes, this is actually a fairly slow movie just like the title implies already. I had a good time watching and recommend this to those who love themselves a quality western occasionally just like I do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Building up slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a reason the word "slow" is in the title. Don't expect this to be guns blazing the whole time. Though I was surprised by the running time. I thought this was going to be at least a two hour affair. But the short time works for the movie and the slow build up to a climax that does reward the viewing.The acting is great too and even some choices do make sense, if you think about them after its revealed why characters chose to do what they did. It's still a bleak affair and might not feel as engaging as some might want it to be. Acting is amazing and everything fits (not only the wardrobe that is, but everything).

		<shortDescription>Excellent Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Fassbender proves once again to be one of the top actors working today. Here he is teamed up with a teenage boy from Scotland in pursuit of his true love who has left their home country with her father under ambiguous circumstances. The boy meets up with Fassbender, who becomes his guide on the horseback journey through the violent west of cowboys and Indians, who could prove equally dangerous. Kodi Smit-McPhee is the kid, and he is perfectly suited for his role as the na?ve and love struck teen. Fassbender chews a cigar along the way in an obvious tribute to Clint Eastwood's "man with no name" Hollywood westerns. It all works, with magnificent scenery of what is actually Scotland and New Zealand substituting for the American West. The story is simple and the bad guys formulaic, but due to the excellent cast and realistic script and surprising finish, I rank Slow West as one of the best films of 2015.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"These violent delights have violent ends."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's more than a good thing that we've gotten beyond the formulaic Westerns of the Thirties, Forties, Fifties and Sixties. The last couple decades or so have seen a host of revisionist Westerns that capture the real grit and grime of an era gone by, with films like "Unforgiven", "3:10 to Yuma" and "Appaloosa" coming immediately to mind. Romantic notions of a solitary life lived on the trail are quickly dispelled by the murderous intentions of outlaws living from day to day and taking their spoils as they come.The unlikely pairing of young Scot Jay Cavendish (Jody Smit-McPhee) and gunslinger Silas Selleck (Michael Fassbender) defies normal Western conventions, and as we come to learn, Silas has an ulterior motive for befriending the na?ve young traveler. The object of Jay's love is wanted for murder along with her father, as the Rosses attempt to elude a host of bounty hunters and killers in the American West of the 1870's. Silas is one of these bounty men.The story turns normal Western conventions on their head, as early on, Silas inhumanely leaves two orphaned children to fend for themselves on the prairie. That their mother was shot in the back by Jay Cavendish seems to be of no concern, a coming of age moment for the young Scotsman who must live with his guilt and keep moving because he has no other options.The irony of the finale occurs when Rose Ross (Caren Pistorius) reflexively shoots her former beau while under attack by Payne's marauders. She offers brief redemption by secretly handing off her weapon to the dying Cavendish who ends the attack by fatally shooting Payne (Ben Mendelsohn). Coming full circle, Silas takes up with the young woman to start a new life, complete with the orphans who made it as far as he had. The ending perhaps is a concession to tying things up in a neat package and may not ring entirely true for some viewers, though it allows Silas to fulfill his character as an honorable man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Naturalist Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would recommend this movie to people who would like to take a breath from the action-filled, overly-fantastic and unrealistic style of modern popular cinema. Slow West is a refreshing take on Westerns, where events happen as they so often do in reality, without purpose, sporadically and not making conventional "sense". Though despite having a somber over-tone, in the end the plot completes the circle in a positive morale, that being that life goes on and is more than just surviving at times. Also the movie is peppered with lovely dark humor. In fact it is a combination of some of the equal aspects of life, love and greed, randomness and fate. And that to me was what I took most from Slow West; a real life story set in fantasy, that has more to offer about the world we live in, and depicts it better than the majority of films. So if a bit of philosophy is what you were looking for, then you've come to the right place. "That kid was a wonder. He saw things differently. To him, we were in a land of hope and good will."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Slow West" may announce itself as an art-house western and one hailing from New Zealand rather than Hollywood at that, but it is still magnificent and not simply one of the best films I've seen this year but one of the great westerns. It may signal its young writer/director John Maclean, (making his feature debut), as being in thrall of his elders, and some might say at this stage, his betters as well as taking his cues from the likes of "McCabe and Mrs Miller" and "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" but here is a film full of imagination as well as virtuoso technique that merits serious critical attention. There is also a large helping of "True Grit" to its plot with young greenhorn Kodi Smit-McPhee journeying West in the company of bounty hunter and killer Michael Fassbender in search of his true love, encountering other bounty hunters, outlaws and Indians on the way.Dialogue is sparse and poetical with both Smit-McPhee and Fassbender acting as our narrators, very much in the style of early Malick while the film is as visually gorgeous and as inventive as anything in the Malick oeuvre, (the DoP is Robbie Ryan). There is also a terrific score by Jed Kurzel. The two leads are first-rate and there's a wonderfully laid-back performance from Ben Mendelsohn as one of the films many villains, (indeed, everyone in this film is a killer of one kind or another). If the territory it explores isn't particularly new, (even the surreal asides feel somehow familiar), Maclean's handling of the material is outstanding and scene after scene lodges in the memory. In a year that has also seen Tommy Lee Jones' magnificent "The Homesman", who says the western is dead?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filled with adventure and a meaningful message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A light-hearted score by Jed Kurzel ("The Snowtown Murders") punctuates Slow West, first-time director John Maclean's 84-minute deconstruction of the myth of the frontier. Winner of the grand jury prize in the international dramatic competition at Sundance, the U.K.-New Zealand co-production is a slow burn that is awash in contradictions. Starring Michael Fassbender ("12 Years a Slave") and Kodi Smit-McPhee ("Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"), Slow West is a serious look at the plight of mistreated Native Americans and the dreams of youth, a buddy picture and a road movie filled with adventure and a meaningful message, but also replete with cruelty and protracted violence and the blackest of humor, sometimes delivered at inappropriate moments.Like Jim Jarmusch's 1995 revisionist Western, "Dead Man," Slow West has the quality of a dream, poetic and beautiful, almost other-worldly, yet filled with an unmistakable sadness and a desperate loneliness, the flip side of the myth of the heroic pioneer: Brave, determined, and fiercely independent. Gorgeously shot in the beautiful vistas of New Zealand by cinematographer Robbie Ryan ("Philomena"), the film is set in Colorado Territory in 1870. In the words of archaeologist Katherine Routledge, "Everywhere is the wind of heaven; round and above all are boundless sea and sky, infinite space and a great silence." When the film opens, as a dreamy-eyed young man points his gun at a kaleidoscope of stars in the distant sky, each star seems to light up.Only sixteen, Jay Cavendish (Smit-McPhee), has traveled from Scotland in pursuit of an idealistic romance with Rose Ross (Caren Pistorius, "The Most Fun You Can Have Dying") who is on the run with her father John (Rory McCann, "Clash of the Titans") after a murder in Scotland. Though to Jay she is his true love, in flashback Rose calls him a "silly boy" and condescendingly tells him that her feelings for him are similar to ones she might have for a younger brother. Nonetheless, Jay is willing to endure unknown hardships to find Rose, unaware that there is a bounty of $2,000 on her head and that of her father, a hefty sum in those days. Struggling to survive in an unfamiliar land where violence is endemic, Jay runs into Silas Selleck (Fassbender), a former bounty hunter and member of the Payne gang who offers to help him find his sweetheart for a fee.Silas is a hard-nosed Clint Eastwood "make my day" kind of guy and, while Jay recognizes that he is a cynical brute who believes he is beyond the law, the boy is need of guidance and unconcerned about aspects of his character or any hidden motive Silas may have. When the fur-coated Payne (Ben Mendelsohn, "Black Sea") shows up with his gang of bounty hunters, however, Jay's eyes are opened to the possibility of treachery, reinforced when he discovers that Silas and Payne are old acquaintances. There are other vignettes that mark their journey that underscore the perils of the frontier: An illuminating scene between Jay and Werner (Andrew Robertt), a writer from Germany who is documenting the "extinction of aboriginal peoples" throughout the world; a conversation in French with Congolese singers; and a spate of dead bodies when Swedish immigrants, desperate to feed their children, repeat the only English words they know, "blanket," "sorry," "money," and "please," with the result being two orphan children.Both Fassbender and Smit-McPhee bring a great deal of authenticity and presence to their performances. As the two bond, their attitudes undergo subtle but unmistakable changes. Seeing Jay's fearless determination, Silas becomes softer and more protective, pondering Jay's advice that there is more to life than survival. The scene in which Silas teaches the young man how to shave by using a sharp knife tells a lot about their relationship. Jay also grows exponentially in maturity in the strange setting where life is cheap and a misstep can end in sudden death.Author J. R. R. Tolkien ("Lord of the Rings") said, "From the ashes a fire shall be woken, a light from the shadows shall spring; renewed shall be blade that was broken, the crownless again shall be king." Like many traditional Westerns, Slow West ends in an explosive shootout that takes place around a little cabin abridging a wheat field, but the ending thwarts conventional expectations and lifts the film from the ordinary to the transcendent, suggesting that not only is there more to life than survival, but that the possibility of transformation is always present.</fullReview>

There are action, brutal shootouts, some genuine moment, smart and involving script, good acting by all involved. There are some truly genuine scenes in this movie, like the one with fallen three and man under him - hilarious. Overall, "Slow West" isn't a typical western.

		<shortDescription>Slow, Beautiful West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's because I'm a die-hard Fassbender fan, but he is always worth watching, even if the film is bad. I am not a great connoisseur of Western - I've watched Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West" and "For a Few Dollars More", and Kevin Costner's "Dances with Wolves" only - but until now I loved them. This one is no different.Slow paced as the title suggests, Slow West is a bizarre, captivating, funny, touching and violent Western road trip that confirms John Maclean as a big talent.British director and writer John Maclean, through the eyes of naive dreamer Jay, tells a beautiful story, with a memorable ending, about the violence in the New World, cynicism, and money rush that involves everybody, both natives and immigrants. Also, he manages to balance life and death with some great comedic elements. There is no much character development, but considering the great result achieved, I don't feel like complaining about it.Filmed in New Zealand, the scenography lacks in Canyons, and provides a sense of loss, yet the spectacular landscapes give you hope. The cinematography by Robbie Ryan is great, and the musical score by Jed Kurzel blends with the film.The acting is sublime. Michael Fassbender, both leading character and narrator, delivers another wonderful performance - he has improved his American accents quite a lot since "12 Years a Slave" - and his humour perfectly fits the character and this road trip. Kodi Smit-McPhee does a fantastic job in the other leading role. However, the most memorable is Caren Pistorius as the beautiful Rose. She does not have lot of screen time, but she is in the frame she captures your full attention.Michael Fassbender once said, "The great thing about doing independent films is that they move fast, and I like that. I like the speed, and having to be on your toes...The little films need the big films to do well because they are dependent on getting that money. "Frank" gets made because I do something like "X-Men: First Class" or "Prometheus". I don't think thanking him from the bottom of my heart will be enough.

		<shortDescription>A breezy breath of fresh air</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slow West clocks in briskly under 90 minutes, which is usually unheard of for a western. You can stamp out any thoughts of it being rushed or too slight of a flick though, because it's exactly what it needs to be every step of the way. It's a beautifully scored, tightly plotted and boldly characterized (the key ingredient in the genre, if you ask me) mix that saunters along like a mule of the plains, before kicking up the dust for a bloody, atmospheric finale that leaves you stunned and breathing hard. Westerns are often ambitious, lofty affairs and can get quite moody and too densely packed for their own good. Not this baby. It breezes by like a summer wind, with just enough violence, character development and aching catharsis to billow out its chipper narrative during the brief stay we are treated to. Kodi Smit McPhee plays a young Scottish lad who is a tad out of his depths in the American west, searching for a girl (Caren Pistorius) who had to flee the country with her father (The Hound himself, Rory McCann). McPhee is naive to the dangers of this new territory, and nearly finds himself at the receiving end of a bullet before being saved by a roaming outlaw (Michael Fassbender) who takes him under his wing with much gruff and huff along the way. Reluctance is doled out along with sympathy on Fassbender's part as he shields the boy from a dangerous bounty hunter and former employer of his, played by a wonderfully greasy Ben Mendelsohn, perpetually shrouded in acrid cigar smoke and snuggled up in one epic and fabulous fur pelt. These three wayward misfits gravitate towards the obligatory final shoot out, which takes place in the girl's hideaway house on the picturesque pretty plains. Impressive is an understatement for this sequence: yellow grass sways, a hailstorm of bullets punctuate the horizon and the mournful tones of Jed Kurzel's lonely score, grim fates are earned in a gorgeous set piece that resembles something like Wes Anderson making an Oater. Everything before and winds up to this sequence, and the payoff is superb. If I've made it sound dark or off putting, think again. It's all crafted with the utmost light and poetic buoyancy, a lilting sadness to the violence that hits home but never batters you. The performances echo this as well, Fassbender a world weary, affable and altogether dangerous man, Mendelsohn slithering about with a dry silver tongue and an itchy trigger finger, and a fish out of water McPhee stuck in between. The visual palette is quite something to see, accented by the music perfectly. I'm beyond anxious to see what first time director John Maclean comes up with for us for his next ride, for he's knocked it out of the ranch with this one. Ho for the West.</fullReview>

I had just watched Hateful 8 and was quite disappointed with the ending. So when I was a bit skeptical when I was about to watch another western movie from a new director. But all my apprehensions disappeared 5 minutes into the movie. Its quite an impressive debut for director John Maclean. Slow West revolvers around a young Scottish boys journey into the 19th century outlaw America in the search for the girl he loves. In his journey he is accompanied by a mysterious outlaw in Michael Fassbender. The plot seems pretty simple and the movie itself is only 90 mins. However within that time the movie is able to portray the wilderness of the 19th century, A young mans quest for love, and an outlaws way of life. However its the ending that makes you wonder what exactly the message of this movie. And for as simple as it is it does make you think for a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love, a chase and Bounty hunters in a western that does nothing to change the genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The recent crop of westerns have all had mixed reviews but one thing that is true is that they are all sticking firmly to the themes of the classic westerns. This one takes the bounty hunter theme and a hunt for a lost love and gives it a revamp. Kodi Smit McPhee ('The Road') plays Jay Cavendish who has tracked his love ? Rose ? from Scotland. He is wandering the wilds of the Old West when he runs into Silas Selleck (Michael Fassbender). Silas takes Jay under his wing and agrees to help him - in return for a wad of cash.The problem is that Selleck is a bounty hunter and so are quite a few others and they are all looking for the same quarry ? and that is the same as Jay. What follows is the story of the search and hunt.Now this is really well made, the acting is great it has a feeling of realistic fatalism from the start and it does not fail to deliver. The period detail is great and the language is of its time too. The general criticism is that it is nothing new ? the story has been told before. That is also true of 'The salvation', 'Dark Valley' and 'The Homesman' to name but three modern westerns. The thing is I really loved all of them, I have a soft spot for westerns and I like the good versus evil and even the occasional black hat to prove who the bad guy is, so I have been far from let down by this. There are innovative westerns and there are poor copies of classics; whilst this is neither it is a great film on a small budget with well realised and recognisable themes and as such if that floats your boat or indeed paints your wagon, then you will not go far wrong with this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slow West is a story about a young man wanting to reunite with his long love but has to travel long ways to do it in 19th century western America. The problem is at this particular time out west it's extremely hard to live by traveling on horseback day and night, especially by yourself as a late teen. So Kodi Smit-McPhee, playing the young and inexperienced Jay, comes across Silas, played by Michael Fassbender and they each take on the journey to find his love, Rose.Of course, once you find out more about Rose and her father, the film gets a whole lot more interesting. But at face value, the film is pretty basic anyway. It's an independent film with a low budget and in turn the run-time is a breezy 84 minutes. Which is good because it's an easy watch, but there's also not a ton of backstory so you don't get a chance to get to know the characters as well as I may have liked. McPhee and Fassbender give great performances and set a coming of age feel to the film. I always love the stories of two characters who view life vastly different, and by the end of the film have learned a thing or two from each other (ironically both of them are now X-Men teammates). Fassbender definitely puts to rest any critics of him being in a western, myself actually being one of them.This film being very short was probably my biggest issue, the story itself doesn't have any holes because it's so basic. But a very good debut for director John Maclean. I love his depiction of the dead or dead lifestyle of 19th century western America. In all, Slow West is a nice little Indi and another great performance from Fassbender.+Fassbender can do anything+McPhee shows promise+Brutality-Too short7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A curious and inventive take on the Western genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A curious and definitely promising debut from young British filmmaker John Maclean, Slow West is a darkly funny trip to the Wild West that sadly never actually fully feels like it is a proper Western due to obvious budget constraints and the fact is was actually filmed in the wide open spaces of the ever picturesque New Zealand.Not an out and out dramatic picture and not by any stretch a laugh out loud comedy, Slow West walks to its own unique beat and has a care free attitude that embeds Maclean's journey with an affable charm. It's great to see the background of the Wild West used in such a way that it is here and while it would've been nice as mentioned for the film to actually legitimately feel like a "western," it's always refreshing to see up and coming directing talents make use of their talents in ways that we don't expect.The tale of young and in love Jay Cavendish (played by the in-and-out-of-Scottish-accent sporting Australian Kodi-Smit McPhee) and his travels in the dangerous wilds of the West, looking for the love of his life Rose Ross, plays out in a non-confirmative way that is unafraid to be both blunt and quirky not to mention Coen-esque in the way its characters appear and disappear within the story. Surrounded by the increasingly charismatic Michael Fassbender as one time gang member Silas Selleck and with solid support from a pimped out looking Ben Mendelsohn and a non-facial scarred Hound from Game of Thrones in the form of Rory McCann, Slow West attracted a solid and on song group of actors that help it through it's more average moments and suggest that Maclean is a filmmaker who will quickly be working with the industry's elite.Well written, beautifully shot and acted with professionalism from a recognisable cast, Slow West is a curious Western that's both enjoyable and sometimes frustrating and a film that could've quite easily been something truly special. It never comes off as passing as a genuine Western tale thanks to its locational use but nevertheless does a fine job of providing us all with a reminder of the ways in which the genre can be used to such entertaining effects.3 ? unlucky lumberjacks out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Rose, the girl Jay loves, flees with her father from Scotland to America in the wake of a death for which they will be blamed, Jay follows in search of her. Hopelessly ill-equipped for his journey, he falls in with the hardened and cynical Silas who agrees to guide him. But there is a bounty on Rose's head, and Silas is a bounty hunter...This western is short, simple and leisurely. The entire cast, heading by Kodi Smit-McPhee as Jay and Michael Fassbender as Silas, is excellent. Filmed by a non-American crew on location in New Zealand and Scotland, and with an international cast portraying mostly immigrants, it has a peculiar feel for a western, with familiar tropes filtered through alien sensibilities. But that doesn't change the fact that it is a first rate movie from writer and first-time director John Maclean, which works on a number of levels - romance, buddy movie, shocker, with occasional laughs and an action finale. And everything works together.Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This gorgeously filmed, lushly scored offering by writer-director John Maclean does not work, as a western or otherwise. The story of a young 1870s scot, incongrously named "Jay Cavendish" (read any compendium of British Isles history, every Cavendish ever was English, not Scottish (or does that difference not matter?) and in fact, reputedly oppressed the Scots (and the Irish, Welsh, Cornish, Manx, Hindis, and well, you get the picture).Somehow, in 1870, Jay is in the central meridian of Colorado, riding around, the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains always in the scene. Nice imagery. And somehow, fully 1/2 of the other settlers, pioneers, etc. he encounters THAT FAR WEST OF Scotland are also European. There are a family of desperate Russian (Finnish?) robbers, a vaguely slavic proto-anthropologist studying American Indians, and of course, more Scots. There are a few American Indians in the frame, now and then, but the film treats them like trees in a school play. "See, it's the American West, everyone. Now cue the Bolshoi dancers."The heavies are goofy-faced, and look like they couldn't handle a one hour guest ranch ring ride, let alone a set of dastardly contrivances slung out across the high lonesomes of near-montane Colorado. Kodi Smit-McPhee plays Jay as simply too effete, too halting, and too phlegmatic. Smit-McPhee is, without realizing it, acting the part of "dairy boy who fails to stand up to gruesome ranch boss" and not Maclean's supposed transcontinental 'Jock.'Michael Fassbender performs a perfect Western genre co-leading role as Jay's travel companion and foil, "Silas." Fassbender is a fine actor, and his movement and looks lend themselves well to cowboy stuff. Incongruities in the story and plot abound. Jay looks for his long, lost Scottish lass-love, Rose, again across the vastnesses of Colorado, and finds her (the luck!), and evades and then, oops, is reunited with Silas, and with the heavies also looking for Rose, as if they were all playing cat-and-mouse detective games in a 10 block section of 1870s Chicago. The mood of the film downshifts (upshifts?) from a Merchant-Ivory type of slow-waltz across fair, bounteous landscapes to a Peckinpah- esque gunshots with splattered gravy forensicum. The shift isn't smooth. The shift was surely engineered by someone laughing at the theatrical truth that no one, from Aeschylus onward, has ever successfully made an entertainment that shifts from first lyrical and languorous to then staccatoed and sinewy. Never been done. For a reason. It's a terrible combination, like drinking laundry soap and chocolate.Laundry soap and chocolate, mixed in a tall pint glass. Come to think of it, that is what Slow West approximates.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may be a very understated and slow-moving drama, with little big action and loud performances, but it's still hugely engrossing to watch. Michael Fassbender and Kodi Smit-McPhee are brilliant in the lead roles, and it's a consistently unpredictable watch from start to finish.Let's start with the plot of this film. Put simply, it's a slow- moving journey across the Deep South of the Old West, including a cast of only a few, and although that may not seem so thrilling, it really is intriguing.The main reason for that is the two excellent central performances. Again, like the whole atmosphere of the film, the main characters are very understated, and yet they're absolutely fascinating. The brilliant writing makes for great unpredictability in their actions throughout, and as such creates a constant air of tension and uneasiness as their relationship progresses.This isn't a big, loud action film either. There are a couple of shootouts, but the main source of excitement comes from the subtle hints of tension and peril, as well as various shocking unpredictable twists throughout.What's more is that this film creates atmosphere excellently through its use of music. It's got a very quiet, but again unnerving score that lurks in the background almost incessantly throughout. It's by no means irritating, in fact it's quite a nice-sounding backing track, but it's the fact that it really does have a very subtle and unnoticed impact on creating such a tense and uneasy atmosphere that proves how clever it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern Western Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slow West is a rare piece of cinema that flies under the radar each year in a criminal sense. This is one of the best films of the year, and one of the best of the decade so far. The storytelling, the cinematography, the music, everything about this film was brilliantly executed and the performances were some of the best of the year. Our story finds a young man named Jay who is traveling across the country to meet up with the woman he loves, and along the way he meets an outlaw named Silas who agree to help him reach his destination safely. But as I stated in the title, this was a western tragedy, in the vein of a Greek tragedy. A captivating story with incredibly interesting and broken characters, who end up facing a form of increasing adversity as the film progresses. This movie does almost everything right, and I was extremely pleased with what I saw. I'm growing short on words right now, but I must say that I would recommend this movie to any film lover, and it is a must see for 2015.</fullReview>

And full of the chaos of the building of the west and the degradation of the native peoples and the struggle of those who came here or were forced here. It's raw, gritty, and unremorseful. It shows the brutality of how things were back then. And how the people who strive to survive have to deal with it. I got chills watching this. And a bit teary eyed. Strongly recommend.

		<fullReview>I should have loved Slow West. People call it, for better or worse, as if Wes Anderson made a Western. That is not the case. Slow West may have his sense of pacing when it comes to the editing room, but it doesn't know how it use it. As such, Slow West is void of tension or sufficient humour. I don't mind wistful Westerns on small treks across the wilderness, Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man is in my top 10 of all-time, but Slow West doesn't have the material. To its credit, the music and the photography for the most part are gorgeous. It's a film with a confident style, but an inadequate one. Especially at the end, the production design fails to look lived-in, though fortunately the costume design does. Ultimately, the story is just too thin, Westerns are supposed to say something about the American dream, but it feels like Slow West picked on it just to be stylish. I's not a failure, the tragic irony at its end is obvious but it isn't stilted as the film's bloodless deaths still carry their weight, it's just a missed opportunity.6/10</fullReview>

Very poor entertainment, no chances of any prizes for this film. Three of us watched it together and within twenty minutes it was unanimous to switch it off. However, as the eternal martyr (as in, I paid for it) I continued alone to the end, and what a weird end it has. I won't give away what very little story-line there is as it is too trivial and unconvincing to put into words. My only reason for writing this is to reduce the Star Rating on this film which is FAR FAR too high. I can't think what the other reviewers were on when they rated this, but we all want some!!

		<shortDescription>Loved Every Minute of This Slow Moving Western Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jay (Smit-McPhee) is traveling across the country in search of Rose (Karen Pistorius) the woman he loves. Outlaw Silas (Fassbender) sees that Jay won't last too long in this rugged country and offers to help him for a price, of course. Jay agrees. Yes, this is a slow moving story and I loved every minute of it. I could almost smell the leather as I settled in to finally watch another Western. I also felt I was there with them as Silas took charge of the trip. At first Silas comes across as a rugged, take no prisoners tough guy, but softens along the way. But Silas knows something that Jay does not: Rose is wanted for murder and there is a $2000 reward for her dead or alive. He needs Jay to lead him to Rose to collect the reward. We do see flashbacks of when Jay and Rose were together back in the day. There are, to be sure, encounters along the way to include a band of Bounty Hunters who also know about Rose and the reward. Oh, oh, this can't be good. The movie was shot in New Zealand in case you don't recognize most of the landscapes. The cinematography is exceptional throughout especially a scene that shows Jay looking at the stars in the lower half of the screen and we see the billions of stars above in the upper half of the screen. Quite a startling and impressive contrast. Almost surreal in a good way. Kudos. In time we get to the destination and the movie end draws near. We see a one-room house in the middle of a wide expanse of land with wheat surrounding all. We do not see any trees. Now here is what surprised me. We see the wood the house is built of and we see that it's all new. Inside the house, we also see that everything is brand new and no tools are shown anywhere. Okay, that's fine, but there are no other out-buildings, no animals, no horses, and no trailers. Why is the house so new? Why are there no out-buildings? Why don't we see any animals? Horses? A trailer or buckboard? The mandatory windmill that always appears in all Westerns? Now all this has nothing to do with the story and the outcome. I just thought this was all out of place. See? Yes, I can understand the newness of the wood in the house, but not the other stuff. Did someone forget to set the scene up correctly? Hmmm??Or does the house scene bring to mind a dreamlike scenario? If some of the previous scenes in the movie gave that impression then I would agree, but the previous scenes within the whole movie did not do that. Back to the story: So here we are at the house where everything will come together and the ending will surprise you as it did me. Yes, this is a slow moving story and I loved every minute of it and was sad to see it end. I'm still remembering the smell of the leather. Bring the Westerns back. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No, but some brief soft stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To sum up: ROMEO AND JULIET, out West. Only SLOWER... MUCH slower... What's with these filmmakers, anyway? Have they nothing to SAY? Or is it just that they don't know HOW to say it? HEAVEN'S GATE was the last time Language was used to great effect in a Western (DEADWOOD doesn't count, because it was clearly TRYING to be different- as opposed to letting the Language of the Times "speak for itself"). And a movie can have a measured pace as long as the STORYTELLING holds up- but cliché after cliché just doesn't cut it. Sure, the cinematography is picture-postcard perfect, but that's about ALL that SLOW WEST has to offer. The shot of the skeleton with the axe lying pinned beneath the fallen tree he cut down was funny, but the Three Stooges routine with the Natives wasn't (especially not when one considers the Native ghettoes- called "reservations"- that persist to this very day). It's in the WRITING that SLOW WEST fails most miserably- but the director deserves some of the blame, as well.</fullReview>

Doing so with few provisions, especially water. 3. Sleeping at night with little protection such as a fire (not just embers) with just street clothing then resting his head directly on the ground. (Creepy crawlies - attack!) 4. No matter how vast the wilderness our traveler coincidentally happens, and nicely spaced apart, upon a Native camp (they seem to ignore him as he passes through); bad guys; three afro-Caribbean singers just sitting and singing; a bad guy to ride along for protection; more bad guys; and more bad people; finally the long lost sweetheart he is traveling to find. 5. Why is the Fintage Collection Agency listed in the credits? No money to pay people? 6. What few sets there were looked flimsy and newly manufactured. Joins the recent spate of American Westerns not filmed/produced in America. This is a New Zealand production mostly filmed in N.Z. If American Western is what you are looking for I suggest, and coincidentally both are produced filmed overseas, is "The Salvation" mostly Danish and filmed in South Africa. The other is "The Dark Valley" an Austrian-German production filmed in Austria.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason I watched this movie, a western, was because it had Michael Fassbender in it, who I have a true admiration/lust for, and it was only 90 minutes long. I figured I could handle that length of time.I am not going to describe the plot because the tagline/description in IMDb sums it up nicely. I read reviews stating that the film had bursts of humor in it. I counted 2 bursts of humor that made me laugh out loud. The story itself was stretched to fill the 90 minutes. If you are a fan of slow westerns, then you may really like it. There really isn't much here other than a beautiful video of New Zealand showing a few people riding horseback, having minimal dialogue, a few odd adventures, and a very violent ending. I gave it a 6 out of 10. I almost quit watching about 40 minutes in, but I decided to stick out the remaining 50 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slow West--Riding without a CauseSlow West is a new film featuring Michael Fassbender. And yes, you smart readers, it's a Western. It hits all the benchmarks of a Western horse movie: a stranger new to the West, an outlaw of questionable character, a bounty hunters, really bad outlaws, an outpost, and a few Native Americans and others. However, they have little to do with the action. One character is looking for his true love. We forgive him, for he is young. The other character, a wishy washy anti-hero bounty hunter, is 'helping' this young man. It's interesting, and the visual are out of Wyeth painting, but it's hard to care much. We don't know why characters turn, we don't understand why the family has a bounty on their head, we don't get enough back story. While I know we are sophisticated movie goers in the 21st Century, we still like to see the motives for our characters, what drives them, what leads them to act as they do. There isn't enough exposition. There was certainly time in this lovely 90 minute film to let us in on the secrets of the characters. Top stars: the music and the cinematography. It looks and sounds delicious. The acting is okay, but not spectacular. However, the main problem was with the writing. The story just wasn't compelling enough. It would have also helped if the film featured a really nasty villain, not just a nebulous undefined band of loons. Westerns benefit from good villains and clear motives, two things Slow West is lacking. Rating: MatinéeIt is entertaining enough and there are enough plot twists to recommend this film. Go to the theaters just to see the wonderful photography. Peace, Tex Shelters</fullReview>

A Determined Demeanor and Youthful Exuberance Propels Him on a Quest for 'His true Love".The Film is Full of Strange Occurrences and is Metaphorical, Surreal, and totally Engaging. Beautifully Shot and Despite its Differentness will most likely be Fulfilling for Western Movie Fans and those not Usually Drawn to the Genre.Violent, Poetic, and filled with much Black Humor, this is one that is worth Finding. It's a Foreign Film that Feels Foreign and that adds to its Dream-Like Ambiance.

		<shortDescription>"Slow West"-"The Revenant" Lite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From thequickflickcritic.blogspot.com/ I came away from "Slow West" with the feeling that I had just seen the economy version of the insta-classic epic "The Revenant". Both deal with a raw and rugged sojourn through the Western U.S. of the 1800s. This chronicle of a young foreigner in search of his lost and one true love simply does so in a more passive and less enduring manner.Not that there aren't some good things to be cultivated from what is clearly a passion/vanity project for the film's star and co exec-producer, the recently ubiquitous Michael Fassbender. With "Slow West", Writer/Director John Maclean fashions a slow burning story, all the while deliberately building toward a violently tumultuous climax. Along the way I found Maclean's methods to be part pretentious, part conscientious, and his use of "something really BIG is coming, you just wait" foreshadowing heavy, pronounced and (perhaps overly) aplenty.Shot on location with New Zealand serving as a more than serviceable Old West setting (some back-story scenes were also filmed in Scotland) and with a predominantly non-American cast, "Slow West" presents an intriguing international interpretation of the stark brutality inherent in the territory of the time.As the movie concludes, it is the strangest of makeshift parents and children with whom we are left to consider. And we realize full well that this is a family forged not OF blood, but rather FROM blood.For more of my Movie Reviews categorized by Genre please visit: thequickflickcritic.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where have all the cowboys gone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The western genre can be as unkind as the west itself. If the stars aren't aligned you're in for a bumpy ride. The trail is especially hazardous for filmmakers today. Few try their hand at the old stereotypes. Recently the focus has been on the brutality of the environment and the weird folks one encounters while traversing the wilderness.Slow West, sadly, is no exception. The photography is gorgeous, but breathtaking landscapes can only do so much. Just watch Tommy Lee Jones' 2014 western The Homesman (now streaming on Netflix) and you'll understand. Lots of beautiful images, but a weird, unappealing story that drags too long and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Slow West follows Jay (Kodi Smit- McPhee), a Scottish native who has come to America in search of his beloved Rose. While on the trail he encounters Silas (Michael Fassbender), an outlaw who takes Jay under his wing to help him journey across the land. Little does Jay know that Silas has other intentions.While there is a fair amount to like in this film, the bad outweigh the good. For one, we have no idea how much time is passing. I think they tried to make it seem like more time had passed by having Silas give Jay a shave, but it felt awkward and out of place. And while Silas and Jay are very different at the start, as is the case for most duos in the genre, I didn't really see them bond over anything except for one particular scene where Jay figured out how to dry their clothes. Was that enough to win Silas' friendship?Just when things start clicking between the two main characters we are already at the climax of the film. And that's a shame because the acting isn't that bad. I wanted at least another half hour of character development, especially once the bad guy shows up, played by one of my favorite characters actors Ben Mendelsohn. He has a certain look that he has nailed. That, "I might be cool right now but say the wrong thing and I will go off," look. He had it in last year's Starred Up. His character here comes in too late and there is not enough of him on screen.For a film with the word, "Slow," in the title, this film moves way too fast. If you look back at other westerns their runtimes are typically in the 110 to 140 minute range. While there are few exceptions (High Noon being one), these stories take time to get through. And that feels right to me. Time was something a lot of cowpokes and frontiersmen had. There was no rush. This film flies to the finish, which us saying something because the landscape forces the characters to take their time. This film sort of cheats by using the forest as a cover for how much land is in front and behind them. But still, the story goes by way too fast. It sets itself up as a big adventure for Jay, but it really only takes about an hour before the big finale begins.And don't get me started on the ending. I won't spoil it for you but it basically makes this entire film a wash. Nothing gained. I don't want to say I was mad, but I certainly wasn't pleased. I might have enjoyed it more if there was more filler before it happened, but it felt like I just waisted an hour and a half.While I've done a good amount of trash talking about this, I can't say it's a bad film. It's just not for me. The camera work is good, the acting is solid (I'm a sucker for Fassbender), and the effects are fine. I guess I'm a little snobby about my westerns. I hate seeing the genre that I was raised on treated as a sideshow attraction. For a while I thought the genre, much like the west itself, had been conquered. Mapped out, drilled for oil, with nothing left but reminders of what it used to be. Luckily there are still a few gold nuggets left in those hills. While Slow West isn't the film the genre deserves, at least it tried.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unfortunate waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a bunch of potential which unfortunately got squandered. My main gripe with the film is that it didn't earn what it wanted the audience to feel; specifically in regards to relationships between characters, the ending, and an overall message.I found the main character, Jay, to be insufferable. While I understand that he's meant to be naive, the character never learns from his experiences. He's fairly one dimensional, being love-struck puppy in over his head throughout the entire movie. Our other main character Silas, while more interesting is also poorly developed. We're given some information about his past, and his outlook on life but he doesn't have much of a personality; he's just there.I think they attempted for Silas to be a foil to Jay's naiveté and innocence, but it doesn't work since they're relationship is so poorly developed. There's an abrupt change in Silas from being fairly indifferent to Jay, to suddenly caring for him deeply; the movie doesn't display this transition well. I can recall one, maybe two, scenes where it felt like there was a budding friendship/respect, but it was nowhere near the extent needed for me to care about these two characters or to believe that they cared for one another.Jay's relationship with Rose, the entire foundation for the plot, is weak. The flashbacks didn't do enough to convince me that Jay loved this girl and would go though everything that he did just for her. In fact I think it would have been more powerful if we didn't have those flashbacks, which showed Jay as delusional.The other characters weren't particularly deep or entertaining, though they were developed enough for their roles and served their purpose. A few of them were given moments that made them a little bit interesting, especially in comparison to our main characters.The acting was mainly serviceable, never taking me out of the film, but not exactly engaging me either. The exception being Kodi Smit-McPhee, who plays Jay. I found him to be great at embodying the character's incompetence and feebleness, with Kodi's great work being one of the reason I stuck with the film.Another positive for the movie is that the setting was beautiful to look at, the wide grassy plains, the mountains in the background, and the forest all contributed a pleasant atmosphere. The movie was well shot for the most part, with their being a clear representation of where people are in relation to one another, what they're doing, etc.The action, while minimal, was fairly enjoyable. A majority of it doesn't happen until towards the end, but I enjoyed seeing the characters utilize their environment, which differentiated the movie from a typical firefight.The music did become fairly overwrought as the movie progressed, especially toward the end where I found it mildly annoying. And there were times I had trouble understanding what someone was saying due to an accent, but it wasn't too bad, and didn't really effect my viewing experience.Overall I found the movie to be dull. The characters spoke, but nothing of importance was really said, neither on a plot/story level, a characterization level, or a thematic/allegorical level. Stuff just happened, and not in a way that was particularly interesting, rewarding, or even fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent storyline with some good performances! 5/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I quite enjoyed this movie because of its originality and good performances from Fassbender and Mendelsohn, who were a perfect choice to play the hard men of the film. The journey begins with a 16 year old boy called Jay (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who travels from Scotland in 1870, &nbsp;to be with his loved one, Rose (Caren Pistorius), in America. During his journey he is rescued from an outlaw by Silas (Michael Fassbender) who offers to take him to his loved one for $100, so he pays him half of the money and he agrees to pay him the rest when he reunites with Rose. On the way to her house, Silas comes across a "Wanted" poster which has Rose and her father, "Wanted For Murder" printed on it and there Is an reward for $2,000 for there capture or death, which was a hell of a lot of money in those days. Silas decides to keep the poster a secret because Jay is taking him straight to were they are but they have to fight of various bounty hunters, who are also out to claim the reward, which includes the rural Payne (Ben Mendelsohn) who tries underarm tactics to use Jay and Silas to get to Rose. Anyway, after a death defying journey, they finally reach Rose, not realises that all of the bounty hunters have followed them for miles, so the final showdown is extremely intense, especially when Jay reunites with his loved one, surrounded by gun shots and various hit men. I liked the chemistry between Jay and Silas and the showdown at the end was great. The film is very short and there isn't that many characters to bring different flavours to this epic journey but it's still a decent watch and there is enough material to keep it interesting throughout. Worth A Watch!Round-Up: This is the first movie directed by John Maclean, who done a good job with such a small cast but he got the best out of the actors. I'm quite a fan of Michael Fassbender at the moment, after his great performances in X-Men, 12 Years A Slave, Hunger and Haywire and with two newly released movies, Macbeth and Steve Jobs, he certainly is going through a busy time in his career. Kodi Smit-McPhee, 19, has also starred in some big movies like Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and the Road with Viggo Mortensen and Charlize Theron but I personally can't remember him in any of those movies. Anyway, this movie didn't make that much money at the box office but it's still better that a lot of the big budget movies that have made millions of dollars.&nbsp;Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross:&nbsp;$230,000I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/thriller/western movies starring Michael Fassbender, Ben Mendelsohn and Kodi Smit-McPhee. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow West - A Must see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slow West is an American Frontier film shot in New Zealand that really works. The cinematography (Robbie Ryan) was colorful and visually pleasing. Not something you would expect in the Old American West. Written and directed by John MaClean, the film is a slow, but steady character drama, sprinkled with humor and heartbreak. The film is about love, courage, mistrust and betrayal. Although I am not a Western Film fan, they seem to be making a comeback recently and after this, I may re-think my position. Regardless if you enjoy the movie or not, you may agree that this is one of Michael Fassbender's best performances. Finally pinning down the American accent, he played this part with such an ease and deepness. Kodi Smit-McPhee did an excellent job playing his Scottish immigrant role of a innocent, love-stricken boy caught up in the savages of the west. One of the best lines in the movie: "In a short time, this will seem like a long time ago." This is a must-see film for all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'SLOW WEST': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A western/coming-of-age tale; about a 16-year-old Scottish boy, traveling across 19th century America, in search of the woman he loves. The film was written and directed by first time feature filmmaker John Maclean. It stars Kodi Smit-McPhee and Michael Fassbender (Fassbender also starred in two previous short films, written and directed by Maclean). The movie is quirky, touching and violent (in a disturbing but moving way). Jay Cavendish is a 16-year-old boy from Scotland; who makes his way to America, in the late 1800s. While in search of the young woman he loves, Jay meets an outlaw, named Silas Selleck (Fassbender). Silas allows the boy to tag along with him, in exchange for cash. On their trek they meet a lot of unique, and dangerous, characters. Jay and Silas also learn a lot about life, from each other.The movie is very dark and violent, in places (like I said); but it's also touching and beautifully shot (the cinematography is gorgeous). Fassbender and Smit-McPhee are both outstanding in the lead roles, and I'm surprised Fassbender let the younger actor take top billing (considering he's more famous, and he also served as an executive producer on the movie). The film also has a good supporting turn from Ben Mendelsohn, in a villainous role. It's definitely an impressive debut, from John Maclean!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUT8JIkuU9Y</fullReview>

At least when the Italians re- invented the western they did so in a raw, honest and enthusiastic manner. This is just another twist on the recent "Bleeding Cowboys" sub-genre of unrealistic yet "gritty" Gothic westerns. Absinthe drinking bounty hunters, a Congolese singing trio, one in a wheelchair miles from nowhere in the wilderness, a ruthless bounty hunter who adopts a naive lovestruck boy, Aborigine like forest dwelling mud-smeared Indians in "Colorado"...

Ben Mendelsohn is wasted, and the final shootout seems to have been crafted by a high school drama class. Are we to believe that a murder in Scotland will warrant a wanted poster in the old west? Or that everybody in this movie will follow a boy to collect the reward, when it seems only one man knows who the boy is searching for? Or that a boy sleeps through a man with 2 horses and a wagon slipping off in the night? The movie is what I call intellectual masturbation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murky and Surreal But Not Surreal Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flashes of wit do not salvage this film, which is too bad because it could have been a serious offbeat Western. The night scenes were murky, the flashbacks distractingly hard to decipher and the series of situations were either clichéd or unbelievable. The scene where Jay meets an itinerant anthropologist writing about the plight of the Indians is a nosebleed. The writer is kind, helpful, cheerful...all the Boy Scout virtues yet ends up stealing Jay's horse and gear as the he sleeps. The writer is traveling in a well provisioned wagon, has no need of theft, yet we are jerked around by this gratuitous non sequitur. The message is what- you can't trust anyone? Everyone is a sociopath? This premise is a distortion of the actual heroic social dynamics that a harsh environment brings out in people and is a reflection of the inaccurate if politically correct lens we look back in time with.The unreality of the script is highlighted when Jay complains to his guide/mentor, Silas, "You are always dissing me". Like they spoke ghetto hip hop slang in the Wild West!? The scene where they are drying their clothes via a clothesline slung between their two horses created a schizoid tension in my mind when I wanted to credit the kid with inventiveness, yet he exhibits this quality nowhere else in the film, and it stretched my "suspension of disbelief" while the clothes necessarily end up dragging in the dirt and the clothesline later defeats two Indian horse thieves in a presumably humorous scene marred by the overhanging dread of the scene taking place in sacred Indian ground.The usual clichés about the treatment of Indians at the hands of the white man are given little context other than what the viewer supplies from contemporary exposure to Native American issues. The movie opens with an encounter with "Indian Slayers" with no supporting context other than the current politicized presumption that the Wild West was populated solely with murderous sociopaths- an historic untruth.Yes, flashes of wit and brilliance. The chance encounter in the middle of nowhere with 3 Congolese musicians, singing a traditional African song while one drums on a box he's sitting atop, was surreal and delightful. The extreme, almost compulsive, order and neatness of Rose's house that was the object of the odyssey, was a fresh and surreal take on the roughness of pioneer living and one hated to see the gunfight chaos that later nearly destroyed the place. The character of Kotori, the Indian handyman and probable lover of Rose, was quirky yet engaging. I wanted to see more of him but that doesn't happen and he also gets killed in the climactic gunfight Armageddon. The scene where Jay tries on a suit of clothes for sale at a remote general store and finds a bloody bullet hole in it was hilarious. And the kid stopping an arrow with his hand was a catchy surreal twist of luck. I wanted to see much more of this sort of twisted and unpredictable Fate.I mean, it's OK to do unbelievable stuff in a film if you are working in the realm of surreal metaphor and irony. But the disjointed nature of the story line with flashbacks that didn't work made the moments of humor (and even moments of story telling elegance as the two protagonists remove a buffalo skeleton that is blocking a narrow canyon passageway) as lonely as the scenic backdrop to the film. It was also disturbing that the kid's phenomenal good luck through a series of misadventures runs out in the end, as though Fate had nothing better to do than smack down the worthy and heroic. In spite of its faults the film is watchable and engaging and there was enough to enjoy in the cinematography and isolated situations of the plot odyssey. Had the filmmakers gone all the way with their bizarre takes and chance encounters, this could have been a cult western on a par with any of the old Spaghetti Westerns.Oh yeah, lemme add my impatience with people who post reviews on IMDb that waste time going over the plot and story line. I mean, isn't that available at the head of the IMDb entry? Just tell us what you liked and disliked in the film. Retelling the story is not a review or a criticism. A good criticism will bring out the salient plot elements as it develops, yes?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very different Kind of Western that can Still bring the Thrills!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slow West follows the story of 16-year-old Jay Cavendish as he journeys across a 19th century frontier to find the woman he loves, while accompanied by a mysterious traveler named Silas. This would have to be one of the most ideal western's I have seen in a while. I'm not usually a fan of Western's but when I saw the trailer for this, I thought it looked so- so but right after those credits came fourth, I was in such revelation of this film's distinction. Michael Fassbender &amp; Kodi Smit-McPhee were really striking, they did such flawless jobs in their roles. Michael Fassbender is really enhancing on his American accent, he played the role as a countryman very convincing with such charisma that his character was given. Kodi Smit-McPhee is really presenting him as a rising star, he played his character with such charismatic tones and personality that can find more enticing in the role given. Notwithstanding the sensible humor, the film did have a atmosphere of some solemnity to it. There were some pretty earnest moments that were escorted on into the film, the seriousness really did suit the film for some of its fierce moments. The film was pretty belligerent as well, with its vicious ending (which was truly a pleasing finale) &amp; the events in between the film that gives you the sign of what we are about to spectate. I mean, the action aspect of the film was really brought on so properly in a good way that made the film more compelling and delightful to be pulled into. The cinematography by Robbie Ryan was so awe-inspiring that made the atmosphere and idea of the outback look more riveting. I just got to talk about Michael Fassbender's performance in this, he gave such a surmising act that you weren't looking at Fassbender himself but as a bounty hunting, gruff &amp; opportunistic man named Silas. He really stole the show for me in this that makes me more compelling to him as a human being and actor. The strange thing in this that I found a bit ironic is that with Fassbender's character being a bounty hunter, he's off to get the father of the girl that Smit-McPhee character is off to see. I found that to be a nice touch to the story to make It more fascinating to see how it'll all play out in the end and yet it did played out swimmingly. Overall, this was not your old run of the mill western film that did bring different times at times but managed to be right on point through the story. This was the directional debut for John Maclean and I would have to say that he did such a applause worthy job and I give him my best regards in the future to come. But this was such a terrific Indie Western that was full of thrills and spills and complex characters and dialogue that make you crave more of. I hope to see you guys saddle up on this thrill ride of a film soon enough!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misguided love, Spot on humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Every now and then a movie catches us off guard as the tone shifts during the story progression. The first feature film from writer/director John Maclean is an example of this, and even more impressive in the manner that it delivers contradicting and overlapping tones through much of its run time. Balancing life and death tension with laugh out loud comedic elements requires a deft touch, and Maclean proves his mettle.Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Road, Let Me In) stars as Jay Cavendish a young Irish man traveling westward across the old west Colorado frontier to find his true love Rose (Caren Pistorius). Jay's babyface, na?ve approach and trusting nature make his survival dubious at best ? at least until he hires a grizzled gunslinger named Silas (Michael Fassbender) to act as his guide and protector. There is vital information about Rose known to all but Jay, which leads us to not be so trusting of Silas' motives in sticking with the young man.The trail provides the expected hardships and a reluctant bond between the two opposites. Some of the tension is created by crossing paths with a couple of bounty hunters ? one a long range dead-eye who sports a priest collar, and the other a nasty sort played by the always dangerous Ben Mendelsohn who leads the gang Silas once rode with.Jay's mission to find Rose is quite a romantic quest, but the effective use of flashbacks and dreams tells us more of the story, and in particular, why Rose and her dad (Rory McCann) are on the run. So as this tension builds, the startling and abrupt use of off-the-wall humor takes us viewers out of our comfort zone and into the unusual place of utter surprise at the back and forth between violence, romantic notions and laughter.Fassbender and Smit-McPhee are both excellent in their roles, and relative newcomer Pistorius oozes with potential. Jed Kurzel's (The Babadook) music effectively adds to both the drama and comedy, and the script is smart and funny ? a rare combination these days. It's likely that viewers will feel guilty for some of the laughs, but that just adds to the ingenuity of Mr. Maclean. Even the body count tally forces one additional guilty laugh from us before leaving the theatre. Very well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wickedly funny delight with a deliciously violent end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his feature debut, musician and filmmaker John McCann has created a perspective of the American frontier that is as refreshingly entertaining as the violent degenerates who inhabit this new, vibrant and majestic landscape. With blurring convention subversions and inversions, a slow but fast tempo, and unexpected flashes of absurdity and violence, it's a fantastical world meticulously designed to surprise you when you least expect whilst simultaneously reminding you of its unforgiving desolation and desperation.Even if you're not a fan of Westerns, you'll be a fan of this one.Scottish aristocrat Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is in the midst of first love; so bewitched that he decides to abandon his birth right and all that he knows (at the tender of 16) in search of his Rose (Caren Pistorius) who has fled to the American frontier with her crofter father (Rory McCann) after a deadly accident on the Cavendish estate.The film begins with stargazing as a voice-over by one Silas Selleck (Michael Fassbender), imparts the basics of an amplified and unrequited love story between Jay and Rose. He's an inscrutable and mysterious frontiersman with an agenda that so happens to coincide with the plans of the young Scottish aristocrat of whom he speaks - well sort of. What he fails to reveal in a stilted manner that would have made John Wayne proud, is the news that a bounty has been issued for Rose and her father to the tune of $2,000 dead or alive and that a number of iniquitous opportunists are also hot on the trail.Set during the end of the 19th Century and with na?ve determination, an over-laden horse, trusty teapot and a guidebook to surviving the west in hand, Jay embarks on his ill-fated journey alone until he is quickly confronted by a showdown between Indian hunters and their prey. Saved by Silas who then goes on to tell Jay that he has agreed to protect him on his journey - for a price of course ? the two team up and continue the slow journey to Colorado. McCann inverts the protagonist/slapstick sidekick convention here to comedic effect. Where Jay is submissive and fanciful, waxing poetically of love, Silas is monosyllabic sharp-witted and dangerously efficient. Jay cares whilst Silas couldn't care less. Jay devises alternate clotheslines; Silas treats wounds and speaks plainly. 'You haven't bedded her yet have you?' he says in response to Jay's talk of Rose.And the pendulum of humorous violence and violent humour steps up each time new characters reveal themselves on screen. The kind of sick humour that I absolutely love when such occasions present themselves like during the hold-up at the general store in the middle of nowhere. It's perfectly triangulated to include all parties in the violent fray and preceded by poignant words from the shopkeeper 'You know, if you take my money, this is the only place you could spend it'. Good point.Not to be outdone in any shape or form, Ben Mendelsohn (who plays Payne) makes his presence known, swaggering into the fray as the party starter with his bottle of absinthe, wearing his 'I've been in Game of Thrones' behemoth coat, and chomping on his robusto cigars. His performance, as well as the performance of Fassbender and Smit-McPhee, is excellent with each character playing off well against and with each other without feeling forced or overdone. But the true standout is the film's visual style. DP Robbie Ryan opts for a smaller, tighter frame that restricts viewing and forces viewers into an intimacy with the characters and the landscapes whilst the shots of on screen violence linger just enough to exploit the cruelty and intense violence. Filmed in the stunning Mackenzie Country region on the New Zealand's South Island, the shots of colourful vistas with Russell Lupins in the frame give the environment a vibrancy that doesn't detract from the barrenness of the plains and balances out the yellow tones of the tussocks reminiscent of American Westerns. SLOW WEST is wickedly funny delight with a deliciously violent end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Maclean ? Yes I remember him . Keyboard player of the Beta Band who were undoubtedly one of the most underrated bands in the Indie genre and a band who refused to be pigeonholed which sadly meant they made innovative and great music but weren't rewarded with the material success they deserved . Nice to see Maclean is trying a second career as screenwriter and film director . Unfortunately SLOW WEST probably won't gain Maclean much attention outside of a cult market The problem lies in the disjointed manner of the storytelling . It's trying to be a quirky , idiosyncratic , black comedy and any humour appearing is very black indeed but it's too offbeat to be entirely successful . Going back to the disjointed manner it follows the exploits of young immigrant Jay Cavindish who travels through 1870s America in order to meet fellow Scot immigrant Rose Ross and he meets many colourful characters but very few of these characters have anything to do with the plot and you could re-edit this film in any random order and it wouldn't make much difference to the story Another peculiar aspect is casting Kodi Smit McPhee as Jay . McPhee is Australian and to be fair to him he does a fairly Scottish convincing accent . That said his accent disappears towards the end of the film and one wonders why the Scottish director didn't cast a native Scot in the role of John Ross played by Rory McCann</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Love like death is essential" - Jay Cavendish Walking into the cinema...Michael Fassbender and Ben Mendelsohn in a western makes this film tantalising. Can an Australian film company capture the heart of the western spirit? Art-house rating: 2.5 stars* Cinematic rating: 2 stars Big question opportunities: 3 stars Review Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is in love. His love compels him to travel around the world to find Rose Ross (Caren Pistorius). Rose and her father have to flee Scotland due to an event that find them on the wrong side of the law and a wealthy land owner of Scotland. They escape to the United States, but as wanted fugitives, they carry a $2000 bounty on their heads. Slow West is a quest for Jay to find his beloved Rose, but he has to travel through the untamed west of 19th century America. On his journey he becomes the ward of a mysterious traveller named Silas (Michael Fassbender). They find their way through the wilds of the West which includes staying ahead of a gang of bounty hunters and avoiding rogue native Americans. On the frontier trail to Rose, they find out more about one another, more about what love will cause people to do and ultimately, who to trust. The artistry of Slow West cannot be denied due to the cinematography and the lead performances. The scenery is convincing as Colorado and provides the necessary distraction from the slow storyline and director John Maclean manages to get convincing performances from Fassbender, Smit-McPhee and Ben Mendelsohn (Black Sea) despite the under-developed script. Maclean's maiden venture in the director's chair is rudimentary and simplistic, which seems to be lived out in the youthful, naivety of his lead character, Jay Cavendish. Placed on the beautiful canvas of New Zealand, Maclean attempts to paint a beautiful vision of love that strives to overcome great odds but delivers a paint by numbers simplistic tragedy. The introduction of the marauding band of bounty hunters offer potential depth and humour to this journey through the West, but never quite get pass the typical Western stereotypes. The humorous gunslinging tale around the camp fire was not enough to spark this woeful adventure. In the end, Slow West was not an unpleasant experience, but not a cinematic triumph. The primary reason to consider seeing it would be to enjoy the performances by Fassbender and Mendelsohn. Otherwise it goes into the category of an acceptable, but forgettable outing for a new director. Despite Slow West being a mediocre cinematic experience, it does provide room for potential discussion. Key themes of love, death, redemption and guidance in life permeate the narrative. Jay Cavendish's romantic view of the world and youthful view of love provides a window into a world that romanticises life. It shows that love is a necessity for existence in this world and can drive people to attempt the impossible. The storyline shows that the key to achieving the impossible is a reciprocation of this love from someone else. The film proves that humans ultimately fail when it comes to achieving this reciprocal love due to the human condition, but the love of God can fulfil this need beyond any human experience The love that Jay Cavendish sought in Rose cannot be fully found in this lifetime, but the love that is satisfying and everlasting can be found through the love of God. This may sound simple or naive, but throughout history God has proved to be the only source of true love. Leaving the cinema... Michael Fassbender takes command of this journey and the film, but his performance could not save this sluggish script. The landscape and the supporting cast give the film the background and potential depth, but this tragic tale suffers from a lack of character development and pacing. The characters and story may be on horseback throughout Slow West, but the experience becomes a pedestrian outing by new director John Maclean. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Why is love essential to life? (Matthew 22:26-40, 1 Corinthians 13) 2. Can we find redemption for our lives? (Ephesians 1:7, Colossians 1:14) 3. Why do we need a guide through life?

		<fullReview>Admittedly I am not really big on Westerns in general and this one didn't turn me into a fan that's for sureIt's listed as an Action Thriller Western but to call this an action movie is reaching, sure it ends with the typical Western shoot out but the first hour is pretty darn slowKodi Smit McPhee who was excellent in YOUNG ONES (2014) has a little charisma but he's supposed to play a Scottish kid and most time he doesn't even appear to try to put on a Scottish accent (I should know, I've lived in Scotland for a year)Michael Fassbender doesn't seem to commit to his role fully either, pulling off a very generic American accent at that (but not typical Southern for some reason) but at least it was better than the Swedes in the movieMaybe I've spent a little too much speaking about accents but really there's not a whole lot to talk about regarding this movie; the whole movie feels like a teenagers idea of what the "wild west" was like with plenty of plot holes and undeveloped characters to put it short the movie is not all that exciting with very few positives I'd give it a 4.5/10, at least it was mercifully short roughly 79 minutes without the credits</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not slow west, silly west.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So a young Scottish lad travels across the American West looking for Rose, his love. Only Rose is a wanted outlaw for some reason. Now this is a west of fertile lands, forests and rivers, not the desert. So this movie has that going for it. But it is also the west where everyone is mean nasty and shoots each other.In reality the West would was made up of people of all levels of education with many different backgrounds. Most people would work together and help each other out. But that doesn't make for a "gritty" movie. People would prefer that the movie is fake and nasty than nice and realistic. If the movie had stopped trying to realistic and actually showed what was real, it would have been more interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Maclean's debut showcases strong performances and beautiful cinematography...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2015 TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL: Scottish director John Maclean mimics the heart and charisma of the old western with his feature film debut "Slow West" starring Kodi Smit-McPhee and Academy Award nominee Michael Fassbender."Slow West" tells the story of Jay Cavendish (played by Smit- McPhee), a Scottish aristocrat that travels to Colorado in search of his love Rose (played exquisitely by Caren Pistorius). Na?ve and unprepared for what the American frontier has in store, he encounters and is saved by Silas Selleck (Fassbender), who joins in his search but with a high bounty to be gained.Maclean, who writes and directs, passionately and unequivocally captures the time through the eyes of a young man. Remarkably determined, Maclean's set up of his characters puts forth in motion, a tale of unrecounted love and self-discovery. Not always engaging with beats and character motivations, Maclean's first time outing is an admirable achievement that provide a strong foundation for future endeavors.Cinematographer Robbie Ryan captures some beautiful imagery, a highlight of the year thus far. Not too many DP's set up a boot so well to be looked upon with such elegance. Composer Jed Kurzel puts an enchanting and tantalizing score that stands tall as one of the film's best attributes.The world first discovered Kodi Smit-McPhee in "The Road" opposite Viggo Mortensen. As a young child actor, McPhee showed signs of a promising career. Other ventures such as "Let Me In" followed but with "Slow West," his most mature to date, he captures the essence of young love with such ease. His relentless nature is called upon so often, and in many ways, the young actor carries the film on his bare shoulders.Michael Fassbender has played all types of different roles in his career thus far. A diabolical human as seen in "12 Years a Slave" is apples and oranges compared to his haunting work as a sex addict in "Shame," both directed by Oscar-winner Steve McQueen. As Silas, Fassbender takes it on with simplicity teamed up with humor and charm. Getting a few chuckles, and being the object of many women (and men's) fantasies as you'll see in his scenes with undergarments, Fassbender hits a base hit with interpretation. I'm excited to see his acting legs continue to be stretched and challenged, despite the role not really challenging him the way we've seen in the past.Co-star Ben Mendelsohn, who continues to just shine in any role he's given at this point, finds his stride with his limited screen time. Surprising, the most memorable player is Caren Pistorius as the beautiful Rose Ross. Not your traditional damsel in distress or one-dimensional female character, she finds a humanizing and bewildering soul to Rose that I'm not sure was originally intended by Maclean. With her screen time so limited, she's demands your eyes and attention in every frame she's in. Enamoring and aching for us to know more (which sadly we don't get to), Pistorious is a new discovery for the world to behold.All in all, "Slow West" finds its footing early on. It manages to keep the audience engaged with its minimal amount of actions and words. While the ending doesn't exactly scream earned or original, it's a well-constructed piece that hawks back to films like "McLintock!" and "True Grit." An hypnotic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slow West The hardest part of living in The Old West must've been all of those film-crews shooting Westerns. Luckily, the only film-crew in this Western is the one shooting this Western. Following his true love Rose (Caren Pistorius) over from Scotland, teenage aristocrat Jay (Kodi Smit-McPhee) tries to make his way in the American Frontier. Fortunately, he finds a guide in the form of a wanted man (Michael Fassbender) who agrees to mentor him in the ways of the west and help him find his sweetheart, for a price. Unbeknownst to Jay, a bounty hunter (Ben Mendelsohn) is also after Rose, along with a number of other bounty hungry gunslingers. An unrequited love story with spurts of violence and a cinematic landscape, Slow West paints a harsh but humorous portrait of the fabled frontier despite its underdeveloped characters. Historically, however, all kilt wearing Scotsmen were sought by the law for cross-dressing. Yellow Light</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well it's done well it has all the elements of a good film But the waiting and the waiting for something interesting to happen . I washed cloths I mopped the kitchen and took the dog to his groomer .And the guy was still putting on his shoes.Nope, I'm sorry, all the high reviews are from people that never saw a real western. This movie is so bad because it tries to be a western but with the mentality of today. The script it's ridiculous, basically it's everyone dies. People get shot and have arrows pierce their hands but everything is OK, like it doesn't hurt. The only thing good in this movie is the landscape, and the horses. All the clichés of cowboys bad, American Indians good. Immigrants good people that only steal because they have families starving. I mean common, does this movie has any original idea? anything new? no, it goes on and on with clichés, good bounty hunter(we don't know why the all movie) drinks with bad bounty hunter(we don't know why either), no story behind the characters. The only bad guy that starts to be likable, the priest with a rifle inside a trunk(cliché), dies 1 minute after he starts shooting people with the rifle. The Scottish family that supposedly has some background story(cliché), and that we don't know, and nobody tell us what it is, I mean ridiculous! how do you want us to care for anyone if we don't know what everyone does in this movie? or more important, why they do it? The best part of the movie is the bounty hunter story at night, I mean that 5 minute story is better than the all movie in terms of script, actors, and action. I can't believe even that so much good actors signed for this movie, the actors it's not the problem really, that's why I give it 2 stars, 1 for the landscape and scenery, and another for the actors, but that's it. We see Indians but they're just this mystical people that comes and goes and disappears and don't say anything important. I sincerely can't believe that people gave this movie more than 5 stars, or even 5 stars, have they watch westerns in they're lifes? are these people from the movie, or with any connection to the filmmaker or the country it was filmed? give me a break, Fassbender did charity on this one, but this is definitely a movie I won't see ever again in my life. Now I have to wash my eyes with Once Upon a Time in the West because of all the crap that I've just seen...</fullReview>
