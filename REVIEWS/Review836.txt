		<fullReview>"Gladiator" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but moving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score ? it is truly a "complete" movie.I am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds me of poetry, though it is still everyday language. I love the acting portrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less "popular" artists who also deserve a big "bravo". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr Universe Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the movie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV Star and actress Ruth Frendo, who although has a small part, she is totally brilliant and outstanding.Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the internet, in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was lucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese production. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but she is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future... The scenery used for "Gladiator" is brilliant ? and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie."Gladiator" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received, and for those of you who still haven't gone and watched it ? I can assure you that it will be well worth your time and money. So go on and rent it now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nail biting, intense modern epic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most films require that the viewer identifies with the character to truly be engrossed with the film. If you can't feel something for the character, than the audience is lost.Luckily, in Ridley Scott's case, Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders.Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast, most notably Connie Neilsen, buoy the film to new perspectives.Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotisitcal persona he should display, stealing every scene he's in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator.But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences which jolt the viewer right in with the opening sequences, as Maximus' true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed. Scott's camera work within these completed sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome scenes.Crowe will now get the respect he deserves for this collosal performance. Gladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours, marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL HAIL MAXIMUS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well, you should see for yourself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Movies I have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is wonderful storytelling. The opening Battle Scene simply mesmerizes, showing the brutal nature of combat for Roman conquests. I went back to see the film again. The first time I didn't hear anything Crowe said before the battle. I was just too visually caught-up. The second time I listened very closely and caught the wise yet succinct line from Maximus "what we do in life... echoes in eternity." Awesome.A simple man v. an emperor. I just loved the resilience Maximus showed throughout the movie. I find in most movies, there is an irritatingly slow process where the character has to "find himself," not so with Gladiator. Maximus does what is needed.I liked how there were only two or three issues within this film. One was the afterlife. Aspects of the afterlife are opened, but not overdone. Love of family is given sizable focus. I liked the theme of love of country that we see as well, although it may not be justly deserved, it is never questioned.The visual effects were amazing. It actually had me wanting to believe that's the way Rome actually looked in all it's glory. The battle of Carthage reenactment was really great.The ending is just hypnotic. Intentionally or unintentionally it was simply emotional. The music is wonderfully beautiful as if Maximus' family are telling him...you have arrived.Bottom line: magnificent. Visually and emotionally satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great Story! Great Writing! Great Acting! Great Directing! Great Score! This movie has it all. I especially enjoyed the mood of the film. Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style. The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations. Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the "general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor." Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine. It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla. However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers. Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators. The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the "thrill of the Coliseum" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate. The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene. But the whole movie is a rush! Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie. Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing. I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages. Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Today I saw a movie become more powerful . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is the story of Maximus (Crowe), a general who leads the Roman army to victory over Germania in the beginning of the movie. The dying emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, is watching this battle.The emperor's son, Commodus, then arrives with his sister Lucilla, and it is discovered that Commodus fully expects to be announced the new emperor of Rome in a few days. Aurelius, however, has other plans--he wants to make Maximus emperor, and requests that of the general, who wants nothing more than to go home to his family.I went into this movie having just watched Ben-Hur in my film studies class and having watched an episode of Xena only a couple of weeks earlier that featured the story of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. So you could say I was in the perfect mindset to watch a "sword-and-sandal" movie. I wasn't sure what to expect, having somehow avoided all the hype that accompanied this movie. But I was not disappointed.Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The battle scenes are very graphic. (This movie is not for the squeamish, that's for sure.) There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such as when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast. The use of color and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie. Excellent.The script was being written and re-written as the filming was going on, yet it doesn't show that the actors had no idea how the movie was going to end when they began filming. The acting is terrific. Russell Crowe is wonderfully cast as Maximus. Many reviewers agree that he is now officially a star. Joaquin Phoenix also proves his mettle as the emotionally troubled Commodus, whose behavior and emotion toward his sister could give anyone the creeps. Connie Nielsen makes you believe that, as Lucilla, she really is torn between natural loyalty to her brother and doing what she knows is right. Oliver Reed, in his last performance, is memorable in his role of Proximo, the former gladiator who is the owner of Maximus and brings him to Rome. In short, the actors were brilliant in their roles, not over-acting, but giving subtle, strong performances.The script itself is very good. Although some elements are a little hard to believe--the fact that no one recognizes Maximus when he's a slave?--this film calls for a willing suspension of disbelief, which one would happily comply with. (It's really no fun to nitpick such a movie.)It's true that this movie does pretty much follow the Braveheart formula. However, this movie includes some elements, such as the cinematography and the incredibly graphic battle scenes (one reviewer likened it to Saving Private Ryan, "only better"), that are spectacular in itself. Overall, a great movie that I highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Movies Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love history, and to me, Gladiator is a masterpiece. It is the most accurate picture of the Roman Empire Hollywood has ever put out. People declare Spartacus a masterpiece, but Gladiator far outdoes Spartacus in quality. The costuming, the acting, the screenplay, the scenery, and the fighting styles made me think that I had traveled back to 180 A.D. Russell Crowe is a true Hollywood tough guy, and he is superb in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as a villain, one of the best in movie history. He played his character as if it were a psychologist's dream case. Connie Nielsen plays one of the strongest female characters that I have ever seen. The choreographer of the action sequences was brilliant. Ridley Scott did an outstanding job in recreating the Empire, including the multitude of ethnic groups within the Empire and accurately depicting everyday life. If you're looking for insight into what the Roman Empire was like, this is a perfect depiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cecil B DeMille eat your heart out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The epic blockbuster returns with the 21st Century's answer to Cecil B DeMille, Ridley Scott and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge, GLADIATOR - "the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor".Once a great roman General, and as good as adopted son of Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Harris), Maximus (Crowe) is forced into exile by Commodus (Phoenix), heir to the throne, after the death of Marcus. Saved from death by slavers, he is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo (Reed) and ends up in the arena of all arena's, the Colloseum, where he proves unbeatable under his guise as "The Spaniard".And with a budget of over $100m, Scott certainly delivers the goods. GLADIATOR transcends the notion of 'blockbuster' that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss, courage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc etc) - also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting - a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to great Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong.The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me (as did the mish mash of accents on offer - but that is I guess a legacy of 'internationally casted films'), but this aside, he was well and truly up to the task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Nielson as Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who "should have been a son" and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is 'right'. The old guard thesps of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.Add to this great cast excellent editing and post production work, and an intricate soundscape (including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score), and you have a film that, despite its length, was highly palatable and had me in there from beginning to end. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special effects and powerful acting make Gladiator an epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I borrowed this movie on DVD, but I wish I had seen it in the theater for it would have been a lot more fun and powerful there. Despite this, Gladiator is one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. The plot goes so smooth together, as well as the acting and the terrific musical score. Director Ridley Scott puts all effort into making this film an epic, and he does just that. I'd have to say that anyone who likes Ridley Scott (I sure do) should see this. It is a lot like Ridley's other movies (Black Hawk Down was also amazing). If you can stand a little bit--well, ok a LOT of blood and gore, then you should see this. Russell Crowe shows an excellent performance like no other. I don't think there's one bad movie that Ridley Scott has made or that Russell Crowe has acted in. The fact that the brutal battles involving innocent slaves in this film actually happened in real life centuries ago makes it even more interesting and powerful. Emperor Commodus is a truely evil and life-like villian who shows a lot of his wits in attempts to get his revenge against Maximus.Ridley Scott went to many different locations to shoot this film to make it real, and he does. The film is set in Rome, and it looks just like it. You feel as if you are there in the crowd, hearing them cheer and cheer to see the death. To some of you, this may sound a little barbaric, and believe me the film is VERY barbaric and brutual, however it teaches a very strong lesson of what happens when an economy turns as violent as Rome was. Ridley Scott goes to many lengths to make this movie real, because even though the characters are fictitious, all of this really did happen. Innocent people had to go through brutual fighting while thousands of people cheered for either their death or the enemy's death. If you were an inexperienced fighter, chances are you would get killed. But the strange thing is that Rome LOVED this. People came from all over to see these fights and to see the blood that was shed, that is why you can't blame the characters in this film for being so forlorn and saddened the whole time. The film itself is very dark. The theme is dark and the ending is dark. From beginning to end there is excessive violence (for those action movie-goers, this is a movie for you). But if the violence is concerning you, don't let it. The special effects make the movie great, but it's the acting and storyline that make it spectacular. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED for anyone who wants a good time. Definitely makes you think. ***** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Crowe the 'next action hero?'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Germania, 150 AD, the setting of Gladiator's opening scene. Far from the blazing sun and dazzlingly beauty of ancient Rome, Ridley Scott shoots the opening sequence in a subdued light. The Roman legions are nonetheless impeccably turned out as they face the comparatively disorganised rabble that inhabits this miserable environment. Caesar's soldiers seem somewhat misplaced here. However, Russell Crowe is at home in this environment of knee-deep mud and merciless snow. He commands the screen with all the virtues of his motto: ?Strength and Honour.'The plot, with its hero-to-zero-to-hero nature, runs through Gladiator's every vein. As General Maximus, Russell Crowe is welcomed by Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Richard Harris) to take the Roman throne as Emperor of a new Republic. All does not run smoothly however as mislead heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) takes over Rome with ill-gotten domination, having dispatched his own Father. Maximus is cast out to find his family murdered and his Spanish farm burnt to the ground. Taken in as a slave by Proximo (Reed), Maximus becomes a Gladiator and starts his journey to the Coliseum and revenge against Commodus.Scott's cast is powerful and he is not left wanting as powerful performances are delivered by all. Due to his untimely mid-production death, Oliver Reed is created in some scenes by the grace of computer graphics, which are as convincing as they come; sometimes making it difficult to differentiate between Reed himself and his computerised counterpart.It is, however, the supporting actors who create many of Gladiator's best dialogue-based scenes. In an accomplished demonstration of her acting ability as Lucilla, Connie Nielsen saves the occasional scene as Joaquim Phoenix shows us that he can ?do evil', but is less convincing when it comes to the more emotional qualities of his role.As a vehicle for the plot, Scott's beautifully created and highly symbolic (there is an image of fire in nearly every shot of the film) dialogue scenes are of a certain merit with digitally created backgrounds that encompass the meticulous nature of the Roman Empire. However, dialogue alone does not an epic movie make, and it is in the film's spectacular action sequences that Gladiator come into its own. Shot on location in Malta, Scott's first arena was built by an army of locals and commanded some 5000 extras (a large majority of whom were of a cardboard variety). All of this pales in comparison as we arrive in a digitally created Rome which makes some scenes in Ben Hur some somewhat small scale. The Coliseum is immense, both inside and out, and the computerised provides the electric atmosphere in which Crowe and his feline companions (four sizeable, and real, Bengal tigers) perform.The battle sequences are perfectly choreographed and shot as iconic masks and typically Roman chariots are abundant in their power and imagery. As swords clash and heads roll, Ridley Scott is triumphant in the application of special effects technology and his directorial prowess.Always one to embrace technology, Scott's views over Rome's landscape are reminiscent of the beautifully created cityscape of Blade Runner. This is a film that fears so little and boasts so much, even a lady archer being sliced clean in half by a spiked chariot wheel!All those involved with Gladiator should be delighted and confident with their creation, for indeed this is a convincing and enthralling display with epic proportions to take the wind from James Cameron's titanic sails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Gladiator" brought a poetic vision in a new and very cinematically richly way...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you go to the ruins of Rome now, you get really no sense of the scale and the grandeur of what that forum would have been? It's hard to get it anywhere except from some of the great epic films of the past like "Quo Vadis," "Ben-Hur," "Demetrius and the Gladiators," "Barabbas," and "The Fall of the Roman Empire." Scott's "Gladiator" is build around a mythic character, a man trying to find his way home... It is around someone finding inner strength in a tough time? Maximus is somebody who doesn't want to be a soldier? We realize this is a man who is pursuing the ultimate which is transcending death and finding love after death which completely transforms your reaction to the man, a man who is very, very strong but very, very loving? The plot, familiar from Anthony Mann's " Fall of the Roman Empire," had Crowe as Maximus, the proud well-loved Roman general in the army of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Maximus whose motto is 'Strength and Honor' is like a son to Aurelius, a statement that left Aurelius' own son, Commodus perturbed...Disappointed by the news that his father privately decides to name Maximus his successor, and being a young ambitious son lusting for power, he murders his father, and orders a strike against the general... One of the best scenes of the motion picture is where Commodus is told by his father that he is not going to be the emperor? Joaquin Phoenix is easy to hate in a frightening and vile character...Ridley Scott creates a lot of beautiful scenes between the characters? He did some fantastic work in all of those wonderful scenes in the film? But there's another moment between the emperor and his daughter Lucilla (the Danish beauty Connie Nielsen) that I loved very much? Harris says, "Let's not speak of politics. Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter and I'm a good father. " They walk for a few seconds and Lucilla says, "This is a pleasant fiction." I felt this short scene so sophisticated? It seemed to me wonderfully insightful, simple in terms of amount of words, but complex in terms of understanding this strange relationship? One of the most successful bits of casting was Oliver Reed? He's a harsh and rough businessman who makes his living off the death machine and yet, inside, there was some kind of ethical person that would come out at the right moment?Ridley Scott's epic film does not romanticize a democratic Golden Age of Rome but a decaying, blood thirsty empire on the edge of its fall... Through its beautiful music, through Russell's performance and through Ridley's soulfulness, "Gladiator" brought a poetic vision in a new and very cinematically richly way that really gave the audience something different, so emotional and so intimate?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I Could Give This Movie 11/10, It Would Be A 12!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator! A thrilling tale of a Roman general who must battle against all thinkable odds to avenge the death of his family and restore justice to the empire. The plot is simple, legendary general Maximus Decimus Meridius, after many victorious campaigns and battles wants to return to his peaceful home in Spain, However the kind, fair and dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius wishes to bestow his title on him over his cruel son, Commodus. Commodus is understandably annoyed and kills his father calming the title of Emperor. Maximus is sentenced to death along with the rest of his family back at his home in Spain. Maximus escapes but is unable to save his wife and son. His loss of will to live makes him an east target for slavers and he is soon sold as a gladiator. He fights his way into the coliseum in Rome were he wins over the crowd and uses his celebrity status to defy the Emperor, to whom he swears his vengeance for the death of his family, after many battles and political backstabbing he gets his chance to fight the Emperor in the Arena.This is just such an amazing film, it captures every emotion possible in only the way an expert director can achieve, we can go on for whole scenes without the need for speaking, everything is told through the genuine body language and expressions. And when there is conversing we get such emotion and wonderfully powerful quotes ? "What we do in life, echoes in eternity" Wow.The opening scene is spellbinding, showing the true gore of battle, the fight scenes are marvellously realistic, discarding the popular "pretty" sword fighting for brutal aggressive force. The audience in the arena express every emotion, surprise, anger, and enjoyment. The cast is brilliantly chosen; we can really see Russell Crowe as a gladiator, in Commodus, Joaquin Phoenix gives us a man we can really hate, Connie Nielson shows real emotion and passion in the role of Lucilla. So apart from the spellbinding acting, scarily realistic fight scenes and the amazing script, what else can we look for? The music is just stunning, its exactly what we need brought in at exactly the right time, truly wonderful directing. And then we have the stunning special effects, we can really visualise the greatness that is Rome, the fight scenes really make you believe. Some critics have condemned the lack of historical fact, for instance an emperor would never fight a gladiator, and these comments cannot be denied, its true.But I think we can forgive them that one fault for such an amazing movie. Without hesitation I give this movie a truly deserved 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Throwback To The Epics Of The '60s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An intense Roman epic, a la "Ben-Hur" or "Spartacus," it was nice to see something like this made again. It had been since the 1960s that we had seen a 3-hour extravaganza like this.Like Ben-Hur, this is a story of a successful man who loses everything thanks to an evil man, and then has to fight his way back up to seek revenge on that man and to obtain his freedom back. It's a tried-and-true formula. This movie doesn't go to excess on the violence as some of the other more recent epic films did, such as "Braveheart" or "The Patriot."The acting is excellent, beginning with Russell Crowe, who has established himself as one of the best actors of today. Joaquin Phoenix also put himself "on the map" as an actor with his portrayal of the evil "Commodus." He's so annoying you want to slap that sucker, which means he's doing a good job acting. Kudos to the rest of the cast, too.Too bad they don't make more of these type of films, as they did in the 1950s and 1960s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly "Grade A" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.I didn't know man could build such things.Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nitpicking is only criticism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so little to find wanting in this film and not wanting to merely repeat its many deserved praises, all I can do is question a couple of historical points.It is unlikely that a Roman general would be sold into slavery and forced to fight in the arena. Exiled, yes. Killed maybe. Asked to commit suicide to retain his property, most likely. It is unlikely that he would return to find his family crucified, of all things. Romans were very specific about who got crucified and why. Romans usually avoided it, no matter how cruel the tyrant(?) was.Roman legionnaires would NEVER have a tattoo unless they were barbarians who got one BEFORE joining a legion. Marking or mutilating the human body was expressedly anti- Roman. No statue or depiction exists of a main-period Roman showing a body-marking. The bonding feature the writer was attempting was an inappropriate borrowing from the 20th century German SS.Great entertaining movie nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is awesome! I think it's great to be in one of IMDb's top 250 best movies, because it deserves it. Every time I watch 'Gladiator'I stay touched by the story and I never get bored of it.It's one of the most excellent movies already made in the movie's history! Russel Crowe is terrific in the role of Maximus and so is Joaquim phoenix great as commodus. For people who enjoys history,specially ancient history,is a chance to see how was Rome many centuries ago, and also know better about the gladiators, the Colosseum and how some things worked in that time.I will not write about the plot here, because many people already did this; I will only say for people that never watched this movie, that it deserves to be watched and, if you have some money, buy the DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent with a purpose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie on video because I was nervous of the gore others had mentioned, but the movie was like a poem. You could not have left out one drop of blood, one terrifying character, one disturbing dream, nor could you have added anything at all. Deeply violent, yet not one gratuitous drop of blood was shed, not one encounter without reason. A classically made film, and a beaut. Don't miss it, whether or not you've seen something that disappointed you, or had a bad day at the arena. Think "Spartacus" and you've got it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Epic of the 21st Century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If only Peter Jackson hadn't come along and done a rather good trilogy of films, we might possibly be talking about the greatest film of the 21st Century so far. Its sweeping but simplistic heroic tale, crunching fight scenes, award-winning special effects, towering acting and soaring score set this film apart from all the pretenders that followed it. Ridley Scott single-handedly re-invented the epic genre with this story of a Roman solider who is betrayed, loses everything and is sold into slavery, only to fight his way back as a gladiator, all the while driven by vengeance for his murdered family.Russell Crowe gives quite simply the performance of a lifetime as the Gladiator Maximus, one that deservedly won him Best Actor at the 2000 Academy Awards (although his performance in the following year's Beautiful Mind was arguably even better, even if it didn't win him his second consecutive Oscar), and provided a thinking woman's alternative to the likes of Pitt, Cruise and Clooney to swoon over. His gravely voice and impressive physique combine to give him a huge presence, which literally fills the screen. His dialogue is sparing, but his actions speak far louder, adding a stoic sadness to his vengeance-driven heroic character. Before Gladiator, Crowe was a good secondary actor; after Gladiator he was catapulted to the top of Hollywood's A-list, and remains there, thanks to this career-making performance ?proving him to be one of the finest actors of his generation.Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the scheming and corrupt Emperor Commodus who betrays Maximus and has his family killed. He manages to be delightfully and totally evil without ever descending into the realms of pantomime villain, which is a tricky line to walk, and manages to avoid being overshadowed by Crowe's monumental performance.The fight scenes are rousing and superbly choreographed, in particular a scene where Maximus marshals his fellow slaves into an army against marauding chariot archers in the Colosseum. The dialogue is kept simple and never overbearing (no need to worry why all of Europe speaks the same language) and culminates in one of the most memorable pieces of script that is destined to join the ranks of 'Play it Sam' and 'Are you talking' to me' as one of the most quoted (and misquoted) lines in movie history ? although it is rather wordy. But here it is, in full; 'My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius. Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true Emperor Marcus Aurelius; Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.' As Crowe turns to the Emperor in the arena and delivers this line, it proves to be one of the most electrifying moments in cinema history ? hairs will stand up, spines will tingle, guaranteed.The action is set to some truly beautiful music, and it is shameful Hans Zimmer missed out on the Oscar for Best Score. Ridley Scott was similarly unlucky in the Director category.The film is however tinged with sadness, as it proved to be the final (but triumphant) swansong for the careers of Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, both of whom died shortly after making this film. Neither could have delivered much finer performances, and if any performance had to be a final one, both delivered one worthy of such a status here. Reed in particular is a revelation, reminding older generations and showing a new generation of his considerable talent.An inspiring film, rousing, exhilarating, exciting and moving. Superbly acted, directed, scored and visualised. A tribute to how great films could be once, and could be again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is the best epic war film. Gladiator has the best war scenes I've ever scene. Better than Troy and much better than Alexander. I liked the digital effects in Gladiator. Troy and Alexander are pretty fun to watch, but in Alexander, i really want to forward it to exciting scenes, like war sequences. Gladiator, I can just sit there and watch it, because if you miss a part, you won't get it. The end was great, i really liked it. It was the best fight scene at the end. Every part kept me interested and there wasn't one part that bored me. It had one of the best endings ever. So if your tired of crappy, imitating war movies go to this one it's the best there is.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adequate Roman Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is much to appreciate about about this picture but at the same time there is much to castigate as well. What could have been a thoroughly involving story turns out to be crippled by a lean script, some very indecisive direction and choppy editing. Not to mention some bad casting in the form of Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, a role which cries out to have been the last role played by Anthony Quinn.The film starts out well and looks bleakly authentic in its depiction of the pivotal battle in the wars between the barbarian tribes of Germania and the Roman Empire. But as the story gives way to 40 minutes of exposition following Commodus and Lucilla's introduction, Ridley Scott seems to tack things on whenever the script runs into weak spots. This leaves the film without a flowing narrative and it seems to want to please a mindless summer movie action market while at the same time aspiring to be something deeper. What it leaves us with is a schizophrenic, unequivocal story full of contradictions. There seems to be an epidemic in the past three or four years - films like this, Titanic, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, Enemy at the Gates etc, try hard to be great epic films but at their core they are very slight and even trivial. The story in Gladiator holds promise but what little conflict there is set up and thrown at us in the first hour, leaving just a linear resolution to unfold for the remainder. A shame because so many elements could have been introduced in this story to make it truly an awesome and thoughtful epic. I guess complex stories like Spartacus and Ben-Hur will never be made again. This one falls somewhere short, though better than Demitrius and the Gladiators and the film it heavily borrows its narrative structure from - The fall of the Roman Empire.Technically the CGI is at times seamless and other times poor. When our troop of Gladiators run into the colosseum for the first time however the effect is absolutely jaw dropping and the scene that follows certainly delivers the action goods. The acting is very good throughout except for Tomas Arana as Quintus (about as bad as John Dall in Spartacus) and the aforementioned Richard Harris. Like Braveheart, not a bad entertainment experience but highly Hollywoodized and with an uneven narrative. But unlike Braveheart, the ending to Gladiator is a just a little embarrassing as it rips off both Braveheart and Titanic to far less effect. If you can get past the flaws, not the worst Roman spectacle on offer. Too highly rated at 8.1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious and Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Evaluating opinion of this movie by the 'Hated It' selection, I lost count of the number of contributors who gave it just one star. I thought they were being unnecessarily 'Roman' in their ruthlessness, but the result does show how disappointed so many viewers were and the extent to which this movie has polarised opinion.I diplomatically place myself somewhere in the middle.For me, scepticism set-in at the outset. That much-vaunted battle scene didn't sit right at all. In combat, the greatest Roman strength lay in the legion. The scrupulously drilled and disciplined foot-soldiers worked in unison, advancing upon enemies in their orderly units and maniples.Their Shields interlocked to create a mobile wall that could form-up on all flanks and even provide overhead protection. In between, they used their short, stabbing swords.The legions, then, were only at their best in the open. In dense forest, their advantages would have been squandered, any fight being a brawl upon the same terms as the enemy. Morover, their big Shields would have been an encumbrance and the short swords inadequate. A good Roman general drew the enemy out to fight on his terms, not the other way round. I'm not a scholar of Roman warfare; it may be there were occasions when Romans had no choice, but this is where the question marks began to pop-up. Check out the impeccable piece in 'Spartacus', where the Roman legions deploy by the textbook, drawing their enemy down from the hill. Perhaps Mr Scott felt that a more faithful rendering would seem like too much of a rip-off. In any case, this battle is quite incidental, and seems to exist only to grip the viewer's attention for the next couple of flatulent hours.Neither was I aware that the Roman army employed fire-bombs. It's not for me to say they didn't, but I have no reference to this tactic at all.I thought Ridley Scott made a futile attempt to create an 'arty' film. The frequent dream-like flashbacks to a hand running through spears of corn reminded me of the recurrent unicorn dream from his fascinating but equally pretentious 'Blade Runner'. From time to time there's even the same high-pitched warbling 'oriental' chorus, intended to project mood, but failing again. Some directors don't seem to realise that cinema-goers have memories.General Gruntus Maximus (Russel Crowe) surely got the easiest Oscar in history. He was believable as an uneducated slob in the way, perhaps, Spartacus should have been; but cerebral enough to be a general? I don't think so. And you don't rise to be a career general in an army whilst obsessing as a farmer about your harvest. You're either one, or the other.There was one particularly absurd scene in the arena when he was chopping-down competitors as quickly as they could be set against him. What then - weren't they trained gladiators, too? I was half-expecting him to begin walking sideways along the arena walls like 'Neo' from 'Matrixus'.As to the 'spectacle' of Rome; well, that was all just computer-generated hokum. The back-room boys can whip-up anything in that way now just by tapping a few keys, so what's the big deal? Check-out the 'real' thing in 'Fall Of The Roman Empire'.As with 'Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbour' a splendid opportunity was missed here to do something really wonderful, but because of flawed vision and misplaced directorial self-belief we finished up with mediocrity. Glorious mediocrity.Still, bread and circuses usually please the crowds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nobility Does Echo In Eternity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:I refer you to others for better reviews of the excellent narrative. Mine will be a philosophical review. The film is great because of its spiritual depth. Scott deepens Maximus,"What we do in life, echoes in eternity." Elysium is very real and is integrated into his bravery. The tragic murder of his wife and son at the hands of evil Commodus is a great transformation of Maximus. He was brave to this point but now, he is consumed with a lust for vengeance that changes him. He is much like Harmonica in the great Once Upon A Time In The West; his life is either death or vengeance whichever comes first. This is what gives his great deeds in the arena believability. His friendship with Hounsu adds emotional depth to the role. His goodness is never lost completely in all that pain and anguish. We see that when Lucilla first comes to visit him. His pain consumes him so that his goodness can barely restrain him from killing her. If you asked me what is the core of this film, I would reply one word: nobility. A word long lost within our merchant's zeitgeist where everyone and everything is for sale. Here, notice how all how come in contact with Maximus change and develop deep respect for him. Even, the world weary misanthropist Proximo, who trusts no one and laughs at Maximus when he first asks him if he is in danger of becoming a good man; Proximo does, he pays for it with his life, but he does become a good man.Like DePalma's works, goodness comes with a great price. Marcus Aurelius' choosing of Maximus has such disastrous consequences for his life. We understand why the emperor chose him, because of the very nobility we are discussing. Unfortunately, and Fatally, the emperor underestimated Commodus' depth of ruthless ambition that would tolerate no interlopers. I understand the objections of historical inaccuracy but really, the point of the movie is the modeling of nobility that dies for doing what is right. As a philosopher, the good that comes from teaching others to perform right, be prepared for the heavy cost, produces a much better society and I couldn't care less if it is completely veracious. The scenes of Elysium, especially the last one, as Maximus lies dying on the ground are so beautiful and give the film such depth and power. It reminds me of the dove flying away in Blade Runner. Within this zeitgeist, metaphysics are quite forbidden and I praise Ridley for having the courage to put it in his movie.The cast and the acting are excellent. The movie may be long but it never drags. Again, for those who found his achievements unbelievable he has lost all fear like Harmonica. Also, he is a general of many decades; I did not find it outside the realm of reality. Why is it a masterpiece? Because it teaches what it costs to be a good man. He pays with his very life's blood but he dies in peace unlike the cowardly, terrified Commodus. Good people never need fear death. Watch the film for the nobility that it shows; for all his violence, his goodness and his great heart remain. Within our reality, here and now, it is a very timely lesson. Sending the light and thinking good thoughts cost nothing and accomplish nothing. Maximus shows you the terrible cost but who doesn't want to live and die so nobly? Good is always to be performed at any cost. Die with the sword in your hands, fighting for good, my friends. Take it from someone who stood over the helpless for 20 years, this movie changed me. It will change you also. A great model and a Masterpiece: Ridley's Greatest Film After Alien.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Story but Far From Historical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, Romans never referred to the Colloseum as the "Colloseum". It was called the Flavian Amphitheatre.Commodus was an actual emperor who ruled from A.D. 180 to 192. He did indeed fight in the Colloseum against gladiators, and was quite good at it because he never lost (Maybe he cheated like in the movie).His sister, Lucilla, did conspire with his wife Crispina to have him killed. They were caught and banished to an island and later killed.His mistress Marcia tried to drug him to death but failed, so they had some athlete strangle him to death. He died on New Year's Eve A.D. 192.He was a nut case, and was quite murderous, but that's about the only things real about the movie.Other than the historical problems, the story was great. I liked Maximus and really hated Commodus. It was your basic struggle between good and evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A+ action film, C- epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Rome circa 185 AD, General Maximus (Russell Crowe) leads a successful expedition against Germanic tribes in the northern empire. Dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) confides that he is to succeed as Emperor, to the chagrin of the vain, ego-maniacal Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who kills Marcus and usurps the throne. Maximus is expelled from the army, his family is killed, and he ultimately ends up in Rome as a gladiator for Proximo (Oliver Reed). Defying the will of the Emperor and eager to have his revenge, Maximus becomes a hero to the masses and joins Commodus's sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and a cabal of Senators led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) in an attempt to bring down Commodus.Gladiator is something of a paradox. As a well-made, entertaining action film, it's hard to beat. Its attempts to be something more, however... not so much. It's very entertaining, an excellent crowd-pleaser to be sure, but it's far from the great film it's widely considered to be.Gladiator wants to be something significant. Its multi-faceted plot, its commentary on society, its distinguished cast of actors, epic battle scenes, and great musical score almost push it there. The movie borrows heavily from "Fall of the Roman Empire" (settings and characters), "Spartacus" and "Ben-Hur" (for the plot). This is not a criticism, merely an observation. And the movie does have an inkling of being something more than just another action movie. And yet it fails, because at heart it is basically "Braveheart" in a toga.Perhaps I'm just not enthralled by the film's basic storyline. See if this sounds familiar: A successful warrior who wants only to live in peace is roused to ass-kicking action by the death of his family at the hands of cartoonishly evil villains. This is the plot of "Braveheart", "The Patriot", and innumerable Westerns, action films, and Steven Seagal/Chuck Norris slugfests. Death of family members is an easy motivation for a character, and dare I suggest a lazy one. Maximus isn't a thoughtful, conflicted hero like T.E. Lawrence or Spartacus, he's just a man of action who wants to wreak vengeance on those who wronged him. In spite of its attempts to convince us otherwise, the movie is basically a Schwarzenegger or Van Damme flick set in Roman times with a lead actor who can act.The subplots of the film don't fare much better. The character of Commodus in particular is a disappointment. One of the few good things about "Fall of the Roman Empire" is Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Commodus. Commodus is an egomaniac with delusions of grandeur. He's not horribly complex in that film but Plummer makes it work. Whether it's the script or Joaquin Phoenix's acting, this film's Commodus is a sniveling weakling. I appreciate the effort to give him motivation (his father never truly loved him) but in his big scene with Marcus Aurelius, Commodus doesn't come across as heart-broken, merely insincere. Commodus is a petulant child who lacks menace. David Schofield's duplictious Senator Falco is a much more effective bad guy. The Senate plot against the Emperor is under-developed and comes across as a bad pastiche of "Spartacus".On a purely action level, the movie is pretty good. The epic battle which opens the film is not particularly impressive in my opinion, but the gladiator combats later in the film are impressive. The visceral thrill of a gladiatorial match comes across well, particularly when Proximo's gladiators "upset" an enemy team. The fight between Maximus and the "Tigress of Gaul" is very well-handled, as is the final duel between Commodus and Maximus. The CGI is of mixed quality. It's impressive in some scenes (notably Commodus's entry into Rome) but in other parts it's murky and distracting. Hans Zimmer's score is haunting and helps drive the film's more powerful moments.The movie excels largely because of Russell Crowe. FOTRE failed because Stephen Boyd is a block of wood; Crowe, playing a very similar role, excels. Maximus is not a particularly noble hero but he's a fabulous action star, and Crowe does bring a degree of intelligence and complexity to complement the ass-kicking. The supporting cast is mostly under-used. Djimon Honsou, Oliver Reed, David Schofield and Derek Jacobi give the most memorable supporting performances in the film despite very limited screen time. Richard Harris is disappointing as Marcus Aurelius, and Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen aren't particularly compelling either."Gladiator" is one of the best action films ever made, on a purely action level. But in its attempts to be something more... well, not so much, I'm afraid.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Victory of production over a lousy script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an unwritten rule in movie making that if you have an excellent script it doesn't matter how you film it. If you have a lousy script - then everything else matters, the direction, the cinematography, the acting, the music... "Gladiator" is an epitome of the latter half of that rule. The case where direction, music, acting and art direction completely redeemed a crappy story.For me it took watching it in German overdubbing. As I don't speak German there was nothing to detract me from visuals and music. And it's a new experience on another level. But more on that later. First the crappy part. The story.Make no mistake, whether you care about history or not, this is a horrible script. It's taking huge (and quite unacceptable) liberties with the period it purports to portray, it's unconvincing even on its own terms, the dialog is pretty much high school and in its core it's a predictable revenge story told a zillion times before. Apparently (according to a documentary about Hollywood screenwriters) only Russell Crowe didn't know what turd the script was so he contributed himself with the juvenile "husband of the dead wife" speech.Ridley Scott and his crew apparently knew what stinker they had to work with and did their best to defeat it with excellence in all areas and actually made two films in one.On the surface it's a revenge story. The hero, a favorite army general turned gladiator, seeks revenge against a young emperor, who had general's family killed during the tumultuous succession to the throne. The military battles and the gladiatorial bouts required for this aspect of the movie are done both to tremendous detail and on a grand scale. With the help of CGI they are seen in all their glory and gore. Some accuse Scott of shying away from action but his direction shows everything one needs to see. Yes, the cuts are brief, the camera sometimes doesn't follow through, but the editing is pure poetry and you miss nothing. Cinematography-wise every frame is shot in a way that you could just hang it on a wall as a nice picture. Costumes and scenery are impeccable. A revenge story, yes, but well worth watching.But on another level "Gladiator" plays out like a remake of "Fall of a Roman Empire". But it's not in the script. It's in the mood set again by production. This other story is about the decline and death of classical Rome and its ideals. There is simple yet effective symbolism to express it, the play on dark and light and the sunrise-sunset arc. The movie starts with a battle at dawn, the way the Rome itself had once dawned, fighting. There is an ideal Roman hero, valiant and dutiful, there's a typical Roman villain, clandestine and scheming. Hero does his best in the light, the villain does his worst in the dark, whenever they swap environments during the movie they fail miserably. The story ends at sunset, symbolizing the end of the Empire itself, and although an uplifting speech is given at that point it is defeated by the setting sun.The feeling of the doom is constantly emphasized by melancholic music. The dreamlike experience of the main character who is already dead but doesn't yet know it is enhanced when he finally visits Rome and the city is an idealistic, blown in proportions version of itself. The script may be a complete falsification of history, but the feeling of decline one gets when watching those scenes is probably completely faithful.So forget the story and the closing speech. Watch and listen the movie. The Roman Empire is living and dying once more before your very eyes.</fullReview>

From the acting to the directing, and especially to the screenplay, this movie is spectacular!Russell Crowe turns in a fine performance. Many of his critics who feel that he shouldn't have won an Oscar for his performance are taking it one step further and saying that he was downright dull. I don't know if Crowe deserved the Best Actor Oscar, but I do know that dull he was anything but. He is the only one I know who could have played Maximus and given him any depth and at the same time be convincingly intimidating. Kudos to the arguably best actor in showbiz!Joaquin Phoenix's work as Commodus was severely underrated. It didn't take but one minute before I hated Commodus with a deep hatred. His scenes with Lucilla (Connie Nelson) are just plain eerie, causing me to hate him more.This is easily Ridley Scott's best job as a director. He gives "Gladiator" an elegance and a darkness that together make the movie quite unique.This is my all-time favorite movie and I think anyone who doesn't go see it is losing out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good summer movie but Oscar worthy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have had a great deal of discussions with people about this film. I agree it is a good movie. Its entertaining, action packed, worth the price of a ticket. However, I don't think I have ever seen a movie win so many awards without questioning the validity. Gladiator, while still a good film, is hardly deserving of all its accolades. I mean it might be worthy of winning cinematography or production awards or special effects but Best picture? Best Actor? I could think of a 100 other movies in the year 2000 more deserving than this movie. Don't misunderstand, I like this movie, but the problem is that movie awards like the Oscars,presumably, are there to honor high quality and High achievements in each respected field. Russel Crowe does an adequate job, but his acting in his other Oscar nominated films like "The Informant" or "A Beautiful Mind" were light years ahead of his performance in "Gladiator". Furthermore, Giving best picture to this film was mind boggling. I personally feel that the only reason this movie was even in the running at all, was because of the money it made. It was a good action movie and nothing more. Hey, remember that "Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" was also up for best picture that year. In my opinion, It ran circles around "Gladiator". Wheras "Gladiator' was just a good action film. CTHD was a phenomenal action movie and love story and should have won the top prize.</fullReview>

Full marks for being one of the best films ever made.It is not historically accurate with the plot but that's not the point (it seems a mash of different events and people who existed at one time or another in during the Roman Empire. From what I know of ancient Rome the story is within the realms of possibility.) The characters are all great. Pheonix is annoying but intentionally so - he acts his character perfectly. The script is kind of poetic at times - it seems it underwent at least three full scale revisions by different masters of script writing.There are a number of different accents in the film but then Rome was probably a pretty multicultural place and we're hardly going to wish they had made it in Latin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>real life situation for an epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's all you might imagine, a real life situation for an epic. Remember that such battles where very common, not to mention the thousands of lives lost. Ridley Scott put the viewer into suspense and tension during the very first battle we had, not to mention the grandiose strategy Maximus had.Shot in Malta: Ricasli and other locations, the arena built had over 5000 extras. All awaiting for the signal...Roar did the crowd when Maximus entered. They loved him, a man of honour, a normal being, a prisoner, a warrior. Their HERO!Ridley Scott direction excelled at its best in Gladiator conveying the authenticity of life, our ancestors have lived!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swords, sandals, battlefields and an amazingly poignant struggle at its core ? it has all you could ask for in an epic Roman saga, plus well-placed flair and fury.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They tell me your son squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross. And your wife moaned like a whore when they ravaged her again and again... and again."Gladiator is an amazing story of revenge. It is a story of one man's struggle to challenge the emperor of Rome, wearing nothing but slaves' attire, being sold as a gladiator for the people's morbid amusement, and seeking vengeance for having his family murdered through these 'games'. It is also a political story about justice in the midst of corruption, interwoven with swords, sandals and battlefields  la epic war saga. This, my friends, is a true underdog story with a hero so poignant that it is impossible not to be engrossed in his struggle.Whatever _I_ will say about this film will simply be semi-coherent, rambling praise as I like the works of Ridley Scott so much. However, far from everyone liked Gladiator (2000). Roger Ebert disliked it. Moviegoers criticized it for being unoriginal ? a mild rip-off of Spartacus (1960) and the likes. It may have been warmly received by the Academy, but audiences were very divided when it was released. I'd like to think that I am usually able to see things from other people's perspective, but just this once, how could you not be entertained?So although I usually trust Roger Ebert a great deal, I have absolutely no idea what he was on about in panning the film for its gloomy tone and "muddy, fuzzy and indistinct" skies. Maybe he simply forgot to clean his widescreen TV, because the Gladiator I know sees hugely epic games under a brilliant blue sky in the coliseum, a glorious tournament that is so entertaining because of its flair. The final battle has ROSES RAINING FROM THE SKY! It does not get more vivid or colourful than that.These battle-scenes of Gladiator are, of course, extremely well tended to by Ridley Scott who is the master at crafting epic war scenarios (see, I told you fanboy-praise would sneak its way in!). The patient, slow pacing of the film seems to take a sudden halt here, and then fast-forward in an amazingly rapid-fire pace with quick shots, swinging swords, vivid skies and a great score by Hans Zimmer to further emphasize the dramatic mood. The very culmination of this is not at the end, but rather early. It is the moment that Maximus (a superb Russell Crowe) removes his helmet, reveals his identity and faces the emperor, after a long and ferocious battle. It is a scene so poignant that I always wish it would have been saved until later on in the film, thereby giving it even more weight. But no matter, because rest assured that it is goosebumps-inducing enough.A gloriously entertaining, heartfelt and carefully crafted war adventure by Ridley Scott in which little feels missing or incomplete. What more could you ask for? Great acting from the cast, I suppose ? well, this is also present in Gladiator. Best of all, the actors have good dialogue to work with so they don't choke on the dated lines. Russell Crowe propels this film with his heroic personality, Connie Nielsen adds introspective depth, and Joaquin Phoenix is excellent as the twisted but idealist emperor Commodurus. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The true definition of being a man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It actually inspired me to be something greater. I felt the need to achieve and become what truly defines a man. Maximus is seriously one of my favorite characters in movie history because he's fascinating and interesting to know about. He is also, once again, what stands as a true definition of a man. A man has to be responsible and patient, and this man just does that. If I have to pick a single most influential person besides Jesus, I'd still go with Maximus. What he did in the movie was truly outstanding and I wish that he was an actual person in history. The death of his family gave him a small moment of despair, but he took it all in, including the loss of his rank and his status now as a "slave." As Maximus gradually progresses as a gladiator in the movie, he just becomes more and more bad ass, being the true hero of the entire movie. He never flinches in pain, but stands up, all the way to the end. The faithfulness he builds in his two friends is awe-inspiring, and their willing to take consequences for his survival is what represents strong friendship. Maximus is by heart THE man. Gladiator is one of the most inspirational movies I saw, and there are no others like it.The movie itself was purely genius. Although it's a pretty simple story about revenge, it has interesting side stories and build ups of characters. The performance as Maximus by Crowe was electrifying. He pounds in every good quotes in the movie in the most awesome ways. Phoenix as Commodus was also notable. I truly hated this character because I saw him as a coward and the true villain of movies. He is just so evil and so cold, even his expressions and appearances define that. Phoenix was just so great as this character, and no others would have been able to land such a villainous role. Other notable characters were Djimon Honsou as the gladiator friend as well as the many others that Crowe's Maximus encountered. Connie Nielsen was also great as Lucilla, who was interesting in that she didn't have a like mind as Commodus. I felt the passion she had for Maximus and the statement she makes about Maximus in the end. I think Oliver Reed as Proximo was a great character that I can easily compare as the teacher. He brought up Maximus's true strength and trained him to become a defined warrior. At first impression, he seemed like a cold blooded man, but the last scene of him with Maximus proved of how caring he is for Maximus and for his sake. Overall, the actors and actresses did an outstanding job playing their parts.The score and the effects were just beautiful. The battle songs were just so inspirational and I found myself listening to it for a boost of strength. The special effects and movie quality was so rich and brilliant, with some of the best actions available.Overall, I think Ridley Scott did a great job in making this film. This movie will simply be placed in my list of best movies in all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally I would say there is no greater movie than this; Gladiator displays excellence in all aspects of what makes a good movie. Russel Crowe (General Maximus) was so well cast for this role and he played it perfectly, through his journey to make Rome great again he sacrifices his own life for the greatness of his country in, what I think of, as the most touching and emotional scene in a movie ever. When I watched this movie at age ten I cried when General Maximus died, the moment was so perfect I forgot I was on a couch, I was there, inside the coliseum with him and it's that moment which elevates this movie above all others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can you still make a great period movie, which is commercially viable too in these days? Apparently you can, as Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe prove with this magnum opus.What strikes you most about "Gladiator" are not the dazzling sets and costumes - though they contribute to the effect too. Where "Gladiator" delivers is in the area of raw human emotions we are so familiar with.As somebody said, switching to the other mind-set is half the fun, and Gladiator takes you right to the midst of Romans' politics, their passions, their dreams and their weaknesses.After Ben-Hur, I feel this is the best period movie to have ever emerged from Hollywood.-Murali Chari</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to watch this movie at least 3 times in your life: First time - in puberty for the special effects and epic battles. Like the little Lucius, this movie will likely make you to dream of being a gladiator.Second time - in your 30's for the love, life choices and loses. This is the time when you fight all your battles for yourself and your family. Like Maximus you will dream to get out of your Colosseum and break the chains.Third time - when you feel your life is close to an end - just to remember what you have achieved. Like the old emperor Marcus Aurelius you will have to realize if your name would be remembered or forgotten forever. Is your family close to you in your final hours or you are going to see them in the afterlife. Have you been a good parent?I really enjoy this movie every time I watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a sad waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's starts out like any good epic should with a masterfully filmed and executed exciting battle sequence that sets up the audience for one of those rare Hollywoodian confections that are both entertaining and artsy. Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there. It isn't the performers faults since every single one of them give amazing, emotional, even, at times, riveting performances (the kinds you should find in better movies) and who give the whole picture more class than it deserves. It isn't Hanz Zimmer's nor Lisa Gerrard's fault since they have composed a score that's almost (and I do mean almost) as unforgettable as the Godfather's. And it certainly isn't Ridely Scott's fault since he yet again succeeds in immersing the audience in the world he has created. No, the ones who are to blame are the people who wrote the saccharine, clichd, soap-opery script and who, in the process, have wasted all of this incredible talent. They should be fed to the lions. It's an entertaining B-movie that could have been a classic. Just like Titanic in a way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is terrific. It is definitely one of my top 5 films of all time. I'm sure everyone knows the plot by now. Russell Crowe is one bad a** MF that kicks major b*tt. Not to mention he looks so hot as he is decapitating and slashing the competition. But what makes this movie great is the story line is heart felt and you feel for Maximus after his family is murdered. It is the ultimate tale of revenge.Russell Crowe is a great actor. I never heard of him before Gladiator but since seeing this I have watched a bunch of other films he is in. He's pretty good in them all. He should have won the oscar for The Insider and for A Beautiful Mind rather than Gladiator though, but just because those two movies were more "oscar-like".FINAL VERDICT: A definite must see. I have this one on tape to watch it over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Movie That Could Have Been Even Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning of "Gladiator" is powerful. We see the Roman Legion fighting against the Germanic tribes in what surely must be one of the most spectacular battle scenes ever filmed; one which truly does give the viewer a taste of what warfare in that era must have been like. The ending is powerful, as the quest for vengeance finally comes to a head, with General Maximus facing the Emperor Commodus in a gladiatorial contest in the Roman arena. In between - well - things could have been a little better.The acting in this movie, I thought, was first-rate. Russell Crowe as General Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodus and Connie Nielsen as Lucilla, sister of Commodus, all played their parts perfectly. The gladiatorial bouts were superbly choreographed. The set decoration was magnificent, and looked exactly as I would expect Imperial Rome to have looked. So, why do I say this could have been better?(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Basically, the whole thing was just a bit too clear-cut for me. Maximus was too obviously the good guy, Commodus too obviously the bad guy. With this being so clear, we know that the movie must be heading for the final confrontation between the two, and it makes watching the middle 90 minutes or so difficult. "Get on with it," I found myself thinking from time to time. It didn't have to be quite so clear cut. The potential was there to give the viewer a real ethical choice to make. I mean, one can understand Commodus being angry when Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) - his father - takes away the throne that Commodus had believed all his life would be his, and hands control of Rome over to Maximus. Commodus could have been a sympathetic character. He didn't have to murder his father. His father was elderly; a natural death wouldn't have been out of the question. And why the incestuous fascination with Lucilla? I didn't think it added anything to the movie - except to make Commodus even more repulsive. In the end, the movie didn't make me think about anything; it didn't challenge me with any moral decision-making; it didn't make choosing sides in this battle even remotely difficult.Don't get me wrong. This was a very good movie. One can always argue whether this movie or that should have been named best picture; one certainly has to agree that "Gladiator" was worthy of consideration. I just felt it could have been better. In the end, I give it a rating of 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent, albeit historically inaccurate, film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rousing story of one man surviving adversity and destroying a corrupt man in the process, Gladiator is a very entertaining 2 1/2 hour ride. The best part of the movie is the backdrop itself, for which Ridley Scott aggressively takes the moviegoer on a trip throughout all corners of the Roman Empire, and even to their concept of heaven in the process. Definitely worth the money, and I'm sorry that I didn't get to see it on the big screen.I was disturbed, however, by the historical liberties taken with the script. For those of you who don't care about this sort of thing, please stop reading now.OK, first of all, Marcus Aurelius died of the plague, which would have been pretty hard for Commodious to fake if he had killed his father. 2nd, Commodius lived for 12 years (180-192 A.D.) so his quick rise and fall doesn't really jibe historically either (he died in a wrestling match). Also, he was known for his physical strength, so his wimpiness in the movie really didn't make sense.These items, taken alone, bother me a little, but then there are more disturbing factors to take into account. For one, soldiers weren't allowed BY LAW to get married, so all of Maximus' talk of "going home to see his wife" really doesn't make sense. Soldiers did keep women on nearby plots of land, but they probably wouldn't talk openly about it. Also, Rome was in a defensive posture; most of the lands they had acquired they acquired BEFORE Marcus Aurelius came to power.I think what bothers me the most is the fact that Marcus Aurelius was no hero. He was renowned for persecuting Christians; he stepped up efforts during his regime, believing that Christianity would be the death of the empire. While he did do some very good things for the empire, he wasn't the benevolent patriarch that the movie made him out to be. He also tried to marry his nephew to his daughter so they would produce a "super emperor"; my guess is that he probably didn't want Rome to be a Republic again.Revisionist history is troublesome. Although this did happen nearly 2 millennia ago, we still can't forget that the emperors of the day were not heroes by today's standards. I'm not one of those politically correct people who thinks that movies about despots shouldn't be made. I simply believe that historical figures should be presented honestly for what they did (and didn't do), and not sugarcoated for a mass audience.Having said all that, I really did like the movie. I give it an 8/10, with the disclaimer that it's no Braveheart, but it is visually stunning and hard to look away from while you're watching it, but not a movie that really will affect me for months after seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say? Gladiator was a great film. It cunningly blends political satire, acting, action, and fun into to a film, right? WRONG.Gladiator is more than just a fun-filled, oscar-winning, controversial action-fest. If you look below the surface, Gladiator has many facets of itself that makes a step above the rest.First, compliments to Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix (who was wrongly denied the Supporting Actor Oscar.) One of the best examples of why this film is unusual is because of how varied and developed (or fleshed-out) the characters are.Another important thing to remember is that the film is not necessarily meant to be taken as a pinnacle masterpiece of the ages. Though the film is portrayed quite artistically and has the ability to touch the audience on an emotional level, some scenes are just intended for fun (or shock value, whichever suits you best.)And so, though I haven't much to say for this one, I enjoyed, and its one that will make a small impression on the American public (emotionally, not economically.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Special Effects, OK Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is one of those movies where you just know what's going to happen next. After returning from war, Maximus (Russell Crowe) is to be given the crown as emperor of Rome, but instead is sent to be executed once the Emperor's son (Joaquin Phoenix) kills the emperor and takes it for himself. After escaping execution and winding up a slave and a gladiator, you just know how the movie is going to go. While the scenery and battle sequences are great, the predictability and general lack of caring about most of the characters makes this a rather unspectacular movie. Crowe does a decent, but not Oscar-worthy job of portraying Maximus while Phoenix does an equally decent job as portraying the evil, self-centered emperor Commodus. No one else in the cast is really given all that much for character depth and thus I never really cared about most of them. I give the movie 9/10 stars for the special effects and 7/10 for everything else, averaging an 8/10 for the movie.</fullReview>

The film is mostly accurate with it's portrayal of the time period, and the writing gives the viewer a sense of connection with these men. The violence was shown in a manner that did not detract from the story. Before I saw the film I had trepidations due to the subject matter, but all the graphic shots were quick and to the point, showing the nature of the combat, but not "gore for gore's sake".Overall, one of the finest films I have seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is a truly great depiction of an important part of early Roman Empire. Yes, Gladiator will probably win the Oscar of Best Picture of 2000, but should it? While I agree that watching it was a great pleasure, I am not convinced that it was the best movie made last year. In any other year, not containing a film named ?Cast Away', Gladiator would get my absolute vote, however in the interest of keeping this review to the movie at hand, I will not name which one I feel should win.Viewing Gladiator was definitely a spectacle everyone should endure. It has everything any good movie should; an original story, great acting, and truly awe-inspiring direction. To be transported to a world that existed over 1800 years ago, and experience the very same excitement the Romans were able to enjoy is just incredible. Ridley Scott struck did very well with his direction of Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Neilsen, and Oliver Reed (who unfortunately suffered a fatal heart attack during filming). Scotts' ability to `see' the action in his head, and create the effect for the cameras is wonderful. This is a far different epic than ?Alien', and far better than ?Hannibal'. Russell Crowe is fabulous as Maximus Meridius, the great soldier planning to return to his home after fighting his last battle only to find himself thrust between the dead kings will for him to become the new king, and Commudus, the son of the former king wanting him to stay and fight for him. Crowe is perfect in this role, he is strong, rugged looking, and has become quite a good actor since his days in ?The Quick and the Dead' and the awful ?Virtuosity'.Joaquin Phoenix is magnificent in his role as Commudus. Only recently have I noticed what great acting skills Phoenix possesses, and how well he transforms into such diverse characters, such the same can be said of Ewan McGregor and his diverse roles in ?Trainspotting', ?Little Voice' and ?Star Wars: Episode I'. Phoenix's ability to present himself in such a devious and hateful aspect is awe-inspiring. As the sister of Commudus, Lucilla (Connie Neilsen) has to play both devoted to her brother, and sympathetic to Maximus. Neilsen pulls this off beautifully and she is very convincing in her role.The story is beautifully written, and there is never a dull moment. After I viewed the film for the first time I felt that the gladiator fight scenes were too far apart, and not enough of them were in the movie. However, a very good friend of mine, we shall call him Michael DeZubiria (check out his reviews), felt it necessary to explain to me that Gladiator is not just a story about fighting, but a story about the life struggles of one man and his quest to avenge the brutal killing of his family. Now, while I admit that I liked this film, I am not ready, nor will I ever be ready, to call it the best movie of 2000 (see my Cast Away review). I do not want to take anything away from Gladiator, it's just that there was a more original, creative film in 2000.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is well-made and sports all the frills of a big budget production -- big sets and lotsa extras in good costumery. However, let's be blunt, it is a 10-minute plot stretched out to epic proportions. And, it is not a new plot. It is not much more than a combination of Braveheart and Last of the Mohicans, go to Rome -- to name a couple of more recent films. In effect, it is hero gets done wrong and his loved ones are killed, so he bides his time and gets his revenge. I think all of the hurrah behind this film is from Hollywood having little else to offer this year at the Oscars (how else could Chocolat get nominated --$$$). Since Crouching Tiger is not part of the good ole boy Hollywood network, Hollywood is working hard to prevent a foreign film from upstaging them. In a different year, this film would not get half the recognition it is getting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie it reminded me of Braveheart. Then I thought to myself that this movie posses a quality that Braveheart does not. It possesses the quality that you get satisfaction at the end of the movie. In Braveheart you do not get satisfaction at the end and it is difficult to watch many times. I believe that that is the reason why Braveheart didn't do as well as Gladiator did in the box office but did win 5 Oscars. This movie is a work of art. The score complements the movie so well. Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer deliver the movie in music notes rather than words. Russell Crowe is great in the movie and reminds me alot of Richard Burton. He is an up and coming star who is destined 2 win an Oscar. Joaquin Phoenix also delivers a great performance worthy of an Oscar. The late Oliver Reed is outstanding. Reed seems to steal the scene that he is in from all the other actors because of his acting power. Ridley Scott delivers a classic film that will remain in our memory and our hearts. If you haven't seen this movie, please do, you will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We thought that the star of director Ridley Scott was going to disappear thanks to unsuccessful movies like the good "Albatross" or the really weird "G. I. Jane", but fortunately he is came back with a success like "Gladiator" and a promising title like "Hannibal". Even if doesn't absolutely respect history, this movie is a beautiful work and a great wonder for our eyes. Scott directs the battle with great ability, helped by the editing of the great Italian Pietro Scalia (Academy Award winner for "JFK"): the initial battle in the woods is frenetic and impressive with the force of a thunder and the fights in the arenas are exceptional, a demonstration of what the evolution in movies can do. And also the cast, which sometimes is sacrificed for the show, shows a very great power: Russell Crowe is a suffering but determined Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix an evil, weak and complex Commodus, Connie Nielsen is so beautiful than good actress and then there is a great english trio formed by Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed (dead during the shots). Giorgio Cantarini (Benigni's son in "La Vita ? Bella") plays the brief role of Maximus' son. We mustn't also forget the red photography by John Mathieson, the rich art direction of Arthur Max (a name, a program) and the wonderful themes composed by Hans Zimmer, featuring the splendid vocals of Lisa Gerrard. Wonderful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The great epic movies were finally surpassed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so well done, that you are overwhelmed. I can frankly say that there is not even a single boring moment during the whole length. I will begin my description with the shooting. The movie has such great shots, that you will be truly impressed. There wasn't any saving made by the producers with the staging of the scenery. It has been set to resemble perfectly the Roman times. The fighting scenes in the gladiator's arena are shocking, but tastefully done. Actually, the movie begins with a battle between a Roman legion and a German tribe's army. Great shots! It is much better than the fights in Braveheart. The other impressive side of the movie is the consistency of the plot. The movie has a coherent plot which sends us a clear picture of the happenings, without limiting the suspension. You cannot guess the end of the movie at all, and neither the next step, but as it happens it is logic. The last but not least is Crowe's acting. I have never heard about this actor until this movie, but he plays very well. He is manly and sensitive altogether. I commend its casting, when other candidates were more known. You just have to see this movie, and you will be convinced that the great epic era of the fifties was finally reproduced and surpassed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best movie ever made. One of the first to move me to tears at the end. Excellent plot, direction and acting. All else pales in comparison. I dare you to watch it because it will blow your mind. And for the losers that think they should nitpick about the historical accuracy of it, or the existence of the characters: It's fiction not a documentary of the gladiatorial lifestyles. The movie paints a beautiful view of Rome, its armies, the leaders and the land. Again, the acting is impeccable. In fact, the movie is so well done, there have been rip offs of it made. For instance, see Troy. A mediocre film with mediocre actors. As well, the direction is so much better. The fight scenes in Gladiator are beautiful, yet don't focus on the gore, as if to make some cheesy thriller. It's all about the plot, and the results are delicious. The movie never gets old. It is an emotional roller-coaster. The beauty, the heartbreak, the fighting, is all so amazing.</fullReview>

Also being able to convince people of every action the hero makes is great. The movie had great sound effects that added more greatness to the movie. The hero was general maximus acted by russell crowe who made the best role in his career in this movie. The movie shows corruption and hatred that is being found in human beings in all times and vengeance that fills the hearts. The greatest parts in the movie is the parts when the gladiators fight for their live(kill or die). The fights where pictured perfectly . Also what made me like that movie was the story as talks about a man who was a general and then became a slave the a gladiator and then he challenges Cesar to a fight for death that is amusing and special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riotously campy success in the "guilty pleasure" genre, but much too long due to pretense of being some kind of intellectual high tragedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally saw Gladiator. Now that's guilty pleasure. Definitely a guy movie, as men outnumbered women three to one in audience. Star Wars, popular as it was, made the mistake of actually being about something; I'm happy to say that Gladiator has no redeeming value whatever. Just blood, mud and crud. Some of the killing made me laugh out loud, like when Crowe stabbed a guy with two swords and then chopped off his head while he was still standing. When Oliver Reed went into that monologue, accompanied by full orchestra, about the thrill of the cheering crowd I almost thought he was going to sing There's No Business Like Show Business. You know something is a bit over the top when one of the most restrained performances comes from Richard Harris! Another big laugh was when Crowe and Djimon win the crowd over by becoming the first "tag team" gladiators in pre-television history. Film pictures all the gladiators as united against some unnamed enemy over on the other side of the arena, thus daintily skirting the more Spartacus-like reality that the gladiators fought and killed each other -- and therefore, presumably, were hard put to have indulged themselves in the kind of emotional ties we see here. When the leading lady (Connie Nielsen, in fact just about the only woman) arranges to meet Crowe privately, she explains for the audience's sake that patrician women purchased sexual favors this way all the time. Seems to me everybody onscreen would know that already! It's like in The Mikado where Yum Yum turns halfway toward the audience and says to Nanky Poo "But darling, you forget: in Japan..." except that in the latter case WS Gilbert meant it as a joke. The one thing that dampened the pace was long dialogue scenes between the battles, as if the movie were hunting desperately for some intellectual point that would justify its existence, not unlike the '63 Cleopatra in that way. Unnecessary in either case, serving only to protract the running time. Gladiator should be at least a half hour shorter than it is. Audience ate it up, though.A friend commented "Gladiator will live on TNT and USA forever!" but I think she underestimates basic cable: there will probably also be a series starring Lorenzo Lamas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no such thing as a perfect movie and i don't think that Gladiator is even near that. But this movie takes a could be basic 80's style action film (like mad max or any steven segal movie)and turns it into a cinematic masterpiece. Ridley Scott is known to make C class concepts into A style movies (Blade Runner) and knows what he's doing and how. the Cinematography is perfect and this is a film for almost everyone to enjoy. If you like rich dialog and cinematography, then this is your film. If you like action and intense war scene, then this is your film. Joaquin Phoenix steals ever scene he is in as he plays the Empire son, who becomes Empire himself. Russell Crowe as much as everyone hate always gives his greatest performance ever (even though he is very good in L.A. confidential). Oliver Reed (Goodfellas) also gives a humorous but heartfelt performance as Maximus' owner who was once a Gladiator himself, this would also mark the last Oliver Reed film unfortunately as he died after filming. Dijmon Hounsou (Amastad, In America) also did a good job as well, surprised me for the most as he was only a model prior to this. But this movie overall isn't the best i have seen, but it should be recognized as one of the best. If you haven't seen this movie go and rent it, you won't be disappointed. 8 out 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Possible Spoilers)Gladiator could be considered the first great movie of the new millennium. It has story, it has history, it has romance, and it has action. But above all else, it has action. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is the leader of Emperor Marcus Aurelius' (Richard Harris) legion in Germany. After a horrific battle to open the film, the Emperor is murdered by his power-hungry son, Commidus (Joaquin Phoenix) and Maximus is sentenced to die. After an amazing escape, Maximus returns home to find his family murdered and home destroyed. Next thing you know he's being sold as a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed) a gladiator owner. The film is filled with amazing battle sequences held in the arena and a story of revenge that nearly matches Ben-Hur's (1959). Russell Crowe does an excellent job as the betrayed servant of Rome and the ability Joaquin Phoenix shows as a truly insane emperor is amazing. This film has some of the best acting I have ever seen. The film won (If memory serves me right) numerous awards and gratitude from critique's. The Colliseum is a tad to big compared to its actual size yet the director is still able to show how advance the Roman's were when it came to construction, battle tactics, and government. The look of Roman society is a bit off but it does not matter as that is not the focus of the film.Gladiator. Starring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielson, and Oliver Reed. 5 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

This had everything movies like Spartacus and Ben Hur had, plus a bit extra since special effects are so much more advanced. The storylines which were woven together I found compelling.

		<fullReview>May be a spoiler. Gladiator was a good movie. And no one could have played Maximus' character better than Crowe. It was the fittest and finest he'd ever looked. I loved the lines at the beginning of the film when he says, "What we do here today echoes in eternity" or something like that. What can I critique? Performances by everyone was great. The plot was adequate for the epic film and it showed a historical account of men being sold into slavery and turned into warriors for entertainment during the times of Roman rule. It was impressive and I'm not going to pretend like I'm some kind of movie critic. The movie kept me interested in its duration,and it had a moral message that I appreciate. The script was good. No stupid lines or cliched ones. The cinematography was great. Did you see that lion scene?Get a load of the beginning war scene. Scene after scene got more interesting. Now the scene stealer for the moment or the few precious moments it ran is Djimon Hounsou's character. Maximus' friend. All I have to say is he was a gorgeous sight to view especially when the slave owner slaps his ass. I wish I was that guy. Damn what a beautiful specimen of a man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GLADIATOR is a fantastic achievement in modern filmmaking. I never expected to ever see another Roman epic, but Ridley Scott has proved it is possible. What's so great about this movie is that it has a really entertaining and enthralling storyline, not just special effects and action (although it has a lot of that): it knows how to make us care about the people in it and how to develop a sense of style and elegance (thanks to director Ridley Scott). The movie is fueled by a number of powerhouse performances: Russell Crowe is perfect as the title character, I loved Oliver Reed as Proximo, and Joaquin Phoenix made a perfectly hissable villain. I was amazed at how exciting this movie was. Although the opening battle sequence is not very promising, with its confusing, chaotic editing, after that it's just uphill: the film will send you on roller-coaster ride of nonstop thrills. The effects are very well done: there is a scene where we see Commodus arrive at Rome as the new emperor that's absolutely breathtaking. I also loved the way they recreated the Colosseum. Parts of this movie are truly awe-ispiring. The fights in the arenas are spectacularly sensational. I must also mention John Mathieson's absolutely beautiful cinematography and Hans Zimmer's perfect music score. Some scenes where Mathieson's visuals and Zimmer's music mix are undescribably beautiful and breathtaking. The entire film is beautiful: just about any frame of it would make a really good poster to stick on the wall. I recommend this film to those who appreciate to finest things in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen.Every minute brings forth more intrigue to Gladiator. Non-stop action keeps the adrenaline pumping, the portrayal of the characters makes us see what the director and writer wants us to see, and a story that keeps us coming for more.Russell Crowe does an excellent job in his portrayal of Maximus, a man cut down from a general to a slave, and then became more powerful than the emperor, exactly as the tag-line says. His despair over the death of his family and the future he's denied, his disgust over the games, and his quest for vengeance when he finds the man who killed his family and his close friend.Joaquin Phoenix also does a marvelous job for Commodus. Successfully showing him as a spoiled rich boy lusting for more power, and viewing his as someone not to be feared, but pitied.Even though Oliver Reed died before he could shoot some very important scenes, they flawlessly brought him back from the dead digitally to say his final words, "Shadows and Dust," from a test shoot earlier making the approach of the climax even more gripping.Alien, Blade Runner, and now Gladiator. What ever Ridley Scott does for these movies, he should keep it up and other directors should take notes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfection! Every single detail: from a perfect cast, to flawless acting, flawless script, the most ascetically amazing and magnificent sets of all time, costume design's are flawless, the directing and editing was absolutely brilliant: you can go frame by frame line by line detail to detail and you will not find any flaws. Even the greatest movies of all time have either a minor plot flaw, or someone does a bad acting job, or their was a casting flaw (someone who just stuck out your head that would be better for a certain part), their is almost always flaws in a certain scene's that could be improved upon or if you could go back in time and change certain things you would. In this movie there is not one single thing in that could be improved upon down to smallest of details. Their is are not any scene's, line's, setting, or expressions in the movie that could be improved upon. No other film has ever been this perfect on so many levels. If it was possible to go back in time and re-shoot this movie again and again starting with everything the same everything, the chances of everything being executed this perfect again are extremely slim for a film of this scale. This movie raised the bar as high as it can go and the bar cannot be raised any higher. Just like you cannot travel faster than speed of light this movie cannot be surpassed. The best any future movie can do is tie and chances of a future movie being this perfect are not very likely. You would have better chances of winning the LOTTO several times then to see another movie that is executed so perfectly in every way.You may enjoy another movie more, because of different factors like your favorite genre or you, somehow dislike some part of this movie for some strange reason like you are scarred of a little blood or violence. But no one could logically argue that any other movie has been developed and executed this perfectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Their are no words to describe this grand historic epic. Gladiator is a film everybody would enjoy, for it has a great story, great action and superb acting (no wonder Crowe got an Oscar!) Gladiator recounts the story of one of the greatest Roman generals Maximus, who was forced to slavery by the corrupt incestuous heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) who killed Marcus Aurelius the emperor for he knew he offered Maximus power over his own son. Maximus has then become his worst enemy. Commodus having ordered to kill him and his family, Maximus escapes death and as becomes the general who became a slave, the slave who became gladiator, and the gladiator who defied an emperor. Gladiator has some of the most beautiful scenery and CGI effects I have ever seen. IT really is one of the best "recent" films out there. The script is also very effective and suiting, and somehow adds a poetic feel to it and so does the superb music used. The actors all did very well in their roles, though Crowe dominated, it is also a memorable performance by Phoenix and Nielsen most memorably and also Hounsou and Harris. Gladiator really does deserve all the awards and nominations it has received. I can assure you, that if you haven't seen this films yet, it should really be the next on your list!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The old Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius wanted to give the power to his favorite general Maximus. Due to envy, Commodus killed his father Marcus and claimed him as the lawful successor. The misfortune fell on Maximus. After he lost his family, he did not want to live anymore. However life did not go on as he wanted. He was trained as a gladiator. It mattered life and death. If you wanted to survive, you had to kill the opponent.The final duel between Maximus and Commodus was the most soul-stirring duel I ever watched. Although Maximus was a powerful general, he was a kind and generous person. It was his kindness that made him become the victim of insidious Commodus. Maybe he was just fit for leading an army.Russell Crowe convincingly played the brave general Maximus. He was deserved to win the best actor (the academy award). It was a pity that Ridley Scott did not win the best director.A movie that can push you forward. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously, though, this is rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Russell Crowe, complete with designer stubble and an occasional Aussie accent, gladiates his way through an overrated melodrama that's so boring it had me climbing the walls after ten minutes. The convincing visual effects used to bring Ancient Rome to life are surrounded by a sludgily lit and droning epic-by-numbers that includes all the requisite battles, close-ups of tortured faces, sweeping shots of fields, and dead loved ones, but not a single moment of awe or poignancy. Despite the film's tut-tutting about the practice of making men fight tigers for entertainment, the fight sequences are shot like this is a Tony Scott film rather than a Ridley effort, while all the underdog-makes-good plot line needs is Burgess Meredith shouting 'You're gonna eat lightnin' and crap thunder!' All of this has about as much impact as a smack in the face from Mr. Burns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Gladiator is really the best movie I've ever seen. Everything is just perfect, the image, the story and of course the music. The first time I saw the movie I was really overwhelmed by the movie. Than I rented it a dozen times before I could buy it. Since the time the movie came out I've seen him at least 30 times. And now I'm still overwhelmed by the feeling the movie gives me. It just the most perfect movie there is!!! The movie starts with a great opening, the only bad thing about the opening and maybe the whole movie is that when the soldiers fire the missiles you can see very good that this missiles are animated by a computer, they go to straight to be real. After that the movie starts slowly and keeps going faster till the end. Thats another reason why it is good. From the beginning till the end you just are watching as if you were there, this is meanly done by the music which fits perfectly by the pictures you see. Great work from Hans Zimmer just like the latest movie King Arthur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A class act!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am usually worried that I'm in for a big let-down when I am looking forward to a film as much as I was to this one. This time however, I was very pleasantly suprised, when Gladiator not only fulfilled but surpassed my expectations. It's a brilliant film, which (while containing weaknesses such as a script which wasn't quite as good as it could have been, and one climactic scene which completely changes, and ruins, the ending) manages to engage your heart and mind.The performances are without exception excellent (although the accents may distract a bit, there is such a wide variety of them). I must single out for commendation Mr. Phoenix, who despite his youth manages to portray a character with such conviction that you never for a moment doubt his interpretation. His physical performance is as good as his mental one.The film rests firmly on the (extremely attractive and capable) shoulders of one Russell Crowe. In a tour-de-force performance, he manages to convey a man (not a superhuman) with frailties and doubts and fears and heart. I cannot convey to you how brilliant this man's performance was. If anyone else had been this character, the film would have rated at best a five out of ten.Kudos to Russell Crowe, and to Ridley Scott, for managing to keep this film on a level with humanity, rather than one in which the characters become killing machines.A must see, five stars out of five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Action Epic Over-Hyped as Something its Not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator should be the type of film that I enjoy. Ridley Scott taking on something much grander than anything he had previously. A cast of fine actors led by Russell Crowe. A return to the sword-and- sandal epics of years gone by. It's a film of fine visual finesse, engaging action sequences and large themes. So why is it that Gladiator left me feeling so cold? Well it falls flat in its two most important areas, story and characters.It follows the gruff general Maximus who is named protector of Rome by Marcus Aurelius, that is until Aurelius is murdered by his own son Commodus who has Maximus exiled and his family killed. From here you can see exactly where the film is going. Maximus finds himself as a slave and is sold to a gladiator trainer named Proximo (played by the always great Oliver Reed) who wants to take him to Rome and help him fight his way to the top. This story is about as basic and clichd as humanly possible. The hero is betrayed and fights his way back in order to get his revenge. That is effectively the main premise of the film. For such simplicity to work the film has to either add twists to the story or be incredible detailed, yet it does neither.The story also contains a weirdly handled sub-plot about Commodus trying to crush the senate who are constantly attempting to make him tackle real issues instead of hosting games. This could have been a decent side story but it's never fleshed out enough to leave an impact. Involved in basically every story thread is Commodus' sister Lucilla, who he also happens to want a child with (yes, he's that kind of kooky), and she becomes a plot device to link all of these pieces together. Joaquin Phoenix hams it up big time as Commodus and to be fair he is clearly meant to be a pantomime villain and Phoenix is probably the only person having fun in the entire film. Connie Nielsen deserves credit too for holding her own despite her incredibly underwritten character.Of course when Maximus and his gladiators get to Rome, they smash through all that stand in their way leading to the crowd turning over to Maximus' side and an inevitable confrontation with Commodus. How Russell Crowe won an Oscar for his performance is a mystery. Crowe himself is fine, but the role is as basic tough guy as it comes and anyone with a bit of muscle could have played the role as it is. Maximus is simply a poor leading character. He's just dour and dull as a rock for the entirety of the film, even before his family are killed off. What's is also notable is that the character doesn't grow. He's a bland, unsympathetic slab from the get-go who just becomes slight more revenge-fuelled as things progress. How can we empathise with this type of main character?Clearing those obstacles, I have little problems with the film on a technical level. It's Ridley Scott so you know the film with be very detailed and beautiful on a visual level and that is exactly what we get. Rome looks magnificent. Vast, majestic and full of people, whilst even the CGI is impressive and manages to blend in seamlessly. The film has an almost dirty brown, hazy look to it that actually works to its advantage. It fits the sullen mood that many of the gladiator's find themselves in. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard provide a score that feels like it's been ripped off by every action movie since it, especially the pieces where Gerrard appears to be singing in a made up language.The action scenes are a highlight. There is a grittiness to them that works for this time period. They not that well-choreographed and I thing that ways purposefully done, in order the show how many of the gladiators were fighting by using sheer aggression and desperation. Every stabbing or wounding looks and sounds painful and not in an overblown or unnatural way. The Coliseum looks fabulous and the films gets across the intimidating atmosphere of having to fight in there. I do have problems with how easily Maximus rises to the top, seeing as he's able to lead the gladiators through tough battles and defeat the only undefeated gladiators with relative ease. Then the climax eventually boils down to Maximus v Commodus and its entirely predictable and just a boring way to end.What is notable is that Gladiator didn't affect me on an emotional level at all. Even comparable epics like 'Braveheart', which shares similar issues, moved me. Gladiator left me numb. I didn't care about Maximus' plight because I was just given a shell of a character to try and get behind. I wasn't engaged in the story because it was simply a downbeat repeat of a storyline that has been done to death. I didn't even care on a basic level to see the villain get his comeuppance. All the talks of political treachery, what it means to be a gladiator and of meeting again in the afterlife just seemed like pieces to fill the film out. I can't deny that the film is a technical marvel or say that it bored me, but I can state that is built upon a story and set of characters that are wholly uninteresting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is one of those movies that will never be outdated. It will never need to be remade or need anything else done to it. It stands on its own like few other movies do. Crowe's performance as Maximus (I think I spelled that right) is subtle and stoic, yet perfect. He is the perfect hero archetype and it ends fulfilling that archetype perfectly. The story, whether how accurate it is to ancient Rome or not, is incredible. Even if we must view it as a fantasy film, the story would not become diluted in any way. If you have not seen Gladiator, you should go buy it at a F.Y.E or Moviestop location (it's very cheap now) and if you have seen it then I'm sure you agree with me and if you have seen it and don't agree with me, whatever, but you're absolutely wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a movie! Just epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the few movies that I watched more than once. The plot, the acting and the direction was just epic. The conspiracy, politics and realistic fight scenes add to the quality of viewing. Especially hats off to Joaquin, who played Commodus. I personally felt that it was unfair that Joaquin didn't get an Oscar for this performance while Crowe got it. I felt that Joaquin performed as good if not better than Crowe and it was his character that made the movie more interesting. The only problem I saw with this movie was that the plot has been stretched to 150 minutes while it could have been fitted into 125-130 minutes. But this is too minor a flaw to reduce my rating.I would highly recommend this movie. If you have not watched it before, watch it now. It will blow your mind</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: This review may contain spoilersRidley Scott shapes the decade with this masterpiece.It is very rare to find a movie, which is this complete like Gladiator. Russell Crowe is embodying the Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius like he was born for this role. While watching the movie, you can feel the striking and courageous personality of the Spaniard, like they call him in the movie. Joaquin Phoenix was the most perfect antagonist they could've taken for. His underhand and egoistic character made the spectator hating him as the role of Commodus - thats why he was nominated as best actor in a supporting role at 2001 Oscars. When a Roman general is betrayed and his family murdered by an emperor's corrupt son, he comes to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge. This sentence was written by IMDb and in my opinion I can approve this! If you want to watch a complete movie, where music, scene play, script and pretty everything is important - then watch Gladiator that has been distinguished with 5 Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The new standard for sword-and-sandal epics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being somewhat of a history buff, I've always loved historical movies. My only gripe was that up to the 1990s none of those movies really managed to convey a sense of authenticity. The sets, the costumes, the hairstyles, the battles ? everything was too polished, too artificial. I think it was with movies like Dances with Wolves (Kevin Costner, 1990), Braveheart (Mel Gibson, 1995), Saving Private Ryan (Steven Spielberg, 1998) and The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (Luc Besson, 1999) that things finally started to change, and historical films moved towards a more realistic depiction of the various eras ? not necessarily in terms of historical facts but the feel. But one thing was still missing: a similar movie set in ancient times, that would reinvigorate the sword-and-sandal genre by matching the epic visuals of Ben-Hur with the new, grittier and more believable look and feel.Ridley Scott's Gladiator, a wonderfully written, timeless revenge story with gripping performances from Russell Crowe, Richard Harris, and Oliver Reed (plus Joaquin Phoenix, Djimon Hounsou &amp; Connie Nielsen), and accompanied by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's trend-setting, haunting score, was that movie. It truly revived the genre and was quickly followed by a string of similar movies (out of which, unfortunately, only one - Wolfgang Petersen's Troy ? measured up to the high standard set by Gladiator). It doesn't really matter that Ridley Scott's movie is full of inaccuracies. It's thrilling, it's heartbreaking, it feels real. I have seen it countless times and it never gets boring.Note: The extended cut is even better than the theatrical version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be my favourite movie of all time. It's a classic. Russell Crowe's performance is out of this world and the award for best actor in that years Oscar was well deserved. He played the roll of a lifetime. What always fascinated me about going to watch this movie was I never watched one single trailer prior to going but was gripped from the beginning The other character's are also extremely strong and the storyline and pathway the film takes isn't something that hasn't seen before but certainly is moving and believable There isn't a great film without great music and Han Zimmer's score in this is arguably his greatest work. The theme and variations are so strong and the attention to detail of the style that was necessary for that period is fantastic. It's been 16 years since it came out and still has the same edge about it and that is the mark of a great film. You would happily watch it over and over.</fullReview>

One big disappointment was the language. Before i watched this movie, i watched Narcos with its authentic Spanish, Braveheart with this awesome Scottish Accent and Inglourious Basterds with Brad Pitt and his cool Tennessee Accent. I don't want to say that the whole movie should have been in Latin, but this American English destroyed the whole atmosphere. I would not say it's a shitty movie, but in my opinion it doesn't deserve an eight-point-five score.</fullReview>

I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best. Simple as that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start off by declaring that, IMO, this is the best film I've ever seen. Why? Well, the reasons are many. First up, the acting is superb. All the major players put in excellent turns, as do the bit-part actors. Russell Crowe will never inhabit another character the way he does Maximus. He looks like he was born to play this part. He presents us a man with immense charisma, authority, bravery, honour and dignity. A man prepared to die for what is right. Joaquin Phoenix gives us an emperor, Commodus, that is entirely credible: one minute, he's reasonable and lucid, the next, he is psychotic. Oliver Reed, in his final role, is an excellent lanista (director of a gladiator school). Connie Nielsen, as Commodus' sister and would-be lover of Maximus, has to run the gauntlet of Commodus' psychotic behaviour to preserve her's and her son's lives. All in all, top notch acting all-round. They're given a great story and script to work with, too.The cinematography is magnificent. The colours the dust, great camera angles, judicious cutting around scenes. It works to create intense images that place the actors firmly in the forefront. The digital recreation of roses is amazing and you have to look very hard to detect the digital effects. Ridley Scott has produced one of his greatest directing achievements.Finally, the music, from Hans Zimmer, is magnificent. It supports the action and moods of the scenes expertly, without ever intruding too much, which is the mark, IMO, of a great score and soundtrack.If you have not seen this movie, or bought the Blu-Ray, I have only one question: why not? This is a MUST WATCH movie. Simple as that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good film with an opening battle scene that is incredible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loved this movie but the best sequence was at the beginning when the disciplined, methodical, Roman Army slaughtered a disorganized German horde in a filmed battle sequence with no equal other than perhaps the storming of Normandy beach from Spielberg's movie Saving Private Ryan! Tactics will beat brute force every time! The emperor overseeing this slaughter was Marcus Aurelius who was the last of the adoptive emperors, also referred to as the 'Good Emperors'. It started with Nerva, who adopted Trajan, who in turn adopted Hadrian, who was followed by Antoninus Pius who in turn was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius. During their rule there was a considerable expansion of the Roman empire, from northern Britain to Dacia and to Arabia and Mesopotamia, followed by a consolidation and an attempt to perfect the empire's defenses (e.g. Hadrian's Wall in Britain). This all started to unravel under Commodus (son of Marcus Aurelius). The period of the adoptive emperors started with the assassination of a horrible emperor (Domitian) and ended with another horrible emperor (Commodus who also was assassinated). This is all historical fact and that's the end of the movie's factual content everything else is just fiction! But enjoyable fiction with the formulaic mistake of turning the main protagonist into something of a superhero and that's why it isn't getting a 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of my absolute favorites. I loved Maximus, Commodus, and Lucilla. The plot was perfect, the violence appropriate for those times. I think that the character, "Commodus" was one we absolutely loved to hate. But, he was weak, and really only wanted to love, and be loved. I loved the fighting scenes, so realistic. Cicero was another one of my favorite characters. Always faithful to Maximus to the very end. He set things in motion for Maximus, when he contacted Lucilla. She paid him and thanked him. I think she loved Maximus, but it was not clear that they could actually be together, if he lived. Which brings me to the only part of the movie i would've changed. Maximus, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife;who will have his vengeance in this world or the next, should have lived.I rated it 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hard to believe Gladiator is 15 years old now, such a fantastic movie that will never go out of style. Super fun watching this again, it's just the classic sword &amp; sandal flick, epic on all counts and the type of movie that stays with you for days afterwards. Admittedly the story was also a bit draggy in parts, its almost 3 hours long and at times I was confused as to where it was taking place Morocco? but the location issue is just me.Russell Crowe is Oscar worthy as he embodies Maximus. Perfect as the strong and silent leader, the type of character you feel for and can't help but cheer along especially as he's squaring off against the awesomely crazy &amp; creepy Joaquin Phoenix "You will love me and bear me a pure heir" -spoken to his sister. Phoenix was just amazing.Of course the battle scenes are awesome; exciting, bloody and epic, starting in Germany with Russell as a Roman general leading his men into battle. He soon arouses the rage of the emperors jealous and bloodthirsty son when it becomes known that Maximus is to be the successor. A bit of murder happens then with Maximus finding himself a widower, beaten, enslaved and forced to become a gladiator. The final battle goes down at the Coliseum in Rome with an ending that I thought was perfect "Am I not merciful?" Really beautiful music here too, and a top notch extended cast including a SOA sighting from one Tommy Flanagan. Yes Maximus, I was entertained. 4/14/15</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A summer blockbuster with a novel twist...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summer blockbusters are creatures of their own, aiming to cater to and exploit our lowest desires. Ridley perfectly understands this and consciously tries to redefine them when he gets a chance. Unlike many others, he knows what he is doing and approaches the matter with care instead of force. This works only because of him.We have a movie about a spectacle, in which we and the mob are one and the same. It's cynical as it bashes the industry and us, yet hopeful with its vision for the future. The visual style is novel and somewhat counterintuitive. Typically, one would expect huge cinematic battles, filled with bloodshed, as well as a very architecturally dimensional Rome, filled with pride of its history. Here, these are handed very differently, casually placed in the background. We imagine and deduce them from the eyes of the characters - very subtle, especially for a summer blockbuster. Instead, the focus here is on emotion and tension. Tension between a "cheap entertainment thrill" and "strength and honor". Judging by how successful this was, new endeavors should learn from it, as it shows that the audience expects something more. Crowe is utilized well here. Some of his scenes with Joaquin carry and project that tension for us to feed on.4/5 - Worth a watch. We've started to demand much more after this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being honest, I was never intended to see Gladiator, thinking it just wasn't my type of film, more of a 'boys action movie'. How wrong was I! Being bored last night, it was on TV so I thought I might as well see what everyone was raving about. As with other epics like it (Braveheart, The Last Samurai), I was on the edge of my seat, eyes glued to the screen.I thought the characters were well written - the complete opposites of the strength and courage of Maximus against Commodus's pathetic coward of an emporer. Some of the lines between them have to be amongst the best ever - the 'father to a murdered son...' and 'smile for me now brother' They bring a tear to my eye (and only braveheart and titanic have also done)Commodus is such a self-indulgent coward, you just have to hate him, and Maximus is a real hero. Their climatic fight is brilliant, I didn't know which way it would go, considering commodus has just stabbed his opponent. The ending was sad, but I felt it was fitting with the film, and I was glad when I seen Commodus about to die, realising he never would win over the crowd.I would recommend this film to everyone, its constantly interesting, has some amazing scenes and dialogue. And most of all, I think I will enjoy it even more on my second viewing. I'm going to buy the DVD very soon!</fullReview>

I think Russell Crowe did a good job and Joaquin Phonix did a good job. This movie great acting, great writing, great cinematography, great sets and great costumes. This movie had great battle sequences. This film won an Oscar for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, and Best Visual Effects. It got nominated for Best Supporting Actor - Joaquin Phonix, Best Art Direction - Arthur Max, Best Original Score - Hans Zimmer and Best Cinematography - John Mathison. I like other Ridley Scott films including Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma &amp; Louise and Black Hawk Down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Six Years Later and Still the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Gladiator' was the movie that proved that sword-and-sandal epics were still economically viable, leading the way for 'Troy', 'Alexander', and 'Kingdom of Heaven'. It remains the best of the bunch, a near miracle considering that half of it was written well into production and one of the leads (Oliver Reed) died half way through filming.The screenplay displays none of the usual problems usually associated with multiple writers and battling egos. It is structurally sound, admirably balancing action with drama, and the characters are all well rounded, complex and believable. Scott proves once again that he is one of the best director's around when it comes to 'action with a heart', and his vision of 2nd century Roman Europe is beautifully extended by flawless CGI that achieves exactly what it should while never drawing attention to itself. Arthur Max and Janty Yates, regular Scott collaborators, do an excellent job of bringing a warts-and-all grittiness and realism to the movie. Though the designs aren't that authentic (Imperial interiors were rarely all-black!), they play a large part in ridding the genre of the traditional toga-party kitsch.The leads are excellent. It's to be expected that Richard Harris and Derek Jacobi can do this stuff in their sleep, and Djimon Hounsou has been playing the same role of proud and stoic nobility, albeit very well, ever since 'Amistad'. But Joaquin Pheonix, in his first real adult role, somehow manages to make a sympathetic character out of what amounts to a murdering, incestuous sociopath, and with all due respect to Benecio del Toro, the Oscar that year should have belonged to Pheonix. Russell Crowe, for all his off-screen nonsense, is able to consistently deliver such natural performances that he completely inhabits his characters and was fully deserving of his Oscar win.'Gladiator' is an excellent movie ? a textbook example of how these kinds of movies SHOULD be done. It's a shame that the subsequent sword-and-sandal movies haven't come close to the quality of this movie. 'Gladiator' remains the benchmark and it will be a long time before it is surpassed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie was really great because the story line was really emotional and believable. The locations for the filming were impeccable. The acting and actors were astounding. This movie had it all drama, action, romance, comedy. A must see movie. This is the kind of movie that anyone (except young children) could enjoy. With all the fighting and gore, it would attract the males. With the love and romance and all the things Maximus does for love and family it would attract the females. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 because it is just so awesome. I highly recommend anyone go see this one of a kind movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A return to epic film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I checked out the latest Top 250,I couldn't quite believe that 'Gladiator' was only ranked at No.138.It just had to be higher,especially when you consider some of the movies that are above it.I thought it would be top 20 at the very least.Why is it so low?Beats me,it truly does.This is a film that scores in every department.Great cinematography,fine acting,excellent story and genuine emotion.It is a film that has gone on to influence several films since and I dare say that a few movies wouldn't have even got made if it hadn't been for the success of this stirring adventure movie.As stated,the acting is fine throughout with Joaquin Phoenix,Connie Nielsen,Oliver Reed and Richard Harris all impressive.But this film belongs to Russell Crowe who gives a powerful performance full of compassion and turmoil.I saw a recent poll that listed the most undeserved Oscar winners and Russell Crowe came top for this performance.Now that is totally pathetic and people obviously voted for the personality and not the actor.You know and I know that there have been many other performances in recent years that have won the coveted Oscar and shouldn't have.Crowe deserved his award without any shadow of a doubt and it his role of Maximus for which he will be remembered,a fact that would probably bug the hell out of him.This film is gripping from start to finish and is one of the finest releases of recent years.No,it isn't perfect.There are too many gaffes for that.The guy wearing jeans,the gas cylinders on the chariots and the headrest for Maximus' death scene(just look at the long shot!!).But it is a cracking movie of a type so rarely seen recently.I know that it is in my top 10 movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a shame Cecil B. DeMille is no longer with us. If he were alive today he would be gratified to see that the type of movies he loved to make are popular again: "Gladiator," "Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl" and "The Passion of the Christ" are all the kinds of movies DeMille made; all of them are movies he would have made if the screenplays had been around in his day. "Gladiator" is a gloriously retro sword-and-sandal epic, a cross-pollination of "Spartacus," "Ben Hur," and "The Fall of the Roman Empire"; director Ridley Scott uses modern CGI technology to make the kind of movie they don't make any more. Although not 100% historically accurate, it's irresistible drama. Russell Crowe is one of the few actors today who can pull off this kind of heroic role; he has the gravitas despite his bad-boy reputation in real life that blond pretty boys like Brad Pitt and Colin Farrell can never hope to approach. Connie Nielsen is a sensuous presence as Lucilla; River Phoenix as Commodus is the creepiest villain since Ralph Fiennes' Amos Goetz in "Schindler's List"; and the supporting cast is full of stand out performances. It's good to see "I Claudius"'s Derek Jacobi back in toga; what's an epic without Richard Harris? and of course Oliver Reed as the lovably irascible slave-trader Proximo, who proves not to be such a bad guy after all. The film completely ignores the persecution of Christians under the otherwise humane Marcus Aurelius; but then, "Pirates of the Caribbean" ignores the presence of slavery in the eighteenth-century West Indies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..the whole movie was wonderful..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely agree with every favorable comment written here. I can find no fault with David Frazoni's story nor Ridley Scott's direction. The cinematography was amazing and colorful; I did not find the CGIs to be intrusive. That the entire production involved so many thousands of people is a testament to filmmakers' ability to produce beautiful, thoroughly enjoyable movies, eve today. "The Gladiator" serves them all up in a gorgeous heap.Mention "gladiator" and "Rome" and a whole plot comes to mind, but this one certainly combines the necessity of bloodshed, gentility and nobility with action in one grand epic. It is sufficiently historically accurate, but it really IS the story which is the "star" in this film. Although all of them gave magnificent performances, it isn't necessary to list all of the cast here. I've read eleven pages of the huge total; I'm sure other readers will read some of them, too. It is, however, irreverent not to praise "bad-boy" Russell Crowe doing his act here so eloquently, with principled reverence. Truly, Bravo! Mr. Crowe. AND - an early exposure to Djimon Hounsu in a good role.With the polyglot that Rome was, one should not be surprised to find a contradiction to "chris_j_albanese", who says (I think) there was no homosexuality in "The Gladiator". "Chris" must have missed the scene when Roman guards come to the senator's home to drag him off to jail, with the senator shoo-ing his "painted" companion away.....When I tried to re-wind my VHS-cassette - a home-made gift from a friend - it wouldn't. Therefore, I'll be buying the wonderful DVD in the near future, so that I can continue to put-in a lot of time watching this movie, just as I've been doing for about four years. I consider it to be the best of this genre. It must sound rather like a broken record, but I thank every technician who did anything to bring this gem to the screen. It's good for every emotion - an easy 30....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is an extraordinary film because it is very spectacular and, at the same time, powerful, intense, vibrant, with a remarkable introspective analysis and representation.It also gives people a positive and edifying message. This film is accompanied by a splendid sound track, sometimes strong and intense, sometimes passionate and touching, that increase its value. Some passages of this sound track remind the music of Beethoven. In my opinion the film deserved more than five Oscars. In fact given that Gladiator in a very painstaking job, it should have deserved many more Oscars. For example I think that Gladiator is more exciting than Ben Hur which got eleven Oscars. Then I was very much disappointed that a a master as Ridley Scott, one of the best directors of the world, didn't win the Oscar. It's unfair that masters as Alfred Hitchcock or Stanley Kubrik have never won an Oscar. Every time I watch again the film I always think that it should have been still more memorable with the participation of Marlon Brando, who should have been perfect for the spirit and the style of the film. He should have been an unforgettable old roman senator. As a matter of fact in my life I have never seen an actor so able to express power, intensity, passion, magnetism, charisma. Just the characteristics of an important ancient roman personality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Gladiator 2000 was one the finest movies of it's kind. Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar and I think that Phoenix should have received the best supporting actor Oscar. The battles, the intensity, the overall rawness of this movie is right up there with Ben Hur, Sparticus or any other movie of it's kind. When ever I want to sit down and watch a great movie I'll watch Gladiator. Cinematography is excellent. I can't actually find any fault with this movie. Phoenix was so great and so genuine as an evil ruler you want to go through the screen and choke him to death. All the fight scenes with gladiators against gladiators, and gladiators against with the tiger was outstanding. The friendship of the gladiators waiting for there turn to live or die in the arena's was also a big part of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The General who became a Slave. The Slave who became a Gladiator. The Gladiator who defied an EmpireDear Readers,Most of us know the man known as Ridley Scott. He's directed many popular films such as Alien, Blade Runner, Legend, Black Rain, G.I. Jane, 1492: The Conquest of Paradise, Black Hawk Down, and Kingdom of Heaven. His most well-known film is Gladiator, one of the greatest epics ever made.The tagline I posted up above basically describes the movie. Maximus, an extremely popular Spanish General in the Roman army, has finished a successful campaign through Germania in the name of Emperor Marcus Aurlieus. Marcus's son, Commodus, discovers that Maximus is to be made Emperor instead of him and in rage kills Marcus and blames Maximus. Maximus escapes his execution in a spectacular scene and rushes to save his family. He is too late and arrives to find that his wife and son have been burned and Crucified. Maximus is then captured and sold into slavery to a Gladiator trainer named Proximo, who was once one of the best Gladiators of Rome. Maximus learns he can win his freedom and plots to kill Commodus. Finally arriving in Rome, Maximus begins to inspire the people of Rome to follow him instead of Commodus until Commodus challenges Maximus to a final (And Spectacular) duel in the Coliseum.Gladiator is Ridley's most violent film, even more so than Alien, Kingdom of Heaven, and Black Hawk Down. It's also his finest, second only to his Crusade Masterpiece: Kingdom of Heaven. The opening battle sequence is breath-taking and perfect for any fan of Lord of the Rings while the Gladiator scenes will have you rooting along with the crowd for Maximus. What really makes this movie work are three things: Ridley Scott's direction, The Acting, and Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard's incredible score. Ridley weaves a masterful tale of revenge and honor filled with incredible fight scenes and battles. Russell Crowe is unforgettable as Maximus while Joaquin Phoenix is twisted and deranged as Commodus. My favorite part of the film (Aside from the battles, of course) is the music by the greatest composer of all time: Hans Zimmer! Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard team up and create an amazingly epic and beautiful score that is truly unforgettable. From its haunting opening music to the grand battle theme to the beautiful song 'Now we are Free', the score of Gladiator is pure genius.Signed, The Constant DVD CollectorParental Warning: This is not a film for kids. The graphic fights and battles aside, the Character Commodus has a twisted obsession with his sister which sends shivers down your spine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of my absolute favorites. I loved Maximus, Commodus, and Lucilla. The plot was perfect, the violence appropriate for those times. I think that the character, "Commodus" was one we absolutely loved to hate. But, he was weak, and really only wanted to love, and be loved. I loved the fighting scenes, so realistic. Cicero was another one of my favorite characters. Always faithful to Maximus to the very end. He set things in motion for Maximus, when he contacted Lucilla. She paid him and thanked him. I think she loved Maximus, but it was not clear that they could actually be together, if he lived. Which brings me to the only part of the movie i would've changed. Maximus, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife;who will have his vengeance in this world or the next, should have lived.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A marvellous comeback of the roman era movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is an extraordinary classic film. Its one of those that will be watched and talked about 50 years from now. Maximus is a Roman general who is framed and betrayed. He ends up as a gladiator fighting in the great Colosseum. The whole story is about the fall and rise of the hero, an honourable man who is motivated by a thirst for revenge and a promise he once gave to the emperor. I remember when I was in school reading about the element of adventure in Greek plays. Adventure is : "the change from happiness to misery or the opposite". If this is right then this movie is one of the most adventurous movies ever made because it is based on this description. About the movie now, the acting was breathtaking by everyone, the directing was amazing giving the film a live, fast action character. The battle at the start of the film was exceptionally good in therms of realistic features, sound effects and especially music. Later on the graphics used to recreate the Colosseum were the greatest I had seen until that time.Cannot be missed</fullReview>

Gladiator's writing, direction, and cinematography are all fabulous. The film contains wonderful and subtle political and social commentary.

Also, "Gladiator" is laced with great scenery including the Roman coliseum and enriched with the history of Roman culture. Watching this movie was an experience I will never forget because it is like watching history come alive. The film is rich in history, the writers made it fun to watch because we learned about the Roman coliseum, gladiators and life in Rome."Gladiator" is an energetic, action packed, drama filled thrill ride which will excite everyone. Two other movies came to mind when I was watching this film; "The Patriot" and "Braveheart" were very similar to "Gladiator" because they all contain unique action sequences, will become classics and all star actors in Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe, who have become major players in Hollywood. "Gladiator" may not be the best movie, but it will win over the hearts of viewers when they rent it at their local video stores. I can't wait to let everyone know "Gladiator" has become one of my favorite films. I hope everyone will enjoy it as I did. "Gladiator" is rich in history and is a masterpiece with all the trimmings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is an underrated movie to say the least. It should be on the top 10, and in my book it's at position 1. People tend to think it's bad because it's not 100% historically accurate. Guess what, it's not a documentary, it shouldn't be judged as one.The dialogue is strong and the story is the one we all love, and it plays out without flaw in Gladiator. The movie sets a new standard for the definition of epic. If you watch Spartacus or Ben-Hur after Gladiator, you notice how plain and un-epic those movies are in comparison. All the actors performed flawlessly, especially Joaquin Phoenix (should have won an Oscar) and Connie Nielsen, I love the "Am I not merciful" scene, so much emotion with so few words. No single actor could be replaced to make this a better movie, it was a perfect cast.The musical score is magnificent, it's so in sync with the action and the emotions on the screen, and so majestically epic, it's in itself destined to become a classic. Too bad Hans Zimmer was robbed of the Oscar.The scenery is phenomenal, the landscapes are perfect, the CGI is top notch. You can FEEL the grandness of Rome. Splendid use of light and color in every single scene. I especially like the scene where Commodus and Maximus are elevated on to the arena, protected by a tortus formation of praetorian guards.Are you not entertained? ARE you not entertained? YES, yes we ARE. Maximus, Maximus, Maximus, Maximus...10/10 - A classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator ReviewMESSAGE TO READERS: THIS REVIEW IS WRITTEN FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE FILM. IT CONTAINS A SPOILER. PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END OF THIS FILM OR IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN GLADIATOR.I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE YOU TO WATCH GLADIATOR FIRST, IT IS WELL WORTH IT.BackgroundGladiator is based solely on one man, General Maximus Decimus Meridius. He seeks revenge when his wife and children are brutally murdered and the emperor whom he loves and looks up to like his father is killed by a jealous and power-greedy son who unlike Maximus does not share the same faith and love for Rome as his father.Commodus and Maximus, as one would normally expect, are greatest enemies, and it is Commodus' dream to get rid of Maximus and control Rome to his pleasure. It is Maximus' role, therefore, to take avenge the lives of his loved ones and defy the emperor, fulfil the promise he made to Emperor Marcus Aurelius and save Rome before it is too late.The Cast Director - Ridley Scott Maximus - Russell Crowe Commudus Aurelius - Joaquin Phoenix Marcus Aurelius - Richard Harris Proximo - Oliver Reed Lucilla - Connie Nielsen Senator Gracchus - Derek JacobiAnalysis There are several themes that are brought up in Gladiator including masculinity, importance of family, love of country and the afterlife. It is a Roman epic set in 72AD. The tone of the film is very serious and we can tell this from the beginning scene when the camera opens up on Maximus propping himself up on his sword as one who is weary from battle. The pace of the film is quite slow, but this works quite well because it allows the audience to realize the seriousness of the film as well as being able to understand the message of the film. The most striking feature of Gladiator is the superbly digitally recreated background of Rome. The Costumes are very well suited to the characters wearing them. Ironically however, Commodus who is more heavily armed than Maximus is the one who is defeated first in the final battle. Ridley Scott has often been criticized for not being able to produce good quality movies and, with the exception of Blade Runner (produced in 1982) and Hannibal (Produced in 2001), this is true but now he is able to silence all his critics in this miraculously well directed and produced film.All the actors in this film were well selected but special credit goes to Joaquin Phoenix, who played his character, Commodus Aurelius superbly. Although being much more inexperienced than other actors on the set, he plays his incestuous and power greedy character with great style.The film is mainly aimed at youths and adults from the age of 15 onwards. Those any younger than this may not be able to understand the messages of the film and consequently unable to enjoy the film to the maximum.*Although the outcome of the film was first-rate, there were several hurdles which the actors and directors working on set had to overcome.On the whole, Gladiator is an excellent and beautifully designed film. From beginning to end it is completely awe inspiring, supported by an excellent script, special affects and cinematography. A definite 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this movie so bad when i saw the previews but i didn't see it until it came out on video. This is one of my all time favorite movies. I didn't even know who Russell Crowe was before I saw this. Now he is one of my favorite actors. His performance is beyond great, there are no words to describe it. The entire movie is just so good, there are no cheesy or stupid scenes. it's a movie anyone can love and EVERYONE should see. And the battle scenes are really good. They are gory, but if you saw The Patriot with Mel Gibson and was okay, you'll be fine in this movie. I don't want to say much about the plot of the story because it is just so good and everyone has to see it for themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very hesitant to watch this movie based on the commercials. I thought it would be a boring movie about a guy fighting lions. But, the movie is great!!! It combines an action movie with a love story (love of country). It definitely ranks in my top 10 of all time. Honestly, this is one of the few movies EVER that made me cry. Great plot, excellent acting and wonderful script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****Starring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielson.A Roman general becomes a slave when he is betrayed. His wife and son were brutally murdered by the prince. But when the slave becomes a gladiator, he fights his way to get to the prince.The battle sequences, in my opinion, were breathtaking. Especially the fight between all the slaves and the other fighters. This movie is quite bloody (That black arrow lady bit the big one), so you better not eat much before you see this. This film is one of the greatest of all time, and it deserved every award it won.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like the trend modern movies are taking. Simply put, they kill everyone the main character knows, and that forces him into action that will force him to action that involves killing all the bad guys. Normal antagonists aren't enough anymore, the bad guys must be literal psychos. It's depressing. This movie handles things a bit differently. The main character actually remembers his wife and kid throughout the entire movie. Sorry, no more spoilers. In any case, I like the camera movement during the large action scenes as it helps to simulate the chaotic action experienced during action scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exceptional viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact that what we saw are Historical Fiction (Marcus Aurilious died from the flu, Maximus Desimus Meridious only existed as Aelious Maximus and HE did not kill commodus in the arena), this film had the great support of Ridley Scott's exceptional story telling and offcourse the great casting. Russell Crowe won the Oscar, in my opinion, on the opening scene and when he found his family dead. The Shorow scene must be classified as one of the most touching and emotional moments ever seen. Commodus was exceptional as well as all the other supporting actors. The music of the film is a clasical masterpiece. One of the finest orchestrations, despite the fact that many sounds were "known" to the experienced audience. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerard (from The Dead Can Dance) completed a fully tensioned and emotional soundrack. The screenplay based on a historical fantasy idea had some gaps but the dialoges between the characters were very good like the one in the end of the movie between Gladator and Commodus: Glad: I had a friend once who said to me, when death smiles at you the only thing you can do is to smile back at him Commo: And what did your friend do when he died? Dlad: You should know, he was your father. Now to the directing of Ridley Scott. He is a very talanted director who knows in perfection what it means to create vision out of a text. Even in Hanniball his directing was strong, solid and thick. Here in Gladiator he shows as a perfect age illustration, he uses all the means (camera music photography) at their extremes in order to create a solid appearence of his film. The usage of visuall effects are effective. The best part of his job is the characters. Everyone that appeared there did everything with a reason based on real or close to real people. He used historical reports and evoluted them to solid 3 dimensional people. The character of Maximus was not the "ancient Rambo", he cries, smiles, crashes, fights, supports, beleive like a man who may live round as. Marcus Aurilious was perfect, you respected him only by the colour of his voice and the tension on his face. Commodus was the most common "bad" person but he was presented to each extremes. The movie is one of the best and one of my favorite amd it asure as that Ridley Scott will continue to offer us pleasure in the Dark room.He did great work so many years (ALIEN, Bladerunner, Thelma and Luise, 1492, Black Hawk Down). As Greek I would like to see by him the epic of Omer, Iliada. Hope he does it some day</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are great films and then there is GLADIATOR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It saddens me that a man such as Ridley Scott can work for months on location bringing the most perceptive and detailed vision of ancient Rome to absolute reality, only to incur the inappropriate, juvenile and one dimensional comments such that I have read here - the following few "reviews" (and I use the term 'loosely') especially. Comments such as "horrible movie," "no interesting characters," "bad acting" and my personal favorite, "crappy special effects," is a sad epitaph to the lack of awareness and utter stupidity of so many viewers.GLADIATOR is one of the finest movies ever made, I don't "think" it, I am telling you! Ridley Scott pulled off a jaw-dropping miracle reeling the finished product in at just on $60 million. It has the appearance, continuity and professional veneer of a $300 million production. It is in fact only an adaptation on Samuel Bronston's classic 1964 movie THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, itself the most literate and well-acted epic of the 50's and 60's...and again, the key figure of Marcus Aurelius is handled with such dignity, feeling and intelligence. In 1964 Sir Alec Guinness played Aurelius as a strong and clear-thinking man of moral strength and fortitude. In GLADIATOR, Richard Harris hands in what I consider his best role ever, portraying Aurelius as a political visionary, caring parent and incorruptible leader. Excellent though Russell Crowe is here, it is Ridley Scott makes the film what it is, together with the cinematography and enervating musical score. Russell has actually not that great a dialog overload! In the acting department, Phoenix blows him off the screen as the immoral, aggrieved and ultimately weak emperor in waiting. Oliver Reed as Proximo? Well, how he did not win best supporting actor posthumously I will never know. This is the greatest Oscar scandal in history as far as I am concerned. It was the role of his life and he took it in both hands and wrung his life out into the part....completely it would seem. He died as he would have wished, tanked and slipping off a bar stool in Malta towards the end of filming. But he gave us an unforgettable Proximo and I will long honor his name with the memory of what he did here.Crappy special effects huh? Well, in the film I saw - I was looking at the COLOSSEUM, not a special effect. I was there with them. I have never seen any CGI effect come close to what these techos achieved. Can you believe there were no more than 48 people ever on set? The "crowds" were made up of the same 48 people wearing different clothes and "matted" together - you want to tell me it "looked" like that? The arena action certainly was a far cry from the "Chariot Race" in BEN HUR but there again, what isn't? It was still exciting stuff though, well for the vaguely cerebral set I hasten to add.A film like GLADIATOR comes along probably once every 40 years or so. Its a pity so many didn't notice it THIS time around. Still, you are probably outnumbered three to one.</fullReview>

From the very first shot in the wheat to the last shot, Gladiator has a visual power which hasn't been experienced for quite some time.

		<fullReview>...the standard Sword 'n Sandal epic. Russell Crowe propels this film in a tour de force of a performance, ably supported by a solid supporting cast. Even the often appalling Oliver Reed does good work in his last film. Ridley Scott directs this film with a deft touch, heavy where he needs to be, violent and brutal, but not gratuitous, and with a good eye for the spectacular.The plot stretches credibility in the latter half and I for one feel that Maximus' identity was exposed to the evil Commodus just a bit too early on. Commodus - what a villain, played with just a touch of camp by Joaquin Phoenix. Swarthy, oily, murderous, cowardly, lusting disgustingly after his own sister, what other name could one give such a character than a Latinised word for "toilet". One of the most repulsive creations ever put on celluloid by an actor. Can't blame him though, there had to be something substantial to match Crowe's massive screen presence. Bloody good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular in every way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, when I saw the trailer, I thought it was another crap period movie; I didn't like period dramas a lot back then. But after I became a fan of Joaquin Phoenix's, I watched it on a VCD, 5 months after it was released in the theatre. And I truly could not understand why the trailer turned me off so much. Besides Joaquin's brilliant and Oscar-robbed performance as Commodus, Gladiator has all the right ingredients of a spectacular epic, beginning with the opening battle scene. I firmly believe that it is filmed "shaky" to convey the confusion and madness in a battle, and not because the guy behind the camera didn't know how to use one. Yes, it contains blood and gore and all that jazz, but do not forget it's a movie about gladiators. Gladiators back then did not sit around, drinking tea and eating sandwiches; they did almost exactly what was depicted in the fights scenes in the film. How else were the film-makers to portray the violence of gladiator fights than to include it in the movie?Another good thing about "Gladiator" is that its villain is very much 3-dimensional. I am a big fan of Joaquin Phoenix, and I strongly believe he deserved that Best Supporting Actor Oscar no matter what people say. How often do you get a villain in an action movie who isn't portrayed as entirely bad? Phoenix played Commodus not as a mere villain, but as a spoiled child whose intense search for love drove him to commit deeds he'd later regret (as seen in one of the deleted scenes in the DVD). He gave Commodus a depth that isn't found in most action-movie villain (for example the bad guy in "Kiss of the Dragon"), and drove the audience into grudging sympathy mixed with loathe. For that alone, he deserves the Oscar.Connie Nielson also deserved some sort of recognition for her underrated performance as Lucilla. She handled her role with great dignity and care; her confliction between her love for her brother that's slowly fading and her duty towards her country is very clearly put across, giving Lucilla the conviction that is certainly needed.Gladiator also has a magnificent score that is, again, Oscar-worthy. The music gives the picture the extra push that sends emotions into overdrive, particularly the **spoiler** Patricide scene, the opening battle scene and the very last scene. The special effects were ASTOUNDING! Just take a look at the Colosseum! Perhaps I'm over-sensitive, but I felt like I was being transported right back to that period."Gladiator" is certainly meant to be seen on the big screen. Due to its second release, I had a chance to do just that. And what an experience. Contrary to what some has said, "Gladiator" WILL be remembered some ten years from now, simply because it's an epic film about the Roman empire. And a spectacular one at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real inspiring,beautiful and magical film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched the film 'Gladiator' last year at home with my parents. Foolishly I didnt go to the movies to watch it, but my parents rented it out and as they had already seen and thought it was a 'must see' , me and my younger brother trusted their judgement. All i can say is 'WOW'. The film opens with that beautiful eastern-sounding music (Lisa Gerrerd) and from that moment I knew that this film was going to be unlike anything id seen before.The actual story is so wonderful and the director (Ridley Scott) and talented actors (Russell Crowe to name but one) make this film magical and definatly one that you won't forget in a hurry. I remember thinking to myself during the film 'Oh my god! this film is fantastic'. The ending is a guaranteed tear jerker, and i felt that lump in the back of my throat and knew that in a couple of seconds id feel my eyes filling up! Ive since bought the Film on video (watching it whenever i can!)I think I know each characters complete script!! I also purchased both the Gladiator soundtracks because me and my dad fell in love with the music! I love the way that Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer worked together so effectivly,they are definatly names we'll be hearing more of in the future! I enjoy all the tracks, as they all remind me of the movie, and I have listened and watched so many times that I know just from the music , which part of the film im at, and if i watched the film and turned down the volume i bet i could even tell you what music was playing! All i can leave you with is one comment 'Experiance Gladiator' You'll come away smiling,humming the music and Madly in love with the man you know you cannot have 'Russell Crowe'! A tip from me, There are certain situations where playing the soundtracks has been wonderful! 1) On the way to work..turn up the volume of those battle scenes and you'll soon be riding in a chariot rather that your Ford Focus! 2) In the bath, the slow romantic tunes are so magical! and finally 3) Listen to Elysium,Honor Him and Now we are free anywhere anytime and you'll instantly be taken back to ancient rome and that magnificant collisium!Love Caley, 17, southampton england</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a while since we've had a blockbuster live up to the hype. This did, despite there being little hype to speak of originally. Now everyone is talking about it, and with good reason. The cast and crew have turned in a fine film.Crowe is magnificent as the central figure of Maximus. Along with an imposing figure, he brings acting skill to the role when many would have simply been tempted to essay the 'action hero' caricature we've seen many times before. Crowe is wonderfully competent at being both the classic 'hero' type and the man with a bit more depth behind the brawn. This role must surely have taken him to the front ranks of Hollywood's leading men.Many of the other cast members perform extremely well too. Joaquin Phoenix delivers the sort of complex interpretation a figure of history such as Commodus doubtless deserves. No matter how much we may be rooting for Maximus, occasionally we feel sympathetic towards Commodus when he is at his most pitiful. This is a fine balance though, as never is any pity we may feel allowed to overshadow the fact that Commodus can also be spectacularly evil. I shall be watching the career of Phoenix more closely on the evidence of this performance.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Often, the efforts of the actresses go unnoticed in relation to their more high profile male counterparts. Not here, Connie Nielsen is also superb as a quiet heroine who the audience can will to get together with the hero.Oliver Reed is fine in his last role, but it is Richard Harris, who, as a member of the 'old guard', reminds us all that he's been doing this sort of thing effortlessly since Crowe was in nappies (probably...) A bravura performance.Ridley Scott, meanwhile, appears to relish a project of this magnitude. The CGI recreation of the Collosseum is magnificent, but Scott never lets such an impressive element detract from the moments of pure drama to be found in David H. Franzoni's script. Instead, he mixes astonishing set pieces with moments of human interaction seamlessly, creating a thoroughly nourishing and rewarding cinematic experience.Proof that they might just make 'em as good as they used to...?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imperfect, but engaging and entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator strives to be more then a brainless big-budget action movie, in that sense, it deserves credit. The question is, though, does Gladiator actually manage to do this?In a way, yes. The storyline, while fairly linear and lacking a huge amount of complexity, manages to give proper motivation to each character and it flows smoothly. There never is any doubt what a character is doing in any given scene. The characters are even well-defined, which is more than can be said for the vast majority of its ilk.However, Gladiator does have its problems. There is no joy, and little emotion to this movie. Everyone who is in this movie is either vengeful, depressed, angry, or just plain said. It's a rather cold movie, in that way... compared to its fellow Best Picture nominee Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (which exudes warmth and emotion), Gladiator is extremely cold and joyless. While the storyline does do a good job of saying why everyone acts like this, it still doesnt help the fact that the movie is extremely cold. Im not asking for a tacked-on love story, just a little bit more emotion then anger or depression.Still, that aside, the movie does manage to stay entertaining. Some parts dont seem to flow quite well, but, for the most part, it is good. The many facets of what is going on (for example, Commodus' dealings with the Senate) are well represented, and Ridley Scott manages to do a good job of sticking with these topics and dealing with them.Gladiator has its fair share of special effects, and they are very nice. Fitting in with the theme of the movie, however, much of it is filmed in drab earth tones. The early scenes are extremely blue or red, but never in between. Compared to a movie like "Titus" (to be fair, that movie only kinda-sorta takes place in Rome, but I digress), Gladiator is quite dull looking. Still, most of it does fit - the Colosseums look as one would think, as does everything else. But the movie definitely is not vivid, nor beautiful to look at. But it does look nice. A lot of the camerawork is good, but a special point must be made about some battle sequences (both the opening, and some effects used in the gladiator battles). There is just too much herky-jerky effects... enough to distract one from the actual event. In Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan, the camera moved around a lot, to be sure, but at least one still got a good feel for what is going on. With this movie, the cameraman fell so in love with these techniques that he neglected that people would actually want to know whats going on.Still, in spite of these flaws (some more significant then others), Gladiator is a very good movie. It is entertaining (although it does get boring at parts) and it does tell a good tale. However, compared to a movie like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (the two movies do have a lot of similar elements), Gladiator does come out as being the inferior one. But, that doesnt mean it's a bad movie - in fact, its probably worth a spot in a movie fan's collection.</fullReview>

Gladiator tries to be(or imitate) something like Ben Hur and Spartacus but fails in many ways. I agree that the visual effects are amazing, but the score is not a masterpiece and the most important thing-in my idea-the screenplay is too ordinary and has nothing particular and new to present. It seems that the real point of killing Maximus is to make audiences cry.( I couldn't find any other reason to get him killed). But, in some ways the movie is worth watching.

		<shortDescription>Great Special Effects = Not-So-Great Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening sequence is worth the price of admission alone. As a student of Latin History, the CGI quality beats any drawn representation of Ancient Rome, and the Coliseum never looked better. (But why does every CGI landscape artist opt to include a flock of airborne birds? They never look right and almost always distract from the focus of the shot.) Visually, the production team earned their credits and I give them kudos for their costumes, props, and above all, the true-to-life gladiator battles.But all that doesn't make up for the cheese-eater of an ending. Director Ridley Scott has created a legacy of amazing films, most of which are science fiction-based, and maybe that's where Gladiator should be categorized. The script is fairly solid except for one MASSIVE flaw.* SPOILER ALERT *For wanting to create a visually stunning, seat-gripping historical action film, why absolutely discredit the validity of the entire piece by having the most important person in Rome (at any given time) killed in the way chosen. NEVER in the history of Ancient Rome could such a plot occur. To have us believe an emperor of Rome would enter the arena, under any circumstance other than to award the victor, boggles the mind. The film which was great-up-to-now totally unravels at this moment.Post-viewing, three simple alternatives came to mind. One, keep the scope from being so grandiose. Rather, use another general or a politician as the antagonist. At least blur the historical lines by using a lesser-known Emperor, not Marcus Aurelius. Hey, it worked for Caligula. Two, design the story more akin to David Lynch's Dune. The similarities are abundantly present, but maybe that's what opted Scott's direction. Three, and this is my favorite idea, let the hero die WITHOUT "saving the day". After all, the most popular form of theater in Ancient Rome was tragedy.I rated Gladiator at 6. It deserves watching, but has problems too severe to ignore. It begins with heart-pounding action and political intrigue, but ends as heroic-tripe. I'd rather watch The Fall of the Roman Empire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stunning visuals, CGI, and wonderful performances by Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Oliver Reed, and Richard Harrison combine to make this film a delight to experience. My only complaint is that Crowe's "General Maximus" comes off as a bit too much of an innocent for his lofty position as a commander of legions of men. Crowe manages, in spite of this, to make you believe Maximus is a commanding man, a true leader. Ridley Scott certainly cast the best man for the job. Joaquin Phoenix made me emotionally squirm in my seat every time he came on the screen. His depiction of the nearly sociopathic son of the Emperor is a role he is clearly well capable of playing. Richard Harrison is always a delight to see, as is Oliver Reed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although everything under the sun has already been said about this movie, I wish to reiterate what many other reviewers have already commented on. First and foremost, the movie is astoundingly grand and thoroughly enjoyable. More importantly, despite some of the plot's predicatibility, the overall pace of the movie is well-maintained throughout the movie. The acting, Joaquin Phoenix in particular, is terrific for such a blockbuster action-styled movie. For the epic-action genre, this movie hits the mark and more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a stunning, powerful epic that boasts some fantastic visuals, a solid story, deep characters, intense fight sequences, and bravura performances, making it very likely to grab a few Oscar nominations. At the least, it's certainly the most entertaining film of the 2000 summer.Russel Crowe stars as General Maximus, devoted to the glory of Rome and a successful military man. When the dying Emperor decides to appoint Maximus as his successor, scheming prince Commodus (a brilliant Joaquin Phoenix) decides to do whatever it takes to assure he will be the next Caesar. Maximus escapes his clutches, but then returns to Rome as a gladiator and wants to exact revenge upon the evil emperorAs Maximus, Russel Crowe shows he is not only a great actor, but a star: Gladiator virtually secures his stature as a leading man. His performance as Maximus is strong and emotional. Though his acting talent was proven when he played Bud White in Curtis Hanson's atmospheric L.A. Confidential, Gladiator proves he can carry a film as a major star. His character is also not a cardboard cutout and shows depth: the writers, thankfully, don't make Maximus a macho, indestructible killing machine and instead he shows sensitivity, devotion, power, and strength.Thankfully, the writers do not forget the villainous counterpart and also give Emperor Commodus depth , replacing what could be the usual out-and-out tyrant character with a tragic, weak, and ultimately inept ruler. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant as Commodus, in some scenes evoking pity for his character, only to become reviling in the next. While Gladiator can be seen as a star vehicle for Crowe, it can also be seen as a display of the fantastic talent Joaquin Phoenix has. His controlled, calculated performance is effectively cringe-inducing.Director Ridley Scott not only gets great performances from the entire cast, but the visual effects employed are equally stunning. The magnificent views of Rome, the towering, hulking Collosseum, the brutal, striking battles, and intricate costumes all are used to immerse the viewer in the spectacle that was once Rome. While the story may drag a bit in a few places, the overall power is not muted one bit thanks to Scott's masterful helming of this powerful, entertaining film.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this is the best movie you have seen in your lifetime then your life must have been quite short or you do not go often to the pictures !A real effort to make it look historically viable is to be praised but the lack of originality of the plot is to be deplored. RollerBall 25 years ago touched the same subject.The pace of the movie is not too "modern Holywood" and allows you to watch scenes for more than 27 seconds... in other words the movie was perhaps tailored for an audience of spectators over 15... quite rare these days when movie makers are putting into practice the old Roman saying : Panem et Cicences. Nevertheless it lacks the depth of Ben Hur.</fullReview>

Incredibly stylish with computer-generated graphics, it did not look very convincing but-I know it may sound strange-in a way it adds to the intensity of the film, so CG served it's purpose. Who said violence had to look totally realistic?The story and sword-fighting aside, I found the acting is just as good. Russell Crowe delivers the emotions very well...the best I'm-very-p***ed-off-right-now face I've seen! And Joaquin Phoenix also did an excellent job.

		<shortDescription>Best movie this summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why everyone is ragging on the plot; even though it was predictable at times, it was still gripping. I think this is the best movie I've watched the whole year; the visuals are just breathtaking. I haven't seen such beautiful cinematography since What Dreams May Come. George Lucas should ask Ridley Scott for some tips because while the special effects in Gladiator were less flashy, I believed it was real. Compare the computer graphics of the cityscapes of Rome to those in (whatever that city was called) in Phantom Menace. Same technical quality, but the stuff in Gladiator was a work of art. My only disappointment was the first battle scene. . . if I had watched the whole scene without turning away, I would have puked. Am I supposed to feel a rush just because they're pulling the film faster? The opening scene in Saving Private Ryan was by far superior. That had me ducking and wincing, Gladiator's did not. The acting was a bit cliche, on Russell Crowe's and Joaquin Phoenix's part, but so were their characters. I have to say though, I've never seen a better performance by Phoenix. In the scene where he kills his father, when he was giving that little speech about not being loved, I was moved to tears. That has got to be the most emotional scene in the whole movie . . . and a job well-done by Phoenix. Does anyone remember James Dean in East of Eden? Same speech, equally powerful. I wonder if that's where Phoenix got his inspiration. Overall, great movie. Too bad some people are anti-hype, anti-mainstream, because this film is really worthy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right from the start, this film strikes you as special with a scene that, if it is meant as an intro, looks like the finale of most other films. The special effects, although hugely impressive, do not take over the story which is simplistic but powerful. How Roman life was at that time is about as graphically illustrated as you would like to see but in more than a violent manner. The roles, and particularly the actors, especially Russell Crowe, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed, enrich the film to their credit. Altogether, miss this one on the big screen, and you'll never really see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a visual masterpiece, maybe Ridley Scott's best work (and that's saying a LOT). I must admit that I was not that impressed with Joaquin Phoenix at first, but on further review, I realized that he was actually very good... his character is a spoiled simpering evil dude, and he played it to the hilt, with a British accent (because we all know English was the language of Rome, and everyone who was anyone in the Roman empire spoke with a Royal Shakespearean accent). Oliver Reed, Derek Jacoby, and Richard Harris were wonderful of course, as was Djimon Honshou, and then there's Russell Crowe... He is definitely the heart and soul of this film, and if THIS film doesn't get him the respect he's due, then nothing will. And anyone who thought the light saber duel in Star Wars Episode I was impressive (as I did -- my favorite part of that movie) will be completely bowled over by the fight sequences in this film. Very bloody, but very well choreographed and incredibly filmed. AND -- this movie has a heart! The characters are well-developed and the plot (yes, there's a PLOT too!) hinges on the relationships between them, not just on the action. A great movie in all respects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning; effectively revives a grand genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Combining visual elements pioneered in BLADE RUNNER with battle scenes depicted in a way reminiscent of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, director Ridley Scott has successfully revived the long dead genre of movies about ancient Rome. Yes, there have been pathetic, postmodern attempts to cinematically resurrect Rome since the Golden Age of ancient epics of the 50s and early 60s, but none have come close to the historic-artistic integration that Scott has pulled off in GLADIATOR. This movie is so beautiful, that a slide show of selected stills could stand on its own as a work of art.An excellent cast is headed by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, the latter being the first actor to succeed at portraying one of the "bad" Roman emperors as something more than a one-dimensional villain. Even evil Emperors deserve better depiction than Hollywood has given them over the years. Connie Nielsen, absolutely ravishing in Roman finery, also carries her role very well. Richard Harris, as Marcus Aurelius, is so good that he really does look like a dying man (I sure hope it's just good acting and makeup!), and of course, it's always great to see Derek Jacobi in a show about ancient Rome. Oliver Reed was excellent in his last film; he will be missed.I predict that GLADIATOR will catalyze a revival of public interest in ancient Rome, which is a long time coming. I hope also that this film heralds a renaissance in Ridley Scott's career. It had been way too long since ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visceral, compelling viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the outset it should be said that "Gladiator" might appear to be a "blokey", "testosterone pumping" blood'n'guts movie. Nothing could be further from the truth.A conspiracy of glorious photography, inspired direction and a powerfully immaculate performance by Russell Crowe transports the audience to ancient Rome. And the journey is immersive, visceral and compelling. "Gladiator" is a rivetting story of treachery, tragedy, deception and revenge and is made memorable by unforgettable performances by Joaquin Phoenix, Oliver Reed, Connie Nielsen, Derek Jacobi, et al.Joaquin delivers as Commodus, a simpering, treacherous psychopath with an apparently unfulfilled lust for his sister Lucilla and a penchant for over-vigorous paternal hugging. Ollie Reed (RIP) gives a cracker of a performance as sports agent, Proximo, whose catch cry should be "show me the denari". He literally throws his clients to the wolves.But all the acting accolades should be showered on Russell Crowe. He thrives on the pressure of appearing in nearly every scene, a burden which would demolish a lesser actor, and he is absolutely mesmerising. What a talent.Ridley Scott has bestowed upon us a cinematic masterpiece. This is not just a 160 minute blockbuster it is a seminal event in movie making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The summer starts with this triumphant Gladiator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not Braveheart, the war drama about Scotland's quest for freedom. This is a character study, a comic book, a video game. Ridley Scott and his screenwriters find intelligent ways to give us everything we would ever want to see in a gladiator film. It doesn't aim to teach or evoke pathos, but to entertain like the gladiators themselves. To the film's credit, it does its job admirably.Russell Crowe is back from Jeffrey Wigand and returns to raging Bud White mode. He carries the film in a breath-taking stride, even though his Aussie-accent is difficult to cover up at first. Joaquin Phoenix is the best costumed villainous fop since Tim Roth of Rob Roy.And the battle scenes are rousing, combining the violent red-throated carnage of Braveheart with the you-are-there shaky-cam of Saving Private Ryan to impression results. And the film actually FEELS like Rome, a feat that for all their glory (varying though) Spartacus and Ben-Hur haven't been able to muster up as they've aged.Gladiator is a terrific way to spend two-and-a-half hours and one of the best non-stop action flicks since Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Terminator.</fullReview>

Scott does a brilliant job with STORY you feel the same rage as Maximus when you understand what he does after having his own friends turn on him simple because he wants to be with his family . Arguably crowes best film the story is filled with epic period spectacle when we go from the smaller arenas to the The roman the story also moves forward in a grand way amazing performance from Crowe as the Anger filled Maximus. Great Production design from Arthur Max(G.I. Jane) Period films aren't easy to do also fantastic costume design from Janty Yates(Welcome to Sarajevo) and Amazing Direction from Ridley Scott(Blade Runner). Gladiator is truly the best out of the Sword &amp; Sandals Genre and a well deserved best picture. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless Modern Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who said that epic movies were out of vogue in 2000? Whoever had that thought was proved wrong by the modern reincarnation of a stereotypical sword-and-sandal motion picture called Gladiator. Gladiator has all the right elements of a big-screen epic, which certainly made the movie worthy of mass appeal around the world when it was released in the summer of 2000.The storyline is filled with well interwoven subtle eternal themes that make the movie a compelling classic for generations to come. Even though some may perceive some of the scenes as grotesque and barbaric, the movie presents a well-balanced view of life in Roman times. It is certainly entertaining, artistic and thoughtful in its own way.With an outstanding cast of actors, Gladiator has shown to the world that great movies can still be made when enough attention is given to every single detail of production. Certainly the movie was a success because of its script and seasoned and measured acting performances. It was also Oliver Reed's farewell performance, which fully encompassed his abilities as an actor. Perhaps it was pure fate that the casting director and production team chose him for the role. Nevertheless, it is hard to imagine someone else playing his role.This is certainly a movie that must be seen on the big screen uninterruptedly. And once you have seen it, please grab a history book and learn few more things about the ancestral heritage of the Roman empire.</fullReview>

You follow his struggle from near death to retribution in a mind blowing performance of grit and determination, given by his love and memories.

Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The battle scenes are very graphic. There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such as when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast. The use of color and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie. Ridley Scott's epic film does not romanticize a democratic Golden Age of Rome but a decaying, blood thirsty empire on the edge of its fall... Through its beautiful music, through Russell's performance and through Ridley's soulfulness, "Gladiator" brought a poetic vision in a new and very cinematically richly way that really gave the audience something different</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott was drawn to direct this project by a painting entitled "Thumbs down", which depicted a scene (seen a few times in the film) where a gladiator is sentenced to death by the emperor. It is a moment of pure theatre and that is part of the cinematic appeal of the idea of Rome ? an idea which had for forty years or so been ignored. Scott's resulting vision was an epic which has been one of the most influential films of the decade.The story is epic in scope, but powerful in its detail. Maximus, general of the armies of the north, is favoured by the Emperor to become the protector of Rome. The Emperor's son, Commodus, kills his father before this happens and condemns Maximus to death. Maximus escapes execution and flees to his home where he finds his wife and child murdered. He is caught by slave traders and becomes a popular gladiator intent on revenge. The work on the script should not be underestimated as this is an effective story of a man trying to avenge his family and, on some level, get home.Maximus sees Russell Crowe in one of his finest performances. He brings charisma and magnetism to the screen which makes Maximus sympathetic and engaging for both genders: a proper, fully developed character and not just an action hero to be adored by teenage boys. Joaquin Phoenix was underrated as Commodus, bringing to bear insecurity and weakness with a terrifying edge, making him one of the greatest villains of recent years. Richard Harris's appearance is all too brief in this film but is memorable enough to be counted as his last great performance. Oliver Reed meets Crowe's performance stroke for stroke and is a great presence in this film (his performance became noted for being completed with the aid of CGI after his death toward the end of filming).Scott, however, is the real star of this film, making a world as rich and detailed as the one he created in "Blade Runner" and delivering a terrific story masterfully. The film looks stunning and has a fine Hans Zimmer score. Once again, the computer effects were another step forward (the Coliseum was largely created by visual effects) and have not dated much in nearly ten years.The film's influence cannot be denied (wheat is now a staple image of otherworldliness) and the decade that has followed has been stuffed with historical epics ("Troy", "Alexander", "300"), none of which have been as successful or as effective. Its claim to greatness however comes from its ability to satisfy those who had come for story and character and those who came for action and excitement. It is the ultimate blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If one is ever asked to select a film which truly measures up to action, drama and historically accuracy, " Gladiator " is the first on that list. Movie audiences have long awaited a film which mixes history and action in such a way that it becomes memorable. Ridley Scott has become a true artist in his conception of action films. To date, few films have become so notable as this rendition of the last years of the Emperorer Marcus Aurelius( Richard Harris) on the Rhine. In this story we have a veteran Roman General (Russell Crowe) Maximus Meridius who having won yet another victory over the Germanic tribes, wishes nothing more than to go home and tend his crops. he asks his emperor for permission to go home, but before the wish is granted, he dies and his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) becomes the new ruler. Fearing the popular general is a threat to him, he orders him killed. Oliver Reed (In his last film) plays Proximo, an owner of slaves and gladiators saves him and offers him a chance for revenge. Derek Jacobi plays Gracchus who lends a splendid dignity to the film. Spencer Treat Clark is Lucius who finds the Spanish Gladiator admirable, courageous and interesting. Throughout the movies, one cannot but enjoy the settings, the costumes and the various sub-topics which make for drama at it's best. Highly recommended, this film is sure to become a Classic. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting and story but quite dated and formulaic otherwise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think without a doubt that Gladiator's strengths are its simple but powerful story and its engaging performances. Other than that, however, I think the overall style of the film and the film-making itself are already quite badly dated and forgettable. It doesn't feel like the personal vision of a talented filmmaker (Ridley Scott in this case) but more like an anonymous miniseries with great actors and a very big budget. So, it's good but it should have been great and I find it frustrating because I think it's overrated and I don't know why so many people either can't see or just don't mind what appear to me to be obvious flaws.The action scenes are no longer very special. Braveheart had passionate battle scenes with very precise and skillful choreography. It's not that these ones aren't skillful, but they aren't very original and there's nothing particularly personal about them either. And of course, the special effects are well past their "best before" date so that aspect no longer helps a whole lot.Is Hans Zimmer a hack? He blatantly rips off Holst's "Mars: The Bringer of War" (and does it badly), not to mention tinges of Vangelis, but maybe Scott is in part to blame for this. His orchestral texture is typical of his scores, there's the obligatory march (that sounds a lot like Pirates of the Caribbean, which he had a hand in, not to mention the Michael Bay movies he's done) and worst of all he employs the subtlety of a sledge hammer when it comes to setting the mood in rousing or emotional scenes. One major exception to this in my opinion was Richard Harris' last scene which I found surprisingly good, as if the director gave him some freedom and he actually liked the scene. Otherwise, Zimmer's music fits the movie, or at least its obvious surface layer, perfectly. No risks. No depth. Plenty of formula.Russel Crowe's performance transcends the dated film-making. It's honest and gritty. Oliver Reed also stood out for me (especially his eyes) while the rest are more than engaging. Coupled with the effective story, the performances make the movie worth seeing (IMHO).So, weakness = formulaic film-making. Strength = story + acting. I reckon if you replaced Hans Zimmer's score with any thematically similar music and re-filmed all the non-dialogue scenes using any competent but disinterested cinematographer, Gladiator would be just as popular as it currently is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a must see for all lovers of cinema. Tightly scripted the characters come to life - you sense the actors have become the characters they portray. The opening battle sequence is one of the best brought to the screen and I have seen Olivier's "Henry V", Kirk Douglas's "Spartacus" and Mel Gibson's "Braveheart". Ridley Scott's direction, not only captures the huge scope of the canvas, he has developed the personalities of the characters and permitted them to 'breathe' and become believable, depicting a range human qualities and deficiencies.Russell Crowe's performance is so dominant (worthy of the "Oscar") one cannot imagine any other actor in the role. Joaquin Pheonix truly establishes himself as a fine actor and Connie Neilson, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed cannot be faulted.I would recommend this film for anyone who loves a strong story line, fine acting and an appreciation of the cinematic art.

Not only Russel Crowe but all the actors did a great job. I especially loved the role of Commodus though he is the bad guy. A mighty character, but then again, not almighty.

		<fullReview>An aging Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) has decided not to leave the empire of Rome in the hands to his only son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and instead has decided to leave it to Rome's greatest General and his greatest friend Maximus (Russell Crowe). Forced to make a decision by morning, Maximus sleeps on the idea while Marcus Aurelius breaks the news to his son who does not take it well and kills his father in his anger.Maximus wakes up in the morning to hearing the news of the Emperor's death, the only one knowing who the true successor was supposed to be and with an accurate assumption of who killed the Emperor. Refusing to pledge his allegiance to Commodus, Maximus is sentenced to death and escapes and journeys to save his family, only to find them all dead. With nothing left to loose, he lives his new life as a gladiator called The Spaniard, taking his vengeance on other gladiators.This is one of the greatest epic stories told on film. The idea of a man with nothing to loose has intrigued audiences for years but not since Russell Crowe have they witnessed the barbaric violence of a roman gladiator. Crowe plays the greatest gladiator I could have ever imagined and Joaquin Phoenix is one the greatest, most complicated villain ever shown on film.The action is incredible. Not since Braveheart, has there been such wonderful battles and fight sequences. From beheadings to throat slits, Gladiator does not hesitate to show the gory realism of the roman Coliseum. Breathtaking surroundings bring Rome to life though eloquent displays of architecture and the large quantities of people, quenching their thirst for the mindless violence shown in the roman arena. This as well as the wonderful writing and incredible acting bring Rome to life as well as creating a story that could entertain anyone.Gladiator is so inspiring and entertaining that I could watch it daily and still find myself still feeling as strongly as I feel about it now. The film is flawless in every aspect. Ridley Scott makes his greatest film of all time, surpassing Blade Runner and Alien. Overall, Gladiator succeeds in every aspect and is one of the greatest films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott brings his stylistic sense to the historical epic in this recreation of the Roman Empire at its zenith. This time frame is actually ahead of the usual one with Julius Caesar that we're mostly used to seeing and actually takes place, I believe, during the same time as the elder epic "The Fall of the Roman Empire"(64). By the title and the hearsay, you'd expect the story to revolve around gladiatorial combat in the arena, but though some of the significant scenes do take place there, the scope encompasses all of Rome and its surrounding provinces. The beginning is a lengthy sequence depicting a final battle in the war against Germania, a brutal &amp; staggering depiction of two armies in combat. It's here that director Scott presents the flavor of what the viewer will become accustomed to as the picture progresses: important people, important events, important decisions - set to an epic scale, of course.But it's the people portion of the formula that dominates what could have been just another epic. Maximus (Crowe), a Roman general at the start of the pic, makes it clear very early where his priorities lie: with his wife &amp; son, whom he hasn't seen in over two years. Yet, he's also intensely loyal to the empire and the emperor (Harris). We realize he's caught between the two responsibilities at this early stage of the film and it's not a simple dilemma; priorities must be weighed, possible impacts both personal &amp; political. Although a decision is taken out of his hands, we see that it's not a simple solution of 'well, i'll go home' as he desired which would have dictated his actions. There's real intelligence to the script by this point. Crowe won the Oscar for his part and though he probably was more deserving for a couple of other films, it's easy to see how he carried the picture here.The supporting cast is first rate. Phoenix as Commodus, the new emperor who takes the decision out of Maximus' hands, does not come across as a standard villain, despite his actions (patricide, lusting for his sister, sadistic murder). You see him make revolting faces during the gladiatorial games, reveling in the blood spilled, and of course you think, what a grotesque villain. Yet, in other scenes he is quite pitiful - it's astonishing we can feel any sympathy for this wretch, but Phoenix plays the 'daddy should have loved me' angle to the hilt - and it works. The no.1 position in the empire dictates that the holder cannot trust anyone, it's so true; no one seems more alone than Phoenix throughout the film. Oliver Reed hams it up a bit as an arena entertainer, but it is Reed, a fitting final role. There's a lot a class spread out among the remainder of the cast - Harris, Jacobi, Hemmings all lend some gravitas, and Connie Nielsen is very good in a truly regal role.Since much of this film involves gladiatorial combat, I must at least mention the fighting scenes in the various arenas. They are very well done. But they're probably not the main reason to see the picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Definition of 'Masterpiece'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Franzoni's (Gladiator , King Arthur) prestigious writing skills, Ridley Scott's (Hannibal , Black Hawk Down) directing techniques, and a five-star cast present the audience with a true masterpiece. Also, outstanding music, set design, and battle effects create a solid, comfortable and emotional mood for viewers. Astonishing performances by Academy-Award winner Russell Crowe (A Beautiful Mind , Master and Commander), Academy-Award nominee Joaquin Phoenix (Signs , The Village [Not to mention, my favorite actor due to his performances.]), Connie Nielsen, and Richard Harris make this film a must-see. Spectacular battle scenes fill this movie, but I rather enjoy the work combination from Scott and Franzoni as they bring out a truly emotional storyline. Personally, the crew behind Gladiator definitely deserved the five Academy-Award (including Best Picture) victories. Did I forget the other seven nominations? I'll leave it at that. Masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Give me a real big break! I realize that most good folks who go to movies have absolutely no history-learning, of America's past or Europe's let-alone Ancient Rome's, but for this over-blown bit of hokum to be touted as some sort of Great Epic is too much for a reasonably intelligent history buff to bear.Ok, it's a movie. I understand that, but do not be fooled for one moment into thinking Ridley Scott's 'Gladiator' is anything but a vehicle that would have been, in the "Technicolour Age", cast with Steve Reeves and Maria Montez with Charles Laughton rolling his eyes as the Eeeevil Emperor. I won't even recommend Gibbons' 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire' to any fans of this flick at hand, it would be fruitless. Suffice it to say that, yes, the characters are all based on people who really lived, but, other than the Emperor's sister, Lucilla, did not behave in any way shape or form indicated by the characters in this comic book creation of Scott's.Yes, Russell Crowe is superb! He looks like a Gladiator, acts like a Gladiator and probably smells like a Gladiator. And he takes Brad Pitt-style mumbling to a new level of sexiness. No complaints there, I mean this isn't 'Citizen Kane.' Connie Nielsen is just about the most beautiful woman I've seen new to the silver screen since Greta Scacchi, and she's a better actress into the bargain. Hers is the best performance in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix was surprisingly good at being evil, it's just too bad his character is so bogus. His final "fight" in the Coliseum with Maximus is ridiculous and about as far from the facts of history as we are on Earth from the next solar system.Richard Harris is predictable casting. He acts his part competently and is believeable, and thanks to his impeccable Shakespearean and West End experience he can fake believeably as the old Emperor. And he makes Crowe's Maximus appear almost three dimensional in their scenes together.Derek Jacobi revisits his 'I Claudius' turn, here as Senator Grauchus (Yawn). The rest is dross although I did like David Hemmings and his outrageous wig, a bit of fact for once in this falacious flick. The Roman gentry were "in" to wigs of various colors, like green and blue and purple.Fortunately Russell Crowe is a first-tier star and holds the camera and the audience tightly between his sweaty thighs. He is also handsome, possessing a "soft" side and he DOES act well. Scotland's answer to Mickey Rourke? Or is Crowe Australian? I've never been sure where he's from, it doesn't matter.Crowe is a great actor with bad personal habits. Regardless, I can't help admiring a guy with the backbone to punch a reporter or a press secretary or a producer in the jewels when it is well-deserved. But don't over-do it Russ or you're finished, at least in Hollywood, which isn't a necessarily bad thing for an outstanding talent. Try on Hamlet in England sometime and see what happens! You'll be too old for that part soon so hop to it. Or better still..Macbeth!I don't recall my response one way or the other as to sets, costumes and musical score. That must mean that they were not bad enough to detract. But I think that this sort of "spaghetti Western" movie is pretty easy to create on film. Just add more blood, breasts and bonking for the modern taste and you've got it down.I am a long time fan of Ridley Scott. This is not his worst movie but it is his most over-rated. It was entertaining but I will never watch it again.Gil</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Gladiator is definitely my favourite movie to-date. I mean I am not really a movie fan, but I went to see it twice cos I just love it so much. This movie has everything -- Action, Drama, Politics, History and Romance (but not too much of it which is good). The action sequences are superb, both the battle scene and the fighting scene. Every details are captured tastefully, &amp; not too gory. The acting is always superb. Russell Crowe was such a natural. I love him!! and his character, Maximus. I'm so glad he won an Oscar which he rightfully deserved. At last not least, the soundtrack was so great that it sounds good just by itself (I still listen to it everyday!!). Also I should not forget to mention the special effect like the reconstruction of the ancient Rome and the Colosseum. I felt like looking at a real living city as it was New York or London or something. After I watched Gladiator, I also watched Ben Hur just to satisfy my thirst for blood. But nah, Ben Hur is not even half as good as Gladiator.</fullReview>

Visually, it is probably the best film of the year. Story, one of the top five. Acting, one of the top five. Gladiator leaves on the edge of your seat the whole time. What's amazing about this is you don't see many action movies that debate between systems of government, and this movie handles it so well. This is brilliant film making, it just might be better than Braveheart. So if you liked Braveheart, you'll LOVE this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An old-fashioned hero, brilliantly portrayed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There isn't much I can add that hasn't already been said, but what made this movie so special for me was Russell Crowe's brilliant portrayal of Maximus as a genuine hero of Shakespearean proportions. I don't mean to imply that there is any resemblance between Gladiator and one of Shakespeare's plays, or that the dialogue resembles one of them. But the creation of a truly heroic character in a pivotal role is a classical and, unfortunately, out of date device. It requires an actor who can not only convince you that his character possesses a heroic and noble nature, but who can also make you care terribly about what happens to this hero. Crowe does both. The viewer loves and admires his Maximus, and agonizes with him in his travails. In this, Crowe reminded me of Laurence Olivier at a comparable age, although I'd guess he would cringe at the comparison. As to the rest of the cast, I couldn't find a single weak link. In fact, the only thing I didn't like about the movie was the extent of the gore in the battle and gladiator scenes. I can't believe that so many prolonged grisly scenes were necessary to get the movie's point across.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good epic film...overall grade: 8 (out of 10).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best way to analyze this film is to compare it to another famous gladiator film, Spartacus (1960). Kirk Douglas (Spartacus) vs. Russell Crowe (Maximus Decimus Meridius)The winner is: Russell Crowe (by a long shot). I liked Russell Crowe in this film. His performance is what keeps the movie generated with electricity from start to finish. Although Douglas was good as Spartacus, I found Crowe's performance much better. Laurence Olivier (Crassus) vs. Joaquin Phoenix (Commodus)The winner is: Laurence Olivier. No actor could steal a screen performance like Olivier. Phoenix goes overboard with his character in some scenes.Peter Ustinov (Lentulus Batiatus) vs. Oliver Reed (Proximo)The winner is: a draw.I liked both characters from each film. Ustinov won an Oscar for his Supporting role, but Reed was equally impressive, too.Direction: Stanley Kubrick vs. Ridley ScottThe winner is: Kubrick (by a long shot). Special Effects: The winner is Spartacus. One example is the mammoth battle scene towards the end of the film. Gladiator is littered with computerized special effects.I feel Spartacus still holds my interest as best gladiator film ever made. The only thing that holds Gladiator together is Crowe's performance.Spartacus: 8.5 (out of 10). Gladiator: 8 (out of 10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator, I thought, was an excellent movie in abundant ways. It was not only visually stunning, but the characters and the feel of the movie made you actually feel as if you were really there. I gave this a ten, and (if you haven't yet) once you've seen it you will too. I will admit that it is wildly graphic, but I like how it really gives meaning to the word "combat." The movie (to sum it up) is about a general named Maximus. This is in ancient Greece/Rome. "Ceasar" (not the (italic) Ceasar, but...) knows his life is ending but wants to crown Maximus Ceasar, instead of his (I think I will be...) son. His son then overthrows his dad and becomes Ceasar. He orders Maximus to be killed, but instead Maximus gets away, becomes a slave, is bought, becomes a very good Gladiator, and that's the movie (kinda). See it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Critique: 8 out of 10Back in 1959, MGM released a film that critic's hailed and audiences adored. This film went on to win eleven academy awards, and instantly becoming a classic all around the world. This was director William Wyler's Ben-Hur. Nearly 40 years after that, comes an epic-like film, with a similar storyline, titled Gladiator. An entertaining, well-made movie, that brings back the treasures of yesterday.The plot, although original, is cleverly written by screenplay writer's, David Franzoni, John Logan, and William Nicholson. General Maximus (Russell Crowe) the greatest military leader Rome has ever had. After defeating, the Germanic renegades, Maximus is looking toward going home to his wife and son soon. Yet, the dying Emperor, Marcus Aurelius wishes to give the throne over toward Maximus, instead of the rightful heir his reckless son, Commodus. Maximus isn't thrilled about the idea, and tells the Emperor he'll think about his decision. Though, before Maximus can give his answer, Commodus hears about this and kills his father out of anger. Commodus takes the throne immediately, and asks for Maximus support. When Maximus doesn't give it, Commodus is furious and orders to execute him and his family. While Maximus barley escapes, he family doesn't. Wounded emotionally and physically, Maximus passes out, only to be captured by slave traders. Purchased by a former Gladiator, Proximus (Oliver Reed), Maximus finds himself competing in small gladiator contests. As Maximus becomes more popular, he discovers he may be able to take revenge on the man who killed his family.Director Ridley Scott ("Blade Runner", "Hannibal") brings to the screen, some enormous cinematography, making you feel as if you were right there among the characters. The Gladiator fight scenes are brought to life, from clever camera angles, and the frequent shaking of the camera.Russell Crowe ("Proof of Life", "The Insider") performs wonderfully, and brings to life his character's emotions. Joaquin Phoenix, plays the corrupt young Emperor well, and delivers a believable performance being crude, selfish, and full of hate against Maximus. Supporting Actress Connie Neilson, ("Mission to Mars," "Soldier") plays the emperors sister, and Maximus former love interest (something that should have been discussed a bit more). Oliver Reed, does a fantastic job as Proximo, the retired Gladiator, who's quest is to help Maximus win his freedom.Violence. This movie is filled with it, from a man being sliced in half, from decapitation's. While, I wouldn't have made the film this gory, it does make for a completely realistic feel! This film is a wonderful, it has a few flaws, but besides them it has become an instant classic around the world. Though, not everyone will enjoy this film as much as I did, it's worth seeing. I give it: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot goes haywire - power surges abound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator overwhelmed the opposition in Academy voting this year. Yet those who cry "foul" are strikingly naive in their calls for some sort of recount. It is a prime example of Oscar voters going for a big winner when the "second-place" entries managed to cancel out one another's separate claims to be better overall films. This BEST PICTURE shows signs of being less than the sum of most of its commendable parts, due in greatest part to its haywire plot. Like the much feared power surges for people's home and work computers, it has plenty of emotional highs and striking brief scenes or cuts but they short-circuit the narrative that you want to puzzle through after the final credits. I believe the screenplay could have made some sort of "revisionist" sense about an introspective Emperor but he is throttled and overthrown in some sort of flip-flop of fortunes that's left unexplained. Don't blame Joaquin Phoenix for overacting when he seemingly improvises with the lurching dialogue. For anybody trying to make sense of slavery and gladiators, see a much better film from 1960, Spartacus. Back then actor Kirk Douglas and buddies were telling the director what the finished product should be. Nowadays, the director uses all the arrows in his quiver to nail us to the trees and we wonder what's hit us as the spectacle overpowers the story.</fullReview>

Since when does cheesey, intelligence insulting popcorn fodder like this disappointing movie win anything better than an award given out at the separate ceremony for technical achievement? The acadmeny has let me down before, no doubt about it. But at least the academy has always rewarded "good" movies, even when you felt a better movie was robbed. Forrest Gump shouldn't have beaten Pulp Fiction, but at least Forrest Gump was good. Same with Shakespeare in Love beating Saving Private Ryan, or Ordinary People beating Raging Bull. But if Gladiator wins, I think it will be the first time ever that a "bad" movie wins the top honor. I can't even recall a "bad" movie even getting nominated before.Let's not kid ourselves. Gladiator is a bad movie. I know the special effects were great, and you paid 8 bucks to see it... I know Gladiator does the whole action/violence/sword-swinging-epic thing better than a lot of its competition. And I know you've been saying it was a good movie all this time, so to make the admission that it was bad now would be to quietly admit that you've been watching a lot of bad movies and wasting a lot of money and time. But for God's sake DO IT. Admit it. You'll feel better.Normally I'd let this go. People watch it, they like it, what's the harm? A little mindless afternoon entertainment for a small fee. But when the industry leaders prepare to give this thing the top honors for the year, then we've got to take a stand. You need to find your nearest Academy voter, look him right in the inebriated bloodshot eye, and tell him that if he votes for this stupid movie, he deserves to be tied up and beaten with bamboo.I won't bother defending why I think it's stupid. All the reasons should be utterly apparent to anyone who's seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Gladiator at a sneak preview in New York and I must admit, I walked away disappointed. I felt that the battle scenes at the beginning were too computerized and pixiliated--they just zoomed by so fast that the audience did not have a chance to see what is going on. Someone later made the comment to me that, "Well, isn't that how you would experience a battle?" And I would have to saw, I don't know, I've never been in one. But compared to the opening sequence in "Saving Private Ryan" (not a perfect movie, in my eyes, but the opening battle scene was far superior to Galdiator's), Gladiator's battle was all whiz-bang, wham-bam, with no emotion. I whispered to my seatmate that it was too pixiliated and he whispered back, "That's how they cheat," which pretty much summed it up.As went the opening battle scene, so went all the gladiatorial scenes--all speed, no substance. I couldn't even tell how the Russell Crowe character won some of the battles, they were whipping by so fast, with such fake, fake computerized effects. To compare, a couple of days after seeing Gladiator, I saw Sparticus on the big screen. There is only one gladiatorial battle, yet it is much more exciting, suspenseful and real than any of the Gladiator scenes. I CARED what happened!On a postive note, I did think Joaquin Phoenix's performance was fantastic, as were all of the performances. The computerized amphitheater was also pretty cool looking. Too bad the film makers felt that the computer could somehow take the place of realisticly choreographed gladiatorial fights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies manage to split the public and critics' opinions right down the middle but still manage to do well at the box office and get tons of awards notice and high ratings. "Gladiator" is one of the biggest examples of this, and I am in the camp that finds this to be a weak film.2000 was fairly weak year for movies, but this isn't an excuse for "Gladiator" winning the Best Picture Oscar. You still had great films that were completely snubbed like "Almost Famous" (my choice), Billy Elliot, Cast Away, Wonder Boys, and among the nominees, Traffic. These films represented the few glimmering moments of film in 2000.Gladiator has actually grown on me with repeated viewings but it is still by no means a great or even good movie. I feel that Russell Crowe did not deserve the Oscar over his entire category and while I am not a huge fan of him as an actor or from what his persona perceives, he did give good performances in "L.A. Confidential", "Romper Stomper", "The Insider", and "Cinderella Man" and these went relatively unnoticed (save for "The Insider"). The movie just didn't feel like a Best Picture winner either. It had all of the right ingredients but it came out stale and bland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott film Gladiator (2000), reputedly inspired by a painting, is set in ancient Rome at the time of Caesars (approximately 100-50 B.C.). Leaders of a republican empire that spread across the whole of Europe, most of the Middle East and North Africa, we join their premier General Maximus (Russel Crowe) on the battlefield immediately prior to their invasion of Germany.Caesar himself (Richard Harris) is in old age. He is wondering whether this great empire he has conquered has been worth the sacrifices he has had to make to secure it.It is not long before he finds out. His aptly named and disaffected son Commodos (Joaquim Phoenix) is soon hell-bent on winning control of all that his absent father has won. His unwilling sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and nephew Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark) are drawn into a succession of outrageous betrayals which they feel helpless to avoid.Loyal Maximus, meanwhile, suffers the loss of his family and barely escapes with his life. Tended to by Juba (Diimon Hounsou) and exiled, of necessity, to a remote part of the Empire - he rebuilds his shattered life championed by the unlikely promoter Proximo (Oliver Reed).No longer the leader of a legitimate army, Maximus makes his name as a prize-fighter or Gladiator. Even in the time of ancient Rome, such a fighter could win his freedom from slavery by open competition in the public arena.Returning to Rome as a self-made champion, Maximus is soon recognised by long-serving members of the Senate like Graccus (Derek Jacobi) with whom he conspires to free Rome from the tyrannous hold that Commodos has gained by deceit.A powerful tale, well told and full of the dark uncertainty that attends such great events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now Thats what I call Screen Magic !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to mumble "Afterlife' a Joke" till Gladiator happened. Now I start to wonder if my actions will in fact echo in my Afterlife ! Set in Ancient Rome, The Gladiator is everything spectacular that you can imagine about a movie of such epic proportions. Breathtaking visuals of the amphitheaters and of Rome itself will segue you into an ancient Roman realm. The grandeur of the "games" will just etch itself in your mind. And the afterlife concept and its depiction was really mind-blowing.USP 1: Dialogue! The Dialogue is everything that can be. It is Awe-Inspiring. It is Heart-Rending. It sends your Pulse-Racing and your hackles springing. I have watched this movie a zillion times now and have memorized every bit of verbal legerdemain that it has to offer. It is clearly exemplary in buttressing the already superior climaxes.USP 2: Russel Crowe - Welcoming you into a cesarean time , is a stubbled Russel Crowe breathtakingly wielding his sword first in battle as a reputed general ,then in the amphitheater as a slave and finally in the Collosuem as the Gladiator. Although the entire cast have a splendid acting performance, Crowe in particular is terrific. Makes it all the more challenging, as his character traverses a wide variety of emotions and situations. He also command a certain air of unnerving chivalry throughout the movie. His English accent goes really well with the movie and its resounding dialog.USP 3 : Hans Zimmer - Soundtrack! Hmm! How many times has it resonated in my ears ! Its brings the Afterlife to ...well ...life. It sets a super cadence to which you would pound your feat , drool your way through Elysiums and colloseums , enliven your emotions and indulge your senses. You could rerun the entire movie in your head with the soundtrack alone ! The sound track for the most part has a tinge of "Gregorian" and fittingly so too.USP 4 : Cinematography and Special Effects - Cinematography and Special effects are so outstanding, that without the aforementioned USP's the Colosseum scenes would have comprehensively eclipsed the rest of the movie. And the Academy certainly didn't disagree either. Of particular significance, is the portrayal of Afterlife which although is a complete human conception , tends to inculcate into the movie a sense of mysticism. This is exactly where the Cinematography is a huge success.It was really pleasing to witness "The Gladiator" make all the big snatches at the Academy Awards even against such stern competition as "Traffic" and "Erin Brokovich". The Gladiator doesn't fall short to make it to the established pedestals of movie making on any front. All in all, a "Screen Magic"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maximus Rules...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. It's what cinema was made for. Everything about it...the acting, Ridley Scott's directing, the screenplay, the score...is wonderful. Russell Crowe gives a magnificent portrayal of Maximus, the Roman Army General who is betrayed by the jealous Emperor and who becomes a gladiator to avenge the murder of his wife and child.Russell Crowe deservedly won an Oscar for his performance! The swarthy, sexy, manly Maximus...has there ever been a more charismatic character on screen? Maximus is the kind of man that you would follow to the end of the earth. The personal journey that he goes through, from proud general to defeated slave to celebrity gladiator, is extremely moving...and the film's strong spiritual subtext made me extremely emotional. This film has one of the most moving endings ever.There is great acting from all the cast...Joaquin Phoenix makes a fantastic boo-hiss villain, and there is also excellent support from Connie Nielsen and the late Oliver Reed and Richard Harris.In short...Yes, I Am Entertained!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criminally Overrated; a Roman "Death Wish"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I write this, I see upon my shelf of movies a true classic everyone should know; "The Raiders of the Lost Ark." It was the best Indiana Jones flick; escapism refined to its purest, most unadulterated form. I wish I had been old enough when it was released in 1983 to call it a stirring epic and one of the best movies of all time.Was it those things? Certainly not. You know what you want to see in "Raiders," and that's Harrison Ford escape from impossible situations, stirring action sequences, and Nazis getting their just desserts. I know what I was looking for when I went to see "Gladiator," and that was testosterone-oozing killing machines lopping off arms and limbs in a plot not too intellectually stimulating where the the bad guy died and our hero won out. I saw that, and I give the movie a 6-7 as a result; professionally-done, cliche`d, brainless action and nothing more. It, too, was cheap (100 million dollar-cheap) escapism, so why is it the forerunner for Best Picture?The Academy was duped when they saw this. There's nothing Best Picture-worthy about this film. Performances? No. Direction? No. Script? A thousand times no!Russell Crowe for Best Actor? To his credit, he's suave and probably tough enough to grind Kirk Douglas from "Spartacus" into chum. He gives one of the best performances I've ever seen from someone who maintains the EXACT SAME facial expression and emotional state throughout 9/10 of the movie's running time. The real talent here was with Joaquin Phoenix, who transformed a character written as a whining infantile nuisance that wouldn't scare a goldfish into a truly creepy and threatening presense. He deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination, but not for this. He gave an even better performance in "Quills."Speaking of Philip Kaufman's masterpiece, "Quills" is one movie on a list I would have rather seen nominated for Best Picture of 2000 than "Diehard with Sandals." "Almost Famous," "American Psycho," "High Fidelity" and "You Can Count on Me" are only a few of the well-crafted pieces of cinematic glory we received in 2000 that were overlooked by the members of the Academy that would rather get soaked in au jus and thrown into a tiger's cage than ::gasp!:: NOMINATE A MOVIE THAT MADE LESS THAN 50 MILLION DOLLARS (Miramax films excluded)!!! I guess the actors in the preceding films should've used a monotone voice and screamed a few more times.What really irks me, though, is the nerve of the Academy nominating "Gladiator's" overcooked, cliche`s-on-parade laden script. Holy Mother of Christ, movies like this aren't driven by a script. They're driven by studio executives throwing fistfulls of money to make something that will make you go "oooh" and "aaaah."Movies are an art form, and with that, "Gladiator" is the equivalent of the sketch artist at the mall doing portraits for ten dollars each. The Picasso of the nominees is the challenging, explosive "Traffic," and the awe-inspiring "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" (a movie with a hint of human connection and feeling; Ridley Scott, take note) is Salvador Dali. I plea to any Academy Member that might by chance be reading this: please, I beg of you, leave this along with the mediocre "Erin Brockovich" and the preach-fest "Chocolat" at the bottom of the heap, and let a movie made by people who know and care take home the gold.</fullReview>

I'm perfectly sure he can write an excellent score but he has been hiding that virtue for a very long time. I'm almost convinced that Mr. Ridley Scott let Mr. George Lucas take the honor's. The characters are quite as flat as they are on Star Wars 1 2 and 3. Even cinematography makes you squirm. Zoom in on a actor while he is monologuing? That hasn't been done since the 70ties and was dealt with there and than. Both Ben Hur and Spartacus were done over 40 years ago and were more convincing and better acted. Also watch Titus and be really stunned by acting soundtrack and story.skip it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst "historical" movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this film when I was maybe 12, and I loved it. Now, 8 years later, I rewatched it (extended edition) and realised how awful this movie really is. I hope I'm not nitpicking, because it felt to me that the points I am going to make were there just to insult the viewers intelligence. -First major battle scene. Romans have siege weapons just lying around, on the front line of Germania? They are obviously hard to transport, and there is no reason for them to be there. -Crowe says later that there were roughly 10,000 roman soldiers on the battlefield, with 2,000 dead. Thats funny because I could probably count the number of roman soldiers who were shown to have died on 1 hand, whereas the number of barbarians killed was massive. -Crowe says the casualties sustained by the cavalry by the siege weapons were necessary, then does nothing but complain about how many of his men died. -Russell Crowe sneaks out of the fort with his cavalry and somehow manages to encircle thousands of barbarians, without them ever noticing. Also, the barbarians just stand there and allow this to happen. -The choice of softly spoken British accents for the romans was awful. I'm not saying they should of spoken in full Latin, but that is no reason for them to speak in those annoying accents. -After the battle, the emperor, the emperors son and his daughter are all within maybe a days ride of the Germanian front line? That makes no sense, why would such important figures be there at all? -Crowe is described as Rome's best general by Caesar, yet he is Spanish, lives on a farm and has no involvement in politics. -Caesar says he is close to death, yet he journeyed from Rome presumably to the front line of Germania. Why didn't he stay in Rome? -Caesar bestows Crowe with the title of Protector of Rome, a man who is Spanish, has little interest or skill in politics and wants nothing more than to go home. Good choice Caesar. -Crowe's slave(he's never called a slave) has a Scottish accent. Is this a nod to the Eagle of the Ninth? Simple stealing of idea because they thought it would work in the Roman context? Or just bad historical accuracy? Also, they are in Germania, so why would there be a Scottish slave there? There isn't any mention of Crowe serving in Britannia. -I can understand Crowe being depicted as an indestructible badass, but seriously, the dude can throw swords that accurately? -Crowe somehow manages to ride from the front line in Germania(which kind of suggests deep in Germania), to Spain, just in time to just miss his wife and son's murderers? Impossible. The farm was still smoking when he got there for god's sake. -After that funny scene where he's covered in snot after finding his wife and son, he's picked up by apparently African slave traders (Carthaginians?). A roman citizen, in a roman province, abducted by slave traders? I don't think I need to explain myself anymore. -So Crowe apparently has an SPQR tattoo, something never practised by Romans at all. The only people who would tattoo themselves were barbarians. So I got 45 minutes in than I gave up. I'll probably get a lot of stick for this review, but I really don't care. If you are looking for a good historically accurate movie with a plot that makes sense I cannot stress enough how frustrated you will be watching this movie. If you have no knowledge of the Roman civilization at all and you are willing to look past all the glaring plot holes and bad accents, there is a lot you will enjoy about this movie. It is full of action and Crowe is a badass. The reason I didn't give this 1 out of 10 is because there were a few enjoyable battle/fight scenes where you could forget about all the stupidness that had occurred for a few minutes. Other than that, there is nothing stopping this from being one of the worst movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who likes the old epics of Hollywood's golden age must cringe at this ugly and unenjoyable production.Russel Crowe must be the most overrated actor of this century. He is gruff and rough but he is just too fat and ugly for the hero. Just compare him to the heroes of the period epics like Charlton Heston. Why do they choose the opposite of handsome. He didn't have to be pretty. In the end who cares if he lives or dies.Joaquin is a bit modern looking and out of place for a Roman Emperor. Although he does have a depraved air - he doesn't combine a regal like presence with it. He's more run of the mill pervert. Connie Nielsen is a bit un Roman - too Northern European but at least she has a certain dignity.The awards this movie and its cast got are mostly undeserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Majestic production that won 2000s-audience; Fabulous Roman epic that echoes in film history as "masterpiece"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They were just shadows and dust. Yet, their courageous deeds have been admired for hundreds of years. Their name was ... gladiators.Since 1959 and the release of the ultra popular Roman epic BEN HUR, many people have thought that William Wyler's movie reached the ultimate splendor on screen and no other production may take its stead. However, the memorable year 2000 sees a premiere of GLADIATOR by Ridley Scott. The movie's title does not indicate any novel nor any specific period of Roman history. Yet, the film becomes one of the top Hollywood productions. What is so extraordinary about it that GLADIATOR is admired not only by epic fans but by the audiences of different interests, different preferences, different expectations from a movie.First of all, GLADIATOR, unlike many other epics, shows a very realistic image of the Roman Empire and makes a perfect use of this on screen. In this case, the movie which discusses a very distant period in time (2nd century A.D.) occurs to be clearly interpreted and understood by the 21 century-audience. This fact proves a great talent of the director, Ridley Scott, who exactly knows viewers' expectations. Such a movie is more a spectacle and entertainment than pure history. Therefore, even if there are historic figures in the film, we cannot treat it as history and look for historical accuracy or inaccuracy. It is much more since it generally shows Rome, its power, its emperors, its people, its games, finally...its gladiators.It seems quite unnecessary to present the content of the film while hundreds have done this before me. What I want to concentrate on GLADIATOR's universal aspect, which makes it an exceptional epic. As a matter of fact, no one will fully understand the story of Maximus (Russell Crowe) without profound reflections. Simply, the entire content of GLADIATOR is one great symbol. A simple man, a farmer becomes a great leader, emperor's friend. Yet, when times change, he gets through a personal tragedy becoming a slave, a gladiator whose primary task is to amuse people and the corrupted emperor by killing. Nevertheless, it is him who is honored at his death - He was the one who loved Rome. In my opinion, the very first shot of the movie shows it all - where Maximus heart is - a bird symbolizing gentleness, and fields symbolizing his life. The final fight on arena between emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and Maximus cannot be treated historically. It is a symbolic battle between two visions of Rome (using modern language - between two visions of the world) - the one of honor, equality and love and the one of decadence, slavery and corruption. And this is, I think, the most important message of this movie. In this perspective, the movie develops all characters universally.CAST: Russell Crowe, who portrays Maximus, does a very fine job. He portrays a man of a good heart who is exposed to living in the reality that is against all he heads for, a leader who got a new name, "gladiator". I loved his performance in one scene more than in any other - in the conversation with the emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Wonderful meeting of two seeing one goal - goodness of Rome! Joaquin Phoenix is also very memorable as brute Commodus, a corrupted emperor who is, on the one hand, a blood sucker, but, on the other hand, a man who wants to be loved. I also loved the performance of Connie Nielsen as Lucilla. This beautiful Danish actress very well fits to this role portraying a woman who lives in the very ambiguous reality. A note must also be made of Derek Jacobi, unforgettable Claudius from a perfect BBC series made almost 30 years earlier. Yet, two performances by already late actors are a must to mention, Richard Harris's phenomenal portrayal of Marcus Aurelius and Oliver Reed's slave trader Proximo. Oliver Reed died during filming and his death is a terrible loss to all film industry. We thank him for such a powerful performance in this film, unforgettable, forever in our hearts and minds.Some people say that GLADIATOR is too violent. I admit that there are very brutal moments, especially the ones showing arena fights. Nevertheless, that is what these fights looked like. Visual effects of the movie are so stunning that I was lost in admiration. Commodus's triumphant entrance to Rome (a bit exaggerated in size but representing not that much a city but rather its power), the sequence at Zucchabar, a fictional Roman province set in Mauretania Caesariensis, the imperial palace, the brutal battle in the woods of Germania - all is filled with unforgettable grandeur! The locations at Morocco, Malta, Italy and Spain add a thrill to the spectacle.And the music... it is half of the whole entertainment to watch GLADIATOR without the admiration of its excellent musical pieces. It is a flow from sentimentalism, through exotic sounds to the tunes expressing the gore of the arena. I loved the title song, it touched my heart. There is something like a gentle power in it...GLADIATOR is in many aspects a film that will become a cult movie, not only an ancient epic but a masterpiece of movie art. When I was a boy, I was saddened by the fact that I don't live in such times like the 1950s when great masterpieces were released like BEN HUR, QUO VADIS or THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. Yet, GLADIATOR made my dream come true. We all do live in such times, the times of great movies and this is, without doubt, one of such films. 10/10! They were just shadows and dust. However, who among them would predict that they would once (in almost 2000 years) be the characters of such a film masterpiece. So were only the emperors immortal?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crowe can't save voyeuristic and incoherent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Russell Crowe's fine performance as an ex-general turned into a slave and then a gladiator cannot save this picture from its utter absurdity, as the ending stages a pathetic duel between him and (no kidding) the Emperor of Rome in the Coliseum!!! There are some impressive scenes in the film, and Crowe has a beautiful screen presence; his friendship with a fellow Numidian gladiator is nicely conveyed, as is his attachment to amulets representing his family; the revelation of his identity is aptly charged with tension; and the preparation of the first battle is superb. Alas, it then turns into an orgy of gore.Being an ancient Greek (Theban to be precise) general, I'm bound to have qualms about this film's treatment of antiquity. As many reviewers have noted, the sole idea of a roman citizen (let alone a general) being turned into a slave is absurd, as is the trip from Germania to Spain during which Crowe seems to pass through some sort of rocky desert before entering the hills of Tuscany... How familiar is the filmmaker with the geography of Europe I wonder? Depictions of power relations in Rome are also quite laughable.But it is the voyeuristic stance and contemporary political relevance of the film which I find most disturbing. The despisal/fascination for the 'mob' which runs through the film has a distinctly fascist tinge. The violence is in some places unbearable, all the more so as it is gratuitous (the slaughter of Maximus' son)... My deep rejection and indeed contempt for the film really developed from listening to Ridley Scott's commentary on the DVD, in which he avows, among other depressing platitudes, that he would really have liked to live in Roman times, granted he was among the wealthy ruling classes... Probably in order to enjoy the spectacle of death and violence he in turn successfully inflicts on his twentieth-century teenage audience. The implications of such a fascination for slavery and violence are frightening, and make one want to watch SPARTACUS over and over again, as a reminder of the times in which Hollywood stood for humanist values, and not their despisal. It is also an opportunity to find where many seemingly novel ideas in GLADIATOR actually originate...All in all, despite how much we want to believe in Crowe, the film is far from the historical and psychological complexity (and visual clarity in battle scenes) of the much-underrated Alexander. Indeed, Crowe would have been perfect in the part, and would probably have had the guts to oppose to the wearing of Colin Farrell's ridiculous blonde wig!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film as Colosseum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regular readers of my comments note my penchant for pointing out that film is a modern medium, meaning that films -- good ones anyway -- are often largely about themselves. When the nature of this self-comment is interesting, I point it out. But I failed to do so in an earlier comment on Gladiator, so here is the remedy.Summer movies target the lowest of our sensibilities. The plots are highly simplified morality plays where good and evil are radically drawn; the form is of violent spectacle. In other words, our civilized society wants the same things we observe in later Rome, to which we insist on feeling superior.So the master Scott gives us a violent spectacle about a violent spectacle. He makes fun of us by pandering to our baser tastes while slyly getting us to agree with the wise senator who observes how simple, stupid and manipulable is the mob. He did much the same in Blade Runner, but there the comment was on the sharpness, complexity of the audience not its dullness.Is this a maturing cynicism, an adventure into a new challenge (mastering the art of painting with a blunt palette), or a striking out against Hollywood's financial politics? I suppose we've have to wait a decade to find out -- until after the power-hungry Caesars die and the medium is returned to the enlightened leaders of the people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott's lame take on a WWF bout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The denizens of the Roman Empire were a particularly bloodthirsty lot, and apparently not that far off in mentality from our own culture. The vox populi, bored to the heavens with the multitudinous burdens inflicted on them by their government, seek escape in the mind-numbingly bland entertainment provided within the Colosseum. Gladiators fend for their lives against a series of uniquely dressed foes and beasts, all in the hope of winning their freedom. Everything about this testosterone-toned epic is meant to cater to a population who likes their filmed landscapes served to them WWF-style.Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a top army general in the army of Marcus Auerlius (Richard Harris), a dying patriarch who (in predictable fashion) unwittingly causes trouble within the family ranks by offering his throne to Maximus instead of to his son Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix). Auerlius' son is the kind of whinny, pussy-whipped boy that your audience likes to hate because the character's moral fiber makes the character so easily expendable. Commodus' temper tantrums lead to patricide and the film turns into an interminably messy three-hour affair simply centering on the standard theme of revenge.Maximus is sent to die in the woods but manages to get the upper hand and kill Commodus' henchmen. He returns to his homestead only to find his wife and son lynched from trees. Poor Maximus is denied the throne of Rome and is now being fueled to wage a one-man war against the sissy who wiped away his entire family. As Maximus works his way back to Rome, unbeknownst to the new king Commodus, our foppish king swishes around the kingdom ridiculously hitting on his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielson) and hovering inappropriately over his nephew Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark).In the first hour Ridley Scott has expertly painted his archetypal figures, forcing us to love the brave Maximus, wifeless and sonless, and hate the creepy teenager with the thirst for forbidden fruit. Maximus, once back in Rome, manages to enter a gladiator troop manned by one Proximo, the late Oliver Reed. This little group of circus freaks will provide Maximus with the proper cover through which he can maneuver himself into the hearts of Rome's people. Not only is the man driven by revenge but he is also cocky enough to believe that he has what it takes to accomplish the sort of feats no other gladiator has been able to accomplish. By his side is Juba (Djimon Hounsou), the proverbial Black voice of wisdom. If not for Will Smith's more unfortunately stereotypical role in Legend of Bagger Vance, this would have been the kind of role that would have garnered the deserved scorn of people like Spike Lee.For two hours, Scott inundates us with endless arena fireworks that would serve the acrobatics of the Rock and Hulk Hogan to a much better effect. The characterization of Crowe's character amounts to nothing more than a cocksure man, full of false bravado, whose only apparent skill is to raise his arm into the air and scream for his men to surge into battle. He is the kind of screen character who wages war against hundreds of foes within the course of a movie and manages to dispose of all of them with relative ease. He is also the kind of superhero archetype that garners the admiration of young boys like Lucius, something which causes our dear Commodus to go even further over the edge.Scott is to be admired in the end for at least not being a hypocrite, as he practices what he preaches. Since the citizens of Rome seem only to live for bloodlust, Scott manages to paint Gladiator as nothing else than that: entertainment geared for audiences whose sole interest is seeing men and tigers beat the s**t out of each other for three hours. But if this is all there was to the film then one would see little complaints from my person but Scott makes the mistake of filling his film with arty flourishes.The film opens with Maximus walking across a field, his hands slowly caressing tall blades of grass. These flashbacks, along with various cutaways to fast-moving skyscapes, amount to nothing more than pretentious attempts to add artistic credibility to an otherwise sophomoric film. Its as if he is aware of the fact that his film is devoid of any three-dimensional resonance that he tries to quickly interject soft touches of humanity into the proceedings. The end result is nothing less than visual illiteracy, ringing completely false and cowardly.When it comes to epics none come better than Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev or Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, two masterworks from Russia's greatest directors that fully captured the three-dimensional scope of war. The bad guys in these films, unlike the one played by Phoenix in Gladiator, are the kinds of foes whose selfishly malicious journeys are never cartoonishly drawn. The landscapes created by the Russian masters were poetic and grand, full of visual and emotional urgency. Scott's film is amounts to nothing more than being beat over the head by a club for three hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has a very inspiring story. The portrayal of the protagonist Russel Crowe forces the audience to love him, understand his sufferings and pray for his victory. That family is the most important has been echoed continuously in the film. The protagonist feels destroyed and yearns to die once he learns that his family died. The movie has also portrayed loyalty to your nation as being of the utmost importance. He carried on inspite of all his suffering, fought hard and cleverly in order to save the Roman Empire.The film has beautiful scenic depictions. The scenes which show the afterlife make it look like the perfect place to be. The way in which home and family is described by Crowe, even though describing the ordinary, makes it appear like the perfect place to be. The music is pretty enchanting as well and gives the film a nice look.The fighting scenes give a description of the Roman Empire in the ancient times. It gives a brilliant description of the greatness of the Colosseum. The fights are made to appear royal. It is a pleasure watching those fights and getting a feel of history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An epic, awe-inspiring movie which thankfully shows us that Hollywood hasn't forgotten how to make good movies anymore, this is a film which has it all, from intrigue to suspense to violence to subtle romance. Forget any of the other CGI-laden rubbish filling out the multiplexes, this is a film which simply has to be seen at the cinema - or alternatively on a very big television screen indeed. Due to the fact that this film was hyped up incredibly, it doesn't actually live up to the hype, but nothing could have done. GLADIATOR is pure, old-fashioned escapism, nothing less.For once, the acting is totally flawless. Russell Crowe comes out of nowhere to give us a powerful, sensitive action hero, able to emote without the use of dialogue, delivering his lines when needed with a gruff British accent. Crowe is a revelation here - I hated him in VIRTUOSITY, but his acting is excellent and finely judged, right up there with the brooding intensity of De Niro or Pacino. He is well supported by a varied cast, including Connie Nielsen who makes a very sultry and alluring love interest. Joaquin Phoenix makes his snivelling, whining emperor truly despicable, easily soaking up the entire audience's hatred. Oliver Reed is also very good in what was to be his final role, as the proud but friendly slave owner who becomes Maximus' friend. Richard Harris lends an air of nobility and authenticity in his brief role as the dying emperor Caesar, while noted British actors Derek Jacobi and David Hemmings appear as senators.Okay, so the plot of revenge is a fairly clichd one and the plot here is reminiscent of a whole number of other films, as well as MACBETH, but it is given added power and resonance by the great acting. The music score is also absolutely excellent and really adds to this film's atmosphere. Physically, it is beautifully made and extremely realistic - you constantly feel that you're in Rome itself. Everything is epic and the whole film is chock-full of grandeur. It looks lovely, it sounds lovely, hell, it is lovely.Director Ridley Scott doesn't skimp on the gore front either, leaving in some gruesome shots of people being cut in half, being decapitated and blood spraying in the air and all over the place. The battle scenes are the highlight of the film and are filmed in a weird way - sometimes sped up, sometimes slowed down - which make them so realistic that you do feel like you're there. They're also very exciting, with Crowe taking on ferocious tigers, masked hulking warriors, and chariots too. The twists and turns in the plot are unexpected and there's a moving, poignant ending giving this film an extra element. Old-fashioned, well-crafted and truly splendid - any movie fan owes it to themselves to see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GLADIATOR! Strength &amp; Honor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course this is a late review. This is for the younger people or the audience who hasn't viewed this amazing movie. The story line itself is just simply awesome. Also who doesn't want to watch a movie with Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott as the director. They both made and starred in many acclaimed movies. This movie was made in 2000 and is still better than other movies out there! It really explains about the Roman Empire and the power they had as well as their weaknesses. It shows that and it also doesn't sway away from the main story. It doesn't just show a man for revenge, it goes deeper about his life and honor. His role as a general and the responsibilities with the surrounding people. The cinematography can't be explained...there is too many positive factors! You will never take your eye off the screen! There is always a climax in every scene and it just goes on and on! Get ready to be amazed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action and a great technical aspect, but I did not care for any of the characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator was one of the films I grew up with as a kid. However, as I grew older, I stopped watching it, and I've gone several years without watching it. I wanted to check it out to see if I would still like it as much as I did when I was younger. When I finally re-watched it after all these years, I felt like it didn't hold up. Its fighting and technical aspects were very good, but I could not care about Maximus's character.After a Roman general named Maximus is about to become Emperor of Rome, he is betrayed by his brother named Commodus who murders his family. He is forced into slavery where he comes back as a Gladiator and fights his way up to seek his revenge.The action is definitely the highlight of this film. I think that it's really good. The fights aren't choreographed all too well since they have shaky cam, but I think the fights were shot that way on purpose to show how Gladiators fought by using sheer aggression and desperation. Every time a character gets stabbed, you feel the pain as the stab always feels very realistic without ever feeling over-the-top or ridiculous. The Coliseum looks realistic, and it gave the fights a claustrophobic feeling. During one fighting sequence, they were reenacting "The Battle of Zama". A large number of Gladiators were in the middle of the Coliseum and they were surrounded by enemies in chariots. Shortly after the battle started, a few Gladiators were quickly killed off, and it gave the fighting a lot of tension after the viewer learned how much of a disadvantage Maximus had. That was my favorite fight scene in the film.Considering that Ridley Scott is usually pretty good with cinematography (Blade Runner and Black Hawk Down), I had no concern about the cinematography, and I expected it to be really good. I was right. The city of Rome was perfectly captured in the film. Many tableau's of Rome and the Coliseum were beautiful to look at. Rome looked vast, majestic, and full of people. Even the CGI shots were impressive and blended into the film seamlessly. They hold up pretty well today. The only issue I have with the film on a technical level was with its soundtrack that was composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. Some songs felt like they were ripped off of by many other action films. Especially the parts where it sounded like someone was singing in a different language. I've heard that in many other films before and it's starting to feel a bit unoriginal. Other than that, the film worked pretty well from a technical standpoint.I don't think that Russell Crowe should've won an Oscar. His performance wasn't bad. Crowe himself is fine. However, his role is about as basic as you can get for a tough guy role. Any actor with some talent could've done what he did. Speaking of Maximus's character, I could not care for him at all. He's just dour and dull for the entire film, even before his family is killed off. He's bland and unsympathetic from the get-go, and he only gets more revenge filled as the movie continues on. I was just given a shell of a character to try and get behind. I could not care for his character for that reason. I could not care about any of the other protagonists in the film. When a main character died, I didn't care that much for them as I felt like I had just been introduced to them. Their deaths just sort of came and went by. Also, I was not as moved by its ending as I expected I would be before going into this film.Looking around a bit, I've seen several reviewers bring up that its plot of betrayal and revenge has been done to death. If I felt that way, I would most likely have a bigger issue with sympathizing with Maximus. As of now, however, I can't think of any movies which borrowed its plot line that came out before this one was released, and I have yet to see any reviewers name any films with a similar plot as this one. So, until I do, I'm going to put that criticism aside.In conclusion, I wasn't a fan of this movie. It's a real shame, because I was hoping that I could relive my childhood memories of it. I can appreciate it for impressing me with its action and its technical aspect. The action was definitely the highlight of the film, and Rome was also very beautiful to look at. However, much of it seemed wasted since it failed in the most important area: Its characters. Maximus felt like a very generic shell of a character and he seemed very uninteresting. I will always love Ridley Scott though, even though I disliked one of his most popular films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical accuracy not much, but an amazing project non the less.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Gladiator be now about half of a generation old I though it was time to review this great flick and the impact to the movies in general. As it is quit known it is a fictionalize as Game of Thrones ,but unlike many historical movies that doesn't bother me much for this flick literally brought the interest for the classical world and let's face it the movie is *beeping* awesome and from the setting alone it is shown the huge work it was put into the project.The story is center to the Roman General Maximus Desimus Marinious ,who after the Emperor Commodus ascends the throne ,he is betray by him and now he has only one goal in life, to kill Commodus himself! The great think it is that though heavily fictionalized the characters ideals and way of thinking is compatible with what Romans had as base for their behavior. They performance although, which are all great don't harm the either! My only small complain is that the gladiatorial fights aren't very accurate (but are awesome) ,dispite that what saves them from criticism is the big budget which make the spectacle nothing short of wow inspiring.Now to the main subject of this review, the increase of mainstream audience for the classical era. When Gladiator came out ,the common people wasn't very kin in Classical history and often dismissed it and studios also didn't give much interest to the sword and sandal genre thinking of it a think of the past. Then this flick made 457,6 million dollars world wide and won five Oscars ,so after EVERYONE wanted a piece of the pie. This renew interest brought us HBO Rome, Spartacus: Blood and Sand, 300 and so on. Now it also borough and awful creations like Gods of Egypt, the remake of Ben-Hur and some more, but if this the price for the people to get started in learning history so be it.Over all I have a soft spot for this film and it truly make me go find out more about the people who ones lived and their actions, tragedies and greatest achievements. Like it or not Gladiator make history mainstream in the pop culture.</fullReview>

Crowe portrays the fictional character, loyal Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when Commodus, the ambitious son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murders of his family and his emperor.In AD 180, Hispano-Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius leads the Roman army to a decisive victory against the Germanic tribes near Vindobona, ending a long war on the Roman frontier and winning the favor of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Maximus, weary of battle, desires to retire to his Spanish farm estate, but the Emperor tells him that his own son and heir to the throne, Commodus, is unfit to rule and so appoints Maximus as regent to help save Rome from corruption. Marcus Aurelius tells Commodus that he will not be emperor; Commodus murders him in a fit of rage and becomes the Emperor of Rome.</fullReview>

However, I need to be careful where I get all these information from, make sure is trustworthy. By learning wisdom of trustworthy information.

		<fullReview>There is nothing too special about this film. It is your typical revenge and honor story. Highly predictable and low on suspense. There is never a question how the movie will end. There is some enjoyable action throughout, but nothing is that exciting. It is a rather slow moving story that doesn't really pay off. The movie is good, but not deserving of being in the mid 8's, where it currently stands.There is a lack of depth to the story. We hate the emperor's son and cheer for Maximus all out of obligation; there is no true feeling to the story. This is worth seeing once, but probably never again. It's good, not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Review and Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A General who is tired of war wants nothing more than to be with his family; a wife and a son in Spain. His name is Maximus (Russell Crowe). Since Emperor Marcus Aurelius became the Caesar, General Maximus has been at his loyal command. He has sworn his utmost allegiance to Emperor Marcus who trusts -- not even his own son, Commodus, the rightful heir -- the general to lead Rome. To take his place as Caesar. It was soon after this conversation that Emperor Marcus is announced dead. Commodus explains to Maximus that it was of "natural causes," when in truth it was he, Commodus, that killed the emperor. Having caught wind of the concursion between father and general, Commodus arranged for General Maximus to be disposed of -- permanently.After escaping the secret execution, Maximus rides home to only find his farmland and family burnt and crucified. In complete distraught and sadness, he faints and is picked up by a slave caravan and is taken to Zucchabar, where he begins his new battles, not as a general, but as a slave.This movie has many qualities that makes it a "complete" movie. It has a story, as simple as it may be, that is moving and full of action, conspiracy, and beautiful filming techniques. In terms of slavery, this movie does a pretty darn good job at representing the most intriguing form of Roman slavery. Gladiators.In Roman history, a lot of times slaves were picked up due to abandonment, such as children with no guardians. Maximus was picked up and became a slave. With the Romans, which the movie portrayed, anyone that was a slave was equal in slavery means. In other words, their prices did not vary due to skin color or race. All slaves had an equal price, unless certain arrangements were made, such as doubling the price of gladiators.What I found interesting was the idea of winning over the crowed will get your freedom. When Maximus completed his first alone fight, he yelled at the spectators, "Are you not entertained?" This caught the attention of a man. He would tell the ex-general how to be a gladiator and earn his freedom. He could not kill quickly. He had to win the crowed. He had to get the people on his side for "the mob is Rome."Throughout the movie there is various spiritual references. An example being when one of the slaves wishes good luck to Maximus for "red is god's color." We also see that Maximus has visions of going to meet his family in the afterlife or Elysium. This might have been meant for a form of foreshadowing.There are many positive takes from this movie in forms of character and vengeance. Right away we know the Maximus is a man of honor. He is incorruptible. Turning down a life of riches and fame because it is not his beliefs and violates any and all of his principles. Also let us not forget the fact that with the lesson of good and evil, Commodus gets a rude awakening.Lucille, Commodus's sister, knew Maximus from the past. She paid him a visit before his next time in the arena. They were conversing about the power of Rome when Maximus exclaimed, "I am a slave. What possible difference can I make?" I found this a little disturbing. He has gone all this way to fight and become a gladiator to seek his vengeance, and then he makes a comment like this. It sounds as if he has given up. Lucille assures him he can. That he will change Rome. He will bring the greatness that Rome has envisioned for so long. He did. Maximus brought honor to the city. It made the people see a true warrior. A true soldier. Maximus has struck the hearts of many for he was General that was brought down to a slave and became an honorable gladiator that changed the fate of Rome.No matter what. Slave or not. Anyone can make a difference. Anyone can change something if they so desired. Their hearts and minds have to be set and then just then will they achieve something of greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Echoes in Eternity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was released over a decade ago, and at that time I enjoyed it as a good film with a deep message but didn't pay too much attention to its deeper meanings beyond that. Today, this film takes on even more depth to me personally. Back then in ancient times it was brutal but today, in this century, things haven't changed much in regards to shallow people in power. People who have power and abuse it. His story isn't unique or all that rare but his story is the foundation for what kind of world we never seem to be evolving from or transcending from. Surrounded still by tyrants and warmongers. This is not a political statement, it's just how things are. Sadly. I know there are negative reviews of this film, but ignore those negative reviews. They don't understand the storyteller or the sheer depth this film provides. It's in fact a study into human nature itself. The overwhelming odds and the determination to seek any semblance of what is right. Even if the Gladiator has to do so from the next life. I highly recommend this film. It speaks the truth that what we do in life echoes in eternity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this movie Maximus's troubles begin after he has conquered the tribes of Germania and learns that Caesar has chosen him. When Caesar's son finds out, he grabs power for himself with brutality. Maximus gets away but is sold into slavery, ending up as a gladiator in Rome, where he fights his way to the top and confronts Caesars son. Russel Crowe as Maximus won best actor for his role in this movie because of his use of emotion to try to regain his title and get out of the arena alive. In my opinion it is one of my favorite movies due to the gory fighting while also following a plot line where Maximus needs to find revenge for what Commodus did to him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is a great movie full of good action with a compelling plot. It pulls the people watching into the movie through the colorful characters. Although the plot of this movie is good and it brings the characters to life, there are some principles in the movie that do not convey a worldview that is wholesome. From a Christian Perspective, the whole plot of the movie is about revenge. The Bible in many places says that revenge is not for us to take. Romans 12:19 says that Revenge is the Lord's and the Lord's only. When we take revenge for ourselves, it only ends in disaster. Like in the movie, it ends in death and there is nothing for us in the end. Deuteronomy 32:35 says 'Vengeance is Mine, and retribution, In due time their foot will slip; For the day of their calamity is near, And the impending things are hastening upon them.' Any sort of revenge will end in disaster. At the ending of the movie, no one really won.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Epicly April got off to a, well, epic start with my viewing of Gladiator. The Academy Award Best Picture winner for 2000 was definitely grand in scale. Ridley Scott has turned in an illustrious career making impressive films, and Gladiator certainly belongs in this category. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix lead the cast in this tale of revenge against a corrupt Emporer. A gripping tale of avenging the death of one's family, Gladiator keeps audiences on the edge of their seats through the entire 2.5-hour film. Maximus (Russel Crowe) is a adored General for the Roman army. He is even loved by the aging Emporer Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). When Aurelius tells his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) that he intends to crown Maximus Emporer over his own blood, Commodus takes this as the ultimate betrayal. After murdering his own father, Commodus assumes power, as no one knew of Marcus Aurelius' intentions to crown Maximus. Commodus then goes on to condemn Maximus to death and sends henchmen to murder his family. Defying odds, Maximus escapes his execution and hurries back in an attempt to save his wife and child. Too late to save them, Maximus is taken into slavery and trained as a gladiator. Maximus gets through his days by hoping that he will eventually be able to exact revenge against Commodus and fulfill his own Emporer, Marcus Aurelius', dying wish. The day finally comes in which Maximus' gladiator troupe is called to fight in the coliseum of Emporer Commodus to participate in a marathon of gladiator challenges. Joining together with Senator Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) who wishes to bring democracy to Rome, and Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) daughter to Marcus Aurelius and sister to Commodus who bore Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark) heir to the throne of his Uncle and is deathly afraid of her brother, the gang of misfits attempts to bring about the demise of Commodus. Gladiator looks like the spectacle you would imagine it to look like. The sounds and score were perfect for the film and made you feel like you needed to wipe the sand out of your eyes because you were so involved in the action. My favorite part, like others I'm sure, was the scene with Russel Crowe fighting the tigers in the coliseum. The scene looked like reality and thankfully wasn't bogged down with CGI. Russel Crowe played the brooding warrior exceptionally and was matched in talent with Joaquin Phoenix's sanctimonious turn as the self- righteous Emporer. Gladiator was a real tour-de-force as far as the acting was concerned. Another stand out was the stark colors sprinkled throughout the film, especially in the costumes. Janty Yates certainly pulled all the stops designing the costumes worn in this epic and was more than worthy of her Oscar for Best Costume Design. It is the scenes in the coliseum that show just how many extras were used in this movie and acts as further proof that Ridley Scott more than deserved the gold statuette for Best Director he took home from the 2000 Oscar ceremony. Everything came together so well in Gladiator that I can more than see why audiences and critics alike have few negative words for this film. Gladiator is driven by the vehicle of revenge. Maximus wants nothing more than to kill Commodus, both because he is responsible for the death of Maximus' own wife and child, and because it was the wish of Marcus Aurelius for Commodus to die and Maximus to take the thrown. Seeking revenge gives Maximus' life purpose after his escape from death and the loss of his family. Maximus' laser focus on revenge fuels every aspect of Maximus' day and one is left to wonder if this idea of revenge turns into an obsession and if it is healthy. Granted, Maximus gives his life purpose with the goal of revenge, but he is set upon killing which never seems to right any wrongs. The theme works in this film and is paced so well that the audience is engaged throughout the entire film. I am happy that a month of viewing epics had brought me Gladiator, a film I am guaranteed to see again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Extraordinary Feat Of Epic Filmmaking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ancient Rome comes alive in breathtaking detail in Ridley Scott's historical epic that presents the esteemed filmmaker in sublime form for Gladiator is truly monumental in both scope of its ambition &amp; scale of its production, is easily amongst the greatest spectacles to surface on the big screen, and is an extraordinary feat of its genre that not only scores high marks in its technical aspects but is equally accomplished in the storytelling department, thus succeeding as a masterpiece of epic filmmaking that delivers on all fronts.The story of Gladiator follows Maximus Decimus Meridius, a loyal general who after leading the Roman army to victory in a decisive battle finds himself betrayed when Commodus (son of the Emperor) murders his father &amp; takes the throne for himself. Arrested &amp; sentenced to death, Maximus manages to escape but is unable to save his family and is then taken captive by slavers. Driven by retribution, the General who became a slave then trains as a gladiator and ultimately returns to Rome to avenge the murder of his family as well as his King.Directed by Ridley Scott, Gladiator is the perfect exemplification of all his trademarks and is undoubtedly his finest output since the 1979 horror classic, Alien, for the level of detail in every frame of this fable is absolutely staggering. His direction also exhibits a much better control on the narrative elements than most of his works and for a historical drama, it is expertly paced. The screenplay packs in an interesting set of characters, their arc is methodically progressed, and despite the subplots related to supporting figures, the focus remains on Maximus throughout its runtime.As far as elements of technical filmmaking go, Gladiator is nothing short of a marvel. Production design team does a magnificent job in putting up set pieces that are grand, imposing &amp; meticulously refined with the real standout being the Colosseum itself which is undeniably a sight to behold. The culture, politics &amp; life within the Roman Empire is illustrated in splendid detail. Costumes, artefacts &amp; other props are in sync with the timeline its story is set in but it also incorporates a slightly urban touch to it that brings a flavour of its own into the picture and enhances the look &amp; feel of the whole imagery.Cinematography makes precise use of nearly all the techniques in the book at just the right moments whether it's the slow-mo shots, chaotic camera-work, time-lapse photography, panning shots, close-ups, zoom-ins &amp; zoom-outs, and the reason why every bit of it works is because none of it is overused. Even the colour palette ranges from cold to warm tones, numerous filters are used for differentiating locations, and lighting is pitch-perfect. Editing provides a steady pace to the whole narrative plus the unfolding of events is effectively controlled considering that its 155 minutes of runtime never becomes an issue.Visual effects team also deserves kudos for restoring the Colosseum to the glory of its heyday with CGI assistance but its use is still minimal for most of the effects in the picture are practical yet it all looks incredibly authentic. However, what really uplifts the entire experience and provides Gladiator its sense of grandness is Hans Zimmer's majestic score for it comprises of tracks that are rousing &amp; resonant and effortlessly match the film's colossal magnitude. The best bits are saved for battle sequences but that doesn't mean the soundtrack isn't able to enrich other moments for it, as a whole, remains one of the most celebrated compositions of Zimmer's career.Coming to the performances, Gladiator features a reliable cast in Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielson, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, Richard Harris &amp; others. Leading from the front is Crowe in what still remains his finest work to date. The ruggedness of his voice combined with the comfort Crowe exhibits in the skin of Maximus makes him a commanding figure worthy of respect and impressive enough for viewers to invest their emotions in. Phoenix is thoroughly committed to his role and makes up for an interesting antagonist. Nielson chips in with a terrific input to stand out in a cast filled with men while Reed, Jacobi &amp; Hounsou play their given roles in a wise manner.On an overall scale, Gladiator manages to live up to its larger- than-life story of a general who became a slave who became a gladiator who defied an emperor and is thematically rich, technically accomplished &amp; spectacularly entertaining from beginning to end. Ingeniously directed, deftly written, gorgeously photographed, smartly edited, outstandingly scored &amp; strongly performed, this epic is engaging from the first frame, is brought to life with great care &amp; attention to detail, and benefits immensely from an assured filmmaker at helm. Holding back nothing, packed with memorable quotes and boasting many astounding moments over the course of its runtime, Gladiator is a cinematic treasure that's worthy of all its accolades. One hundred percent recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some numbers just for fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 'reconstitution' of the battle of Carthage between gladiators &amp; legionnaires of Scipion is very uplifting. I watch it as some kind of motivation when facing a challenge where my odds are under average. The last time, just for fun, I've decided to count the 'casualties' on both sides. I know some of you are extremely good with numbers and according to the best I can do: I've count 21 gladiators (it's not easy). 6 chariots will get in, each one having 2 men or women on board. During the sequence, you'll not see more than 3 chariots at a time, and 'during the battle', you'll not see the entire arena neither. Only 4 gladiators are kill by the legionnaires at the beginning. Maximus kills 3 legionnaires. Something a bit weird is the use of women in reconstitution fights. From the 60s to 200 AD, female gladiators appear, as "exotic markers of exceptionally lavish spectacle" (Wikipedia). It reminds me a bit about Muammar Gaddafi's use of sexy female's bodyguards: 'Kadafettes'. Listen well, I don't underestimate women in Arenas...It's clear that many women can fight &amp; be bodyguards, but c'mon the use of Pinups (or Drag Queens as security) is an insult. It's a message to the outside world +- like 'You're a bunch of minus, so I only need a few gogo dancers to protect me? Most of these women claim rape after Gaddafi's Nemesis ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott's finest film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is a tour de force in action and adventure. It brings you back in time to the best of its ability and strives to deliver heart- pounding action and terrific fight scenes. Russell Crowe plays Maximus, a Roman general betrayed with his family murdered by an emperor's corrupt son, who he to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge. This is an epic that fancies the costumes and sets more than the actual story, but excels in entertainment and style. Russell Crowe gives a strong performance, while Ridley Scott directs the film in a typical style that allows us to soak up the time period and absorb the action and bloodshed in front of us. While there are many goofs and laughable moments, "Gladiator" remains a solid film that entertains the audience for its entire runtime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful acting makes this an epic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An impeccable film set in ancient Rome sends us on an emotional, adventurous, and entertaining journey. Maximus (Russell Crowe) leads the Roman legions to victory in their final battle against the Germanic tribes and longs for nothing more than seeing his wife and son back in Spain. Knowing Maximus owes him his loyalty, the Emperor audaciously over looks his son and rightful heir to the thrown and ask Maximus to succeed him. His son hearing about this plots for Maximus to be killed. Though Maximus escapes his assassin, he gets back to Spain only to find his wife and son murdered by the Emperor's son's orders leaving him devastated and broken. He is then sent into slavery to become a Gladiator and if that's not enough, he has to fight and entertain the very man who killed his family. Will he get his revenge? This is one of my favorite films of all time. It's absolutely worth your time.Spiritual Content: Many references to "the gods." Maximus talks about the "Elysian Fields," a paradise of classical mythology. Maximus carries small statues to represent his family and ancestors and prays to them. The film several times shows Maximus imagining meeting his family in the afterlife, symbolized by going through a door into wide, green fields.Sexual Content: Nothing explicit. There is a barely hinted-at past between Maximus and Lucilla, and the film leaves open the question of whether Lucilla's son, Lucius, is Maximus' child. A gladiator master asks a man, "What do you want, a girl? A boy?" Commodus makes several incestuous advances against his sister, Lucilla.Violent Content: Frequent and extreme. The film opens with a headless Roman soldier on horseback and the Germanic leader taunting the Romans with the soldier's head. Opening battle scene shows men impaled by spears, pinned to trees by arrows, and frequent killing by sword. Gladiatorial combat features just about every possible way to kill a man short of nuclear weapons. To his credit, Director Scott does not dwell on gore; once the point is made that a man has been killed, the camera moves elsewhere. Still, the gruesome images burn deep.Crude or Profane Language: A woman is called a b--ch. One s-word.Drug and Alcohol Content: Little. Emperor drinks wine.Summary: Gladiator is a great film cinematically. The acting is powerful and the story is strong, even if it is a bit of a rehash of the Ben-Hur story?without the redemptive ending. Still, I left the theater feeling vaguely ill-at-ease, and it took me several hours to figure out why. I then realized that the degeneracy shown on screen?Emperor Commodus happily clapping his hands as a gladiator is decapitated, the crowd roaring its blood-lust?is too close to some forms of entertainment today, particularly professional wrestling. The gladiators of Rome took on certain contrived personalities, and gladiatorial combat was intended to tell some sort of story, just like today's equivalent of gladiatorial entertainment. And as the crowd's appetite was whetted by increasingly bizarre and violent combat, so too are today's wrestling maniacs. Gladiator serves as an object lesson as to what can happen to a society that proceeds down such a violent path. The extreme violence used to create that lesson, however, prohibits children and teens (and will dissuade many adults) from getting a chance to experience it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Synopsis Does Not Do It Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I was very reluctant to watch this movie. I knew that it had gotten great reviews but when I read the summary, I thought it would be rather bland. Before I go on further, I must divulge that I am more of a Sci-fi person so I generally find historical films such as "Braveheart" or "Schindler's List" less appealing. Therefore, Gladiator never made it to the top of my watch-list.BIG MISTAKE!On a whim I decided to watch this movie and I fell in love with it immediately. I knew Russell Crowe from "A Beautiful Mind" and "Les Mis" but I didn't find him particularly memorable. This movie completely changed my mind on that and now I feel obligated to watch those movies again. The versatility of his glance still leaves me in awe. He perfectly captures the heroic characteristics of Maximus but also brings out the primitive evil of mankind. I am getting shivers just thinking about it.Joaquin Phoenix also makes a great Commodus as he delivers not only as an antagonist but as a leader and a son.And don't get me started on the sound track. If epicness could be liquefied and poured into your ears, this would be it. I have always been a Hans Zimmer fan for a very long time but I revere him so much more now that I've watched "Gladiator".Finally onto plot, the movie is lengthy but completely worth the while. The story is complete and logically structured. It plays your emotions with every plot-twist and keeps your heart at its toes. The intense battle and fight scenes, although violent, are packed with meaning and symbolism. Even an emotional tough-nut such as myself couldn't prevent tears from shedding at the end.Do not listen to the oversimplified summary, instead take the chance and watch this movie. You will not regret one minute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the elements of a great tragedy with a side dish of critique of democracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a story of love, greed, loyalty, revenge, sex, betrayal and camaraderie all packed into a nearly 3hr movie. What more could you want? Acting is top notch, scenery and visuals are fantastic, pacing is spot on. The many elements of the story are hardly original but they come neatly together to make this movie into a masterpiece.Yet I think what captures the audience in this movie is deeper than that. One sits through the movie feeling, knowing that there really is no resolution for our protagonist at the end. Sure he'll get his revenge and overcome the odds, kill the bad guy and die peacefully believing he'll be reunited with his lost loved ones yet something is missing. Apart from the small diatribe about giving power to Roman citizens and restoring democracy, so much of it feels like it's been done in vain. If one wasn't overly invested in the death of the evil emperor, I can't see where that resolution would come. Strangely enough, this is a better movie for it. I compare it to Troy in this aspect.The wholesome/moral/upright part of the story about a good man avenging the gruesome murder of his family while central to the course of events, doesn't lend itself to an epic finale where all wrongs will be righted and where justice would prevail. No wrong in this instance can truly be righted and what we are asked to accept as justice is ambiguous and less than fulfilling to say the least which I think is all for the better. This is not the epic story of the life of Ramesses II, this is Shelley's Ozymandias ridiculing our notions of greatness as The Gladiator lacks one thing he wants, a simple life with his family, to die of old age in his bed during his sleep yet every step of his life he's pushed by external forces to rise to a challenge he would rather avoid.He's not really a good guy in the classical sense either. He's a Roman General which means he's been told to go and kill hundreds if not thousands of people to invade their land, pillage their resources and ironically enslave them as cheap labor or for recreational purposes. This rings true for many of the other characters as well. The revered emperor who neglected and abused his son having the nerve to chastise him for his "immorality" and incompetence, whose actions in raising the poor kid turned Commodus into a man whose ambition and thirst for greatness and power can't be satisfied until all is obedient and subservient to his power, his vision, his ambition. The lovely princess Lucille whose own desire for power and survival skills extend to conspiring to kill her brother. The senate, a corrupt bunch of politicians hiding behind the veil of democracy and claim of representing the people lavishly living off the finances of Rome. Last but not least, the people of Rome who have no qualms about being entertained by slaves being forced to murder each other for their entertainment, trusted by the "wise" emperor to make decisions for the well being of themselves and other Romans. This is where the critique of democracy kicks in, contrasted with Commodus' ambition for greatness, his drive for actualizing his vision for Rome these masses of Romans are only interested in their illusions of democracy, in their misguided virtues, in their violent sports and in their desire to feel victorious against the "barbarians", the end of the movie becomes somewhat anticlimactic with the thought. One could get political and start drawing parallels between this and the Rome of our era, United States, but I believe this review has gone long enough already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very riveting and entertaining epic brought together by Ridley Scott</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by critically-acclaimed director Ridley Scott comes an historical epic action flick that embraces one of the most powerful tales of revenge ever put together on screen. Set in 180 A.D, this movie follows Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius (played by Russell Crowe) in one of the most powerful Roman empires, who chosen by the favor of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (played by Richard Harris) to the throne of the Roman republic. This sparks incredible jealous in this son Commodus (played by Joaquin Phoenix) who the emperor deems as unsuitable for the job. Consumed with anger, Commodus murders his fathers and sends an army to murder the wife and child of Maximus. Vowing revenge of Commodus, Maxmius works his way up to the gladiator rank by fighting against the most powerful spartans in the gladiator arena, and his effort eventually leads to the fight of his life. Director Ridley Scott really outdone himself with this enthralling epic, shining more effort and incredible direction from his 'Alien' franchise. Scott polishes this film with a captivating story and masterful script that fuels with film from to start. Opening with an intense and harrowing battle scene between the Roman army and the Greek army that leads to countless bloodshed, the Gladiator boasts a story with such depth and energy, and uses some powerful characters like the main antagonist who is brought to life by the tour-de-force performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Commodus frightens audiences with his cruel and unsettling demeanor, and Joaquin Phoenix boasts such energy into this character, he makes it so believable. Russell Crowe also grabs the spotlight with his performance as the main character Maximus. While the film may not have the power to fill in for its occasionally humdrum pacing, it fuels its plot with some great writing and strives a strong narrative that audiences will not be given much of a choice than to sit through it.Gladiator is arguably Ridley Scott's best picture and one of the best historical epics put on screen. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are both outstanding in this film and deserve a round of applause. This is a film is worth watching for most, but those who are sensitive to graphic and bloody combat may want to stay away from this one.</fullReview>

There he enjoys success as the greatest gladiator. The film shows how betrayal can be destructive, and how the brave will conquer, while the coward will weep.The Film, besides all then awesome sets, costumes and acting, the Action Sequences are spectacular, and will definitely leave you entertained. Ridleys Scotts Greatest Epic, proves to be one of the greatest films of the 2000s, and probably the best film of 2000. Ridley Scott's direction is great. If another person directed this film, it would be dull and boring. But not with Ridley. He Captures the Exctiment, the Pain, and the bravery of the Characters as the Film goes on.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A roman general seeks revenge for his murdered family.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Ridley Scott, the hit blockbuster film Gladiator, is an epic tale of a man who lost everything he once held dear and decides he must fight back even if it means going against the most powerful man in Rome. The film opens with visions of a man walking through a field trying to get to his family on the other side. But we are soon whisked away from the serenity of the farm and into the harsh reality of a battlefield. Here, we meet Maximus (Russell Crowe) who is the well respected general of the Roman army. We soon come to find out that he is the trusted adviser to Caesar Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) which doesn't sit well with the son of the Caesar, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). From this point on the story unfolds into one of action, manipulation, trust, and dignity. The moral of the story starts to unveil itself throughout the story and even makes you question how you're living your own life. Overall the movie is one that pulls at the heart and though it is somewhat lengthy running at 2 hours and 35 minutes, it is definitely worth watching fully. Scott brings the glory of Rome to life through this movie, with the help of a little CGI of course. Russell Crowe and his fellow costars assist Scott through their tremendous acting and without them, it wouldn't have been such an heartfelt tale of finding oneself.</fullReview>

It is like with many other films. I find that this movie shows real character, amazing battle scenes which do not take the attention away from the narrative. I liked being immersed in an epoch I know nothing about. I don't know if it is historically correct and I suspect it is not, but still it is a beautiful movie about real (well, in fact fictional) heroes, how can you go wrong :) Of course I will recommend this to others, to kids and grown ups alike.

		<fullReview>In the world many people envy each other through the gain for power and fame much like the movie the "Gladiator". In this movie a well known and respected General by the name of Maximus, was appointed the next heir of the Roman Empire by the Ceasar Marcus Aurelius while on his deathbed. Marcus Aurelius son, Commodus became so angry that he was not chosen. Commodus then killed his Father and appointed himself King. Commodus sent furious soldiers to capture Maximus and kill his family but before he could save his family they died. He was captured by slave owners and forced to fight in the Gladiator games for his freedom. Maximus did not care about becoming the next Gladiator he wanted to reach the top to face the King so he could let the world know who killed the former Marcus Aurelius and gain his honor before death. The "Gladiator" shared with us the struggle one went through when losing everything and fighting to prove something in hope to gain everything. Maximus had few loved ones and lost it all because of the betrayal of someone that was his friend but envied until death. Maximus faced a struggle to fight in the Gladiator games but continued to prove himself in this movie by display humility and taking the stand to fight for something and proving what was righteous. Maximus rose to the top and showed the world who was wrong all the way to his death. This movie was such a great movie and displayed a lot of moral and ethics to show how patience and determination can lead you to do the right things and envy plus murder for the want of power can cause you your life. I really love this movie it is by far my favorite classical Ancient Greek Movie. I watch this movie every time it's is on cable no matter the repetition or if it is in the middle of the story. I believe every inch of this movie is worth seeing and I give it a 10!</fullReview>

It's great to see the actor behind The Master and Her deliver such a great performance early on in his career, before he was as acclaimed as he is now. He makes the character never wholly evil, and you can understand where his pain comes from. It's a great performance, although at times his writing is sketchy (as is the whole film's).

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's "Gladiator" which was published in the year 2000,is the kind of movie upon which Hollywood once built its reputation but rarely produces anymore.It contained gorgeous scenery,impressive set design,and an epic storyline. Russell Crowe is Maximus, a popular general in the emperor Marcus Aurelius's army, who begins the film by winning a great and bloody battle against the Deutch hordes thus securing the roman borders. We learn from this victory that his troops love him, as does the aging emperor (Richard Harris), who asks Maximus to take over in Rome and root out the mercenaries who are corrupting the place. But the emperor already has a son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who is a self-indulgent, cowardly layabout, with hints of an incestuous relationship with his sister. After that, Commodus, learning of the emperor's decision to name Maximus and not him as the next ruler, kills his father and orders Maximus killed. But because the movie still has another two hours to run, the killers are foiled and Maximus survives.</fullReview>

The set pieces as well as the wardrobe and mentality of the film are extremely Roman and feel authentic as anything real in this modern age. A film that was nominated and one in which will not only grip the viewer from beginning to end but resonate with the viewer for some time to come. The action sequence are authentic and very tense as is intended. The musical score is heroic and filled with epic grandeur that only further strengthen the film. Many consider this film an epic and one in which still to this day hold up to the test of time. This film as well was Oliver Reed's last film as he passed away during the filming process. Gladiator is an awe inspiring, swords and sandals film that hold back no punches in its action, its pacing or its storytelling.

		<shortDescription>Epic historical drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I love the most about this film is how it transports me directly to the Era of Ancient Rome in all of its glory. The sheer scope of this film is awe-inspiring, from the brutal battle scenes against the barbarians, to the slave markets of the Middle-East to the Colosseum of Rome. It all looks, sounds and feels real, and the era has never been more accurately represented.This is also one of Russell Crowe's crowning achievements. He fully disappears into the role of General Maximus, aptly portraying both the brilliant military leader, the anguished family man after revenge as well as the beacon of hope for the people of Rome. The story of Gladiator is his story, and a bad casting choice would have ruined the whole film. In this case it elevates it to a masterpiece territory.The rest of the actors do a fine job as well, though I've never quite gotten the appeal of Joaquin Phoenix, playing here the corrupted emperor Commodus. He's fine villain objectively, but I think he's perhaps a shade too slimy with very little charisma. I get that's the purpose, but I would have preferred a villain with a hint more backbone. Still, only a nitpick.Aside from that, it's an all-around great film with intense and well-choreographed fight scenes, interesting characters, high production values and great use of both music and colour. It's no wonder they're still talking about the soundtrack of this film.Do you like action, historical dramas or pretty much anything with convincing characters and great storytelling? Then this film is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally Saw This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took a long time but I finally saw Gladiator. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix star in a story I have seen plenty of times in movies. The story is simple. Guy in high power gets betrayed by a jealous brother and falls to the bottom and has to climb back up to gain his vengeance. How many times have I seen this? A lot. How many times does it work really well? A lot. In Gladiator it works really well. Everything from the acting to action worked in this movie.Like I said the plot is basic but it works. I have seen this movie before just with a different setting and characters. Russell Crowe is a general for the Roman Empire, Maximus, and his father who adopted him is dying wants him to take over the empire. Commodus, Phoenix, is the rightful heir to the throne because he is blood related but he takes his brother out of the picture anyway by betraying him and murdering his family. Maximus survives and becomes a Gladiator to get his revenge. I figured out the ending to this movie and most of the key plot points but it was still amazing.Russell Crowe gives an amazing performance in this movie, winning him an Oscar. Crowe has an amazing talent for acting and this was his best performance. Luckily he didn't sing. His best scene is when he finds his family dead. He has an emotional breakdown. Another when Commodus is tempting Maximus to fight and he keeps his composure. Any normal man would have broken down but he kept his cool. Maximus is a very interesting character and a natural leader. I don't know why Joaquin Phoenix's career went down the tubes but he comes through in the clutch in this movie. Commodus is one of the creepiest villains in any movie. He stalks his nephew and wants to sleep with his sister. His jealousy and anger towards Maximus drives his performance. When he is on screen its intense. His emotion escalates rather quickly. Phoenix got nominated for an Oscar and I think he deserved it. The fighting scenes in this movie were top of the line. My favorite being the one with the tigers. I saw the tiger come out and I went nuts. I was pumped and as unrealistic as it was, it was awesome. The Colosseum looked real and amazing. The lack of CGI shows and it makes the movie better. Watching this I pictured the making of the movie and the set. The sands of the Colosseum were probably real and the first section of seating was probably used with extras. The second two had to be CGI for budget common sense but the movie felt real. I watched the director's cut of this movie so it was really long. Honestly I got a little bored and most of the added in scenes I could spot out. There was a lot of filler that didn't need to be in there. I took that into account when thinking back on the movie. The regular version is probably a lot better and cleaned up but the backstory was still interesting. Character relationships are obviously very important and none was creepier than the one with Commodus and his sister. Many times in the movie he tries to kiss his sister. There comes a point where he demands she give birth to his future son. That's messed up. It shows how sick his character is. I understand power hungry but this guy was 110% crazy. Maximus is a great leader and has great relationships with his soldiers. There is the one huge guy and the other black guy he befriends and they are both incredible. Secondary characters like that are important and they do their part.Overall, Gladiator is a masterpiece and I don't know why I waited so long to see it. Hans Zimmer adds an excellent score and captures the emotional part of the movie. Ridley Scott directs this film in the right into the academy awards and he really let his stars shine. Crowe and Phoenix give it their all and help push this movie to get the WillyT Seal of Approval.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An almost perfect movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of a roman general, Maximus, who displeases his new emperor, Commodus, because he was too close to the old emperor, Commodus's father, and is sure that Commodus killed his father, which he did. So Commodus has Maximus's family killed and Maximus ends up becoming a gladiator, having to fight for his life in the arena.I really liked this movie, even though I first saw it when I was a kid and there are some pretty violent or nasty scenes, like for example when Maximus finds his wife and daughter burned and hanged in front of his house. It's full of action, and you want to know how it's going to go, if he's going to survive and if he's going to stay a slave forever.I recommend to see it, because it's beautifully played and the settings and clothes seem authentic. If I had to give the negative aspects, though, it would be that you have to have time to watch it, since it is a long movie (that is if you watch the extended version, which is obviously better and more complete). Also, if you never saw it and already saw Pirates of the Caribbean, you will be thrown off by the music. Yes, it is the same. It's not plagiarism though, both soundtracks are by Hans Zimmer. You would have the same effect while watching Lord of the Rings if you saw Braveheart, so it's not that uncommon a fact, even though in that case the movies were NOT scored by the same artist.One last thing though, if you know a lot about roman history and want to watch 'Gladiator' to see how much of the movie sticks to real events, don't. It is a great movie if you are not easily upset with inaccurate facts. For example, Commodus did not actually killed Marcus Aurelius to take his place, they reigned together for many years before Marcus died.So in general I really loved it, except for these 'minor' details, and I think it's one of those movies which everyone should have seen before ever saying they have a good cinematographic culture.</fullReview>

Movies has the best battle scenes and great hero. This is one complete movie. My favorite scene the from movie is: "My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions and loyal servant to the TRUE emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.

		<shortDescription>Good, but not for the expected reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you look on my top shelf of DVDs and Blu-Rays you will find pride of place given to "Spartacus", "Ben Hur" and "El Cid". I have told the story elsewhere about how bizarre English educational policies permanently altered my brain chemistry so that I became fetishistically fixated on sword and sandal epics and how death by being disembowelled by the sword became linked with stories of baby Jesus in a satanic miasma of adolescent confusion. In short, I like a good epic. I had therefore been looking forward to seeing "Gladiator" ever since I first heard about it. The question is, then, was it worth the wait? Short answer ? no. Long answer follows.I liked Gladiator a lot though it took me half the film to readjust my head to what I was seeing as opposed to what I had expected to see. I would not call this film an epic and it certainly does not compare to the spectacles we used to see in the good old epics as mentioned above. Instead we get a classic Joseph Campbell-like heroes journey story in which Russell Crowe starts out holding high position as a commander of the Roman Army in the North but is betrayed, left for dead and has to fight his way back from the bottom in order to wreak the revenge of the righteous man. On this level it works superbly. Russell Crowe is the man. There can be no doubt after seeing this film that the mantle of romantic tough guy lead must pass to him for the foreseeable future. I would not say that he is a great actor (thank god) but he has the looks and the presence to make the character work. A pivotal scene in which he reveals his identity to Commodus, his nemesis, is simply fantastic.So we end up with a film that has a very strong emotional centre. The murdered emperor Marcus Aurelius is a highly moral man who wants to pass responsibility to Crowe, not to his real son. We see the struggles that Crowe has to go through to accept the responsibility and then how, even when he becomes a slave and his family is murdered, he can still eventually do the right thing. I would guess that it is because this emotional tale is so central, rather than the fighting, that Scott has chosen to shoot so many scenes by using close-ups of the actors and that they occupy so much time on screen. In fact I think this will transfer very badly to a pan and scan TV version because he often uses close-ups with 2 heads either side of the screen with an out-of-focus centre. Nice to see a director really directing for widescreen (at least on this level).But as for the much-touted gladiatorial scenes I have to say that I was disappointed. In the first instance the CGI is still not up to the job. We all know only a portion of the Coliseum set actually existed and the rest was computer generated. It's good but it's still not good enough. The flyover shot of the arena which has been much talked about is also good but still not good enough to make you forget you are watching a computer-generated scene in which the movements of people and animals is still too jerky to be convincing. Compared to the epics of the 50s these modern CGI scenes are not as impressive as large-scale sets.I have to report disappointment over the actual combat too. Compare the opening, admittedly very good, battle with any battle scene from Braveheart and you will see that it is not quite as good. The man to man fighting between gladiators later in the film is even more disappointing with Scott constantly going for close-ups rather than pulling back to let us really see the action. Bruce Lee and Fred Astaire both looked brilliant because they were usually (almost always with Astaire) shot with their full bodies in frame. What made them so impressive was that you could see they used their whole bodies and most of what they were doing was not faked. In Gladiator I seldom escaped the frustrating feeling that tight camera angles were being used to compensate for the fact that the real spectacle was too difficult to depict. Oh and I have to say that men wrestling stuffed animals still looks as silly as it ever did.I regret saying so many negative things here but I say them because the film seems to have been hyped as something it is not. It is superficially an epic but it in no way compares to the best of the original epics. In my judgement this is a film about character and the relationships between men of honour and men of opportunity. The acting from Richard Harris is as impressive as that from Crowe. Oliver Reed also turns in a good performance for his last film and we can only regret that he did not get better roles in his life. Perhaps Reed's tragedy was that he would have been perfect for epic roles as a young man but epics had become too expensive to make by then.Ridley Scott is still, to my mind, one of the best and most innovative directors around and I rate this film highly despite my criticisms. The problem lies in the marketing. This is an excellent film but for every reason other than the ones advertised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was entertained! Ridley Scott's Gladiator is stunningly beautiful?visually, aurally, and semantically: a complete artistic achievement. The recreation of Ancient Rome is something to behold. The musical score by Hans Zimmer, featuring gorgeous vocals by Lisa Gerrard, is rousing and touching. Convincing, interesting, and moving acting performances abound, with standouts by Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, and Djimon Hounsou. The story is pure, distilled, derivative blockbuster/epic. The originality of Gladiator is found in its focused reduction of common movie ore into golden nuggets: essential, concentrated elements that have been grandly designed and then boiled down to make viewers alternately cry, laugh, and cheer?in a big way. Although we are spattered with occasional "political" discussions about Republic versus Empire, there is no social commentary here about the Roman system breeding corruption, and who needs it? The emperor wants an empire; the senate prefers a republic. Evil is personified in Commodus (Phoenix), the scheming, cowardly, childish, jealous, lecherous, murderous son of Marcus Aurelius (Harris), who tries to tiptoe over his only son (as if he wouldn't notice or care), by choosing as his successor "Rome's greatest general" Maximus (Crowe) to become the "protector of Rome" and to "end the corruption." "Commodus is not a moral man," Marcus Aurelius reminds Maximus, giving his reason why his son should not rule. Good is personified in Maximus, the strong, loyal, moral, brave, good-natured, hands-on, fighting family man, who swears to uphold Marcus Aurelius's wish to give Rome back to its people. But, alas, Commodus doesn't take the news from his father too well, and he kills Marcus Aurelius and takes over anyway. Then he orders Maximus, his wife, and his son to be killed. But Maximus escapes! But he can't get to his family in time to prevent their demise. And so, the perfectly justifiable tale of revenge has been perfectly set into motion. Commodus doesn't know that Maximus has survived his plot, and his own egotistical plan to make the people of Rome "love him" (since his father obviously didn't)?instead of serving the people (by tending to plagues and so forth)?becomes the vehicle by which Maximus will eventually take his revenge, and Commodus will meet his own undoing. The second act "delivers the goods" as Maximus is enslaved and then converted into a gladiator. In perfect movie irony, his skills garnered from leading real battles in defense of Rome against its enemies enable Maximus to make a name for himself ("The Spaniard") in the entertainment arena; and Commodus's schedule of gladiatorial games, meant to distract the people of Rome from their real problems and attract them to his "loving" rule, pulls the now famous gladiator Maximus, incognito, to the Coliseum. The gladiatorial action sequences don't disappoint. What may slightly disappoint, for some, is the highly unlikely showdown, in which the emperor, who has already successfully detected and foiled the plot to overthrow him, offers Maximus a one-on-one battle with him in the Coliseum. The possible disappointment comes not just from the improbability of the offer (after all, the fact that both Commodus and Maximus are alive at this point is improbable enough), or from the showdown itself, or its outcome, but from the machinations through which we arrive at the showdown. After all of the battles that Maximus has had to survive to arrive on Commodus's doorstep, it would have been purer had Maximus fought his way to the final confrontation, rather than having been granted a "shot at the title." What if Maximus had successfully reunited with his men, so that we actually witness the return of their loyalties to him, as well as a battle with those still loyal to Commodus, in an effort to restore Rome's greatness? Still, we do get a championship bout between Good personified and Evil personified, and Maximus?whose belief in an afterlife (spiritual and/or historical), which the film highly commends ("What we do in life, echoes in eternity?")?deservedly rejoins his family at their incorporeal home.</fullReview>

The emporer does not love his own son however and asks maximus(Crowe) to take over as emporer once he dies. The emporers son finds out though and frames him for his death. They send the general for exectution where he escapes and is rounded up by slave drivers who turn him into a gladiator.This movie is very good. Its a must see for everyone.

		<fullReview>In ancient Rome, a gladiator seeks revenge against the emperor's son after the latter kills his family. Despite the extensive running time, the film does not drag at all. The credit for this goes to Scott, who directs with a sure hand and sustains a high level of excitement. However, scenes of bloody violence are gratuitous. The script may not be historically accurate but it is surely entertaining. Crowe is fine in the title role, turning in a quietly effective performance. Equally good is Phoenix as the evil emperor, a despicable weasel. Nielsen has little to do other than look worried but she looks quite beautiful doing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Champion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fall of The Roman Empire, a blockbuster Roman epic that nearly bankrupted 20th Century Fox, sounded the death knell for major films about the Roman Empire for decades, until the genre was revived by Ridley's Scott masterpiece, Gladiator.Gladiator is centered during the last days of the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius and his military campaign against the barbarian hordes of Germania. The person leading the campaign is his greatest General, Maximus, an honourable soldier and faithful servant to Rome. After Maximus wages a successful battle against the Germans, the emperor who is dying, hands over succession of the Roman Empire to Maximus. Maximus is to hold the crown in trust until Rome becomes a republic.Of course, Aurelius's decision does not go well with his son Commodus and in a fit of rage or hyper emotional surge, he smothers his father. Maximmus suspecting foul play in the death of the emperor refuses to show fealty to Commodus.This singular act of rebellion attracts the death penalty on his head and the consequences present a Homer epic like tale of tragedy, love, courage, loyalty, incest, betrayal and vengeance.With the exception of The Insider and possibly A Beautiful Mind, I have never seen Russel Crowe deliver such a credible performance as he did as the vengeful tortured Roman General who became a slave, a slave who became a gladiator, a gladiator who defied an emperor. His performance was outstanding and his burly frame helped him. Unlike most actors who would produce finely sculpted muscles developed in gyms, Crowe's body was more realistic as a veteran soldier whose body is exercised in the battle fields.But even his performance was matched by Joachin Phoenix as the disturbed incestuous Commodus. Phoenix was a delight to watch and one of the most complex characters. Despite his hatred for Maximus, it was obvious he admired and envied the the General's courage and would have rather had him as a friend than as an enemy. There was also the subtle jealousy of the affection his father had for Maximus.Interestingly enough, Richard Harris who played Aurelius had the most moving lines in the movies. Harris, despite his fondness for the bottle, could be always be counted on to give a dependable acting and in his 15 minutes in Gladiator, it is easy to see why he will always remain as one of the greatest character actors ever. This was his last movie and it was a befitting tribute to him.Another actor whose this was the last movie was Oliver Reed who plays the slave owner, Proximo. He did not finish the move and his face was superimposed on another actor. Still, his performance was mesmerizing.Connie Nielsen plays Lucien, Commodus's sister who is compelled to join forces with Maximus to protect her son. Other actors Like Derek Jacobi and Djimon Housnou also gave strong supporting performances.From the opening battles on the plains of Germania to the final scenes of Maximus' stand against Commodus, Scott does not waste any second with cheap melodrama or boredom. Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer produced a haunting magnificent score that will echo in your minds after the movie has finished.Kudos has to be given to the Scott's eyes for details. The battles were fierce and captivating, the Collosus was intimidating, and the costumes were top notch. Of course, he took a lot of fictional license with the movie. Historically speaking, Aurelius was never murdered by his son, Commodus. He actually handed over succession to Commodus and died later. Commodus was never killed in the arena, although as unbelievable as it may sound, he actually as the Roman Emperor participated in gladiatorial contests in the arena. Although it can be argued, that his rivals may have been much less aggressive in their battles with him, fully aware of the repercussion of killing a Roman emperor, even in sport.SKG and Universal took a brave stance in forking out the money to bring out this dream masterpiece. Gladiator simply rocks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maximus questions, "What possible difference can I make?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film, Gladiator, shows that despite formidable obstacles, be it physical, emotional, or political, a man can triumph over them and succeed in making a difference for others. Maximus, played by Russell Crowe, is in favor with Rome's Caesar, Marcus Aurelius played by Richard Harris, and is chosen by Marcus Aurelius to be the next Caesar over his own son Commodus. Joaquin Phoenix plays Commodus, who is hurt and enraged by this turn of events and subsequently kills his father and seizes the crown for himself. He orders Maximus executed right then and there and dispatches Praetorian guards to murder his family as he sees Maximus as the main obstacle to his obsession ? to be loved, by everyone.However, Maximus escapes the would be execution and manages to hold himself together despite the heart break upon finding his brutally murdered family. He nearly loses the will to survive, goes on to battle in the gladiator games in fights for his life winning the respect, loyalty, admiration, and love of the slaves: the gladiators owner ? Proximo played by the late Oliver Reed; the Roman soldiers; the crowds of Roman citizens; and by Commodus's sister Lucilla, portrayed by Connie Nielson. Maximus seems to get the steepest odds and most dangerous obstacles in the arena after Commodus finds out who he is. Despite this, at the end of it all, Maximus conquers Commodus in the arena giving his life for Rome and changes the dynamics of the Roman Empire.The director's use of lighting, color, and camera angle pulls the viewer into the story so that they have the full emotional experience. The dark, shadowy scenes of battle, clandestine meetings, and an escape attempt give an ominous and foreboding feel. While the use of red streamers as Maximus enters the arena for his first fight and red petals as he enters the arena for his last fight give the feeling that death is ever present. The red color of the streamers and petals, along with the darkness and shadows create the feeling of doom and despair and make the viewer wonder how this man, this one man, fails to give up and manages to keep fighting against such adversity.The shots of the beginning of Maximus's story are much the same as the shots at the end of Maximus's story. We can see just the hand of Maximus running along the stalks of grass as he walks through the fields towards home. There is much relief and serenity as Maximus heads home ? we are him ? it is our hand ? through the grass in the beginning of the story and in the end, as the fight is over and he has triumphed, just the reason for the fight and for who he fights is different. Both times we see Maximus near death the director brings us into the physical and emotional impact on the Roman General via use of a hovering camera angle, which makes the viewer feel as if Maximus is floating surreal above the ground. The first near death experience Maximus recovers to battle tyranny and fight on against all odds. The latter is his triumph over the injustices he has experienced and victory for Rome over Commodus' tyranny.The viewer directly experiences the character's emotions through use of close-ups. We experience Commodus's hate, loathing, and deceitfulness; Lucilla's confidence, fear of Commodus, and love for Maximus; Marcus Aurelius' love and admiration of Maximus, his weariness of battle, and concern for Rome's welfare; and Maximus's pain and despair, his angst and sadness, and his strength, determination, and resolve. The viewer can't help but cheer along with Rome for Maximus to overcome.As with the film, The Man in the Iron Mask, two would be brothers (one literally, the other figuratively) are pitted against each other. The power hungry, ego-maniac of a brother seeks to destroy the other and rule a kingdom at all costs. While the humble, morally conscious brother fights back to triumph over all obstacles set before him. In the film Gladiator, Maximus questions, "What possible difference can I make?" (Wick &amp; Scott, 2000). Both films show that one man can make a difference. The strength and determination to not fail is contagious when one man is willing to take a stand despite the obvious obstacles working against him. Proving that one man can make a difference even if they don't always know what it is, even if it is to just give rise to others to take action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator nearly killed by writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything's better now. The acting, the photography, the sound, the editing, the costumes (Roman indigo too, not purple), the effects and the art design. The action sequences, the location work. OK, there are some anachronisms and the history is fictionalized, and the stunts were impressive in the 1920s too. Still, everything's better now. Except the writing.If Charlton Heston, Yul Brinner, and Anne Baxter were reading this film's dialogue you would hear how dreadful it really is. It's a tribute to modern actors like Crowe and Phoenix that they can make even things like "I shall have my vengeance-- in this life or the next!" sound as if someone might say them, somewhere, ever. Try it! This fight between quality actor and poor script is fought out within nearly every contemporary Hollywood blockbuster. Why? How much does a joke cost? Do audiences accept this as good writing? Why don't they demand better? To prove all this: watch the DVD with the sound off and the subtitles on. Yes, that's how hard Crowe and the rest had to work. THis movie deserves a 6 (a 9 with a -3 for the writing), but it gets an 8 because the actors are able to put the banalities over and make it sound convincing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning duel staged against the decaying Roman Empire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One comment insists that Gladiator would be something for Fight Club fans. I do not get the idea, but I have to admit that I indeed enjoyed both films very much.That much said, be prepared for beautifully shot scenes, spectacular fights, some interesting characters (there could have been a little enhancement in this respect, but nevertheless, the characters are strong and sound).Kudos to Joaquin Phoenix in the first place. He performs a haunted, tormented and cruel emperor you can still sometimes glimpse the human and pitiable side of, and is altogether very creepy and goes under your skin. Yes, he definitely should have gotten the Oscar. He is the only member of the cast I can not imagine to be replaceable. His interpretation of Commodus adds depth to Gladiator as otherwise it might have been just the usual the very, very, very good guy battles the bad, stupid, really bad one against all odds. Russell Crowe is a fine Maximus. He engages in some spectacular fights in and out of the arena while showing off genuine feelings and wits. The opening battle is in its genre perfect in my belief. The much disputed scenes where he is floating over the fields are a bit kitschy, a bit cheesy, but still, nice thought, and do not work that bad with the excellent music. Oliver Reed and Richard Harris are both rendering great performances and contribute mainly to the authenticity (not meant in a historical sense) of the story. Why is it a problem for so many that in the end Maximus fights and kills the Emperor in the arena in a duel that never ever took or would have taken place in reality? Do not expect historical correctness or accuracy, this is not a documentary to be broadcast on National Geographic or the History Channel. Enjoy Gladiator for for what it is, an action-drama-epic imaginary saga set in powerful cruel ancient Rome already overshadowed by its unavoidable fall from greatness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a brilliant work of art; from director to cast it was preformed perfectly. The opening of the movie was well executed and I was so overwhelmed that I wasn't listening to what the characters were saying until probably the third time I saw the film. The way the director Ridley Scott recreated Rome and its military and political struggle was a masterpiece, from the language used to the accuracy of the structures it was almost as if it really was still there to see.The way the characters like Maximus (Russell Crowe) fit in to the character was phenomenal the performance gave the audience the real feeling of being a general who was betrayed, then became a gladiator and obtained his revenge. Definitely a gladiator who defied and emperor is the best way to describe how he executed his role, even cast who aren't famous Hollywood material managed to keep the audience on the edge of their seats and showed them the a replica of Rome. This movie is definitely one of the greatest works of art I have ever seen as far as enactments of early ages of man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. And in the opulently rousing Gladiator that goes doubly for Maximus (Russell Crowe), the classic hero personified. A great Roman general, he isn't insulated from the same skulduggery and inconsiderations that plague executives in today's corporate scene. You know the drill: The top man, in this case Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), loves you like a son. He's grooming you to take his spot. Only you can continue his glorious vision for the company. And then your benefactor meets an untimely demise. Suddenly no one knows anything about what the boss had in mind for you. Especially his corrupt son, who it just so happens was being cut out of the loop prior to dear old Dad's suspicious death.But despair not, fans of the Roman Empire, the business world, or politics in general. Per director Ridley Scott's lavish throwback to the sword and sandal epics of the 1950s, talent and greatness will out. It is the romantically optimistic contention of screenwriters David H. Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson that ideas, like honour and devotion, are as indestructible as matter; that they live on in reincarnated forms.Of course it was a little more complicated in 180AD. Whereas today's ousted golden boy in search of vindication might simply take his resume and a few company secrets cross-town, the fugitive Maximus' road to redemption first leads him into slavery. And then adhering to good Biblical/literary form, it is not until he hits absolute rock bottom that the heroic paradigm reinvents himself as a peerless gladiator, beloved by the masses and primed to challenge Aurelius' despotic son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).It's a grand old tale, and apparently ready for the retelling thanks to Mr. Scott's fine helmsmanship, Russell Crowe's stupendous tour-de-force in the title role, and the relatively economical set possibilities now afforded via computer magic. While you can expect Mr. Crowe (L.A. Confidential, The Insider) to garner another Oscar nomination, the rub-your-eyes-in-disbelief effects that virtually re-create Rome at the height of her glory are also award-worthy.The other active ingredient in director Scott's sweeping tale of love, duty, deceit and revenge is testosterone. An opening battle scene depicting the Roman Legion's vicious campaign in Germania to win the last of the undefeated lands worth conquering is a naturalistic horror -- as primitively haunting in its anti-war message as the first twenty minutes of Spielberg's Normandy invasion in Saving Private Ryan. This is smartly balanced by a corresponding tale of intrigue at court featuring the internecine calculations of the deliciously twisted Commodus and his far more politically astute sister, Lucilla, exacted with notable aplomb by the comely Connie Nielsen.Curiously subtle hints at incest as well as a far nobler tale of unrequited love round out the story. And perhaps just for good measure, conjuring images of de Havilland, O'Hara, Fairbanks and Flynn, the filmmakers can't pass up the time-honoured clich wherein highborn damsel visits seemingly doomed hunk in the dungeon. Will she slip him a file along with the forbidden kiss? In any case, even when combined with the script's glibly knowing takes on senatorial politics, the cerebral aspects of this cinematic event are far outweighed by the visceral.Mr. Crowe oozes with authority as the consummate warrior-leader, with men just dying, literally, to follow him to Elysium. A less egalitarian film critic, unconcerned with being labelled a chauvinist, might even dub Gladiator a men's film; albeit one that can still be enjoyed by the women who love them.The fighting is, to coin a phrase, awesome, featuring more decapitations and high-pressure blood spurts than a slice-and-dice flick. Maybe even more than on those "real-life" emergency room shows you inevitably come across when channel surfing. Be assured, 'tis the free-flowing plasma and not sex that earns it an R-rating.A fine supporting cast keeps the action from sprawling out of control and the story from being engulfed by the stunning special effects. Joaquin Phoenix is appropriately hateful and completely without redeeming qualities as the warped Commodus. Oliver Reed, who sadly died during filming on Malta, adds a sympathetically reflective note as Proximus, once a great gladiator and now a self-effacing promoter of combative flesh. Derek Jacobi is correctly aristocratic as Gracchus, the Roman senator who forthrightly declares: "I may not be of the people, but I certainly am for the people." And even Richard Harris manages to harness the hamminess, succinctly setting the film's philosophically sober tone as Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Naturally, in a respectful nod to Hollywood tradition, ancient Romans still speak with a proper British accent.Truth be told, the architectural evocation of the legendary city is a bit much, a tad too perfect. Which tends to remind that it's all being done by a little computer. But then again, much of this splashing saga has to be exaggerated. If it weren't, the stirring political lesson, every bit as poignant as the message in Braveheart, would just get buried in the sand. Constructing an homage to the film phylum that is Rome while providing viably exciting entertainment not only for seasoned viewers, but for an entire generation that probably never saw Ben-Hur, director Ridley Scott achieves just the right balance of the old and the new. True, all roads no longer lead to Rome. But rest assured that once the word gets around, filmgoers in search of big-screen thrills will beat a path to Gladiator</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll make this short since there are probably thousands of reviews here already.This is the 2nd movie after Saving Private Ryan that reduced me to tears at the end of the show. The success of this film was largely made possible by the talented director, great cast and a huge budget allocated for the movie. Although Crowe was the lead actor, much credit have to be given to Richard Harris and Joaquin Phoenix(not forgetting Oliver Reed) for adding depth and character into the movie. If I were only allowed to choose one, I would pick Harris(in portraying the slain emperor) as the best supporting actor over Joaquin, Oliver or Connie Nielsen. I think his performances are very powerful and not to mention the fact that I particularly admire his incredible acting in the scene where he told Joaquin he was not going to be his heir to the throne. His gestures, his expressions when listening to Joaquin's rant were just so real that you really feel for him being an aging but noble emperor.Russell Crowe is better off given roles as a fighter(for a good cause) just like James Braddock in that boxing movie. He's still better suited to movies with patriotic kind of battles such as this one in Gladiator. Crowe just sucks big time acting in dramas and movies with love elements. Please we don't want to see him fall in love with Meg Ryan! We want an action star out of Russell!! I hope the directors are reading this so that Crowe can be given more roles that involve leading a pack of army or something and turn out to be a hero at the end. Never mind if he's dead or alive at the end of the show but it just adds more compassion and probably reduce some folks to tears if he really fails to keep on breathing at the end.My 2 cents worth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Opening battle scene in the movie is amazing and camera movements create convincing and realistic pictures.Unique cinematograph and his stylish camera techniques also create surreal feelings in the movie and effective score gives great emotion to its audienceLighting and camera lenses manage to give warm ambiance and good atmosphere of Rome.Visual effects are great and so convincing (accept scene that tiger attacks to Maximus) Background details and costumes are all gorgeous. The Rome which he recreated in the movie is more beautiful than my imagination. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix gave powerful performances and I don't think any other actor can do better job than Joaquin Phoenix as a Commodus.However, there are some big historical mistakes in the movie. In history of the Roman Empire, Emperors never fights with the gladiators. But it is acceptable because this is a big budget Hollywood movie and it needs a powerful ending. Finally, Gladiator is good film and Scott makes another great job, stylish camera techniques, good storytelling, amazing atmosphere and visual effectiveness of colors are the proofs of his artistic vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Sad Story With Great Cinematography, Score, Performances, and Direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Ridley Scott's fourth masterpiece. Period.Maximus Decimus Meridius is a general for the Roman Army. Just finishing up his duty in Germainia, he seeks to return home. But his mentor, Caesar Marcus Arelius, wants him to stay on as Emperor, rejecting his own son as not worthy. The son, obviously jealous, murders his father and orders Maximus' family, and Max himself, dead. Thus follows an odyssey of epic proportions of revenge.Gladiator is an epic film in every sense of the word. It is no doubt that Ridley Scott's vision helped shape the enormous scope of this film and benefited from it. Scott seems to be the master the epic actioner.The performances by all the actors are tear-shedding. Maximus, played by Crowe, is easily the most straightforward character in the film. Crowe delivers emotion in an intense fashion that makes be cry every time I see him die, being carried out of the Colesseum on his back. Joaquin Phoenix's performance, I think, easily outdoes Crowes. Phoenix's character (Commodus) is so complex and dimensional, I sympathize with him every time--even with the atrocious acts he has committed. Connie Neilsen plays Lucilla, Max's old flame before his marriage and also Commodus's sister. She is a beautiful woman and commands respect from those around her. And she gets it, too.The cinematography by John Maetheson is dark, murky, and depressing. And that was the effect the filmmakers wanted. His choice of the 45 degree shutter angles during the battle scenes create a more barbaric and violent experience for the viewer. And those battles ARE violent. No other filmmaker could've done this like Ridley Scott. He is the master of the craft. He makes everything look so effortless and easily done, yet is so seamless. I'm still depressed of his loss at the Oscars.An honorable mention goes out to Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. Their score for this film is emotionally bound and delivers the goods time and time over. It is a soundtrack worthy of my CD rack. Their 'Now We Are Free' makes me cry every time.Overall, this is a great film. Truly deserving of its Oscar win. Great story, great acting, and great direction make this a modern masterpiece.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator, proves that love prevails above all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator for me is Ridley Scott's finest work. It is credible to state that alien was fantastic but for me this is his greatest achievement in film. Gladiator holds a message within which is never give in, or give up when your cause is worthy, and we can see that Maximus's cause is more worthy than any. Crowe is nothing short of world class in portraying to us the character of Maximus. Yes he is a born fighter and general of Rome, yet he loves his family more than anything and only wants to live peacefully with them. It is because of this that the audience can understand Maximus's drive for redemption, regained respect and vengeance for his family. The battle scenes for me show how Maximus fights with his heart and nothing else, he slays the fighters for his family, he wins the crowd for his family and gains his vengeance. Lisa Gerrard's "Now we are free" creates an overwhelmingly emotional end to the film and had me in tears for the first time ever in a film. Gladiator is nothing short of a masterpiece and shows that despite all the endless rubbish that has come out of Hollywood over the past ten years there are still gems and films to remembered for a long time, and Gladiator is certainly one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The passionate patriotic character of Maximus is fighting a battle for Marcus Aurelius, the previous emperor before his tragic death, to make Rome a better place but Aurelius' son Commodus wants to run Rome his own way.The plots consistent with passionate emotional dialogue from each character. There are many different opinions being harassed around in different societies and through the use of battles and family story lines the film enables audience to really feel a passion behind the character's lives.The battle scenes, sword fighting etc are beautifully directed allowing audiences to see graphic scenes of violence which conforms to the war drama genre. It's a very gripping story and reflects the context perfectly.The costume design and setting help to conform to the time in which the film was set and through the use of old time values including slavery and money we are thrust deep within character and society values.Russell Crowe (Master and Commander) won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role and although I wasn't a huge fan of his character at certain points during the film I can tell that he acted his heart you and deserved his award for playing the emotional yet strongly determined soldier.The interplay between the characters is also strong and creates fantastic tension for the story to thrive upon, especially between maximus and Commodus.The passion behind each character's actions is remarkable, especially Maximus' antics. It's a truly remarkable story that reflects the time perfectly through the emotion, social values, costumes and settings (the Coliseum is tremendous) being a fan of war, period and drama genres this film was perfect and if you are into any of those genres then i definitely recommend this Oscar winning epic. i believe it is a must watch for anyone actually because it is that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gladiator, in my opinion is a great film. It really shows how one man's rage and quest for revenge can consume him. This film takes you through such dramatic chain of events such as Maximus going from being one of the greatest generals and almost Caesar of Rome to a lowly slave working and fighting to survive. And even in his low ranked position being able to overcome obstacle's and getting the revenge he deserves. The fights in the Colosseum really depict the amount of violence and the savageness that went on inside the Colosseum. Their was a immense amount of brutality just to please a crowd. Though the ending isn't very conclusive it is a just ending for our hero Mximus to end his painful quest.</fullReview>

He is captured by a slave lord, and forced to fight in the arena for entertainment. His great skills and determination bring him as far as the Colleseum in Rome, where he fights in front of thousands of spectators who cheer his name every time he fights. The new emporer, and the one truly responsible for the death of the old emporer, wants him dead. He trys to have him executed, but the crowd is up in arms at this. Finally the emporer challenges him to a duel. But the fight is not fair. The emporer stabs him before the fight, and with such a huge advantage, eventually kills him.</fullReview>

Maximus wished to rid Rome of the oppression of Commodus, the greedy and power hungry son of Marcus Aurelius. He does so, but he dies in the process. His death however wasn't tragic, in fact it was happy, as he ended with his reunion with his family.Gladiator was all about Maximus, a general in the roman army under Marcus Aurelius. Maximus braves yet another battle, in which he ends victorious. The emperor, proud of Maximus, offered him the position as emperor after he died. Maximus was to think on the offer. But Commodus, the son of the emperor, killed his father, and hence claimed the thrown of Rome. He ordered Maximus's death but the general escaped. But his escape was futile, as his family was murdered by Commodus's men. Broken hearted and worn out, Maximus was captured to become a slave and was sold off as a Gladiator. He later fought as one, killed Commodus and died himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator still stands, to this day, as one of my favorite movies of all-time. A mix of drama and action, Gladiator tells the tale of Maximus (Russell Crowe), a general in Marcus Aurelius' army who shined in battle but was eventually deceived by the corrupt emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), suffered through the murder of his family, and was sold into slavery. While a slave, Maximus (there known as "The Spaniard") learns the techniques of gladiator battle and becomes Rome's greatest warrior, on a quest to seek revenge for the murders. Defeating Roman soldiers and other gladiators alike, his final battle comes against the emperor himself. In a glorious battle, Maximus slays his foe, earning the love and respect of the fans and of Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). Though not 100% factually correct, the miniscule errors do not take away from what I found to be a mind-blowing movie experience. Gladiator is a classic, and will always be a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is an extraordinary motion picture that successfully combines action and adventure with a dramatic storyline and excellent plot. It is simply the story of how a General became a slave, a slave became a gladiator, and a gladiator conquered Rome. Ridley Scott reaches his highest peak, and that's not easier considering his director resume of Alien and Blade Runner. Russell Crowe's acting is impressive, as always, but is perhaps outdone by Joaquin Phoenix, who plays a more cynical and emotionless character. The tag line describes the movie's purpose to perfection, What we do in life, echoes in eternity. The action scenes are very well done, and the dialogue fits the time period perfectly. There was a lot of controversy when it one best picture over the movie Traffic, but any one who appreciates movies can easily see why Gladiator took home this high honor. Most people have seen it, but I look forward to future movie lovers to enjoying it for the first time.</fullReview>

Aside from beating LOTR on the visual and action scales (well, in my opinion), this film really recaptures the Roman era well, and is far more than just standard sword-and-sandal fare - it has a complex story, a complex script, complex characters and complex situations. The character of Commodus was done best - his spite, cunning and villainy was brought to the screen well by actor Joaquin Phoenix. Russell Crowe's Maximus was also a well-played and strong character, and one that you really felt for and understood - his humanity, love and sacrifice made him a true cinema hero. This is Ridley Scott's finest hour - his true talent is historical action films (Kingdom of Heaven is also one to be reckoned with). The best ever sword-and-sandal epic made! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is a great story told with energy and intensity. This is a well-told story of revenge and political machinations brewing beneath the surface of the Roman Empire. I won't spoil any surprises or any of the film here. But let me say this Gladiators cinematography is extraordinary. The film looks beautiful from shots of fields, to the shots of Rome from overhead, the Colosseum, and the sky. This is a great-looking movie. The battle scenes are terrific. The gladiatorial combats as staged by Ridley Scott and his collaborators are some of the best ever committed to a movie. Russell Crowe is brooding, smart and efficient as the titular hero, General Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix literally chews the scenery as Emperor Commodus, an almost deranged Caesar. Nielesen shows depth as his sister while Derek Jacobi and Richard Harris are good in their roles. Oliver Reed in his final farewell performance captures Proximo perfectly as an apolitical entertainer and former gladiator. Long live the General Maximus, and long live this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****MAY BE SPOILERS***** This is one amazing film. The only word i can think to describe it is powerful. Everything about this film is powerful, from the acting to the imagery to the storyline to the emotional and unexpected ending. When i think of the best performance, the exceptional Joaquin Phoenix comes to mind. He plays the twisted, corrupt Commodus who **SPOILERS** kills his father Marcus Aureilius (played by the late great Richard Harris) to become emperor. So far, so evil. But Phoenix turns this seemingly evil character into something sympathetic. i for one was far more moved when Phoenix was asking his father why he didnt love him than when ***SPOILERS*** Maximus finds his dead wife and child. The stand-offs between Crowe and Phoenix are the most thrilling parts of this film, and the contrasts between the two actors are superb- Crowe, quietly understated, dignified yet unable to contain his undeniable screen presence and power, and Phoenix- troubled, sulky, voice trembling yet dangerous and cruel. The "They say your son squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross" line is mesmerising and terrifying. The images in this film are beautiful- when Maximus is rushing home to his family, with the clouds storming and the sun rising and falling. The ending brings such an emotional impact, especailly Juba's (in a striking performance by Djimou Hounsou) final line- "I will see you again-but not yet". This line really makes me cry. This is a film the likes of which i haven't seen for years. See it and be amazed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently purchased this movie on DVD and it reminded me, if I needed reminding, what a great film it is. Its strengths are obvious - excellent acting, including memorable performances from Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Oliver Reed, an absorbing story, superb music, and interesting photography. The latter was not to everybody's taste, nor were the scenes in Elysium, but I thought both worked rather well, lending texture to what we were watching. The movie is not the most original ever made, but does most other things so well, it can be forgiven for that. Recommended. Rating: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good piece of cinema, but a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only way, I have found, to completely objectively rate this movie, is to discriminate between it as a 'movie' and as a piece of 'cinema', the latter being the more arty, deep and ultimately pretentious films made only to further the world of cinema today rather than just to make money as the former.As a movie, Gladiator is completely brilliant: the individual film-making sections work so well together to bring this epic tale to the big screen. There are flawless performances, excellent cinematography, and the art direction and costume design are perfect, both for film-lovers and for historical nit-pickers.Ridley Scott's direction does well to bring to life the great tale of a Roman general turned gladiator-slave, Maximus Decimus Meridus (Russell Crowe) who defies and overthrows the wrongful and villainous emperor of Rome, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The director manages to invoke exceptional performances from the entire cast and leaves us wanting more. One of the other most enjoyable parts of this movie is Hans Zimmer's score, moving in every scene and creating a mood matched by few movie scores. Personally I think Zimmer was ripped off at the 2000 Oscars.Now for the spoilers. As a piece of cinema, Gladiator struggles. The central interaction between the two main protagonists is brilliantly done and the under-tone of each battle scene is well portrayed, that Maximus kills only when he is required to and that is enough for him to go on to the afterlife. However, the film itself is fundamentally inaccurate, historically speaking. History tells us that Commodus was a fine emperor, beloved by his people, far from the evil, plotting emperor we see Phoenix portraying here. Naturally, the screenwriter Franzoni, Logan and Nicholson decided to use artistic license and alter the lines of history in order to make a one-off, unconnected movie. But for this reason, the attempt to incorporate political ideas into this movie fails, as it tries to create a tale of a new, young emperor struggling to follow in the footsteps of his beloved older father, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). But neither the senate nor the real emperor Commodus would ever have had problems on this score. Hence, the 'movie' chooses to write its own rules in order to tell a story, under the pretence that is a historical epic.Also, while not intending to say anything of a racist nature, the casting is slightly odd. Personally I have had a little trouble recently understanding the fact that the gladiator referred to as the 'Spaniard' is played by Russell Crowe who, in this movie, speaks in more of an Australian accent than any other type, while the Hispanic actor Phoenix portrays the Roman Emperor. This is not to say that both actors do not do a tremendous job in their roles, it is just that Phoenix does not, in the end, look much like Richard Harris' son and Connie Neilsen's brother. But overall I don't think it is important, for the simple fact that Phoenix pulls off one of the most amazing and empathetic performances ever to grace a movie screen. Personally I believe that in the past decade, there have been only two truly great villainous performances; Phoenix is one, the other, more recently, being Daniel Day-Lewis in Gangs of New York. As a sidetrack, Gangs of NY actually contained the similar ambiguous casting, with English-born Day-Lewis playing an American 'native', while Leonardo DiCaprio, born and raised in Hollywood, played the Irish settler.Back to Gladiator, and Ridley Scott's direction being another element to diminish this as a piece of cinema. There is nothing wrong with Scott's direction, it is perfect. But it is cliched, the film is very Hollywood, set against an almost monochromatic ancient backdrop. While the art direction and so forth are all stunning, Scott uses them only as a background to the main tale which is nothing original. It is a little too hackneyed, I would say, to have the main protagonist, despite however many people he has killed, to be the dedicated family man who wants vengeance for the murder of his wife and son and so the character of Maximus does not quite work on that score. But that is the only problem; the battle sequences, both in the arena and in times of Roman conquest, are all impeccably directed and are, unlike some of my other comments, historically realistic as far as we can tell in this day and age. It is actually an accurate depiction of the way people fought during that time period.And finally to mention the performances more in-depth, they are all flawless. Despite the visually odd casting as previously mentioned, Crowe and Phoenix are perfectly cast and perfectly directed to extract brilliant performances in two very difficult roles. While the stand-out for me is always Phoenix, the minor characters also play a very important role. Connie Neilsen produces what I think is her best performance to date as the frightened and virtuous Lucilla, Djimon Hounsou is great as Maximus' fellow gladiator, while Marcus Aurelius and Antonius Proximo provide two later roles for two great and esteemed careers of Richard Harris and Oliver Reed respectively. Having said this, I think that the most perfectly cast is Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus. When all is said and done, Jacobi contains far and away the most credibility of the minor characters, both visually and in terms of his performance. It is not an entirely difficult role to play but Jacobi achieves it to perfection.Overall, Gladiator is outstanding viewing and what will become a classic for everybody to see. It is powerful, moving, tense and not overly violent and for these reasons it is extremely widely accessible. As a piece of 'cinema', four stars, as a movie, five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you LOOK at Gladiator, you are immediately transferred back to Ancient Rome; everything seems so real and in place, it's hard to believe that it's a set with added on CG.I liked this film. A little long, perhaps (hey, I wasn't into Spartacus that much, either) but entertaining. The battle scenes were the best and Russell Crowe was as magnetic as ever.Saying that, however, it wasn't his best performance. The trouble with films like this where the speech and setting is "old", the performances tend to get a little wooden, as the actors can't act "naturally" in the role.Although the history is a little innacurate (commodus was killed in his bath not in the arena) but a movie is nothing more than just that, and so history should not really be taken into account and the movie can just be enjoyed.One thing I did like was the soundtrack. Well written and worth more than a few listens.Overrall 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge of the Gladiator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Gladiator", with the main character Maximus (Russell Crowe), is an intense film that keeps the viewer pleading for more throughout the entire movie. The movie is based upon Maximus striving for revenge against Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). It takes place in ancient Roman times when Caesar is above all others. The characters are very well portrayed in this film, though everything that happens revolves around Caesar, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). He is loved by all. However, Commodus, his power hungry son, is the one who puts Caesar to his end. The plot is very well written and is based upon revenge. Commodus destroys everyone and everything that Maximus cherishes most in life, and Maximus is not willing to let that go. He will stop at nothing to get his revenge on Commodus for hurting him so deeply; however, he must fight for his own life throughout the film. Maximus was picked up, while sleeping, by a man named Proximo (Oliver Reed) who runs a gladiator school and who was once a gladiator himself. This man runs the school for the entertainment business. Maximus is now considered a slave and must fight for survival. The setting of the movie is in ancient Rome. It fits the film perfectly because other than revenge, the movie is based upon Caesar and the glory of Rome. They show clips of ancient arenas that were basically there for entertainment, and they also held all of the gladiator matches there. The "Gladiator" is a very well produced movie. Though its basic thought is revenge, it shows how quickly a person's role in life could change back in that time period, and it shows how much power Caesar actually had. Maximus went from a general, to the Emperor of Rome, to a gladiator slave in a matter of days. It is a very intriguing movie with great effects and great acting. This film is definitely a movie that I would recommend for anyone to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crowe was superb; Joaquin Phoenix deserved an Oscar - Contains Spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Russell Crowe was PERFECT for the role of Maximus, and he created a character so memorable and life-like that it actually makes me sad when I think of Maximus and remember that he died after his struggle. No. I'm not delusional, and I'm not a tough-guy wannabe, but I have to admit that the character reached me. Joaquin Phoenix was SO good, and the role was such a departure for him, yet he played it flawlessly. He deserved the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting role. He brought Commodus to life as Crowe did Maximus. This is definetly one of my all time favorite movies.My only complaint: the fight scenes were choreographed too fast. At times it seemed like 3 people were dead with one swing of Maximus' sword. The movie had a cast member from "Braveheart" (Tommy Flanagan, a.k.a Cicero). He should have given the director some input on how more realistic the battle scenes in "Braveheart" were; the action could be seen in more detail. But, I still give "Gladiator" 9.9 out of 10. It's tough to beat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A host of Roman related films such as Quo Vadis, Ben Hur, The Robe, Fall of the Roman Empire, etc. preceeded Gladiator. I enjoy Russell Crowe but felt his Oscar award should have waited for A Beautiful Mind...not Gladiator. Juaquin Phoenix was very nearly as good as Christopher Plummer's Commodus in Fall of the Roman Empire. I enjoyed watching the film for it's special effects and opening battle scene to see how closely Scott came to recreating a real battle. I looked at the costuming, weaponry, etc. and in all respects I think Ridley Scott did an outstanding job...I was convinced I was seeing Rome, Romans, and Roman battle. But, the story itself paled in comparison to the wonderful effects! I felt in my heart the animosity, the loathing that came between Ben Hur and Messala. I did not get that kind of feeling with Maximus and Commodus. You cannot help but feel the agony of Ben Hur who, having defeated his mortal enemy, finds out from Messala's last words that the "race is not over". At the end of Gladiator, it's "who will help me carry a great Roman" and off we go. I never quite understood why the other gladiators were so quick to die for Maximus. After all, he was there to kill them. (the charioteers from the Battle of Zama scene were gladiators also..at least that's how it would have historically been). I could not buy into Commodus's thinking on letting Maximus live. The real Commodus would not have hesitated, Maximus would have been executed on the spot when he revealed his face. I'm hoping that more classically developed stories of "real" characters will be well filmed when they show up in 2003-2004 ("Alexander the Great", "Troy" and "Hannibal"). I'd love to see Ridley Scott-style special effects in all these but...with story lines that I can really feel in my gut.</fullReview>

I don't know why that is, but I think this is a classic case that shows that a big time movie reviewer can have a different opinion than you. One thing that everyone agreed on was that there was quite a bit of violence/gore in the movie. Other than that, I think that the movie was quite a good one compared to a lot of the other movies out there right now. It wasn't crammed full of sex and profanities like a lot of movies that come out today. The movie also gives a good message of loyalty to a cause and to fight against the crowd if you don't believe what they are doing is right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Comeback For the Ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People love a comeback. They might just be our favorite storytelling archetypes and contain the most relatable and inspirational narrative tropes: vulnerability, failure, trial, redemption and eventual triumph. Gladiator is an epic comeback in more ways than one.First, it is the story of a comeback: unfairly disgraced Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russel Crowe) is exiled by mad Emperor Commodus. Reduced to slavery, he earns his keep in the arena, and fights his way to the Colosseum in Rome, and to revenge. It is as streamlined as storytelling comes.Then, it marks the comeback of director Ridley Scott after a series of flops and artistically underwhelming pictures. It also sees the return of a genre confined to the dustbin of cinematic history since the failure of the bloated Fall of the Roman Empire over three decades prior (which incidentally also told the story of a general fighting a redeeming battle against mad emperor Commodus). How odd that a studio might pick a director best known for science fiction to tell what is on paper essentially the same story as that famous flop?Galvanized by techniques first deployed in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, Scott chose to stick to a straightforward, almost very by-the-numbers script and immerse us in the arena. And immerse us he did. From the first shot to the last, Gladiator is a lean, mean, single-minded brute of a film, punctuated with quiet moments of tender beauty. The bloody fights in the arena eclipsed anything seen since, and the Rome depicted was intoxicatingly real, far removed from the stagy creations of old.Serendipity was, as it so often is, essential to this film's success: original star Antonio Banderas - the main reason the screenplay alludes to our gladiator as "the Spaniard" - jumped ship, and paved the way for revelation du jour Russel Crowe, fresh from L.A. Confidential. While Banderas is a likable, charming lead, it is impossible to imagine anyone else but Crowe as Maximus: he fits the role and the story like a glove, hard as nails but also deeply wounded and at times even gentle. It earned Crowe not just an Academy Award but super-stardom. Luckily that was not enough to completely eclipse revealing turns from Djimon Hounsou and Joaquin Phoenix as the mad emperor, or first-rate work from departed veterans Richard Harris and Oliver Reed, the later particularly haunting as gladiator-trainer Proximo.Throughout, Scott's visual mastery speaks for itself, and his seasoned collaborators all produced some of the best work in their respective careers, from set designer Arthur Max to composers Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, whose epic score truly did echo in eternity as the ad campaign promised.Gladiator is Hollywood at its best: old-fashioned storytelling executed in a vibrant and awe-inspiring way.</fullReview>

Ridley Scott creates a magical, believable, and effortless picture of ancient Rome. The score is beautiful, and perfect for each scene we come across. Perhaps the best part of this film is the performance of Russel Crowe as Maximus, the lead character. Crowe creates a heroic yet human character who demands both attention and respect. Joaquin Phoenix is wonderful as the antagaonist, Commodus, and the rest of the roles fit in without err. Gladiator is one of the greatest films ever made. It entertains. It thrills. It terrifies.

		<fullReview>There is an ever more popular trend in Hollywood movies now-a-days. The trend is taking a substance, called plot, out of scripts by mass amounts and filling these gaping holes with another substance called action. Now dont get me wrong action is fine in the right amount of dosage and for the right movies however now thier seems to be an overflow of this stuff. As you can tell by the sarcasm in my comments that i like this movie and i like the fact that it takes the time to set up a story rather then jump into a bunch of bull. And becuase of an overdose of this plot this movie gets a bad wrap. I personally love this movie and was what turned me on to history. Now with that out of the way lets talk about the movie. I must say that nearly every aspect of this movie, from the extensive amounts of weaponry created to the acting and directing impressed me. Ridley is a fantastic director and does a phenominal job with this movie, using old techniques of movie making with modern day technology was a stroke of genius. The historical accuracy ( the armor, arms, and buildings. Not the story ) was amazing, from the blade of a sword to the grandure of Rome astonished me. Music! The music makes this movie and sets the mode so well it almost makes you weap ( well, not really but you get the picture ). Hans Zimmer is truly a god at music, i respect him a great bit now. All actors in this film do a great job, however Jaquin Pheonix really stills the show. Playing the very disturbed and conflicted Commodos, Jaquin does a great job expressing conterdicting emotions and facial expressions. Though the story is well told and petty solid ( with exception of some historical inaccuracies ) it is not that original, of course then again what is now-a-days. And.... geez i didnt realize how much i loved this movie well lets cut to the chase. Im not gonna insult you or call you an unitellectual if you didnt like this movie or thought it was boring, becuase i can understand what your complaints are. I just dont agree with them. But if you liked BraveHeart or Spartacus you will not be let down by this movie. I think this movie deserves a 9/10 ( sorry only Shawshank and Requiem get a 10 in my book )."What we do in life echoes an eternity"- General Maximus, "Gladiator"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Russell Crowe earned his Oscar for his portrayal of Maximus, and it had nothing to do with the fact that he didn't win for The Insider. His performance in Gladiator is absolutely flawless. I can't imagine anybody else playing Maximus. This was my first time seeing Russell, and now he is my favorite actor.If I had to describe Russell's performance in one word, it would be `subtle.' Less is more. Joel Siegel, the film critic on `Good Morning America,' said `Russell Crowe is not an action star, but he is such a great actor he makes you believe he is an action star.' Joel is missing the point. The LAST thing this movie needs is an action star! The role of Maximus required an actor who could convey all the facets of Maximus' personality and emotions. He also needed to look good in a tunic and perform convincingly in the action scenes. Russell combines all the necessary qualities and looks gorgeous. I can't praise his performance enough. Russell always holds your attention and makes himself clear, but always in a very subtle way. He is never flashy or exaggerated. He conveys Maximus' dignity, intelligence, courage, intensity, warmth, sense of humor, and all his other qualities. He is also totally believable in the action scenes.All the performances in this movie are excellent. Joaquin Phoenix should have won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Commodus. Connie Nielsen (Lucilla) has real chemistry with Russell.The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard is magnificent and should have won the Oscar.I also have a couple of minor complaints about the movie.The cinematography in the beginning of the movie is awful. I know they wanted us to understand that Germania is cold, but it was not necessary to photograph those scenes in such a way that everything is tinted blue. It just looks wrong. The actors have blue faces and the costumes look dull and washed out. The scene in which Maximus walks out of Marcus Aurelius' (Richard Harris) tent and meets Lucilla is the most egregious.The writing leaves something to be desired. When Commodus discovers that Maximus is alive, he says `They lied to me...They told me he was dead.' But there was nobody left alive! Who lied to Commodus?Seeing Gladiator made me want to learn something about the real Roman Empire, and I have been doing some reading. Gladiator is a brilliantly acted, very entertaining movie, and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gladiator" ranks high among movies about Roman times, "Spartacus", "Ben-Hur", "Fall of the Roman Empire", "Quo Vadis" come to mind. The movie maintains its uniqueness among these heroic sagas in the way it affords us a view of those times and men in those times. The panoramic scale the movie maintains to set us up and bring us into the parts of the story is breath-taking. The camera shots of the protagonists makes sure the viewer is held firmly and moved surely through the plot. The intensity of the final confrontation is brought by sheer force of the way the viewer is brought to this point. For people who enjoy movies, this is an event that must not missed. On a personal note, the opening scenes were a bonus to students of Caesar's Gallic Wars. If you have always wondered, like me, how those battles (strategies &amp; tactics) were fought, this is the answer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought the video of 'Gladiator' for my dad's birthday. He loved it, my brother loved it, my mother loved it, my Latin teacher loved it, everyone else I know loved it, and of course I loved it too. But I wanted to see it in the cinema, because it's more powerful there. A friend of mine once told me the end of the film, that wasn't very nice, but still I wanted to see it and I'm glad I did. I like movies about ancient Rome, even when I was a kid, this is after Ben-Hur my favorite one.The story is simple, but it's very strong and effective shown to the audience. A Roman general, called Maximus (Russell Crowe) is betrayed, and he's forced to go into slavery, as a gladiator he tries to survive, and after many victories, he goes back to Rome in the Colosseum, where he wants to take revenge on the corrupted emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).This movie has an excellent cast, Russell Crowe as the hero, Joaquin Phoenix as the corrupted emperor, Richard Harris as the TRUE emperor, Connie Nielsen as the sister of Commodus, and Oliver Reed as the former gladiator who teaches Maximus how to be a magnificent gladiator. Pity that it was his last performance. (Oliver, we'll miss you.)The performances were terrific, especially from Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, but the others were terrific too. As for the Oscars, there are people who say it's been overrated, I think it's a bit underrated, even though it won 5 Oscars. I was disappointed that Joaquin Phoenix and Ridley Scott didn't get an Oscar for this, because they both really surprised me. However I was glad that it won an Oscar for Best Picture and Russell Crowe for Best Actor, I wasn't surprised about that because Russell really showed what a true hero is. Ridley Scott did an excellent job with this movie. I'm really impressed. The special effects are outstanding, and they don't subordinate the performances of the actors. Ridley brings us in the heart of Rome, and inside the walls of the Colosseum, where the battles are organized. These battle scenes are really great and exciting to see. But the best thing Ridley Scott did, was to give us a clew how it was in the ancient Rome, I mean, those things REALLY happened back then, and Rome loved this: the blood, the gore, the fights, etc. Ridley Scott made these images very realistic, in a way it's beautiful made, even though it's extremely violent and brutal. But behind all the violence and the blood, there's a striking story of a man, who becomes the poorest man, but after a while he becomes a hero and he puts Rome back on its feet. Ridley also describes the politics and the corruption in Rome, those things also were well known in the ancient Rome.I really enjoyed this movie, and after all those years it's fun to see another Roman epic. I recommend this movie to everyone, my advice, BUY it, don't RENT it, and get ready for a big pile of action. The Roman epic is back again. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator was a great movie. It really got me interested in Roman history. That's the movie that made me decide that Russell Crowe is my favorite actor. Although Gene Wilder is right behind him. Gladiator was a moving and action-packed movie all together. Who came up with that idea? It was great!!! And they picked great people for the parts too. That gave Russell the big brake he needed. Now he's back in action. If you haven't seen it then you're missing out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything that makes a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" has everything that makes a film a great film. It has a pretty simple story, a main character that you can either identify with or which has an incredible sex appeal (so my wife tells me), great actors, a great score, and very professional production.You can easily find films that outperform "Gladiator" on one of those elements, but films that do so on *all* elements are rather scarce. I've seen plenty of comments complaining about the story or overuse of special effects, but you might as well go and complain about Star Wars - because I think that what makes Star Wars a great movie is pretty much what I described in the first paragraph.*** Spoiler warning: if you don't know anything about the film, best not read the part that comes next ***The film is indeed rather dark. There are the very graphic fights on the battlefield and in the arenas. There is the decadence of Roman culture, and the incestuous love (lust?) of Commodus for his sister. It certainly doesn't have a happy end, but amazingly so this is one unhappy end that makes you feel good: it gives a glimpse of afterlife as the Romans would have perceived it, and somehow it tells you that dying isn't as bad as people make it out to be.All in all, I think this is one of those rare, very beautiful films. When you leave the auditorium, you're still in another world. There are very few films that have that effect - instead relying on what the CGI department came up with this week, or what the statistics say a film should be like. It is a pleasure to watch, a film like a film should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**It saddens me to see so many uninformed and under-intelligent reviews for this film, which is unfortunatly the same for many other films on this site, "Russel Crowe was pathetic" is one comment, this user must have been blind or concentrating too much on their popcorn to realise that this could not be more wrong. The comment on the box, "Russel Crowe's performance hits the screen with such force that you can't rip your eyes away" is far more closer to the truth, the film deserved very much the oscars that it received.Many would see this movie as old by now, but I am writing this today after watching it again and after all these years, it still has the same staying power that it had when I watched the first time.The movie is about a Roman general who has the utmost pride and loyalty to the Emporer, played by Richard Harris. Who has been betrayed by his son, Claudius, **Spoiler** who murders Richard Harris's character in order to circumvent his father's decision that Claudius will not be emporer after his father dies. In order to succeed the throne against that wish. ** End Spoiler **There after, the General, "Maximus" played by Russel Crowe is also betrayed by the mentally disturbed Claudius, who murdered maximus's family because Maximus would not swear loyalty to Claudius as the New Emporer.Maximus ends up as a slave to fight in the gladiator battles that Claudius has planned.Maximus now sets out to get revenge on Claudius and from there the plotline develops into a tangled web of good versus evil, in places it seems that the good will not prevail and in others you think that it might. Quite a twister!One thing I will say is that there is probably too much gore throughout the film, although this is balanced by the fact that games such as those actually happened in Roman times and probably were a lot more gruesome, something to think about....Anyway I think that there was no need for so much gore to get the plotline accross effectivley.The ending leaves no loose ends, which improves my opinion of the film considerably.Loose ends really annoy me at the end of films, some of the films that I had initially thought were good, end up with disappointing endings and many loose ends, which greatly reduce my final opinion of them.If I was to give an overall opinion of this film, I'd say that this is probably the best film I have seen to date, followed closely only by "Titanic", "Lord Of The Rings" and/or "Men In Black"10 out of 10 See it if you havn't and watch it again if you have!

		<fullReview>Brilliant acting, brutal battle sequences, and a concise story propel "Gladiator" to epic status, making it quite possibly the greatest epic of Ancient Rome ever filmed, rivalled only by "Spartacus".Russell Crowe proves himself to be one of the great actors of our time as he plays General Maximus, a man who only wants to live a quiet, peaceful life with his family. Instead, Maximus is hailed for his abilities in battle, first on the battlefield as he helps Emperor Marcus Aurelius expand the Empire, then in the gladiator arena after he is betrayed, sold into slavery, and forced to kill for the entertainment of the barbaric masses. Crowe shows us the General's quiet desperation to get home after the battle in Germania, his unimaginable shock at finding his family murdered, and his intense desire to avenge his family by killing Commodus, a range of emotions that many actors these days have trouble playing convincingly, but which Crowe handles perfectly.But a hero is only as good as his nemesis is bad, and Joaquin Phoenix portrays the insane Emperor Commodus flawlessly. Commodus is shown as more than a crazed dictator; he is shown as a young man who wanted to feel love from his father, but couldn't, even when his father tried to express his love for Commodus. His unsettling passion for his sister makes the audience dislike him, but his apparent love for his nephew makes him seem human, until he threatens the boy near the end. The audience comes to hate Commodus, but there is also a feeling of pity for him, and that is a hard balance for an actor to maintain. Phoenix shows that he has a long, impressive career ahead of him, and in my opinion, he should have been awarded the Best Supporting Actor Oscar when he was nominated for this role.Everything about this production is remarkable, from the almost Wagnerian score to the jarring choreography and cinematography of the battle sequences. A true masterpiece of movie making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting, Profound Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie truly deserved to win Best Picture. Ridley Scott does a magnificent job directing, and the acting is stellar from the entire cast. Connie Nielsen as Lucilla is particularly enchanting, and really looks the part of Roman nobility. She embraces her brother the emperor, but schemes against him at the same time. Joaquin Phoenix is also captivating as the callous and callow, yet fiercely cunning Emperor Commodus. The late Oliver Reed is wonderful in his part as the former gladiator Proximo, who earned his freedom. Russell Crowe is very good as Maximus. He portrays the strength, pride and dignity of a Roman General very well, and rightly maintains that facade even when he is reduced to gladiator/entertainer/slave status. The score by Hans Zimmer is appropriately haunting, as this is a heartbreaking film. It hurts to see Maximus lose his family, and become an outcast from the society he loved. It also hurts to see that refined society transformed into a bloodthirsty mob who live for the games orchestrated by a petty tyrant not deserving of the title emperor. Gladiator is very much a tragedy. I found it amusing that one major critic said he didn't like it because it didn't have enough blue skies and bright colors. Ok, I guess you didn't get the point of the movie. For everyone else, I highly recommend Gladiator, especially on DVD (which includes Ridley's informative commentary track on the making of the film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie that even got some of the history right!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is one of my favorite movies to date.Review: While the storyline is fictional, the emperors and their character traits are historical. In both the movie and in history, Marcus Aurelius was a good emperor who cared about Rome but who had a very cruel son (Commodus). The addition of Maximus is not necessarily historical, though Commodus was (SPOILER) assassinated (END SPOILER) by someone. Also, in history Marcus Aurelius allowed Commodus to be his successor, where in the movie, that was not his intent. I thought the storyline was excellent. Extremely gripping and intense. An excellent battle of good vs. evil.Objectionable Content: This IS an R rated movie! Actually though, it really wasn't nearly as bad as I expected. I started watching the movie with expectations of gory battles with blood everywhere. I was pleasantly surprised. It still had some really nasty parts, but as a whole the gory parts were very short and the camera quickly moved on. It is definitely too gory for a PG-13 movie, but it really isn't terrible. As for other objectionable content, profanity is limited to only a few words that are in most PG-13 movies and sex/nudity is practically non-existent. The princess seems to try a couple times to make moves on the married Maximus, but he ignores her and moves on. Commodus also is a bit "too" loving and close to his sister (the princess), but nothing is further hinted or shown. Maximus also prays to Roman gods and frequently talks about how he will go into the after-life and be with his family. If that were true, the movie's ending would be much more triumphant. All in all though, objectionable content is fairly minor for an R rated movie.Conclusion: This is a great movie, especially for being rated R. My main problem with it is that Maximus doesn't seem to mind killing the other gladiators much. He voices his thoughts that it is a sick and disgusting form of entertainment, but he still does it. Not that he had a choice, but he only spoke out against it once in the whole movie. Also, the whole movie is about his rise to recognition so that he makes it to the Roman Colliseum, where he can kill Commodus, the evil emperor who killed his family. I don't blame him one bit, as I was furious at Commodus after he told Maximus how he killed his family (probably one of the most sad parts in the whole movie), but from a moral standpoint, it would have been better for Maximus to not take the law into his own hands (although that wouldn't have made a very entertaining movie). My point is that not everything the protagonist does is good and worthy of being a role-model. He is loyal to his family and country however, and he does value life (even though he valued his own life more than the other gladiators he was fighting). All in all, there are some things to be concerned about morally, but all these things are historical. In conclusion though, an excellent movie. Amazing acting (Russel Crowe was awesome!), emotional storyline, awesome CG graphics and scenery, cool battle scenes (even though they can be pretty nasty), and an epic battle of good vs. evil. I loved it. Excellent, very entertaining, and not all that gross. I would recommend this for people who want a serious but awesome movie, and who are above the age of 13. It also has fairly good history, so for Roman history fans this would also be a great look. A definite 9 rating.Extras: DVD - 2 discs, movie in widescreen format, running audio commentary, 11 deleted scenes with or without commentary, as well as unused shots and leftover sequences, the making of Gladiator, a 50 minute feature on gladiators and their contests, a feature about the musical score for Gladiator, a gladiator journal, original storylines for key sequences and deleted sequences (also has conceptual art), a still gallery of portraits, Rome, Germania, the Collosseum, Zucchabar, and behind the scenes, and theatrical teaser and trailer, cast bios, and production notes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly UNDERrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was reviewing the comments above and was surprised to see that most of them were derogatory or lukewarm about the movie. There are some who call it an action flick and some who call it Oscar fodder, and truthfully, it is both. But even if you don't see all the different aspects that come together to make this movie so wonderful, the Academy did. There are REASONS that films win Oscars, in case you didn't know. **Possible spoilers, somewhere in the message, yeah yeah...** First, let me say that my opinion was extremely biased against the movie in the first place. I was feeling sore that Russell Crowe beat out Tom Hanks for Best Actor, and didn't even bother to see Gladiator to see if it was justified. Before I saw this movie, I was grumbling, "Piece of crap...Russell Crowe probably sucks...I know I'm gonna hate it." After...well, my tissue box was empty, my mouth hanging open, and my Tom Hanks posters in the trash. I had never cried at a single movie until this one. What really astonishes is the large percentage of people who seem to hate it. Perhaps they're automatically going against the Academy because it picks so many crappy movies, but this time it was right on target. Those people were right, Gladiator didn't deserve best picture of the year. It deserved best of the decade.The blood and gore portrayed were real, and graphic enough to deserve an R rating. But they were not put there just for show. Every maiming/decapitation had its place in the movie. Partly why they showed so much gore is to chronicle Maximus' resignation to the fact that he must kill to survive, and not only that, but must kill in front of the bloodthirsty Roman public for entertainment to survive. He maintains a hearty disgust for it throughout the movie ("Are you not entertained?") but doesn't fight it. There is no controversy on that point. To think that all the arena scenes were completely pointless is wrong! Through them, Maximus gains the support of the people and enough power to topple the emperor.Need I even mention the acting? Definitely! Russell Crowe deserved every praise he got, but there is one actor who didn't get praised nearly enough. Joaquin Phoenix. Most movie villains are corny or just plain evil, but Phoenix's Commodus is multi-layered and complex. He provides the perfect foil to Maximus, his dangerous insecurity makes him a loose cannon to compete with the gladiator's quiet confidence. By the end of the movie, I hated him with a passion; hated not only the character but hated him, so thoroughly did he immerse himself into Commodus. His insecurities make him all the more sinister, and as he was 'telling' Lucius the busy little bee story, he truly scared me. I was getting chills! I haven't seen him in Quills, but he was getting many compliments on that too. Let me just say that he's one of the best actors in Hollywood! British great Derek Jacobi delivers a sold performance as Gracchus, the pro-republic senator who enters the conspiracy against Commodus. Too bad he didn't get more screen time here, or something more remarkable to say and do. Derek is great in any movie, however! Connie Nielsen didn't really stand out to me; although there is certainly nothing bad about her acting, in a cast of such talent she was the status quo. Oliver Reed and Richard Harris complete the ensemble to make it the movie where everyone is an award-winner.If you want something that truly shines, in story, setting, cast, special effects, and pretty much anything else you can think of, don't hesitate to watch Gladiator. You won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*Few movies are as breath-taking and exciting as GLADIATOR, a film that contains brilliant battle sequences and marvelous storytelling. After returning from a long, hard battle during the time of the Punic Wars, Maximus (Russel Crowe) is coming home. Greeted by the Caeser (Richard Harris) and his son Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus is expecting gratitude for the work that he has served during the war. But, when the Caeser is murdered by Commodus after learning that he shall not be Emperor, Maximus is ordered to be executed. Escaping his executors, Maximus is sold off as a slave and must fight in the arena as a gladiator. Commodus then orders for Maximus' wife and son to be killed. When Commodus finds him, Maximus will do anything to exact his revenge. Russel Crowe gives a spotty performance, but it wasn't anything special. Joaquin Phoenix (THE YARDS) was the person who I was most impressed by. He does a good job as the creepy emperor. And it really sucks to learn that Oliver Reed passed away during filming. He did a really good job too. And look for Djimon Honsou (DEEP RISING) as Juba the hunter.I like the atmosphere of the film. I like the way Rome was recreated as it was back in 180 AD. The opening battle sequence was one of my favorite parts. It has a slight ring of SLEEPY HOLLOW to it, with its cloudy and gloomily eerie sky. This film has everything, action, drama, a little romance, suspense, adventure, and even somewhat of a horror story to it. During the end, when Joaquin Phoenix is giving off his "Busy little Bee" story, I was getting a little spooked by his performance. It has something that relates to a royal conspiracy of some sort. When we get into the battles, you are enticed by an endless array of action. GLADIATOR is a great movie. While I don't feel that Crowe's performance should have garned him the Best Actor award, I still think that he should've gotten credit. This is a milestone in filmmaking....5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazingly Different Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you go into this movie expecting straight-up action packed scenes, a muscular hero, and the blood and gore that we've come to expect then you will get what you want, but soooo much more. This movie has all a good action movie should have; a ton of fighting scenes with blood flying everywhere and a central hero who is unstoppable. On top of that Gladiator is a story that highlights an ancient empire, both its glory and its corruption. Russel Crowe is stunning as a humble, softspoken general who becomes a slave and fights, at first to keep his life, and later, to save an empire. Russel Crowe is incredible as can also be seen in A Beautiful Mind and is one of the greatest actors of our day. Crowe manages to play a gladiator who, although he fights for a living and does it amazingly well, also can be caring and humble. Joaquin Phoneix plays just his opposite and is also incredibly good. In this movie you hate him so much because he is able to play a bad guy who you can't stand and want to see die a horrible death. But that is what makes him so good. He is ruthless and cunning, but is blind to his flaws and his hunger for power. I think both of these actors are great in this film but Crowe takes the cake because he's the good guy and he's the one you're rooting for. The scenery is also breathtaking as the filmmakers recreate ancient Rome including the palace and the Colesseum. Of course since these places don't exist entirely anymore they were all computer generated but are blended in superbly and it looks like they're actually there. This movie is definetly in my top 3 movies ever and perhaps I dare to say my number 1 ever.</fullReview>

Despite tragic detours, he eventually finds his way to the Colosseum where he becomes a fierce and influential gladiator, while still maintaining his vow to claim retribution against the ruthless emperor. The vision of Roman times is imaginatively brought to life by director Scott as the film boasts remarkable set design, well-drawn characters, powerful performances (anchored by Crowe's commanding presence), and rousing battle scenes.

		<shortDescription>More than just a 'boys' movie . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then a movie comes along which you take a while to see, but end up loving. In the case of Gladiator, I saw it almost two years after its release. The obvious question then is: Why on earth did it take me so long? I must admit that when it first came out I wasn't too keen to see it, since it sounded too much like a typical 'boys' action movie with plenty of blood and gratuitous human destruction. Well, having now seen it more than once, I must say this film is most impressive. Rather than simply 'entertaining the masses' (in more ways than one), this film seems to work on quite a convincing spiritual level. OK, I concede it does revolve around 4 or 5 very well orchestrated fight sequences, however for me these, some would say, 'pivotal' sequences are secondary to what I consider to be a much more important aspect of the film - the spiritual journey undertaken by Maximus. Russell Crowe's performance in this film is very, very good, since his character is quite complex, more complex perhaps than some viewers would think. For mine, he captures both the physicality and the spirituality of Maximus more than adequately. However, it is the character of Maximus I am more moved by than the actor who plays him. Maximus really is an outstanding creation who appealed to me both as a dedicated soldier and as a human being. The motif of Maximus walking through the wheat I find extremely moving, as it shows him to be a man of enormous spiritual depth, despite the ugly Roman world he exists in. The opening shot of him, brooding, contemplating, and acknowledging the presence of the bird only adds to his sentimentality. As a counterpoint to this Joaquin Phoenix is truly outstanding. I really do feel that he deserved the Oscar for supporting actor for this role (perhaps more so than Benecio Del Toro) since this is a knockout performance. He captures so brilliantly the hideous brutality of the Roman Empire, the twisted, perverted view of the world that excessive power can instill in an individual who lacks the maturity to handle it appropriately. It seems Phoenix injected himself into this role most admirably. The results, I feel, are absolutely first-rate. As for the film's ending, well, what can one say? What a fantastic ending! I suspect some may not go for it, however, for me, I couldn't really imagine it any other way. It must be hard for filmmakers to conclude their stories, so I guess it makes us admire them all the more when they do it so well as Ridley Scott has here. The closing fight sequence is riveting (including its pre-cursor in the corridors), and the closing sequences left me speechless (and this is rare!) So well done to Ridley Scott et al for this major contribution to the Hollywood circuit. Although Scott can get a bit carried away with his filmmaking at times, he has truly struck a chord with this viewer in the case of Gladiator. I was spiritually moved by this film, and I seriously never expected that I would be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Movie - Historically ACCURATE!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just so you know, this is probably the most historically ACCURATE movie of ancient Rome ever. The special effects and plot are amazing, but what really gets my goat is how you so-called "historians" make such a big fuss with "anachronisms" that don't even exist. Sure, some horsemen have stirrups, but just because their is no evidence *today* does not mean that they didn't have something that looked like it. These so-called historians may know about facts, but the people at dreamworks were trying to recreate a civilization that collapsed fifteen-hundred years ago (not including Byzantium, of course). Below are just a few of the arguments that I could come up with, with the "historian's statement followed by my response.1. "They never threw bread in the collosseum like hot dogs at a baseball game!" Well, just because their is no evidence AT THE MOMENT doesn't mean that there will ever be at all. And besides, they had food stands outside, just like at a baseball game - why not have throwers?2. "Gladiator's were rarely ever killed, because they were very valuable!" Really (OH MY GOD!) This is probably the lamest argument ever! They never had the electric chair for capital punishment, so they had to find another way to get rid of their "criminals" (P.O.W.'s, Christians...). At that point in history, many Romans were poor and miserable, so the government decided to take their minds off of their lives by watching other people suffer. In fact, during the time of Commodus (the emperor in the movie), thousands of gladiators were killed.3. "Male gladiators and female gladiator's almost never fought together". Just because there is no immediate evidence does not mean that they never did. And also, maybe Commodus wanted to give the crowd something out of the ordinary.4. "The Roman Writing is wrong" That is because we are looking through the eyes of a latin-speaking person. Since the Romans could understand their mother tongue as we can, we could assume that reading was just as natural. It is challenging to explain, but let's say that in a movieif our mother-tongue was latin, the writings on buildings in a French movie would be written in latin as well.5. "The names do not follow the normal Roman pattern (daughter of of Julius is Julia, and how the daughter of Tiberius would be Tiberia)". The Roman empire ruled a very large space, so their are many different ethnicities. Cicero never had a "traditional" Roman name, so why can't Marcus Aurelius' daughter be named Lucia?6. "In the battle scene, the many siege weapons were not invented yet till centuries later." Oye Vey! The romans were ingenius with the art of siege warfare. In fact, the large catapults and ballista's were in perfect time. They were wrapped in sheets of oil and set alight as well! One ballista (a huge field artillery-like crossbow), known as the Helepolis, was the most sofisticated weapon of the time, because when a crank was pulled, a deadly dart was fired, and another was mechanically set. That is why you see all the flaming arrows in the beginning.5. "The romans never had an archery unit." They very well did! They were called missile units, and were usually fed from the local auxillaries, such as the ones in Syria. They were the best in the world at that time. And besides, in Persia, the Romans had to fight against Parthians, whose strategy was to fire arrows on horseback. Don't you think that it would be stupid for a heavily clad footman to chase a light-speed horse archer, when that foot soldier belonged to an army that was the best the world has ever seen?6. "The battle scene was all screwed up" The romans did use scientific warfare, but, as we see in the beginning, the battle in Germania was going on for a long time before we are there, so maybe the romans did not see the german's as much of a threat? And even though the roman's slashed in this movie with their swords instead of the "known" hide-and-stab technique, did it ever occur to you that it might have been part of Maximus's strategy, though how unlikely it seems?7. "The costumes are wrong." Not every single Roman wore a toga! That is like saying all North American's wear jeans! Only officials down to high middle-class wore them. The poor people probably wore a simple tunic (which they almost all did), but remember that many provincials visited the Eternal City itself (Gauls in trousers, and so on.).And finally, the stupidest nitpick ever:"The characters in that story never died like that" True. Aurelius was never murdered by his son, and nor was their a person called Maximus in the first place. But their never was a person called Ben Hur either, so why are you historians ganging up on this innocent sword-and-sandals-soon-to-be-a-classic movie? The movie is historical fiction - FICTION that uses a historical context to play the characters in. There is nothing wrong by bending the facts in an entertainment movie (the best stories are what-if stories, like this, in my opinion). It's not as if this movie is a history lesson on how these people lived.Thank you for reading my comments. Even though I am not a graduate YET, I have read volumes and volumes of books on ancient Rome from "A History of the Ancient World" by the historian Chester G. Starr to poetry by Ovid. I really hope that you people who think that this movie is full of more anachronisms than "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" have gained a couple nuggets from a budding wisdom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing wave after wave of mindless action movies, I was actually quite surprised to for once see a movie that took its time (almost three hours) to tell an epic tale of courage, love, etc.That story is far from perfect: the movie can be horribly slow, there are plot holes, and the entire thing borders on the sentimental, but as a whole the story is quite impressive.The action scenes in this movie, which are not as frequent as you might expect, are quite well-done for the most part, although they are edited in a very haphazard way, making the battles very hard to follow.Gladiator is by no means a classic, but it's a welcome change from the explosion-per-minute, mindless Jerry Bruckheimer and Ronald Emmerich (to name a few) crap, and it's a movie that has a really epic feeling to it. It make me feel great for at least a week after first seeing it.*** out of **** stars</fullReview>

Just click to see the latest user comments and 90% of them will be negative, trust me. So why, then, did this movie get a rating 8.1 on the database and a solid position in the top 250? Personally I think it's a very good movie, it keeps you riveted to your seat from start to finish. Great performances, great action, wonderful music and production design. It was easily the most memorable movie to come out of 2000. CROUCHING TIGER, you say? Boring hokum. TRAFFIC? Well intentioned, but highly unpleasant and tedious. ALMOST FAMOUS? Unwhimsical, repetitious gobbledygook. CAST AWAY? Pretty funny on the island, extremely crappy everywhere else. GLADIATOR was the film to see, and it more than deserved the Oscars it got. I swear I turned off the Oscars when I saw that TRAFFIC WON for best director. All the guy did was shake his camera around and stage dialogue scenes. Ridley Scott is one great director and GLADIATOR is easily his best film ever. People who don't like it should ask themselves if they like movies at all, since GLADIATOR is so obviously what they are all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lincoln as Gladiator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a magnificent Ridley Scott film, honoured by a sensational score from Hans Zimmer.Gladiator has all of the visual flare that you come to expect from Ridley Scott, this time enhanced by brilliant use of computer graphics (note the rendering of Rome). Hans Zimmer produces a good score, featuring also Lisa Gerrard.Oliver Reed does himself justice in what turns out to be his valedictory role.My final thought is that at the end of the film, just before succumbing to his trecherous wounds from Commodus, the title gladiator Maximus announces 'free my men'! He is clearly President LINCOLN all along, playing out a noble quest to free all slaves and democratise the nation. This is reinforced by the final, end tribute from the freed black gladiator who says that they've all been freed by Maximus.NB. Buy this on the special edition DVD, which features tons of stuff on the music (interview with Hans Zimmer), making of, documentaries about gladiators, etc. the DVD is brilliant!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people would compare this film to Braveheart. it may be true but not always. Braveheart was a film about a man's fight for freedom. Gladiator is a film about a man's fight for justice and what he feels should be rational. i saw this film once again on New Year's Day and i was captivated by it. Russell Crowe gave a performance of what I led to belive may be the best performance he has ever given. One of the many aspects of the film is the direction as well as the cinematography. Ridley Scott is a visionary director and he creates this movie pictures that will stick out in our minds forever. the battle scenes as well as the stadium scenes may be quite brutal but it's important to know about it and see it because these most of the people back in those times who fought in these stadiums were slaves and they fought to show that they were courageous and wanted their justice. this may be a one of those films that was rapidly paced. The film was two and a half hours long but it seemed like a hour less because the film went by so quickly. I really believe that Gladiator is one of the best films i have ever seen as well as one of the best action films i have ever seen. The acting was excellent and the directing was magnificent. If you want to see a movie that will leave you in awe or what to learn about the history of ancient societies such as Roman societies, take a look at this film. You will be amazed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's why I liked "Gladiator" . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up in what is called a simpler time. Motion pictures then are considered milksop today because they didn't deal with "real life". I'm glad I'm not a kid today. They have had to deal with destructive drug use, vulgar sex, disgusting language, unredeemable violence, disease, rape, incest . . . name it, it is part of today's culture. And, it IS destructive. Motion pictures in the 40's and 50's left us with a set of values about how one should live our lives. They were idealized. They were about duty, honor, courage, justice, etc. and if they were about the opposite of those values, they reflected the consequences of a wasted life. Gladiator is "old-fashioned" movie-making. I liked it because it reminded me of my youth which was a great time to be young. But it ought to be an important movie also. Just imagine all the impressionable young minds glorying in the heroism of Maximus. I'm not a religious man but a picture like this makes me wish I were. I have a hard time believing that there are rewards in an after-life for a heroic life. That is why it is so important for our young people to have a valued childhood; so they can grow to be a valued adult. The rewards of a good life may only be realized in THIS life. Gladiator goes beyond our time but movies like that didn't harm me as a youngster; no more than the fantasy stories we grew up with. If the fantasy of an after-life is deemed destructive then I suggest you don't see the current Harry Hopper films; nor the Lord of the Rings or even It's a Wonderful Life. Actually there is a long list of films that may be milksop but I don't think there's enough of them, especially these days.As for Russell Crowe being a "poor" actor, I think those critics will have to reevaluate their positions when they have seen "A Beautiful Mind". Russell just might win ANOTHER oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott's crowning achievement...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, he's had a sparkling and varied directing career with films such as "Alien" and "Thelma and Louise," but this one gave Ridley Scott his Oscar -- and deservedly so. "Gladiator" has the same epic scope as the anamorphic films of yesteryear, but never bores the audience with non-essential characters or dialogue. Tight, well-paced, and full of in-your-face action sequences (not for the squeamish), it doesn't take long to discover hero and villain. After seeing this one, I'm betting you'll agree that it's almost more fun to hate Joaquin Phoenix as the incestuous, psychopathic Roman emperor than it is to cheer for our beloved gladiator, Mr. Crowe. Almost. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flashy, action-driven piece of cinematic trash.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I'll be the first to admit that this movie has spectacular action sequences, depicting horrifying terrible combat and beheadings and arrow strikings, I must say that I am really perplexed as to why so many people find this movie so good. It never deserved any awards, save maybe a "gruesomest bloodbath" award. People are harping on and on about how Russell Crowe is this great actor, but all he did, the entire movie was either look p***ed off or look about to cry. His character had no depth, no faults, he was brave, gallant, honorable, and completely too perfect to be human. His nemesis, Commode-ius or whatever toilet-sounding Greek name he had was as shallow and one-dimensional a villain I have seen since Titanic. He had no redeeming traits, even when you thought he might show one... oh, it was eclipsed because he either killed his father or molested his sister. Plus the story line? Utter trash! When will movie writers see that the audiences of America (at least the ones that can think for themselves) want something more than the standard by the book epic of "Great novel superior Good" vs. the "Deep dark despicable Evil" that killed his wife and kids and other people too? When will we get more than a simple piece of re-hashed, re-charactered, and ever-so-slightly-re-written cinematic garbage to feast our intellects on? Obviously not as long as the tasteless hoards gush to see the epic about people getting chopped up, that was produced by no-talent scene-stealing unimaginative hacks. Ridley Scott, I'm very disappointed in you...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting in this fim was in my opinion very good. Russell Crowe's performance was outstanding. You get the sense that his men respected him, you get to see how proficient he is at fighting, you get to see a tender side. The one thing that I never hear or read is the fact that for quite a lengthy period of time Crowe doesn't speak. He gets his emotions across without words. And it works. Ridley Scott is a great director. Some may say the first battle is full of fast cuts, but to me it gives you the feeling of being in battle. There are lots of things going on and you have to try and get it all in. The rest of the cast is fantastic. Joaquin Phoenix did a marvelous job. Finally the score. As with many great films the music just enhances the enjoyment of the film. Hans Zimmer gets high marks for the music in the both the first battle &amp; its reprise in the Barbarian Horde scene. All in all was it the best film of 2000? I won't say outright yes, but considering what else was out it had to be right up there.</fullReview>

Some of the most memorable quotes come from the character of Maximus, such as 'My name is Gladiator'.Another outstanding performance is that of Connie Nielsen as Lucilla.The action scenes are well done, and extremely bloody, but this makes them more authentic.If you haven't seen this movie yet, you are missing out on one of the best movies ever made.Definately 10/10!</fullReview>

I found the acting good, the spectacle and special effects outstanding, the hero one we could cheer for. Why, then, do I feel so empty? Was it all the hype, best picture of the year? I just don't know. It was totally predictable. There were absolutely no surprises. After seeing The Patriot and realizing both movies have the same plot, I expected something more. Why are evil Roman Emperors always portrayed as cowardly wimps? I still don't believe that he actually was willing to go into the arena with Maximus. He wouldn't have anything to do with war. There is the obligatory killing of the family. That goes back to Macbeth folks. If a ruler wants to stay a ruler, leave the family alone. I know it's just to show how evil and powerful the Emperor is, but do you want the top general in the army gunning for you?--this will guarantee it. There is masterful cinematography in this film. The scenes of violence are masterful. Although once you've seen one fountain of blood spouting up, you've seen them all--one decapitation is like another. What I wanted was to see the characters really dealing with the evil of the times and confronting it. There is always that army out there ready to be commanded again. There is always the possibility that the greatest empire in the world can be destroyed by one guy (like when Mel Gibson won the Revolutionary War all by himself). I think this is really quite a good film. But I don't see it as deserving to be named the best of any year. We've come to demand a movie that looks good rather than one that grasps our heart.</fullReview>

The strongest parts of this Ridley Scott film are the excellent fight scenes and the performances of veteran actors Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, and Oliver Reed (who died during the filming). Only the appearence and design of Rome look very grainy and unpleasant. I have some doubt why this movie received some Oscars that included Best Actor (Crowe, no offense) and Best Picture. The only nominations that this film should deserve are Best Supporting Actor for Reed and Djimon Hounsou instead of Joaquin Phoenix (brother of the late River Phoenix).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely does a film leave me with a sense of awe. I am not easily impressed. As a rare person who is easily affected by violence I found this film to be exceptional. Everything about it was choreographed so well, Not just the fight scenes. All of the character interactions were done so well. Russell Crowe was, as always outstanding. I have yet to see him not be a full character. Totally absorbing as Maximus. His emotion and depth were enough to convince me that this is truly one of the finest actors this decade. He can truly be anybody. The music was incredible, but then it was Hans Zimmer. I listen to the soundtrack and it transports back into the film. Incredible film viewing opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-The Best: Russell Crowe, Connie Nielsen, the evil River Phoenix, the directing, plot, music, cinematography, the outstanding battle scenes which lead this film to be one of the best of all time. Synopsis: the whole movie. -The Worst:????????????????? -Rating: 9/10Roman General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is chosen to be the new emperor of Rome after Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) instead of his son Commodus (River Phoenix), which becomes a corrupt prince by killing his father and claiming himself has the new emperor of Rome. As soon as Commodus has his hands on the power he orders the army to kill General Maximus and his family. It happens that Maximus survives the attack, but not does the family that is burned and crucified alive. Maximus is found unconscious on the ground by a group of nomads who turn himself in a gladiator called Spaniard specially known for his combat skills and are these very skills that take him to Rome to fight in the Colosseum as a Gladiator. Also in Rome Maximus calls everyone's attention once more by his combat skills which moves the emperor to know who that Spaniard Gladiator is. It is in this moment that appears one of the movie's best lines: ? My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the armies of the north, general of the Felix legions, loyal to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and now I will have my vengeance, in this life or in the next.'. Commodus is now frightened to see that his control of the empire is dropping and the people's love for him is each time dropping as well arranges some plan to make the new hero of Rome be forgotten in less than nothingOnce more, revealing the rest of the movie's plot would certainly be really boring and somehow useless because there's almost no one who haven't seen this masterpiece already. Regarding to the movie's evident quality there aren't needed anymore words uttered by another viewer like me, as this year's Oscar nominations speak for themselves. Start running to the Oscar ceremony as the clear favourite, Gladiator's final number of Oscars ended up being somewhat like a big disappointment (there were only five). However the awards delivered to the movie were all fair besides the Visual Effects one. I can tell that I am one of the biggest defenders of this movie, but if the recreation of one big city would have been done in some other movie it would certainly be forgotten or ignored by the academy to the nominations list, in my opinion what led to the big astonishment regarding to this effects was the fact that no one have seen the city of Rome in good old times of the empire so fully created before. It is clear to everyone's eyes that the Special Visual Effects are quite more flawless and astonishing in one of the other nominees Hollow Man. Due to it's acceptance to the big audience it is now a matter of opinion but you can't surely disagree that the effects were eye candy and all the work developed by the computer wise men should have been rewarded by the Academy (see for example the scene were Kevin Bacon disappears, only that ?about- five minutes scene will show all of you how right I am). Regarding to the other Oscars unfortunately Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon stole almost all the awards that should have been given to Gladiator. It seems that critics and now the Academy are completely going nuts by those poor Tiger and Dragon that don't even appear on the movie? But now getting back to the centre of the arena where movies like this one are considered minor when compared to movies that show a cheesy and ordinary love story that should have been water down along with the boat, we have to consider ?ourselves' lucky to have (only) five Oscars when we should have had 11 (Special Effects out ? explained before-) Well, right now when there is lesser space for writing, before I will go back to my resting place, I should (of Course) congratulate all the ones that were responsible of bringing back Roman empire: Ridley Scott's aggressive and reachable vision, Russell Crowe's power which was capable of filling even more the Coliseum, an other powerful artist named Connie Nielsen, who by one single look meaned not what a thousand words could. See it, enjoy it, it might be tragic and get 5 Oscars instead of 11, but at least it is not tragic, ridiculous winning 11 Oscars when it should have been 5?.Strength and Honour 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GLADIATOR (2000) Rating: 9/10Winner of 5 Oscars including Best Picture, Gladiator is an astonishingly engaging epic spectacle with a grand action-drama genre. The action is brilliant; you get everything from gruesome killings to leaping tigers in some visual effects that look truly real, you won't even notice they are computer-generated or CGI. The drama is the heart of the movie however; the back-story is the story of a man, his love for his family, his strong abilities and his will to escape. Russell Crowe plays this man to perfection in one of his most gritty roles to date. There is also a fantastic-supporting cast ? Oliver Reed, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Neilsen and Amistad's Djimon Hounsou ? all give life to interesting roles. Okay, so there are lots of flaws in the editing, Joaquin's scar changing from right to left and an aeroplane crossing the arena, but, this is a movie you watch for enjoyment, not to diss the mistakes that come up, even though they do. Gladiator has excellent cinematography, stunning sets and beautiful costumes ? even if the lavish wardrobe isn't right for the century in which Gladiator is set. The movie has an amazing DVD with great stills, a brilliant making of feature and a 2-disk special. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a cast that includes the late, great Oliver Reed, you know you are in for a treat. Add the direction of Ridley Scott, amazing sets and some of the most seamless CG seen thus far, you only need a decent plot to make a classic movie.Thankfully, the plot is very good (if a little historically inaccurate), and in Russell Crowe, you have a physically believable gladiator.The fall and rise of Crowe's character gathers momentum as the story moves on and along the way we are treated to some stunning visuals, accompanied by one of the most vibrant soundtracks I have ever heard.The fight scenes too look real, I can bet a few bruises were collected along the way. It's a novelty to see such combat in modern movies - no ballet-like stuff here - all blood and guts and hard work.The characters are also so believable - and the dirty, gritty images of pre-firearm combat really do make battles in other movies seem like a bit of a joke.I have no hesitation at all recommending this one - especially on DVD where you get a plethora of extra features and commentery.10 out of 10 for this one - a movie I have watched time and time again, and will continue to do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grim and gritty classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love a good melodrama, and this is a grim and gritty classic, full of vengeful tooth-gnashing and visceral battles. Crowe's performance is moody and believable (his Richard Burton impression is very impressive), and he's backed by some great acting from Phoenix and Nielson. Veterans Richard Harris and Oliver Reed make the whole affair that bit classier, and it's a fine swan song for the latter.So what if the plot is an old chestnut, we haven't seen this kind of film for a while, and it's done very well. Protestations of historical inaccuracies should be ignored ? it's a sad day when we can't enjoy a spirited yarn without being force-fed a history lesson, for no other reason than to keep the pedants happy. Mention should be made of the effective CGI utilised to bring ancient Rome to life, and the impressive (if vaguely familiar) score. Lots of little touches combine to make this superb entertainment, the best film Scott has given us in some time. It's very much a movie that should have been seen at the cinema, but if you missed it there the DVD version is great and reasonably stocked with extras. Pull the chair closer to the TV and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it was a great great idea to finally make a big movie about Rome and the Gladiators's life. In the latest 20 years, I think this is obviously the best epic movie. Director Ridley Scott proved one more time his versatility. One more great movie he made. This movie has great acting, wonderful directing, and the story is simply fabulous. Perhaps we could say much more about this great movie, but the ones who didn't see it yet dont't know what they are really missing. This movie is maybe the best movie of the 90's (well, actually it only came in theatres in 2000), and it's worth viewing. Nobody can detect weak points in this movie, you know why? Because it has no weak points. Ridley Scott and the rest of the crew members made an wonderful job. And, besides, the story is original. Great, great movie. Have a seat and enjoy it, and then have a seat and enjoy it again. Yes, because I really believe you won't see this movie only one time, but several times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie reaches out and offers you many things, as if on a large, golden platter, and I enjoyed all of the fare that I could actually swallow. The visuals were grand and satisfying, almost haunting - particularly the opening battle with the Germanic tribe(s) in the forest (which was stunning), and first historic recreational battle in the Big Ring. The costumes were very good. Oliver Reed stood out as thoroughly enjoyable and believable; and it was nice to have a face that was fresh (to me) in the starring role of a budget monster, instead of, say, Mel Gibson's.But though Crowe was good, I don't think he was better than Geoffrey Rush in Quills, who also had the nomination. Crowe showed depth but no remarkable vulnerability; Rush had both. Joaquin Phoenix put good effort into his role as the naughty Commodus, with just that precisely awful affect that you could see his effort to do so. He engaged in some intense acting that looked like that - intense acting (a bit like Angus MacFadyen as Robert the Bruce in Braveheart, but more obvious). Commodus' emotions looked drummed up from the actor, not flooding up from the natural depravity of the man who brought back the Games.Nevertheless the movie still has a sum greater than its parts (no easy feat in the whirlwind of filmmaking's many disjointed pieces). I've seen it twice and would see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie. Russell Crowe is awesome as Maximus, the Roman General turned slave, who than becomes the Gladiator that defies an empire. It's tastefully violent, there are good action scenes, but the acting was why I liked this movie. Russell Crowe was convincing as a vengeful gladiator who wants revenge from the new emperor Commodus, who kills anyone who stands in his way of being Rome's greatest emperor.Joaquin Phoenix was a good villain as Commodus, and Connie Nielsen was also good as Commodus' terrified sister, Lucilla. There are great special effects, great costumes, great acting, and a great story.This is a good and exciting movie that you can watch for the action or drama. I found it was funner to watch it as an action/drama, which made it all the more enjoyable. This is one of my favorite movies, and I recommend it to anyone who like the above description, because I know I do. Besides, how many other award winning movies can you see a guy get his head cut off with a large sword (not including Braveheart, because that wasn't a sword)! 9/10 </fullReview>

Most of the performances (especially by the star, Russell Crowe) weren't that good as Iexpected, plus the extremely long time length of the film was adowner, and this movie won the best picture of 2000?? The Oscarcommittee was far too generous for GLADIATOR, that's for sure.I thought the only saving graces in the film were the intense action sequences in the battlefields and the arena, plus the costumes and landscapes were fantastic. But sometimes the minor details are indeed minor; they didn't help to buoy GLADIATOR from sinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Moviemaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the best picture of 2000, by far in my opinion. The first time I saw it in the theatre I was awestruck by the film's tremendous suspense, drama and depth of character. One scene in particular, the moment that Maximus has to finally go into the arena to fight, is extremely intense. The sounds of clanging metal echoing under the belly of the arena give you a feeling of the terror and tremendous fear these men had live through. The second time I saw the film confirmed for me that this was one of the finest films I have ever seen. One reviewer wrote it was not quite as good as Spartacus, I disagree. I'm am a big fan of Hollywood Epic movies. I think Spartacus ranks up there as one of the best. Gladiator is a very different picture and just as good. Overall it's a sad film, but a film that has hope. Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are both excellent. They give fresh in-depth performances without giving us cliche Roman era characters. The script is powerful, and the story compelling without ever seeming to sentimental or pious. It's so refreshing to see a character like Maximus with the highest of principals come to life on screen without looking like a cartoon character in a bad script. The sountrack is a perfect compliment to the look and feel of the movie and brings it up to another level. Ridley Scott has given us a magnificent picture that I am sure will be looked upon as a masterpiece for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excessively impressed half a year lately!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its extremly rare that one watches a movie that grabs your attention so much that over half a year later it is what you consider to be the best film you have seen recently. Gladiator certainly has had this effect on me! Where so many other films which, at the time of viewing I considered to be really stand-out have faded in impact over the march of time, Gladiator soldiers on.In all departments Gladiator is one of the undeniable best. Its casting is perfect. Russell Crowe as 'Maximus' is a sight to behold. Having read the screenplay, the concept of his battlefield prowess and presence which is allured to is instantly recognisable on the screen. One see's Maximus as a man of honour, integrity, dignity and courage. By contrast Jouqain Phoneix as 'Commudus' epitomises a classic villain. Yet he rises above this and plays his character with such conviction one starts to believe he really exists. I gauge this by the fact that in seeing films in years to come with Phoenix, I will regard him still as not that character but Commudus. Connie Nielsen is also excellent in her role as 'Lucilla'. Richard Harris and the late Oliver Reed also support skillfully.Cast aside, the two areas that impressed me above all in Gladiator were the score and the visuals. Ridley Scott is truly an awesome director and Hans Zimmer in my opinion beyond even John Williams. The seamless, and I do mean seamless, transitions between CGI and conventional film is a sight to behold. As I watched the film on the big screen, the sight of Rome and the Colleseum was awe-inspiring. It is extraordinarily immersive. Zimmers score with vocals by Lisa Gerrard is close to perfect amd easily his most accomplished yet. It is stirring at the right moments and sensetive when the mood dictates it. EVERYONE SHOULD OWN A COPY OF THE SCORE!!!If one had to pick a weak point, I would have to opt for the script, which although brilliant was probably the least polished of the componets. However what really makes Gladiator stand head and shoulders above the rest is the manner in which it is epic, enthralling and exciting. It's a Hollywood blockbuster that manages to succesfully negotiate all the pitfalls that that conventionally entails. I highly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every now and then, a film comes along with adrenaline-pumped action, first-class acting, delicious cinematography and with warm, old-fashioned storytelling charm. I believe that Gladiator is one of those films. Russell Crowe gives a memorable performance as the heroic Maximus Decimus Meridius, Joaquin Phoenix is sensually evil as the embittered, power-hungry Commodus and the late Oliver Reed gives one of his career-best turns as Maximus' idealistic trainer.The story had enough depth to compliment the action sequences and the score to the film was just sensational. One of Han Zimmer's most accomplished compositions, and one to remember with nostalgic sentiment. Connie Nielsen was also credible as Lucilla, the troubled sister of Commodus, repressed of hope by her brother's dark affections towards her. The sheer magnitude of Rome, the fight sequences in the wilderness and the battles in the amphitheatre elevate this film from the run-of-the-mill Hollywood crowd of films, and witholds a historic value to boost its credibility.I don't think its one of the best films of all time, because some of the subplots are not given the depth I would have liked, and some were given too much. The incestual relationship between Lucilla and Commodus lacked subtlety. The ending though, is very special. I think about Maximus' ideal of heaven and I wonder how close he is to the truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only realistic movie about ancient Rome history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The producers of this movie must know well ancient history, and, in the same time, they know well how to add fantastic elements to transform a simple movie into an awesome one...Surprisingly, this movie shows high class elements in scripting, direction, acting, photography and action scenes.The opening is epic; it represents a battle between Romans and ancient Germans. Never a movie on ancient history has shown a battle scene so well realised; not only it is highly exciting and dramatic but also, there is a historic realism in representation, battle technics, nomenclature. Apart classic elements, like an exciting show of the Roman phalanx in action covered with shields repelling German's arrows, You will see a series of innovative realistic historic features: very good costumes, war dogs, catapults and so long. The battle shown in "Spartacus", although good, was less realistic, and surely was far less enjoying and thrilling.Another important thing is that this movie, unlike all other of its genre, shows the real religion of ancient Romans (substantially, the adoration of ancestors) with realism, respect and seriousness, not like old movies of this type, where this religion was considered only "paganism" and never showed. And then, after this, You have wonderful actors and fantastic plot, perhaps a free variation on the real story of the despotic Commodus (in the reality, Commodus was killed in 192 a.c. by an ambush of a gladiator, Narcissus, hired by his sister and the Senate).It is really the case to say: thumb up!</fullReview>

I watched the movie as a human being in search of a wonderful story and visual experience, not as a wannabe critic as many reviewers here seem to have done. I could find no fault with this movie: it had me choking back tears (in concealment from my girlfriend, of course) during many scenes; the battles where great; many actors/supporting actors gave awesome performances; the music inspired me to search music stores for Lisa Gerrard (what a beautiful voice, she melodically DEFINES the sadness in many tough scenes); etc--for sure! For those of you who write that this movie does not deserve the praise/honors it has received, I could only guess that this is because you're all unaccustomed or uncomfortable with seeing a movie about a hero doing well. Or, some other bias holds you back. In any case, many more people with professional experience in the movie industry voted contrary to your tastes/opinions by placing this spectacular movie among the archives of the greats through their granting of awards. This may sound corny, but, there are some things in life that I'm thankful for having done or experienced or seen before I die: seeing "Gladiator" was one of them. It was otherworldly; I got to escape from some of the dumber beasts of modern-day society for 3 hours and idolize a hero.</fullReview>

I rate it 7. Russell Crowe's character is fighting for an ideal that is never really explained (what - a slightly less oppressive Roman Empire?), and so some of the drama seemed thin to me. Basically, Stanley Kubrick's "Spartacus" (1960) does everything "Gladiator" wants to do, and does it much better (including the fact that Spartacus is fighting for the more noble cause of ending slavery).</fullReview>

Other then that yes it was a good movie it had a ok storyline and for the acting that was good but lacked a few things as did the story line. For one the story was the same throughout the whole movie you knew what was going to happen before it happened. Fight after Fight. Sorry he wouldn't have lasted but maybe 3 fights not as many as he did. So people say it's a movie it dosn't have to be accurate. Well I think it should be somewhat accurate. other then that it did hold my attention and the music was totally good. Richard harris did a good job. It's a good movie and it's worth watching but it really didn't earn best picture in my opinion. That would go to crouching Tiger hidden Dragan. (own both on DVD) I'd Give it a 8/10</fullReview>

But disregarding that, it is a fine film, and one of those cases where you can't let all the hype fool you into thinking it's over-hyped. Great direction, cinematograpy, score, etc, etc. A friend of mine (also a teen) bashed it for its "MTV-style direction ," perhaps referring to the frantic pacing in the battle scenes and the surreal dream sequences. I didn't see those as flaws. I think that if there's one that that this film has more than anything, it's feeling. Pain, anger, sitting through the whole film wanting to see Commodus dead. And that final scene - I can't find the word to describe it, but it simply left me awestruck. Or something like that. I once thought that if this film had any flaws, it would be its title, which seemed simplistic and stupidly obvious, sort of like "Titanic." But I eventually realized that this film isn't just a film about a gladiator in Ancient Rome, and I think some people have yet to see that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To give Gladiator its due, the music is good and aspects of the filming are also much above average. Unfortunately, there is little to either the story line or the acting to understand the ridiculous comments regarding the quality of this movie. The antagonist is reminiscent of Caligula with over-acting and a twisted personality that defies understanding where his political strength came from. The protagonist is wooden and compares poorly to all the prior "heroes" of this genre. Russell Crowe manages to make Victor Mature look good which is quite an accomplishment.When you start a movie by having the aging caesar far removed from the political center of Rome decide that he will confront his perverted son and announce that the son is getting the shaft and the general is getting the glory, credibility drops like a stone. No one but Maximus, the son and the daughter know of the plans for succession. Oh, surprise! son kills father. Son kills Maximus' family. Maximus spends the movies going through slavery, remote gladiator contests, Rome and final confrontation. If there was one clever plot element along the way, I missed it. Gladiator=glad it was over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's best film in years is this astonishing epic of Roman proportions about a great general (Russell Crowe) who is demoted to gladiator slave when the kindhearted emperor (Richard Harris) dies and his selfish and callous son (Joaquin Phoenix) takes over. The plot moves smoothly over its vast size without stopping for a second, climaxing in excellent fight scenes that combine state of the art sound effects with Scott's unbeatable visual flair. Crowe gives a star making performance as the lead, and Connie Nielsen stands out in a pretty ineffective role as the princess who must watch her brother destroy everything her beloved father worked so hard for. One of the most exciting films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure most people who like this movie, do it because of its strong orientation on one's feelings. It's quite the same thing as Titanic (although I didn't like Titanic), that simply attracts so many people who actually might have very different taste.Furthermore, it has something for everyone: action, intrigue, love (not merely between a man and a woman) and even history (only visual, though) - fantastic battles, costumes, and decorations. As these kind of movies are often considered to be just bare money-machines by a lot of critics, Gladiator goes far beyond that level. There are very few categories about the film that I wouldn't like to rate as perfect. The way Scott has managed to create an atmosphere of the time of Roman Empire, the pain you can see in Crowe's eyes almost all throughout the movie as the betrayed general Maximus, incredibly powerful soundtrack composed by H. Zimmer - these are the first thoughts that come in mind.Personally, I always get carried away by the anger and oppression that I feel together with Maximus. So even if there were more scenes that wouldn't remind me of his pain, it wouldn't really matter because the tension simply is already high enough, until the end. And the end is much more than a classic "happy end" would be, it is beautiful! So is the film itself, too.I simply had to give it 10/10, because of the effect it has to me everytime I watch it. Otherwise I wouldn't be fair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a year today since I first saw "Gladiator" at the movies and it's beyond me why it took me so long to write a review for it but here it is now. Russell Crowe plays the title role (Maximus) to perfection and makes it impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. Winning an Oscar as Best Actor (it was really a consolation prize for his loss last year for "The Insider") made me VERY happy and he was very humble and dignified while making his acceptance speech at the Oscars in March. Joaquin Phoenix made an incredible breakthrough as the villain Commodus and should have won the supporting actor Oscar for his performance, while Miss Connie Nielsen is convincing as Lucilla, Commodus' sister and Maximus' love interest (but only as a lukewarm love interest since he has eyes really for his late wife). The sets which also should have won (they lost to "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", but the brilliant costumes won so there is some consolation in that) and the score as well. The Academy is just getting more and more benevolent in regards to splitting the awards evenly between several different movies. But "Gladiator" by far is the winner of the year. Viva la Crowe!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie? Yes! Best picture? Hmmmm...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Gladiator last May and really enjoyed it. I have never seen a movie of this scope and dealing with this subject, so I thought that it was original for today's types of movies. I am a big fan of Russell Crowe and thought that he did a great job in the title role of Maximus. He is a very strong character who follows his own path and ideas, but shows a tender side in his desire to be with his family. The majority of the cast was great, especially Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. He has a very strong talent and will be sure to make an impact in movies in the future. However, I thought that Connie Neilsen's Lucilla was a bit weak and while she did display some independence in her actions and thoughts, she still held true to the standards of typical women's roles. While I did think that the movie was great, it was hardly the best picture of 2000... but I'm not sure what would be instead. It was a fairly weak year for the movies in comparison with recent years, especially 1999. It was nice to see Russell Crowe win the Oscar for best actor, but he should have received it LAST year for his stirring portrayal of Jeffrey Wigand instead of Maximus. His performance in Gladiator was excellent, but somehow it did not measure up to his former role. I still believe that Tom Hanks was robbed for not getting an Oscar instead!7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Gladiator' is a splendid, action-packed throwback to sandal epics such as `Spartacus'. Russell Crowe is Maximus, a general in the Roman army. After crushing an army of Gauls, Maximus meets with the Emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that he wishes Rome to become a Republic once more, after his death . . . and that he would like Maximus to help create this new Republic. Afterwards, Aurelius goes to see his spoiled son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), and tells him that he does not feel Rome should have another Emperor. In a fit of rage, Commodus kills Aurelius and becomes emperor, and then promptly orders the execution of Maximus. Maximus manages to escape his own death . . . . but his wife and son, alas, do not. Fast forward a few years (exactly how the following transpires is never clear), and Maximus is a slave, a gladiator forced to kill in order to entertain the Roman people. As his popularity as a gladiator grows, Maximus begins to see how he can exact his vengeance upon Commodus.For the most part, `Gladiator' is well-acted. Russell Crowe is quietly intense as the former general Maximus, and manages to effortlessly pull off a memorable performance in what could've been a wooden role in other hands. Richard Harris is good as the wise and weary Marcus Aurelius, and the late Oliver Reed is excellent in his final role as Proximo, the cunning gladiator trainer. The weak link of the cast is Joaquin Phoenix, who I still can't believe was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his stiff, awkward portrayal of Commodus. I found him annoying instead of terrifying ? Commodus needed to be a fearful tyrant, and instead he was little more a petulant child. This might have been more how the role was written instead of Joachim Phoenix's acting skill, but the character of Commodus still brought the movie down. Ridley Scott's direction is superb ? the battle scenes and the gladiator fights are wonderfully done, and the movie has a grand, epic feel that's been missing from the big screen for far too long. The use of CGI to recreate Rome is incredible as well. Where the film falls apart to a certain extent is the story ? there are a few plot holes that are just big enough to be distracting. For example, the audience watching `Gladiator' in the theater or at home on their DVD player are given plenty of reasons to hate the vile Commodus . . . but it's never made clear why the Roman people would hate him. The Emperor puts on lots of gladiator tournaments, gives out free bread, free wine ? hey, the average Roman should love Commodus! So why isn't he? Little points like this drag `Gladiator' down slightly ? and while these detractions certainly don't make `Gladiator' a bad film, I think they're enough to pull it down off the masterpiece mantel. Personally, while I really liked `Gladiator', I think even nominating it for Best Picture of 2000 was a stretch, and as for actually winning the Best Picture Oscar . . . no. It's good, but not that good.Still, an intense epic worth watching. A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Symbolism in Gladiator (warning: potential spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Gladiator, directed by Ridley Scott, contains many elements of symbolic nature. This becomes evident in the story very quickly. Although most Ridley Scott films seem completely pointless, this film is surprisingly deep. The first obvious symbol that is shown in this movie is the wheat field that Maximus is walking through several times throughout the movie. This field symbolizes his view of paradise. We know that this is the ideal place that he wants to be, because there is a scene where he describes his home, and the way he describes it shows plainly that he prefers that place over any other. Another symbol in the movie is Maximus' habit of rubbing his hands in the soil before battle. This symbolizes his ability to know his enemy; also to know the battlefield. A third symbol in Gladiator is the child and mother dolls, which are physical representations of Maximus' family in the afterlife. These dolls are used very effectively in the denouement of the story, where Juba buries the dolls in the center of the Coliseum. This represents the closure that Maximus has attained through his death. Fourthly, we see another symbol in the wooden sword of the character Proximo. This sword represents not only the freedom of Proximo, but also foreshadows the freedom that Maximus is to attain. Unfortunately, Maximus dies just as he achieves his freedom, which is a slightly ironic but very necessary plot twist. Gladiator is a multi-faceted film that contains all the elements of a true epic, and is quite a masterpiece. Symbolism is well used in this movie, and the instances where it is used, both obvious and not so obvious, show evidence of much creative thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done, Russell Crowe!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film seems to be symptomatic: an empire turns out a film about an empire. So what do the audiences get? On the one hand, the scriptwriter will obviously not set the Thames on fire. The plot is very predictable, the action (especially in the first part of the film) dragged out, dialogue anaemic. There is a "politically correct" Juba and the optimistic end. Good guys go home, the evil emperor is punished, Commodus's sister makes another stilted speech. The drawbacks are numerous: first, I doubt that Marcus Aurelius looked so old (he died when he was 59), second, the child Lucius looks like a typical American kid with strange outfit on, Commodus was killed after he had reigned in Rome for 12 years. So what keeps this film from being a tedious pseudo-Roman stuff? First of all, Russell Crowe. He managed to convey that sense of inborn dignity which can't be taken from a real Man. He did a very good job of his character bordering on magic (taking the poor stuff he had to work with into consideration). Second, it's the sound-track. And third, it's the work of the cameramen. The magnificent landscapes, the huge moon, the glimpses of the other world, the silver cypresses moving in the wind. I believe the film is hardly a new word in cinema, BUT it's a story of a Man, a human being at last, not a story of mundane violence. I think people are getting pretty tired of drugs and addicts, cops and mobsters, tearful soap operas. It's a "fairy tale" of course, too, but not a bad one. I'd like to mention that an imdb-user Aleona said it was implausible that a Roman emperor had fought a gladiator. An encyclopedia says about Commodus that he took part in gladiator fights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, sure. Great? No, uh-uh. Overall a 6.75 out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should preface this review by stating that I'm something of an expert in the area of weapons and armament. Most folks aren't going to notice or care about the many things I found wrong with the film, but the HUGE number of historical inaccuracies were distracting to me. For the sake of the readers, I won't go into a lot of detail and will only point out two examples. In one of the scenes Crowe and his fellow gladiators approach a table filled with helmets. Each gladiator picks a helm and moves on. Two helmets were 9th-10th century Norse and two(?) helmets were most likely 12th century Turkish. If someone is going to drop a ton of dough making an "epic" (such as Gladiator is alleged to be), wouldn't you think they'd spend a couple of bucks on a military or historical advisor with, perhaps a high school knowledge of history? In this great "film" a senator states Rome was originally founded as a Republic. Yes, and I'm the Easter Bunny. The storyline itself wasn't terribly objectionable, as long as you don't expect a lesson in history. What I did find redeemable about this film is what many left-wing reviewers found the most upsetting and that is the objective portayal of a man who was patriotic and loyal to the idea of a concept and entity larger than himself. Whether some pseudo intellectual bed-wetting types want to accept it or not, Roman military types were often motivated by feelings of nationalism. Fascistic, maybe, but that is the way many thought. The makers of the film obviously never intended to propogandize, they merely showed things the way they were. It's amusing how the far left and the far right are outraged at the truth when it doesn't fit their preconceived notions of reality. If you merely want a film to entertain and don't give a hoot about history, go for it! The combat scenes are fun and there's enough of a sentimental subplot to make this an enjoyable flick for romantic types of either sex. The acting wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. Oscar material, I think not. Entertainment, you bet!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take that, Ben Hur.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's been a lot of hubbub since the Oscars because Gladiator beat out super-favorite Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Now, I hadn't seen any of them, so I decided to go and rent Gladiator (no one wants to go see CTHD with me because it's in Mandarin). Gladiator is a throwback to the days of Ben-Hur and Spartacus. Russell Crowe plays Maximus, a general in the Roman army. In a battle in Germany, Maximus wins and heads back to report to Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). There, the old and withered Aurelius tells Maximus that he will take his place once he dies. Maximus is reluctant, however. Aurelius goes to see his son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) but feels like Commodus will betray him. Oh, and he does. Commodus kills Aurelius and becomes emperor (I think) because Maximus didn't approve. Commodus sentences Maximus to be killed. Maximus, however, doesn't feel this way and escapes back to his son and wife. When he arrives there, they have been killed by Commodus's army. Plagued with grief, Maximus falls to the ground. Later, he is picked up by slavers and consequently bought by Proximo (Oliver Reed). Proximo supplies gladiators for the fights. Maximus becomes a gladiator. And what a gladiator.Gladiator is very well acted by the whole cast. Crowe is intense in a role that could very well have been a stereotypical action role with no feelings, but it's not. Crowe deserved that Oscar. Joaquin Phoenix is also very intense and is at his best in the scene where Commodus is with his father for the last time. If the category for best supporting actor hadn't been so crowded with great roles, Phoenix could've won. Richard Harris isn't on screen for very long but does a solid job. Oliver Reed as the gladiator trainer Proximo is absolutely superb with his oozing machisimo and pride. This was the great actor's last role as he died during production. Connie Neilsen as Commodus' sister (I forget her name) is good but not perfect. One last note: the big guy in the wig that announces the gladiators is David Hemmings, the guy who played the skinny photgrapher in the 1966 classic Blow-Up.Gladiator is considered an action movie. That is not completely untrue, but it stretches the truth. There are some intense, gory battle sequences, true. There is a hero that couldn't possibly do everything he does, true. There is some language that definitely doesn't have a place in those times, true. But this is only for a part of the movie. The rest is filled with poignant scenes such as when Maximus returns to his home and sees everyone dead. The sets and costumes are very nice and the camera work exemplary except for one thing. In some combat scenes (especially the first one), the camera often switches to pointless shots of knees, legs, elbows, backs of heads, etc. with once in a while blood coming out of them. I understand that it creates atmosphere, but dammit it's annoying. As I mentioned, the very first battle is confusing, dark, muddy and generally pointless because you can't see much.This brings us to the final question: Is Gladiator better than Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon? I don't know. Did Gladiator deserve a Best Picture award? Definitely. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The gladiator shown in this movie is a man of flesh, blood and brains, not only integer, will-powered and physically dominant, but also intelligent and sensitive. A real difference from previous movies on similar themes. Further on the whole film is breathtaking by acting achievements, special effects and sound-track. Very lucky I saw it, because mostly I am not so interested in big show-pieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Academy bows to what Hollywood is ridiculed for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, Gladiator is NOT an epic!!!! I know there are sites that claim that historically it is true, but let's be honest...no emperor will ever fight a Gladiator. EVER!!! No matter who the Gladiator really is, just imagine Spartacus fighting the emperor. Umm...no!Second of all --- there is no way Gladiator deserved the Oscar for movie of the year...Sure it deserved to get all the technical decorations and computer animation and whatever else they did to make the Coliseum and all the special effects, but BEST MOVIE?? Is the Academy on crack?Third of all -- there was no strong acting...NONE!! There were some touching scenes and some beautiful scenes of nature and blood for that matter (if you find that thrilling), but not one actor did a wonderful job acting...They were all predictable. Of course the girl loved the hero and the father didn't love the son, etc., etc. A cliche on top of cliche is all this movie is made of and then it gets an Oscar. Well at least next year the Oscars will be better because they couldn't possibly screw up more this year.And lastly, when I leave a movie theater, I would like to have something to think about because of a movie I just saw. Some sort of a greater, bigger picture. Here we had a point that being dishonest and weak fires back! That's an original! And it certainly take three hours to deliver that point to the audience. I am not even arguing for good movies to be recognized because given what I think is good may not be the standard for everyone else, but let us not recognize something that is unworthy of it. I was also disappointed in Russel Crowe because I did not expect him to go from LA Confidential and The Insider to crap like Gladiator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think there's a great difference between a FILM and a common show: Gladiator was made to be a show machine, with special effects that doesn't reproduce realisticly the ancient Rome. It may be not very important, if Rome wouldn't seem a little America, with its peculiarities and its typical characters... Screenplay is well thought, and goes on, but it remains a simple "epic movie", with its exaggerations and its stereotypes. (sorry, but my english is not very good...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A long, long time ago, a movie about gladiators was released. It had sensational acting and a marvelous story-line. It kept viewers interested for the whole length. Recently, a new movie with the same plot was released set to stun audiences. Unfortunately it didn't stun a lot of viewers. The budget was astronomical, but the quality was poor. Russell Crowe tries very hard to put on a good show, but does he? NO!! He can't act. It is true that he got his Oscar, but many are still puzzled for what did he get it? The effects and choreography is trully stunning, but nothing else shines. The movie is polishes around the edges but is rough inside. MAYBE WORTH A LOOK!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To all the people who bash this film and or the performances..You obviously have no idea what your talking about. Russell Crowe(though he fared much better in L.A Confidential) was nothing short of brilliant. The directing was top notch by one of Hollywood's A-list directors. I do believe there was a flaw in the computer graphic's. The coliseum did not look real at all. My only complaint.Just because a film is "Hollywood" and has a big budget does not make it a bad film. Hollywood has produced the greatest films ever made. Yes, Hollywood does favor historical epics but I think you have unfairly judged this film.If you pretentious people want to sit around drinking zima, watching masterpiece theater or the latest Peter Greenway film, pretending not to be bored go ahead. I'll take Gladiator any day.Strength And Honor... **** out of **** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Welcome to Braveheart, the Prequel! The similarities to Braveheart are*uncanny*! In fact, the only real differences between this and Braveheart (aside from the time period) are that Braveheart has a better script, more clever dialogue, better acting, far less horribly cheezy melodrama, and *much* less spit and polish. In fact, Gladiator is *so* polished that most of it looks *beyond* fake! The tigers were so obviously CGI'd that you could see the superimposition most of the time. And the squibs were obvious as well.And the melodrama!! Don't get me started on the melodrama!!! Braveheart should've cut the last 10 minutes you say? Gladiator should have cut the last half hour! Horribly cheezy death scenes followed by some of the worst schlock I've *ever* seen. His buddy burying his little figures as he meets his dead wife and child in the recurring wheat field dream-zone. I feel *something* rising inside of me, but believe me it's not tears...Phoenix was awful and unconvincing (he should watch a few of his late brother's films to learn a couple of things about acting...) and Russell Crowe is so far behind his role in LA Confidential that he's barely worth mentioning...which is frightening, because save for the always fabulous Oliver Reed's too small role, Crowe was actually a standout.Ridley, Ridley, Ridley, what are we to do with you?? First White Squall, now this??? Come one now! And get over the lightning already!! And the pacing!!! OUCH!! It's slow, it's fast, it's slow, it's fast, it's an action film, it's a melodrama, it's an action film...Make up your bleeding mind!! Pacing was horrid! And most of those slow-paced scenes dragged on *way* too long...Admittedly, *some* of the cinematography and sets were amazing (as is usual for Ridley Scott) but most was much less than I'd expect from one of the greatest scenic directors in modern cinematic history. Even aside from all of the hype, this film needed to chop off at least 30-40 minutes, ease up on the too-special special effects and get itself a decent cast. Oscar my butt! My advice? Save yourself two and a half hours and go see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon instead...or Braveheart...each has everything this doesn't. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator is an entertaining but slightly flawed film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is my opinion that Gladiator is one of the very few good movies of the year 2000. David H. Franzoni's screenplay is satisfactory. It doesn't introduce any new ideas or concepts to the genre but it is still entertaining. The cast does a nice job of giving life to their roles. Russell Crowe does a good job at putting the human back in the hero in his role as Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is pretty good as the disturbed villain, Commodus. Some of Joaquin's more emotional scenes are a little over the top and hammy, though. Oliver Reed is wonderful at bringing a hardness and edge to the character of Proximo. Hans Zimmer's score is terrific; at times it is powerful and energetic and at other time it is very sorrowful and mournful. The set and costume designs in Gladiator are very good; they bring out the splendor and glory that was Rome. The computer effects are okay but sometimes it is evident that the images seen on the screen were generated from a computer. Ridley Scott's direction is nothing to write home about but it is good nonetheless; the film carries that Ridley Scott flare. Pietro Scalia's editing, and Scott's direction bring the grisly battle scenes to life. Scalia utilizes quick cuts for the battle scenes, which prove to be very effective. His editing does falter however; some scenes tend to drag on too long. John Mathieson's cinematography is one of the films lower points. The camera movement is occasionally too bumpy and some of the images appear to be too murky and dirty. Overall, Gladiator is a good film; one of the few enjoyable films of 2000.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed Gladiator both as history and as a movie. The real Commodus was murdered in the Arena by a gladiator. Commodus liked to impress the populace by fighting in the Arena but the last time the plotters got to his opponent. Earlier on, his sister had plotted with Senators against him, although he won. As for the detail in the movie, I liked the attention to detail even in military uniforms. As for Russ, he was wonderful, as brooding as anyone who had seen their family murdered. As for the Emperor, the real Commodus was a nasty piece of work. Of course many of the real Emperors were psychotic - Nero, Caligula, etc.The sound track is wonderful, I really enjoyed Hans Zimmer's soundtrack documentary on the DVD version of Gladiator. To hear his intentions with the music and then re-visit the film has added to my appreciation.As for comparisons with "Crouching Tiger" or the self-styled cinema experts - we differ in our opinions. "The Heart of Rome is not the floor of the Senate but the sand of the Colosseum" (one of many realistic and memorable lines).I think the Academy did well in recognising both the movie and Russell's work. I regret Ridley Scott missed out as best Director, it was not an easy shoot but he gave us a wonderful cinema experience. Thank you, Ridley. As a Roman history buff, I look forward to playing my DVD of Gladiator again and again. A wonderful re-telling of the classic story of a person battling for family and personal integrity/honour against the all the odds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Picture???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is by no means a bad movie, but it doesn't hold a candle to "Traffic" or "Crouching Tiger".It seems that Hollywood wanted to celebrate the rebirth of a classic genre, the Roman epic, but it's a shame that such an unspectacular film has received so many accolades. In particular, I was highly disappointed with the cinematography. Why, oh why, do all modern directors (other than Ang Lee) think that every action scene must feature a shaking camera and intermittently altered film speed, both of which interfere with the viewer's ability to actually SEE what's going on? The battle scenes, while impressively staged, were not filmed nearly as well as "Braveheart", the swordplay looks quite tame compared to "Crouching Tiger", and you can find more impressive Colosseum action in "Spartacus" and "Ben Hur". The plot and dialogue were hack writing at best and revisionist history at worst, with clearly American sentiments filling in for anything recognizably Roman. There is actually a lot to like about this movie. The sets are dazzling, the acting is quite good, and the drama is often quite real... although it isn't sustained throughout. Russell Crowe gives a strong performance and commands a tremendous screen presence, although he displays less range than in his earlier work. Joaquin Phoenix manages (barely) to avoid falling into the realm of camp, although he is dealt quite a few inane lines. In fact, all the main actors deserve tremendous kudos for salvaging what could have been a bomb in less capable hands. It's worth noting that "Gladiator" received Oscars for acting and costumes, not for directing, cinematography, or screenplay.But Best Picture? Are you kidding me? This isn't even Ridley Scott's best picture. I demand a recount.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is so much people complaining about "Gladiator" winning Best Picture and Russell Crowe winning Best Actor? I just don't get it. It is obvious to me that Academy members did like "Gladiator" much more than the other 4 films nominated for Best Picture. And when they voted Crowe as Best Actor, they were stating that he ALONE carried the film. His acting is SUPERB. I'm pretty sure that those who question Crowe's talent are not familiar with his career. Try watching "Romper Stomper" and "The Sum of Us" back to back to see what I mean. "Gladiator" is an excellent film. It was the year's best indeed. It's closer to Shakespeare than it is to "Ben-Hur" and other Hollywood epics of the past. It's going to be an influential film too...just wait and see. "Gladiator" is not "Titanic" nor "Braveheart". It's a MUCH better film. Its heart lies in its hero, not in its F/X or action sequences. Maximus! Maximus!</fullReview>

The same can be said about Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed, the best actors of that film, but working with an auto-pilot) and a very weak soundtrack could win all those Oscars or even nominated for them? Furthermore, a film that isn't able to win the oscars for the script, the editing, cinematography, actors (besides Crowe, i've already told my opinion about that), director, music and soundtrack (these are really the oscars that award a film and make it good or bad) awarded with best film of the year?i think that everyone who knows anything about films understands my position. I don't consider Gladiator as one of the best films for 2000 (a rather weak year for films, by the way), i consider it as one of the greatest disappointments of the year.

		<fullReview>Warning: some spoilers ahead!My personal impression of this film is that it is a good film, but I wouldn't have given it so many oscars as it got(my choice there would have been the Ang Lee film instead). Let me explain. The movie is set in a very realistic roman environment and its clear that the makers of this movies intention was to make it feel as a genuine part of roman history. I don't think the movie quite succeeds on this point. If you look below the surface the typical American stereotypes are even so present. Like for example when Maximus says "Bring em hell on my command". Its really ludicrous that such a line is in this move. Its just like something that Sylverster Stalone, Bruce Willis or some other American macho-hero would say. Lines like that fit in their particular genre but here its really silly and I am not even sure that the concept of "hell" was invented at the time the story takes place.Its really hard to pin down the exact details where the sterotypes shine through but they are present. Instead of being pictured as a person with many sides the emperor is pictured as an althrough evil person. Just like the standard "badguy" in any standard hollywood action movie. When the emperor cheats by stabbing Maximus with a dagger we are supposed to get the impression that the people view this as a very injust thing to do. I'm not so very sure that the morale of that time really worked that way. Why would the people care about a gladiator? And why would an emperor fight a duel with a slave? That seems just like something an American macho-emperor would do, nothing for a civilized roman if you see my point. Anyway too much of the American culture shows through in this movie in subtile ways. This makes the movie less interesting than it could have been. I guess the American audience will never notice this and maybe thats why it got so many oscars. To me it was entertaining to see once but nothing more than the fantastic scenography and some music in it is worth remembering. All in all it adds up to grade 7 in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly enjoyed Gladiator, Russell Crowe gave a good performance and the brutal fight scenes made for an action packed couple of hours. But I didn't see too much depth in the film, Maximus = good Commodus = bad seemed to pretty much sum up the story while barely touching on the complex Roman political system or having any kind of character development.When compared with a film like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with its protagonists changing throughout the film ( Li Mu Bai realizing his wasted chance for love and Jen searching for her own destiny). Not to mention the complex relationship between all the characters, I find it difficult to justify gladiator being nominated for a academy award let alone winning over crouching tiger!I have seen gladiator a few times and so far its proving not to be a rewatchable film, even the beautiful CGI renderings of Rome don't seem so great after the second time. But in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon there are so many levels and details, each time I watch I find something new.Gladiator serves its function well as a action movie but not as Oscar winning material (In my mind).</fullReview>

No. I thought it was entertaining in much the same way, say "The Great Escape" or "Fist of Legend" was; it's escapism at it's best, but it's not Oscar Gold. But then again, 2000 was a very dry year for movies...Russell Crowe was excellent. So was Oliver Reed. It was sad to note that his performance went largely unnoticed in most reviews in favor of Joaquin Phoenix's (who was good, but still...).

		<shortDescription>Epic tale of power struggle in Rome set c.180 AD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene of gladiator is a telling moment in the movie. General Maximus is thinking of being home on his farm with his family. This thought is captured in the picture of Maximus running his hand through ears of wheat while standing in a field planted with that crop. The scene cuts to Maximus in a forest in Germania on the eve of a battle, for a moment he sees and contemplates a robin as if with a friend, this is man of interesting qualities. What follows is a bloody battle sequence in which Maximus kills and maims and is nearly killed in turn. Life for Maximus is brutal, cruel and dark and yet we have seen he is not. Who is this character?Enter the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, Richard Harris on a good days work, to congratulate Maximus. Cometh also the emperors son, Commodus and daughter, Drusilla, effectively the royal family, and a retinue of Roman politicians. How does Maximus deal with the political intrigues of a great empire, he fights wars is the answer so he doesn't need to. But now he is placed in a position where he must take sides. He becomes a victim of intrigue and ends up a slave, a gladiator living with the possibility of death, daily.Gladiator is the story of the intrigues of Rome, of Maximus' fight for revenge and how one man can defy an empire. Spectacular in its settings, with the city of Rome and it's Colliseum recreated with computer graphics as a backdrop, Gladiator is big screen cinema. The stunning images of director Ridley Scott capture a gritty and harsh time while displaying the beautiful light and colours this director is renowned for. Incorporating bloody battle scenes set to the equally impressive musical score done by the experienced Hans Zimmer and enchanting music of Lisa Gerrard, this movie is the work of a good team who know how to show the talents of their craft.Coming in at just on two and a half hours in length, Gladiator is the tale of slave versus master, of a spirited man versus a man twisted by power into a hateful tyrant, of worthy leadership against fearful controlling ambition. It is a film of great drama, with spectacular set piece battle scenes interspersed with intelligent dialogue and interesting and plausible characters. It is not necessary to undergo a crash course in Roman history to appreciate the story, which is heavily dramatised and largely fictitious, though the impact of the civilisation of the time needs to be appreciated if the movie is to suitably interest you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not certain whether it is easier to play a hero with charisma and depth, or it is easier to play a mad man.It seems in the past few years only those who portrayed characters with either drinking problems or mental illnesses could win. The things we are most unfamiliar with are the things that intrigue us the most, right? However, it's about time that we honor an actor who plays a hero with tremendous success for a change. Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar (not to mention he deserved one last year as well). His Maximus was the best thing I saw in 2000. After Gladiator, I could not watch any other movies with satisfaction for a long time because I thought either the movies were bad or in most cases, the actings paled in comparison to that of Russell Crowe.If people think Russell Crowe did not deserve this Oscar for portraying a relatively normal and simple character, we can always go back to our traditions next year to award people who play either alcoholics, or mad men. Maybe we will see another best actor award for Russell Crowe, since this time he is actually going to play a mad man in A Beautiful Mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Actor? Best Picture?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In viewing Russell Crowe's performance in Gladiator, I'm reminded of Dorothy Parker's assessment of Kathryn Hepburn -- "she showed the entire range of emotions from A to B." Oddly, though, Crowe's flat, unemotional performance fits perfectly in this supposedly epic movie. Feature after feature fails to convince. The mock-up of the Coliseum looks like a toy model, Joaquin Phoenix as about the least compelling Roman emperor on film, the fight scenes are muddled, the historical basis for the movie almost laughable, and the emotional entor of the movie flat, flat, flat.Not a bad movie, but certainly not a great one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A message for Russell Crowe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's career is strange. He made the great Duelists and the Alien in the 1970's. Blade Runner and Legend were mixed bags. Black Rain was good and Thelma and Louise was great. Then he immediately made the boring 1492.This year he made a comeback with the Gladiator, which was good, and Hannibal which was awful. The casting of Russell Crowe, the battle scenes, the supporting cast including the late Oliver Reed, were great. I couldn't picture Pheonix as a Roman and I have preferred to see Jude Law. A lot of people don't realize this is essentially a remake of the old 1964 film the Fall of the Roman Empire which flopped and ended the era of big spectacular epics which had started in 1949 with Samson and Delila.Overall I would give this film 3 and 1/2 stars and I would classify it as a decent effort. But it definitely was not the best film of 2000.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but really.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the Academy Awards, I have to temper my displeasure a bit. This was not a bad movie at all. It is quite good compared to, say, Demetrius and the Gladiators. But this has to be the most overrated movie to win Best Picture since Forrest Gump. Even more overrated than Titanic. Take one part Spartacus, one third Braveheart, and one third Caligula and blend. The female character is pure window dressing, the effects are poor but thankfully used sparingly.The period armour and weapons are all wrong. The tacked-on "going home" racial liberation bit at the end is pure hokum. In it's defense, the film does have two very fine performances (rewarded) and some terrific action sequences.Still, I am sad that we could not have seen the award go to one of the more challenging and visionary films, Crouching Tiger or Traffic. Sometimes popcorn is just popcorn, even with heavy butter. ** 1/2 stars, seven out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>you people are never satisfied!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was reading the comments, and some things become apparent. When Russell Crowe does show his outrageous upper body, people whine about him being some kind of male pig. But when he doesn't, you whine! Same thing with the realistic traits. When there are historical inaccuracies, FOR SHAME!!!! Well, make some note of these points:1. MOVIES ARE NOT DOCUMENTARIES. When will people learn that entertainment is seldom reality and reality seldom entertaining. For example, there's the part where thumbs up meant death and closed thumbs meant life. In reality, that would be the case. However, put that in a movie and it would just serve to confuse modern day audiences. "Should Maximus live or die?!?!?! ohhhhhh ohhhhhhhh Commidus chooses...was that sign language he just used???" Number two example: Maximus goes riding into battle with German Sheperds instead of Mastiffs(which was the real dogs they would have used). If you would have put Mastiffs into the picture, it would have been like lending Auggie Dog to a noble moment. A Mastiff is a big droopy mutt. German shepards added to the scene better than the other. So not all realistic things would have worked in an artistic sense. They would have only confused, bored the audience, or conflicted with themes.2. IT WAS A RITUAL FORMULA, WHICH WOMEN JUST EAT UP!!! Lets face it, he's fighting for love, and for his country. So unselfish. Women just swoon for those kind of heroes. Remember Braveheart? Same thing, and also historically inaccurate. But both films were successful. Gladiator takes a traditional theme and makes it fly high. I was impressed.3. Roger Ebert just doesn't understand- He whines that alot of the setting was dark. Well it was! Duh! Where's the electricity in this scene Roger?!?! This story is second century A.D. Of course it was dark. He also complains about Gladiator being muddy. Well, let me explain why the movie was so muddy. Mud goes great with gladiators. Mud goes great with blood. There was a lot of that in the film, right Roger? As dark as it may seem, it is a film with dualistic properties. It focuses on death as a latent theme, but what shines through is more about life and living. That everyone will die someday, but it is best to live to the fullest until that time comes.</fullReview>

Four extremely talented actors with outstanding performances lost to a TV movie of the week performance. How does that happen? He wasn't even cast well. How can you make a Gladiator movie without the beefcake! Russell Crow never exposes "the gladiator's" outrageous upper body. He's always covered up. Perhaps we should thank him for that. Don't get me wrong...it's an entertaining view...just got way too much credit.</fullReview>

It has several great performance, none the least of which belong to Russel Crowe, who accurately portrayed a simple, but honourable soldier, the way they must have been in the ancient days. Fighting scenes are terrific. I particularly enjoyed Oliver Reed's rendition of Proximo, he's simply fabulous. This movie has an aura of a classic around it. And this comes about not only because of its topic, but also through a certain old-fashioned way in which this movie was crafted. I like old-fashioned, as well as new and unusual, and this movie reminded me a little bit of Kubrik's Spartacus. Ten out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although much of the plot was lifted from 1966's THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, enough of a new twist was put into the script to make this film refreshing. Crowe's Oscar was well-deserved, as he gives a magnificent performance as the general who craves vengenance against the emperor of the mightiest nation on the face of the planet. Phoenix does a wonderful turn as the emperor, &amp; is frightening, to say the least. Oliver Reed, who died during the filming, gives one final, great performance.This is a return to the epics that were almost commonplace during the 1950s &amp; early 1960s, but seem to be a novelty in today's day &amp; age. Hopefully, its success will start a trend towards more of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I'll give you that the movie was visually spectacular. Yeah, great visuals, great CGI. I'll even give you that Crowe and Phoenix acted well in the movie. I didn't think it was anything special, but fine, I'll give you that. But what the hell was the movie about? Basically, the tagline "he kills and kills until he kills no more" applies to this movie. But it had no meaning. So what if his family was killed. Did anyone feel the pain outside of those stupid dream clips which is basically Ridley Scott's futile attempt to make you think about it? These characters were two dimensional. Maximus was the low-key uber-fighter. Phoenix's character was the ultimate evil. There was absolutely no story outside of who is Maximus going to fight next. Pro-wrestling offers more of a storyline.Hey, this was a good action flick, I'd even say a great action flick. But that's all it was. This movie, IN NO WAY WHATSOEVER (IMO), separated itself from any other action flick outside of the level of visual detail and perhaps superior acting. What bothers me is that this movie will probably beat out much better movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Traffic, and Wonderboys for best movie of 2000, according to the "experts" at the Oscars. History will look back on this as a mistake. Good movie, yes. Oscar winner? No, not even Oscar nominee. 7/10.</fullReview>

And the Special FX are incredible. It feels like you are actualy in the arena! In addition to the special FX, Gladiator also demonstrates what acting is all about, as Russel Crowe delivers the best performance of his Career. And though the plot of the movie seems a little cliche, it is carried out beautifully, set against the zenith of the Pax Romana. This should take home the Oscar for Best Picture, and most likely one for Mr. Crowe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is fantastic. As a movie buff I have seen a thousand movies, but none of them can quite compete with Gladiator. I'm too young to have grown up with sword and sandal epics, but I have seen most of them on television, and I was very excited to hear about Gladiator when word initially got out. Now, almost a year later, I have seen the movie 10 times and it keeps getting better. Russell Crowe is amazing. His screen presence is so dynamic that it almost blows you out of your seat. He doesn't have to say a word, just look at the opening sequence with the bird, and you'll know what I mean. He has the audience hooked from the second he walks on screen and right 'til the end. Ridley Scott has made an epic without comparison. The special effects alone are a feast for the eyes. The cast is fantastic. Joaquin Phoenix who I before hand only had seen in "8 MM" was amazing as Commodus. I hated him for everything he did to Maximus and still I pitied him - he just wanted something he had never had - love. As a Dane I was also thrilled to see Connie Nielsen as Lucilla - the rumours about Jennifer Lopez trying out for the part made me laugh - only a woman with Connie's regal stature could pull of the part of sister, love interest and truly politically interested without making any of it look fake. That woman has my utmost admiration. I can't wait to see her next movie. The plot is believable - and heartmoving. As a viewer you feel for Maximus as you make the journey alongside him for a painstakingly two-and-a-half hours. But when he reaches the end, you know it was the only way to end the movie. If Maximus had survived, as he did in the early script drafts, the movie wouldn't have had the same impact. As he dies, he joins the ranks of heroes who, after performing their tasks, goes to the great beyond to join their loved ones. For some reason, seeing Maximus shag up with Lucilla wouldn't have given me quite the same rush as the actual ending of the movie did. Hands up for a Kleenex moment. I've always loved a good cry - and this movie provides it - along with some memorable laughs and smiles, for my part mostly courtesy of Mr. Crowe. And if you don't like Roman Epics, see it for Russell Crowe. The man deserves his following - and an OSCAR - if I had any say in the matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Epics have come a long way since the 1950s. Gladiator is a gem of a movie. Outstanding from first frame to last, this is moviemaking at its best. The opening battle scenes which were filmed in Surrey I believe, have to be seen to be believed. Russell Crow is perfectly cast as the Roman General who is betrayed, loses his wife and son who are both murdered, and then ends up in the Arena seeking revenge against Emporer Commodus. Some of the action is brilliant to watch. It is also a fine tribute to Oliver Reed who sadly died during the final shooting. Won't beat Ben-Hur for oscars though, but should gain a few.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A better film than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading some of the comments here and being generally leary about Hollywood blockbusters, I did not expect much from this film. I was pleasantly surprised.If you can get by the preposterous premise of the film, you will find a literate script, good performances, and a movie that really moves along at a fast pace. It is the only Roman epic that I would willingly see again besides Spartacus. In fact, there is a lot in Gladiator that can be compared to the first half of Spartacus but Spartacus remains the superior film. I am glad that the producers of Gladiator chose to emulate Spartacus rather than The Fall of the Roman Empire(which was a terrible film) upon which the plot was based.Some good things about the film include the lack of sex and foul language which would have restricted the viewing of this film. There is plenty of violence but it's in a comic book style and not too realistic. The use of Oliver Reed and Richard Harris was truly inspired and they contribute to the film in the way that Alec Guiness contributed to Star Wars. The overall quality of acting is very good. The special effects are fine and the scenes in the Colluseum are especially memorable.It is not a great film, or even the best film of 2000, but I enjoyed it and would recommend it with enthusiasm.</fullReview>

After Gladiator, I finally decided never to see another Hollywood blockbuster in the theater - why did it take me so long to learn that lesson? On an historical note, Commodus really did enjoy participating in the games, much to the embarrassment of the Roman upper class. He really was killed by a gladiator too, only, he was at home at the time and it was a wrestler named Narcissus who strangled him while the Praetorian Guard looked on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching "Gladiator", I was reminded of a number of films with either a similar setting ("Ben Hur", "El Cid") or a similar storyline (avenge your family's murder like "The Outlaw Josey Wales", or gather a large group of people to fight against a oppressive leadership like "Braveheart").Despite the film's budget and some of director Ridley Scott's impressive visuals, "Gladiator" left me cold. The movie didn't blow me away. Throughout the movie, I was reminded of films that did a better job. "Gladiator" felt very drab and, in some stretches, dull.I've been impressed with Russell Crowe's work in a number of movies including "Romper Stomper", "L.A. Confidential" and especially, "The Insider". I was not impressed with his work in this movie. I thought that he captured the physical aspects but not the emotional. I was surprised how much I didn't care about his character.I thought Joaquin Phoenix did a better job as Commodus. His callous, cold-blooded actions were right on target. I did find it interesting that Derek Jacobi, who played Gracchus, played a similar character in the title role of "I, Claudius" several decades ago.Considering all the battles that occurred in the film, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Oliver Reed gave his most understated performance in the final movie of his career.As always, with any Ridley Scott film, the visuals will always be impressive. But unless the script he directs from is really good (e.g., "Thelma and Louise"), the end product will always be a good-looking but underwhelming movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very rare Hollywood film, that is not only entertaining, but also intelligent, suspenseful, historic, and enthralling. This movie illustrates how a good movie doesn't need cops and robbers, guns and bombs, or four letter words to keep an audiences attention. The acting is above average in every respect. Especially, Russell Crowe's subtle but forceful main character. Production values are excellent, and the soundtrack is mesmerizing. It is a shame that more movies of this caliber are not being made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dude, where's the great movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing Gladiator last summer. I remember dishing out 8 bucks, paying for my Coke, watching the movie, and coming out entertained. But that was it. And, really, that was it. It didn't linger on my mind even a nanosecond after I have exited the theatre. And I certainly didn't have to fight the urge to come back for more. The word "great" wouldn't exactly have fluttered about had I been asked to describe it. Six months or so later, what do I read: Gladiator is set to be named best movie of the year. What? has the definition of greatness changed? And thus, I ordered it on pay-per-view yesterday. Well, big shock, I dozed off several times. The movie started well enough with impressive pre-battle scenery but then when the action started, nothing could be seen: there was too many quick cuts (which, in contrast, reminds me of that amazing shot in Crouching Tiger when you see a thug fall off the first floor to the ground floor in ONE seamless shot) and jerky camera movements (which, in contrast, reminds me of the gorgeous overhead shots in Crouching Tiger). Great action? Well sure, people lose limbs, get impaled but I don't call that great action. Great scenery? I hate over-reliance on CGI (read: the Phantom Menace), the Coliseum has no organic feel to it and thus it is difficult to imagine the characters inhabiting the setting (read: Keanu Reeves pretending to act in front of a green screen). Great introduction to Rome? Well, enough has been said on that. The only thing historical about the oft-lauded battle was the "turtle" formation adopted by the Romans when confronted with enemy arrows. Of course the ending was predictably condescending. Had the setting been an American one, we would seen the star-spangled banner 100 times before the credits started rolling. You get the picture. Overall it was just one of those blockbuster for the masses, one of those factory-movies churned out in droves by Hollywood every summer. Entertainment for a mindless afternoon. But great art it isn't. Not even close. 7/10</fullReview>

Granted it is violent, but only because it has to be, not because it can be. You really begin to develop a feel for the characters as the story goes on, especially the tragedies and hardships that the main character Maximus goes through. Another plus is the soundtrack, I would definitely recommend renting this, especially on DVD. I hope it gets best picture, it deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They don't make Best Picture nominees the way they used to, I guess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is a good movie, but I'm amazed at how many people gave it ten out of ten stars. I know standards fall as time goes on, but that's a rating that should be reserved for a movie that will stay with you for years to come. All About Eve is such a movie; so is the Godfather. This isn't going to be one.Don't get me wrong, it's great to see old pros (Reed and Harris) and relatively new pros (Crowe, Phoenix, Nielsen, and Hounsou) go through their paces; Crowe in particular is better than I've ever seen him before. However, the plot is well worn, the dialogue occasionally lapses into silliness, and the CGIs bother me. I can remember a time (was it really only two decades ago?) when filmmakers who wanted a mindbogglingly spectacular set built one--they did the work, they spent the bucks, they expended the sweat. The CGI Colosseum seems like cheating, somehow, and several other shots are so obviously faked, they detract from the action.Speaking of the action, it is quite good. Scott has definitely lost none of his knack for tense pacing; I was surprised to see that two hours had gone by and I hadn't even felt them. The fight scenes are not only believable, which isn't even remotely a given in action movies, they're so entertaining they inspire not only excitement but a vague sense of guilt. And after being weaned on the mega-buff steroid stallions of the 80s and early 90s, it's very nice to see the athletic but not Conanesque Maximus in action.All in all, a good flick, but I'm pulling for Traffic or Crouching Tiger to take home the gold statues. This just isn't the kind of movie that deserves them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit walking into the theatre to watch 'Gladiator' I thought that it was going to be just a rip-off of 'Spartacus.' I was pleasantly surprised to see that it wasn't the case. 'Gladiator' was a very visualy rewarding film, it was probably the best technical achievement that I seen last year, but on the other hand for it to get an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture was a little much. I believe that it no doubtly deserves to clean up the technical Oscars, but just because it is visually a great film, I don't think that makes it one of the best films of the year. I said the very same thing about 'Titanic' which was an amazing technical film, but to say that it was the best film of the year, or in some cases I heard some people say that it was the best film of the decade, was ubsurd. Just because you spend a lot of money on a film does not mean that it makes it a great film. I feel that it is the same case with 'Gladiator.' Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed this film, but sometimes hype can get the best of me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is a film worth watching. But as I was watching the film, I suddenly felt like I've seen this movie before and my appreciation for it started to lower. Wasn't until the final scenes that it clicked. I was sure this movie was a remake of The Fall Of The Roman Empire. Gladiator had similarities to this 1964 movie starring Sophia Loren, Boyd and Christopher Plummer as the over the top Emperor. I found this movie a bit corny and it sort have had negatively influenced my judgement over Gladiator.Todays action movies you mainly see guns and explosions, but when a movie like Gladiator comes out it should be fresh, new and entertaining. I found the movie entertaining and fresh - but it wasn't a new storyline. But putting everything else aside, movies are there for enjoyment and entertainment. As long as a movie has these ingredients it can't possibly go wrong. Gladiator is one of these movies that has the ingredients. A great movie, but if you want to see a better gladiator movie, I would recommend Spartacus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertainment and Fun, all the way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I avoid looking the movies in a technical way. For me, watching a movie is entertainment, I'm part of the public. There's no such thing as say at the end of the movie - "gosh, that was fun".Of course, many movies can be fun, and fun can be enough. Romantic Comedy is a perfect example. It's always fun watching some of this movies. But some of them still stays in our memories, forever. What's the difference of Pretty Woman and Notting Hill? Can you tell? Both of them are very entertainment.When I first watch Gladiator, I felt adrenaline, emotions, I hear messages and got conclusions about a lot of things. Gladiator was very fun, and I got out of the movies with a very good feeling. It's entertainment, I guess. Fun in the most pure form of it.If I end this comment here, some people would hate me for comparing Pretty Woman with Gladiator. I don't see why I can't do it... Gladiator is fun, so is Pretty Woman. Both of 'em will remain in our memories. But anyone can tell that this two movies are REALLY different. People can say that Gladiator is better, and believe me, they will, some of them will hate me for putting these two movies together in one comment.I'll repeat: Gladiator is fun. Pretty Woman is fun. Both of 'em made rich too many people, in not too distant proportions, but still people will kill themselves to find a difference.Gladiator is a an achievement of the movies' industry, with billions of special effects, direction and acting, mixed up in a form that won't disappear soon. Even the script is amazing. Gladiator is filled with the top of movies' resources, and the result is: an epic. But still, Gladiator is as fun as Pretty Woman.I'll keep saying this until you all understand that Gladiator is entertainment. It's fun to read X-Men Comics, it's fun to eat Doritos, it's so much fun telling jokes and anecdotes, and it's fun to watch Gladiator. This movie is fun, entertaining, oh yeah, it is. VERY fun, VERY entertaining, EVERYBODY will remember of Russel Crowe with sand in his hands before a fight, EVERYBODY will remember the epic General-Slave-Gladiator-Hero line, because it is fun! Think again of Gladiator, and you'll see that you already knew the end about half of the movie. You'll see that Gladiator is a linear story, without any form of surprising and clever message. Gladiator is an epic, because it showed the most important thing of movies - what the public want to see. I won't say that Gladiator is a bad movie, I think of Gladiator as one of the best movies ever, because it brought me fun.I wouldn't risk myself saying that Gladiator is a piece of art, but I risk myself saying that Gladiator is as fun as Pretty Woman. Gladiator is public, Gladiator is commercial, Gladiator is Hollywood. Ridley Scott &amp; crew turned a linear and very predictable story into an epic, that will get the Best Movie awards.Why movies like Hamilton, Talented Mr Ripley and Eyes Wide Shut don't get the spotlights, even when they're acclaimed by the critics as "pieces of art"? Because they don't bring what people expect - the pure entertainment. To find fun in movies like Magnolia (one movie that I love most) you have to think, think again, and then cross culture barriers that you WON'T FIND in movies like Gladiator.Gladiator will bring you fun, and TOO MUCH fun, in a VERY FAST way. You'll get it, without any form of barrier that you'll have to cross. Like a chocolate bar or Doritos will bring you fun.Gladiator is fun. And fun is more than enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator was, without a doubt, my favorite movie of 2000, thus far. I am not a huge action kinda guy, but this movie actually had a tremendous storyline and magnificient performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Pheonix. With staggering battle scenes on the battlefields and in the collesuem, this film was absolutely the definition of a great epic. Crowe's performance deserves an Oscar for Best Actor, though I am sure they will give it to Tom Hanks or Ed Harris, which is fine by me. I am sure Crowe will get his Oscar in the future sometime. Richard Harris's role as the aging emperor is also good, and should have been noticed for Best Supporting Actor. All and all this film is truly and beautifully shot and exciting action/drama worth seeing 50 times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw GLADIATOR in the theatre, I was amazed. I hadn't seen anything like it before. When I saw it on video, I began to actually consider the film, as one always does. I found it quite different.What makes a motion picture good. The acting has to be good, the story original, the directing careful and good, the dialogue realistic, the screenplay well written, the cinematography original AND good, and entertaining.In Gladiator, the acting is great, fantastic, even. Phoenix is evil as Commodus, Harris on target as Marcus Aurelius, Nielson convincing as Commodus' sister, and seems to care for Maximus and her child. Russell Crowe amazing, being exactly what the writer and director wanted him to be: tough, caring, slightly emotionless, though, and at times funny.The story is quite original, it mixes true historical events and fictional sequences alike to create something wholly new. The pacing is perfect, and the dialogue and screenplay are good. The sub plots are involving and one comes to care for the charcters.The cinematography tells a good story. Old fashioned camera angles are used, as well as technically impressive photographing techniques are employed in the film. The action scenes are exactly what Scott wants them to be, confusing, violent, compelling, and showing not only the common horrors of war and violence, but also those invovled's feelings and what it was like to be there in them.There is no question that Gladiator is not entertaining- it is! Old fashioned Rome stuff and today's violence, as well as involving charcters.So why not like the film? Okay, there are historical inaccuraces, but Scott doesn't want it to be real. Spartacus had inaccuraces, Ben-Hur did, too, no one is complaining of them.In addition to the above things, the art direction is beautiful, the score compelling, the costume design good (however inaccurate), and some good old Braveheart style violence.I keep thinking to myself, this film isn't that great, it doesn't even deserve a nomination, but then I think about what I tell you, and I realize it really is a great film.I have not seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or Chocolat, so I can't say anything about those. However, Erin Brokovich was just awful! But I'm reviewing Gladiator here. Traffic was gret too, but I have only seen it once in the theartre, so I have not really had a chance to truly evaluate it.In conclusion, Gladiator is an amzing film, not to be missed. I give it eight out of ten, but even now I find that I am giving it a lesser score than I think it should. I don't want to like this film, but I can;t help it!</fullReview>

It was about a man's courage and will to enter his way to his main goal- Revenge. Unfortunately- Gladiator was a movie of Hollywood while William Wallace of Braveheart was based strictly on historical events. However, there was Roman Gladiators back before christ and after christ, and they did shed bloodshed and life for the Emperors of Rome.

The tigers can only be seen as real, I knew after seeing and reading a review that they were digital. The directing is seemless and the battle scene cinematography seems presented as part of the depiction, too many over-army shots would have you thinking "Braveheart." It is the most deservant for Best Picture, and with exactly the same noms that Ben-Hur was met with I cant see whay it should'nt win most of the others.

		<shortDescription>Are you not entertained?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening moments of Gladiator, and till the last, it is clear that you are being treated to Oscar quality entertainment. Ridley Scott, who directed one of my all-time favorites, Blade Runner, almost never misses. But few directors can ever hope to hit the mark so cleanly and convincingly as Scott does with Gladiator. Gladiator is magnificent, thrilling, moving, epic, heroic and a dozen other things so conspicuously absent in so many movies and so abundantly present here.Russell Crowe was born to play this role, and he occupies the character with epic vigor and a presence that has a tendency to overpower a scene. It is, of course, true that Crowe's ego made him nearly impossible to work with, and he is said to have proclaimed during filming that he was the greatest actor in the world. There are, in fact, moments in the film where it would be difficult to argue with him. Still, he has subtle moments as well. There is a scene, late in the movie. Maximus is near the end of an epic struggle and all the contentious forces of Rome are whirling around him. He is asked by Lucilla, the emperor's sister, with whom he apparently had an affair years ago, if all that had happened made her seem different. Crowe replies, with stunning understatement, "You laughed more." I knew in that moment that Crowe had won the Oscar, and deservedly so. The story is, quite simply, largely fabrication, though to some extent based on fact. It is true that Commodus was the only Roman emperor to fight in the Coliseum, although his battle with Maximus, as well as its magnificent conclusion, is entirely fictionalized. In fact, Maximus Decimus Meridius is a completely fictitious character perhaps composited by screenwriter David Franzoni and director Ridley Scott, who clearly gave themselves full literary license to rewrite the relatively common story of Commodus into something breathtakingly memorable.Hollywood has been in the movie business a long time. There are many great movies, but few are great on the scale of Gladiator. Every aspect of Gladiator comes together so spectacularly that any shortcomings it may have are easily overlooked. Scott's inspired direction, Hans Zimmer's thrilling score, supplemented by Lisa Gerrard's stirring vocals; all conspire magically to contribute to Gladiator's success. John Mathieson's cinematography, which Scott relied on in Robin Hood and Hannibal as well, is painterly and dark, perfectly matched to the story and characters. There are movies of the genre, towering achievements in cinema from decades past, held in higher regard than Gladiator, but in many ways even they are not Gladiator's equal. Gladiator is not only a peer to the likes of Spartacus and Ben Hur, but, ultimately, their superior. And for the curious, or the skeptical, I would put the Battle of Carthage scene up against the Chariot Race scene any day. Perhaps it isn't as disturbingly, agonizingly long, but the heroism and courage played out in the Carthage scene is without equal. A few of the common problems with epic films are necessarily present. Some of the characters are not fully developed, which, given the story arc, is common in epic films which are based on events rather than subtle characterizations. As for historical inaccuracies, much cited in derision of the film, I don't think Scott is presently seeking an endowed chair in History at any major university, so if he took a few liberties with a well-known story to heighten the drama, I can only reply with a quote from the main character; "Are you not entertained?" The lore surrounding Gladiator is definitely fascinating. Oliver Reed, who died during principle filming, had to be recreated digitally in some scenes. Despite the difficulty of this effort, it was less expensive than refilming Reed's scenes and many of the cast insisted that Reed remain a part of the film. Richard Harris is rumored to have refused to learn rewrites, complicating his scenes early in the film. In both cases, their immense contributions to the film make it all worthwhile. Scott's signature touches, a washed-out color palette, the ubiquitous slow motion splattering of blood, and, most notably his tendency to magnify characters by using tight close-ups against backgrounds compressed by the application of telephoto lenses, may have been a bit overdone, but the combined effect heightens the action, the drama and the characters and somehow imbues them with a sense of history fitting the story.In short, Gladiator may be the best sandals and swords epic ever, and a worthy heir to the mantle handed down from its predecessors. Russell Crowe is glorious as the brooding and relentless gladiator bent on revenge. Joaquin Phoenix is electric as the devious and ambitious Commodus, and without a doubt should have received the Best Supporting Actor nod. With Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, sadly both now deceased, added for flavor, this is as great an epic as any. So many reviewers want to dislike movies that are popular, as if it proves that they are gifted with an appreciation of fine cinema that escapes lesser moviegoers. I say nonsense. The reason everyone thinks this movie is great is because it is great. It's beautiful, it's moving, it's just plain fun. Grab some popcorn and prepare to be entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott is a much misunderstood director. His trademark style is to create movies with purposely "one-dimensional" characters, most of which are not very likeable... and to distance us from them rather than bring them in closer. The reason he does this is so we focus on the film's (always incredible) atmosphere and (amazing) visuals.Now, some may say this is "style over substance." Not quite right, it is style *AS* substance. A good example of plain old "style over substance" is the movie "The Cell." That one is all style, no substance. Gladiator, Hannibal, Blade Runner, these films are (mostly) all style, but the style *IS THE SUBSTANCE*. The atmosphere these films create, the way they make you feel in your gut, that is the substance!Is there something wrong with that? Film is an art form, and who ever said every movie has to tell a deep, complex tale with warm characters we can all relate to? Sometimes, a film is all about style... it's a visual medium, isn't it? Do all paintings have to be of people?Many people are never going to appreciate Ridley Scott's kind of directing... it's usually a "love it or hate it" kind of thing. Anyway, you finally deserve one of those golden paperweights, Ridley, go grab (at least) one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing Gladator I started thinking back to the history class where I first saw Spartacus. Also a Roman hero story only with a much lower budget. But what can I say... nowadays we're used to heavy gunshot scenes in fliks, so Roman slaughter scenes give us some distraction and this is why I stayed watching this movie. I felt Spartacus coming back at the end of Gladiator when Maximus is being carried away, I was waiting till somebody would stand up saying; "I am Maximus" with many following him. But giving it a overall look, I say yes to this flik.a thumbs UP.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its a good thing "Saving Private Ryan and Gladiator", were not out in the same year, I think it would have been a first time duel for Best Picture.I did enjoy this film greatly, but I had trouble with the basic plot, that is, the suppose killing of Maximus. His men were very loyal to him, and his right hand man "Quintas" was not in the Pretorian Guard,(who protects the Emperor), so for him to turn against Maximus is just not believable, during the Roman empire in the years A.D. it was the army who plotted against the Emperors and in many cases put their Generals as emperors.Be that as it may,its a story of the destiny of men "when death smiles at you, all you can do is smile back", as we will all dead, its the when and the how.This is also the third film that had this special type editing, I don't know what to call it, but its like a slow motion, speeded up editing process that's quite unique.This movie has a message here and its all to real</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bombastic production, old-fashioned story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its impossible to stay unimpressed from this gigantic epic. "Gladiator" is full of dramatic, emotion and suspense. Watch this film on a big screen at the cinema and the sets, costumes and the sound will catapult you out of your seat! The cast is excellent - especially Joaquin Phoenix as schemer Roman emperor. However I was disappointed about the leading actor Russell Crowe, who was in my opinion too reserved for this role. The second problem is, that the story lies somewhere between "Spartacus" (Gladiator fights against the Roman empire and becomes the hero of the nation) and "Quo vadis?". At last there is nothing really new in this film, its more a remake of the old ones - just with a better technic, better FX and a higher budget. Today I heard on the radio that "Gladiator" is nominated for 12 awards... what made my think of that there are "better" movies which also would deserve an Oscar. "Better" in this sense that there films which have more original ideas and which are not only pure commercial products like this one is! However, you wont be disappointed by "Gladiator". If you like bombastic cinema - watch this! Its just a film that is made more for the eye than for the demands. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film...But Not As Good As Awards Make It To Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched "Gladiator" last night to see if it deserved to win over "Traffic" at the Golden Globes. And while I still think "Traffic" is better, "Gladiator" still proved to be a really good film. However, I don't think it was the best film of the year.The story begins in wartime b/w Rome and Germania. Maximus (Russel Crowe) is the general of the Roman army, and he leads them into battle. To sum it up, they kick major Germanian army booty in a really bloody battle (if you are intensely disturbed and grossed out at this point, don't continue watching the film). Anyway, the Emperor of Rome currently is all proud of Maximus, and it turns out he really admires Maximus after his good work all these years, which, of course, sparks intense jealousy from an already "bad dude" Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the current emperor's son. So when Commodus becomes Emperor, he orders Maximus to be killed. But Maximus dodges being killed, returns home to find his family dead, and then while wandering around lost, he's picked up by some salesmen and is held as a slave. He's then sold as a gladiator. The rest of the story chronicles him being a gladiator that sort of teaches Rome with his fighting and rebellious ways to be more powerful than the Emperor...which Commodus isn't too happy about.This was a better movie than I thought it would be. The story was good: it was creative, pretty, touching, and interesting all rolled together.The acting was exceptional. Russel Crowe captured the intensity of Maximus' feelings and displayed them well for the audience to intake. Connie Nielsen was convincing as Commodus' sister. But the best performance in the whole movie was Joaquin Phoenix as the nasty Emperor of Rome, Commodus Caesar. He gave his character an evil that was seen through coyness and nastiness, both blended to give Commodus that bad guy touch that really makes you fear and hate him...and yet he seems so innocent at times. The only other time I've seen a performance like that is when Topher Grace played slimeball Seth Abrams in "Traffic".I loved the cinematic artwork in this movie, namely seen during the first battle in the story. The camera dissolves and movement were all used to just make you say, "Wow!" throughout the whole movie. I also liked the color usage: blues for outside scenes at the beginning battle, brownish oranges for inside, brightness in the gladiator arena, and darkness surrounding the Emperor. These techniques managed to turn a summer popcorn movie into a piece of art that can be appreciated through many movie goer's eyes.This film is definitely in my top 5 of 2000. While I personally think "Traffic" is the best film of the year, I won't ask, "How much money was under the table?" if this movie wins the prize.I give it an 8/10, being it was a little overly long. Length wasn't the problem; after all, "Traffic" was 147 minutes and I loved every minute. But unlike "Traffic", "Gladiator" got really boring at times and I found myself looking at my VCR clock a little too constantly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this is a strange place I find myself in. I'm a huge Ridley Scott fan and a big Russel Crowe fan. But the movie lacked in several areas. I think that the story itself was very powerful but it didn't translate that well to the screen. I'm not really sure whose fault that was but apparently I'm the only one that noticed it anyway. It also never got my blood pumping the way I think Ridley intended it to. The battles were poorly shot and hard to watch, especially on the small screen. I must give credit where credit is due though. The film is very beautiful and the visual effects of Rome were very good. Russel Crowe was, as usual, amazing and Juaquin Phoenix stole the entire film away from even Richard Harris (I was very impressed). Overall the film was watchable but lacked the epic part of an epic movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know about anybody else, but if I'm watching a car chase or a martial arts fight or one guy hacking another guy's head off with an axe, I want to see it. Is that so hard? For some unknown reason, directors are equating style with the ability to shake the camera around so the audience can't see anything. Now this idiotic trend has grabbed Ridley Scott by the testicles. Let me give you an idea what watching this film's action sequences is like:It's as though I wr ote the ent ire review som ethi ng lik e this.Now, wasn't that fun? Russell Crowe plays General Maximus, who's the leader of the armies of the Roman Empire. He's just finished beating the crap out of the barbarian hordes when Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) decides he's going to make Maximus the new emperor, spurning his cleft-lip son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). This p***es Commodus off so he kills dear old dad, kills Maximus's family, and tries to kill Maximus, who barely escapes. Maximus ends up a slave, but he starts fighting, eventually becomes the best gladiator in the land and travels back to Rome so he can have his revenge on Commodus.Aside from the action sequences, which made me feel like someone was jackhammering my head, the major problem with the film lies with Commodus, who, if he had any brains at all, would have had Maximus killed the second he saw him. Just take him in the back and bash in his head, then insist he slipped in the tub. Instead, Maximus is able to plot with Commodus's sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), and one of the senators (Derek Jacobi). Of course, Commodus is clueless the entire time. Basically, by the time the film is over, you wonder how the Roman Empire managed to conquer anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clarification on a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Gladiator', the fictional story of Maximus Decimus Meridius, is an excellent movie. There is a deep spirituality to the movie, an unraveling romance and breath-taking action sequences. Superb acting by the leads and supporters (Jaoquin Phoenix was incredible as evil Emperor Commodus) adds to the spectacle that is Gladiator. Ridley Scott hits the mark with his latest masterpiece. Now for some clarification. Some critics, professional and Internet-based alike, have stated that "Gladiator's" storyline strays away from the actual historical events that took place in ancient Rome. Please do your homework before you blatantly bash the credibility of a movie: at the end of 'Gladiator' there is a disclaimer: "Although some characters were taken from actual historical events, the STORY IS FICTION". Therefore, they can use the names but can write their own story. On a final note, Hans Zimmer has composed another amazing score. His other works include 'The Rock', 'Crimson Tide' and 'Backdraft'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At last... a kicking historical epic.. with added foxiness!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I must reveal my bias towards this film, owing to the fact that I am female and am not averse to the sight of 13 odd stone of tanned, muscled, Australian manhood (if only!). However, my highly tuned entertainment gland will not bow down to the demands of my quivering hormonal bits without a little plot action for itself.Having read some of the less kind reviews of Gladiator, I get the feeling that they are missing the point a little. Gladiator isn't Citizen Kane, but it is great entertainment. It isn't a lesson in Roman history, either. Some reviewers made reference to Braveheart and it's superiority over this film. Obviously, no professors of Scottish history are posting reviews here, but William Wallace wasn't the upstanding, noble, man of the people that Americans seem to believe. And at least Gladiator is shot in a sunny climate, not on the gloomy old Curragh in Ireland. Maltese rays are infinitely preferable for some escapism.Yes, the plot could have done with a bit of tweaking to make it a little more free flowing, but never mind the narrative, feel the action! Even for the squeamish, these were the exciting parts. And anyone who has ever been to a pantomime cannot deny the thrill to be felt as Maximus reveals his identity to Commodus. You have to love the melodrama "I am Maximus Decimus Barridius... and I will have my revenge in this life or the next". Go Russ, go!!!!As for the direction, Ridley Scott isn't afraid to use images that are a little different, even though some of the crowd scenes look a little hokey, it works.Finally, I may be (rightly?) accused of rampant xenophobia, but the ultimate success of this film lies in the lack of American actors (apart from the excellent Joaquin Phoenix). When an Irish girl has been fed an endless diet of Neighbours, Home and Away, The Flying Doctors et al., she can't help having a gra for the old Aussie male. Fair dinkum, strength and honour, mate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumphant achievement from all angles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So what if Commodus was actually murdered in his bathtub? And honestly, do we care that he actually ruled with his father Marcus Aurelius as co-emperor for several years before Marcus Aurelius died? At least, these are some of the facts which have been rearranged in "Gladiator", but why not take liberties with poetic license?! Great cinema is about drama, and this is not a documentary, nor will the audience be disappointed by what they see. Gladiator gives the audience what it wants: the human connection. History is not flat, lying on a page. It was real, as real as today is now, and in Gladiator, history is alive, visually compelling... transporting. What higher compliment could we give than that so many people have been able to instantly identify with a time and place that most of those watching this film have never given much thought to before? How can this in itself not be called a triumph? And I would even argue that the writers of these historical epics *must* truncate and rearrange so many aspects of one historical era to reproduce the whole for our understanding... thus aspects of the equally despotic Roman emperors Caligula and Nero are merged with the character of Commodus... but Gladiator is not merely a visual success, or that merely because of its fantastic special effects. It is quite simply a compelling story. We all support Maximus in his fight to avenge the murders of his wife and son. We all love to watch the strangely intriguing performance of the ambitious, luminously mad emperor Commodus... and the delicate maneuvering of his politically-minded sister, Lucilla! The acting in Gladiator is also reason enough to see the film. Not only have we the last performance of the great Shakespearean actor Oliver Reed playing Promximo, and the incomparable Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, but two new luminaries on the cinematic horizon: Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. If great acting can be accomplished with the simple movement of the eyes, if great acting, as has often been said, can be achieved with and within the subtlety of a single expression, then these two have mastered the art of great acting! A telling point would be to see the film dubbed into Italian (close to Roman Latin); this would prove, I think, how talented these actors are in the expressiveness of their emotions through the eyes and body language, as well as through their fantastic speaking voices. As for Connie Nielsen, I have to say that she was excellently cast as the elegant Lucilla; had Ridley Scott substituted her for any other more well-known but less capable Hollywood actress, I think the role would have been the film's greatest weakness. In fact, it was a wise choice to cast this film with extremely talented but less well-known actors (though NOT ANY MORE!), or else Gladiator may not have seemed so realistic, nor made so powerful an impact on so many. I would recommend this film to anyone. My rating: 11/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Gladiator this weekend and I have to say I'm not sure what all the hype was about. The story is only fair and the characters flat; and, at over two and a half hours, there was ample time for much better story and character development. Unlike Braveheart, and The Patriot, two other recent period epics, I was never drawn into the story, never became involved emotionally with the characters, never really cared. And, Crowe seems to play the same character in many of his movies; it's time for less grunting. It was nice to see Richard Harris, I wish he'd do more.If you see it, see it for the scenery and the special effects; they are FANTASTIC. I remember watching Titanic and being able to pick out the people and scenery that was computer generated. Not so in Gladiator. Rome looks like it's real, nothing short of amazing.The blood and gore, if you worry about that kind of thing, wasn't as bad as some have said; in fact, there was much less than I expected.Worth the time if you must. But "The Fall of the Roman Empire" was better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If, like me, you're a big fan of the old Roman epics, this is a dream come true. It includes everything required of a good Roman epic film, and then some. It is simply amazing! A wonderful film.Starting with the cinematography, it is the most beautiful I've seen in years, and the soundtrack is a perfect match for the strong imagery.All the actors give their very best, and every character is believable, down to the most minor roles. Russell Crowe IS Maximus, no doubt about it. And sad as it is he passed away so soon, Oliver Reed gives the performance of a lifetime, so what a way to go. Some good lines there as well, but as it is an action movie, not that many. Mind you, it has a better dialogue than most other contemporary block-busters.Something totally new for this genre is of course the advanced computer graphics, unknown in the days of classics like "Ben Hur" and "The Fall of the Roman Empire". Ridley Scott has used this new medium to its full potential, without overdoing it. It works really well, and looks quite real indeed.What else is there to say. Almost forgot: If you haven't seen it yet, do it right now. No kidding. This is a future classic and quite soon we'll see how many Oscars it will receive. (My guess: best actor, best cinematography, best film, best director and quite possibly even more. Although this is only a wild guess as yet, here's hoping...)10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too flawed to be considered a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADThis is a pretty good film, but certainly not worth being considered a serious candidate for "best picture of the year" (sadly, the people at the Oscars are probably gonna think different). The reason for my statement is simple: although the visuals are excellent and there are some really strong points through the whole movie, the script is pretty simplistic, and is inaccurate as a portrait of the ancient Roman empire.Also, I have a big problem with Ridley Scott's depiction of "evil" and "good" characters. Apart from Blade Runner, he always insists too much on how the bad guy is evil, and how the good guy is the voice of reason and freedom. This movie is no exception. Maximus is portrayed too much as the "good guy", yet it's pretty obvious that we can't consider him ONLY good. He was a warrior, fought and killed people for Rome. We see him killing people in the arena as a gladiator, yet anyone can realize their lives as men were as important as Maximus', and the Roman empire did wrong to them as it did to Maximus. Don't get me wrong, Maximus was fighting for revenge and for his own life, and we obviously can't consider him a villain. But anger and sadness should be what we see in Maximus, or maybe his character should be partially rehabilitated -- i.e. regretting his life as a legionary and showing frustration for what he has to do to survive in the arena -- before we are TOLD that he is SO good and caring. Sadly, the script doesn't add much depth, and that's a shame because I think Crowe could have done much better with a good script. More, Ridley Scott tricks us by making Maximus a man that once was just a farmer, and that's historically inaccurate (in the Roman empire you couldn't become a Legion commander unless you were a noble). I found the movie too manipulative to make me really care about Maximus' character.More, I found the love story with the princess pathetic. It didn't add anything to the movie, and it was there just to make it a little more appealing to the mass audience. A love story between two "beautiful people" always works for some. Not for me. I recently saw the DVD version and I think most of the stuff that got cut out was actually much more interesting than this love story.Elsewhere, the movie is really good. The visuals are great, and I liked Commodus' performance as well (although I wouldn't call it outstanding). The battle scenes are very impressive. The fight in the end is awesome, too.I would rate this movie something between 6 and 7 out of ten, but I stick with 6. Sorry, but considering the budget and the potential this is a failure, although a fairly good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timely epic of ancient Rome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not only the best movie to be released so far this year, it is also one of the few summer films to come along in the past decades that simply demands repeat viewings. My feeling is that it will get them. The summer movie season began early this year with the release of Scott's first film since 1997's `G.I. Jane' and will likely end sometime early next year when the film is sure to be re-released for a pre-Oscar audience. Something tells me that this year the Academy is going to love an epic and Gladiator will be it. Aside from the ney-sayers who avoided the film, dismissing it as it was marketed: A testosterone fueled slugfest without a story or the brain to create one, those familiar with Scott's previous work went to see Gladiator on opening weekend. As many are beginning to remember, Ridley Scott has a talent, not only for telling absorbing stories, but also for creating completely believable worlds in which those stories can be played out. The result is often some of the most visually arresting cinema in existence. As Julie Taymor was able to accomplish with last year's stunning Titus, Scott often lets his color pallet tell the story. The opening sequence which takes place on a decimated forest battlefield in Germania sets the tone for the rest of the film. The colors are grey, brown? oh, and red, but sparingly so. After the Roman army, under the command of General Maximus (Russell Crowe), completes a bloody victory over the `last stronghold' of rebel barbarians, Maximus re-affirms to himself why he has just killed hundreds of men in the name of the empire, `Rome is the light' ? the rest of the world: darkness. Of course, Maximus has never been to the city he speaks of and when he does, we see that it too is just as dark as the rest of the world it helped to create. When the new Caesar, Comodus (Juaquin Phoenix) rides past the Coliseum for the first time since his father's death, the mood is as cold and steel-grey as the surroundings. This has to be the heaviest shadow ever cast on the golden city. The majority of the rest of the film follows in its dark visuals, save for the scenes where we are shown the one true light in Maximus' life: his family. The film plays like an old fashioned epic. The tag-line pretty much sums up the action ? `The General who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an empire'. Gladiator is a hero story, but as traditional as the story arc may seem at first to be, we are not given the ending we might expect. This tale of ancient Rome is a timely one. We are being told the tale of a nation who's soul reason for being is an idea that is too beautiful to be realized by the men who bore it. `There was a dream that was Rome', says Caesar Marcus Aurelias before he dies, but to even speak it aloud would cause it to vanish. This is more of a curse than a dream, yet it serves to remind us of the things that can be accomplished through ideas, as well as just how easy it would be to let a dream fade into obscurity through excess and greed. We know that Rome was such a nation and we are at least given solace in seeing that Maximus was able to leave Rome believing, if only for himself, that his life gave a little bit of light back to the city that took it from him. Gladiator, is a film to be valued for many things. Most immediately for using violence, both outside of and within the story, as a tool to show that we can no longer find glory in violence itself. After brutally dispatching of six menacing gladiators in a matter of seconds, Maximus throws his sword into the crowd and asks `are you not entertained!' before spitting in disgust at the realization of what he must do to other men in order to find peace for his family. He is a man who has killed more people in his lifetime than we could possibly fathom, but it hurts us to know that with each life he takes, he is that much closer to finding peace within himself. Sadly, for him, killing is the only path to salvation. Fortunately, for the audience, we are allowed to witness how the redemption of one man may make for one of the most beautiful sequences ever put onto film, but it cannot bring back the dream of a nation that has allowed itself to extinguish through its own selfish quest for light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't watch this movie expecting great acting or literate writing. In this I certainly wasn't disappointed. I also didn't expect to see any real history presented. Even otherwise great movies take more than a little liberty with historical fact but this one was so far off they might as well have used completely fictional characters. The real disappointment is with the much praised visuals. When Maximus and the other gladiators enter the coliseum it is announced that they are going to present a re-enactment of the siege of Carthage. In the REAL coliseum they presented such shows with casts of hundreds of gladiators complete with elaborate staging. Parts of the coliseum were even flooded to support ships for naval battles. You would think that with a huge budget and modern effects capabilities they could have done much better. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator ranks as #3 on my all-time list of movies(The Fugitive, The Godfather). This movie has it all: Great scenery, great fight scenes, a non-boring history lesson, and great acting. With newcomer Joaquin Phoenix and superstar Russell Crowe, this movie will be on everyone's favourite list. Parents - There is a lot of blood in this movie, but is not more than a 14 year old can handle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Brilliant Film of 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator was probably the most brilliant film to come out of 2000, until late december when films like Traffic and Cast Away came out and even those two films didn't amount to what Gladiator did. What pushes this film beyond it's beautiful setting and brilliant cinematography would have to be the acting. Russell Crowe outdoes his performance in "The Insider" as a moral man determined to grant Caesar Marcus Aurelius' wish of not allowing his son Commodus from taking over. Joaquin Phoenix finally has achieved a role which allows him to fully let lose as Commodus the ambitious and manipulative son of Marcus Aurelius. The reason Gladiator is so appealing to such a wide audience is because it touches many moral areas including the afterlife and longing to reunite with family. This film will undoubtably win the Best Picture oscar along with many other awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hero DID Rise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I would just like to say Gladiator is one of my personal favorites, just behind Braveheart. This summer, a hero DID rise.I found Gladiator to be very interesting because it's not like all films of the summer of 2000.Ok, so maybe there already was a movie about a Gladiator(Spartacus), but do you really care? I mean, did a subject that was already covered stop you from watching Saving Private Ryan? Gladiator has a certain shine to it that makes you feel like an ancient Roman during the times of gladiators. It's cinematography and set-design is beautiful, as are the costumes. But along with the visuals, it's the excellent acting, impressive directing and sharp writing. If youy haven't seen Gladiator by now, go rent it.....you won't be disappointed.CONGRATS to Gladiator's Golden Globe Wins: Best Motion Picture Drama and Best Original score. Good look to ya for when The Oscar nominations are released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Booom, this movie explodes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again you can count on Ridley Scott to direct a bloody masterpiece! That's right, it's bloody and it's a masterpiece. I'm sorry I sound like a salesman but that's what happens when you're excited about the brilliance of a movie. If you havent' seen it yet take this as a que, it's in the video rentals so you have NO excuse not to see it! The acting was amazing. I don't care what anyone says I think Joaquin Phoenix did the best job as Commodus. He was so awesomely convincing, I would easily say he played the best villian since Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. Besides that, everyone else also acted flawlessly in their roles. This is definitely Oliver Reed's best performance ever, unfortunately his last. Besides that, the movie was so convincing, I have seen many movies who's settings are ancient rome, none of them did it as well as Gladiator did. The clothes, the palace, the battles, and most of all, the Colliseum are completely captivating. You wanna see a good movie that EVERYONE will love, this is the one, get it now!</fullReview>

This movie has every aspect a movie should have: romance, revenge, a villain you both despise and pity, a woman who is both strong and struggling, a hero who is mourning and determined (and not to mention absolutley adorable), violence to make you cheer, sorrow to make you cry, and an ending that makes you sad and happy, and a script that just cuts through you. When the music soars, so does your heart. Gladiator is the perfect movie, one that will be regarded a classic for all time. Well done Russell Crowe, Ridley Scott, and David H. Franzoni!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonable acting, no thanks to a poor script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Possible spoilers contained*** Some very good combat sequences and lots of impressive cgi do not make a good film. The script was poor, with some appalling cliches. The acting was reasonable given this poor script, which helped provide some hilarious "hammy" moments. I found myself laughing at what were meant to be the dramatic highlights ("What is your name?" "My name is Gladiator" - pur-leeease!). Towards the end I found myself wishing that Maximus had killed Commodus when he had his first chance in the arena. And thus saving me an hour of filler before the inevitable ending. If you are easily pleased and a sucker for hyped blockbusters, you'll love it. If you think that good special effects and cgi make a good movie, then you'll love it. Otherwise, treat with caution and a healthy dose of cynicism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Braveheart" it isn't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: The last line may contain a possible spoiler. The massive popularity of "Gladiator" blows my mind. Yes, it is an entertaining movie, but it is hardly the type of movie (historic, epic, depressingly dark) that usually appeals to most movie-goers. In some ways, this movie reminded me more of bleak, cautionary Sci-Fi flicks like "The Running Man" ("look at the darkness the human heart is capable of" type movies) rather than the heart-breaking human dramas recent epics like "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" have been. But I think the weakest part of the movie is the villain, Commodus. He's too weak to carry the movie, and since the driving force of the movie is Maximus' desire to avenge what was done to him and his family, that is a fatal weakness. Commodus' only skill is making sure his enemies are incapacitated in some way (or at least outnumbered) before they can get anywhere near him. You see, he knows how pathetic he really is, so he doesn't allow himself to get into a position in which he is likely to get the living daylights beat out of him (which just about anyone in this movie could do to him). Maybe it's just me. Maybe I wanted an evil villain instead of one that just frustrated me so much. Perhaps the thought of a ruler who doesn't deserve his power will be enough conflict for other viewers. But Commodus' weaknesses seem so obvious, I just wanted to stand up and tell everyone to open their eyes. "This is the man you let *lead* you?!" But no one in this movie, except Maximus, can see Commodus for what he really is. (Well, some could, but they wouldn't do anything about it, for some reason.) So how can I feel any satisfaction seeing such a weak man finally get his due?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vivid action enthralls and repels in bloody combat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Severed heads roll across the screen, blood spurts from torn torsos and the clash of steel swords keep the action going in a frenzy of gladiatorial combat. Film buffs who like plenty of action will find it all here and will especially admire the courage and determination of the greatest of all the gladiators, Maximus, a general who brings glory to Rome when he fights and wins the battle against Germania. Russell Crowe who plays Maximus wields a mighty sword against terrible odds. Maximus through his agility and experience and working to a plan is able to decimate his attackers however many surround him When the dying Caesar promises that the General Maximus should take over the control of Rome, the choice of candidate is not popular with Caesar's son who promptly sets about the slaughter of his wife and little son. Russell Crowe shines as an actor in the scene where he discovers the body of his wife hanging from a tree. This is a scene filled with emotion and heart-break. The remainder of the story concerns the avenging of this cruel deed. Those who dislike the sight of blood will have to close heir eyes many times during this film. The arena scenes are extremely well done on a broad canvas with sweeping views of blood-hungry spectators screaming "Maximus! Maximus!..." The supporting actors give very creditable performances as they get caught up in the intrigue and dirty tricks department of imperial Rome, but all eyes of course are on Russell Crowe as the sweaty gladiator, man of courage, man of action, hoping, as we all hope that good will triumph over evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing visuals, but little sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last week a co-worker told me her husband thought Gladiator was "the best movie he has every seen." I figured I should finally see it, and we watched it on PPV. Now I guess I know more about my co-worker's husband.We rated Gladiator a 7, and that is due to the terrific visual settings that convey an epic scope to the film. Without those settings, it would have been a 5. Gladiator revolves around the beliefs and actions of its main character, a man who seems to be stuck in the past and unable to see much around him for what it is. When his luck turns bad after a succession at the top, you feel sorry for the guy but also wonder why such a great leader of men didn't wake up sooner.Honor, loyalty and "the good of Rome" is at the heart of Gladiator. If you don't buy into those concepts, then you have a hard time caring much about Maximus or his journey. In this case, I had a hard time with several things, including:- Maximus is portrayed as a successful leader who wants Rome to return to rule by the people through the Senate. Setting aside questions about whether the Senators actually represent "the people" well, the film makes absolutely no effort to show you anything about Rome that is worth preserving. Its citizens are described several times as a "mob." It's leadership spent years on a crusade in Germania that even the emporer said solved nothing. There are no scenes showing citizens who hope for anything better, be it democracy or real leadership or a vision. So what is it, exactly, Maximus wants to save by supporting the Senate? Even Maximus lives so far outside Rome on his nice spread that people call him "The Spaniard." He had never even *been* to Rome! Why should the viewer care who rules Rome?- Maximus is never set up properly as a fighter who could be an amazing gladiator. In the film's initial battle, he rides on a horse against basically a horde of undisciplined neo-Vikings on foot, and attacks from the rear, no less. He manages to survive, but we never see that he has any special skill in battle other than as a leader. From there we suddenly must believe that he can defeat five or more gladiators in a 5 vs. 1 scenario where his opponents have armor and better weapons! How did that happen? There must have been some great training going on in the gladiator school.- The film also never does enough to show Maximum's anger and motivation to meet the new emporer after Maximum's family is slaughtered (no big spoiler; by now you should know his motivation). Is he mourning? Yes. Is he mad? I guess. But he is never seething, or furious, or even apparently taking out his anger on his opponents. He simply kills mechanically, then moves on.- At one point a big deal is made of the fact that to survive in the Roman games, Maximus must "win the crowd." He promptly goes out into the colisseum with his school's fighters and they win, but not with any flair. Yet suddenly the crowd loves Maximus. Should't we have seen some effort on his part to win them over? This scene was especially disappointing because it is Maximus' first face-to-face with the emporer. Yet we see no emotion, no feeling. Just resignation. It was anti-climactic and a letdown.I'm not sure why some people loved this film. Maybe they buy into the honor, loyalty, old soldier thing. I do, too, when I feel it is warranted. In this case, Maximus reminded me of most Kevin Costner characters: He is there, but wooden, and not very sympathetic. Russell Crowe may have played Maximus as too deadened by grief and not motivated enough by life or revenge. Ultimately, I was mostly uninterested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that `Gladiator' was a fine film. However, when deciding which movie should be the golden child of the Oscars for 2000, one should be able to use easily think of better adjectives than simply `fine'. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix both gave very good performances, but, in my humble opinion, they were not quite Oscar worthy. If this movie had come out in 1999, then such a discussion would be completely unnecessary since there were so many fine movies that year (at least relative to 2000). But, because of the overall poor pool last year, a mediocre film such as Gladiator has risen to the top of many peoples' Oscar A-lists. Well, move it to the top of your B-list. Granted there were not many excellent films this year, but there were some. Films such as `Traffic', `Castaway', and `Unbreakable' all had better writing, better acting, and most importantly, more originality. `Gladiator' was a very basic, and at sometimes tedious, storyline, which we have seen countless times. Man gets wronged, he seeks revenge. There was nothing new here, except that the director learned he could shake a camera during fight scenes. The computer generated Rome was of extremely poor quality, and the muddy earth-toned scenery was depressing.To reiterate, it's a fine story, a good action film. But until the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences creates a category `Best Mediocre Film', then there should be no discussion of "Gladiator" as an Oscar contender.</fullReview>

I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I'd seen the full effect.Because this is a BIG movie. And to that end, it's excellent. The sets and costumes are incredible, the characters are well established, and the action scenes are amazing. My only problem with the story was that I think there must have been a better way to explain the main political conflict, as the action literally has to halt in order for the characters to explain what's going on. Other than that, I enjoyed this movie. Although I'm not sure if it'll be up for best picture, it at least gets my honor of the year's most quotable movie."That vexes me.

		<shortDescription>"Gladiator" has got everything a great movie should offer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'd like to mention that I didn't go to the cinema to watch "Gladiator" because I'd thought it was only another high-action spectacle with an oversized hero, set in ancient Rome. However, I'll never forgive myself for that mistake, or will forgive Dreamworks for putting so much emphasis on the no-doubt impressive fight sequences (in fact, the trailers rather deterred me from watching this film earlier). It almost made me miss one of the finest movies that in my opinion has ever been produced.The strength of this film is to my mind the fact that it beautifully combines the action part with a good story, a rich dialogue, beautiful shots (with and without CGI) and, above all, excellent actor performances not only by Russell Crowe's portrayal of the title-hero. Likewise, the movie itself is well-balanced because the hero is counterbalanced by an equally convincing "villain", who is brought to life by an absolutely marvelous piece of acting from Joaquin Phoenix. Of course, there might be some smaller detail that could be improved (though I honestly couldn't put my finger on it), but then, who cares? This movie has got well-developed characters, romance and tragedy, deep-running emotions and sheer violence, touching and intimate dialogues and grandiose views, no one could seriously ask for more in a movie of such scale. In any case, this is most certainly more than films like "Braveheart" and "Titanic" have to offer, plus, in Gladiator you've got a Joaquin Phoenix to admire who alone makes the film worthwhile for everyone who appreciates first-rate acting! (And yes, in case you couldn't have guessed by now,I happen to be a great Phoenix-fan since I first saw the movie on dvd.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of 2000!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see Gladiator on the big screen, and I'm glad I did because it was an experience to remember. I believe this is one of the most brilliantly made films I have ever seen, and I could not point out a single flaw. The cast was exceptional, not least Russell Crowe, moody and magnificent in the title role. Joaquin Phoenix was also utterly believable as the twisted Commodus. I had never heard of Connie Nielsen before, but found she gave a very convincing performance as Lucilla. British fans will not be disappointed either, for an excellent support headed by Oliver Reed and Derek Jacobi adds even more strength and depth.The story itself is powerful enough, helped along by some truly awesome special effects. The view of the Colosseum is so real and yet purely digital, the battle scenes are sometimes gruesome but always breathtaking. Finally, a masterful score by Hans Zimmer gives this film its heart-wrenching edge and brings out every emotion in the brutal tale.Anyone who thought this an over-hyped blockbuster in the way of 'Titanic' is utterly mistaken. It is a masterpiece and historical epic that brings back the true meaning of cinema. I only hope that the Oscars can do it justice, if for once they get it right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rip roaring epic/strong drama/great acting, score and direction/bad script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator-the film about Maximus (Russell Crowe) who, after the newly "elected" emperor (Joaquin Phoenix) kills his family, rises up in an attempt to defeat him. The film contains tons of splattery action, and he-man butchering, but Scott incorporates his brilliance into it, with constant symbolism, and true care for Maximus. With this, we get some of the best thrills I can remember in the past 5 years out of Gladiator's action scenes. Scott also incorporates some great drama, with a compelling and sad scene at the end, a feel for the evil emperor, and the aura of the scenery and its surroundings. The acting, all I can say is...WOW! Russell Crowe, anyone who doesn't appreciate his acting talent should be taken out back and shot. He is amazing! Angry, ferocious, honorable, determined, and seriously p***ed off. Joaquin Phoenix is as good, and almost better. Evil, disgusting, repulsive, but you have sympathy for him, and sometimes he seems relatively normal. Oliver Reed is great, but sadly he died during the film's production. Connie Nielsen is also very good, and Richard Harris, in his small role, is worth praise. Ridley Scott, who is unfortunately getting a little old, directs this film very well, like I've mentioned before, and inserts provoking themes inside the action and angriness. Praise for him. The score! Hans Zimmer did the rip roaring action scenes mostly, and Lisa Gerrard did the chants. This combines to be one of the greatest scores I've ever heard. Sad and heroic. Now that I've honored the other things, let me get mad at the scriptwriters. John Logan I've come to dislike with his idea of good films: dumb football movies (Any Given Sunday), awful horror movies (Bats), and a movie thats extremely good but script isn't (Gladiator). I think Franzoni and Nicholson had a good idea going, and Logan, who (I'm making an assumption) butchered the script with fake lines and totally off historical facts. Moving on to possible Oscar nods: Winner- Best Actor-Crowe/Best Supporting Actor-Phoenix/Best Score-Zimmer,Gerrard Now that I'm done with that, I'll say this: GO SEE IT! YOU'LL LOVE IT! ***1/2 stars out of ****</fullReview>

He is stabbed not hugged to death.Also the term Spaniard wasn't used for at least 500 years after the Roman Empire fell. Spain was still Iberia hence anyone from Iberia would have been called Iberian. It may seem anal to some but they could have at least gotten those facts correct. I realize that Maximus Decimus Meridius is a fictional character and therefore this movie is part fiction but it is also part non-fiction and they could have at least tried to get the facts right.I was disappointed to say the least, DON'T waste your time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big and very exciting, but ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has lots to admire and little to like. Its many plusses ? spectacle, beautiful photography, action galore, superb effects ? create only sporadic involvement. Its popularity may be based on the fact that its defects are overwhelmed by its vast scope. But look behind the on-screen uproar: the hero is an empty symbol, the linear story goes straight as an arrow from event to event, and the tiny amount of real feeling (other than excitement) is introduced artificially. The music seems to belong with another film. Russell Crowe, as the gladiator, is more stolid than heroic. Acting honors go to Joaquin Phoenix as the evil Emperor Commodus. (Accent on the first syllable.) At the climax, the script soars completely out of control, creating the movie's single authentic surprise. The emperor, a deranged weakling, ensuring that he holds every conceivable unfair advantage, pits himself in the arena against Rome's greatest gladiator. Even the delusions of the real Commodus weren't quite that insane, and the vision of Phoenix vs Crowe in the Coliseum is outright ludicrous. Perhaps it isn't possible to make a epic of this scale that can create any emotion beyond a feeling of awe. Possibly many of the defects are in the genre, not in the movie itself. But by all means see it, revel in the spectacular images, and don't think about it too intensely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen Gladiator a number of times, and was greatly impressed with the acting,music and the style of the film, the only let down is the script (too often predictable).However seen seeing the DVD version with all its extra, there was so much deapth that Ridley S. missed out. I think he gotrapped up telling a linear story rather than adding depth.Also my view of J phoenix has also gone up, from when I originally saw Gladiator the first time I thought he over acted. But since seeing the DVD I've changed my mind and he produced a great proformance.Right than Oscars, Russell Crowe- Best Actor J. Phoenix - Best Supporting Actor R Scott Best Director Gladiator Best Film Best Effects and make up Oscar....And by the way O.Reed preformance was his best ever, and I hope he gets a special award.Rob</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Fun, and often unfairly criticized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several people have criticized Gladiator for it`s so called historical inaccuracies. So what? If people want absolute realism, plausibility and accuracy, they should watch a documentary. They should not expect the aforementioned qualities from a fictional feature film, even if it shows events and people that actually existed. What people should concentrate on are the dramatic and technical qualities this film has; The performances are uniformly excellent, particularly Phoenix's. He manages to make the viewer pity as well as hate the character of Commodus. Russell Crowe also turns in yet another fine performance. There is fine support from Connie Nielsen, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Honsou and, above all, the late, great, Oliver Reed. The script, though not the highlight of the film, was in general very good, and the cinematography was marvellous. On the whole, Gladiator is hugely enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure, action and drama. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, Gladiator is not high art. There are huge gaping holes in the screenplay. Much of the story is predictable and some special effects are just plain silly. However, this movie is great escapist fun with magnificent acting especially from Russell Crowe whose towering presence defines the whole film. It is a chance for us to get lost for a little while in a different world. Ridley Scott looks at Ancient Rome with a truly epic vision and shows the horror of the gladiator games with a terrifying reality that is also pure entertainment.Reccomended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that this movie could be one of my favorites, but it has really poor story. It is still the same, good guy, bad guy, pretty woman and some empire between them. Very good special effects but the battle scenes were very fast. What i missed was also some sort of idea, that i could remember longer that one day as it was for example in Besson`s Messenger. The end of the movie recall me antic tragedies, but in some forcible way. But what i really like in this movie was acting of Joaqin Phoenix, he was better than Crowe. And who doesnt like Connie Nielsen is either gay or have not seen The Devil`s advocate. So it is good to see it, but it is not a revolution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favourite film of all time is "Braveheart" and after seeing that like 15 times over the last 2 years, I was really looking for a similar movie in "Gladiator". I have only see this film once and that was in July of 2000 but I will still give my impression of from what I can remember of it - A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.. I was really excited by the first few minutes of the film when the armies of Rome and Germania were preparing for battle. But when the battle commenced, the sound of fire balls and sword clashing was so loud that I wished the scene would end quickly cos it was BURSTING MY EAR DRUMS !! Even the fighting was too fast to enjoy - in Braveheart at least you see men being hacked to pieces in realistic motion !!! After this first scene, I was already given a bad impression of the film, and I was put of from the rest of the film! The story was NEITHER HISTORICAL OR ORIGINAL ( If it was meant to be fictious)..There is ABSOLUTELY NO HUMOUR in this film !!! At least, if a film is fictious then it should at least bring a GIGGLE to the audience ! Just because the Romans were a conquering and tyrannical race of people it does'nt mean they NEVER HAD A LAUGH !!!! And one more point, I did'nt care that Maximus died in the end - in "Braveheart" when William Wallace was beheaded I was almost in tears..and for me that sums up the difference in CLASS between the films !!! I discouraged all my friends and family to go to the cinema to watch it afterwards and save their money. But I still think its good enough to watch on TV.

		<fullReview>I was disappointed by this film. At times I thought I was watching one of those Italian Hercules Steve Reeves films from 60's (the ones that say FINE at the end, but they really weren't that good ;). At other times I thought I was watching BRAVEHEART MEETS THE PATRIOT MEETS SPARTACUS. I was never really drawn in to the Russell Crowe character, in fact, I felt more sympathy for Comodius than Maximus.While the slashing and chopping is entertaining in a sort of WCW way, it seemed contrived and obligatory. As a history lesson it ranks right next to MONTY PYTHON'S SEARCH FOR THE HOLY GRAIL. If I had a choice between films along similar lines like SPARTACUS, BEN HUR, or GLADIATOR, I would definitely see one of the earlier films and skip GLADIATOR.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmm. Gladiator. A tough one, that's for sure.. I'm not exactly sure whether I like it. Sure, I liked it the first time I saw it on airplane to Barbados, but I couldn't really see the picture on the miniscule screen and I was under the impression that the role of Commodus was played by Scottish guy Dougray Scott, partly because of the lighting and partly out of hope that no director in their right mind would cast someone like Joaquin (or Wokeen, I've heard it pronounced) Phoenix in such a necessary role. Anyway, after nine (or a million) times of sitting through this movie I am not exactly impressed much anymore. The scripting is bad, the effects are bad, the actors are worst. I was surprised that more wooden actors like Keanu Reeves and Leo DiCaprio weren't thrown in to make it just that little bit more tedious. The suuposed tension between emperor Commodus and his passive sis Lucilla, played by the miserable Connie Nielsen is drowned out by the increasingly annoying soundtrack and the gratuitous gore factor that spatters the entire set. Russell Crow couldn't get an Oscar if he bribed the panel. Old Wokeen, or let's call him Wok, ruined the cast, with apparently not much effort at all. And we all know that Oliver Reed stole the show anyway so don't argue, OK?! Let's face it. You like it? I think you just hit Wok bottom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Gladiator' (2000) *** ? Out of **** A great film about a man who is forced to kill to get to his family. Russell Crowe plays a man who is supposed to be king but the son of the last king ends up getting the crown by force. Then Russell has to fight as a gladiator to stay alive. He ends up being very good at it and becomes the crowd's favorite. He continues to fight on his way back to his family Russell Crowe does an excellent job playing his role and the special effects in this movie are extreme. The story never shifts directions and the plot is one of a kind. The only reason this film did not get 4 stars is because of the other characters. It is uncertain to the viewer whether they are supposed to like or dislike some of them and that is confusing. It also brought the story down because you cannot decide whether the character is good or bad and you don't know who to support. There is no question to support Russell but every one else is in a gray area. I would recommend this movie to anyone but if you are the slightest bit squeamish don't go see Gladiator because although great it is a very extreme movie. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie was awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen a movie about gladiators since I was a teenager. I have always wondered why don't they make movies about gladiators like they used to. Oh, well when I hear that "Gladiator" was coming up last summer, I thought. That is going to be a hit. I believe that when I read that Ridley Scott (Thelma &amp; Louise, G.I. Jane) was directing it I knew the movie had to be good. I knew nothing about Russell Crowe "Maximus Decimus Meridius," Who is the Gladiator himself, perhaps because his name was not all over the place as it is now, I have movies that I am watching and I go? : Russell Crowe! The movie at hand is romantic, full of good principles and "biceps" combined with great fights. I enjoyed the movie very much. I am trying to leave people's private lives outside their work. I thought that Russell deserved the Golden globe nomination that he has received and wish him the best in his career and private life as well. The Gladiator brought to mind many Biblical Characters, such as David, Saul, and specially Daniel. The movie was awesome! Favorite Scenes: Russell's hands passing through the tall grass. Really cool images. Favorite Quote: Juba: "Can they hear you?" Maximus Decimus Meridius: "Who?" Juba: "Your family. In the after life." Maximus Decimus Meridius: "Oh yes." Juba: "What do you say to them?" Maximus Decimus Meridius: "To my son -- I tell him I will see him again soon. To keep his heels down while riding his horse. To my wife... that is not your business."</fullReview>

The gore content is tastefully done and while brutal it serves it's purpose and is not the focus but rather the motivation for the story.The acting is excellent, Russell Crowe played the role of Gladiator with the necessary reserve, angst and passion needed. Joaquin Phoenix as the Emperor's son was truly distasteful. I loathed his character by the end of the movie more than most characters I can call to mind.

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Movie about Rome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the director and the cast, I was expecting a good action movie, great acting, and a derivative story about our times. As an action movie, it wasn't bad, but not as good as I'd hoped, the acting was fantastic all round (especially Joaquin Phoenix), but I was amazed and gratified that it was mostly a movie about *Roman* themes, not modern ones. It looks to me like the writer understood the Roman concept of Virtue, knew about Roman religion and Stoic philosophy, and Marcus Aurelius' "Meditations".On the downside, there were a lot of minor anachronisms and inaccuracies:1. Stirrups hadn't been invented yet. 2. The Romans used "Greek Fire", not Napalm, and they did not use it much as field artillery. 3. The Romans generally did not use cavalry as a decisive military arm in this period, and certainly not against the germans, who had more and better cavalry. 4. Did the Romans have tigers?! 5. If they did, the tigers would have had elementary big cat training. At one point a tiger decides to chew on Russell Crowe's armor instead of deliver the Killing Bite, or just break his neck with its paw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good movie. I viewed it at home and I imagine it would be even more majestic on the big screen with a tub of popcorn in hand and my shoes sticking to the floor.Russell Crowe is great as Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is very believable as your typical schizo, paranoid Caesar with a flair for incest. I think he drank too much of the Roman water or maybe it was just a case of when in Rome do as the Romans. Hey, you look kinda cute, sis. Richard Harris's character as the old Caesar is a little too soft for me. I realize he is old, but hey, its good to be king. He was a little too touchy feely, but Harris salvages it and reels you in.The look and feel of the movie is awesome and the story is superb. The story reminded me a lot of Braveheart with a few different twists. Braveheart stuck in a different world. Unlike Mel Gibson in Braveheart, Crowe does not give a quick glimpse of his gluteus maximus. I guess that is not his trademark. By the way, in my mind thats a big plus for the movie.I scored this movie an 8. A disappointing 8. Why? Maybe because I was expecting a 9 or maybe even a 10. Why did it not deliver? I expected more true history, I guess. The gladiator's contests were too choreographed. The violence sometimes fit in the movie like hair in your chewing gum. Can't get it out, but it definitely does not belong there. Many of the fights were very good and others were like Jackie Chan and sword meets the gladiator. The one that comes to mind is when Maximus has 2 swords and stabs them into his foe. Not bad, pretty cool, very Romanesque. Then he draws them out, twirls them around and does a double sword decapitation of the poor soul. He must have worked at Beni Hana as a table chef. I was waiting for him to spit some tobacco, go into a back flip followed by a chinese split and remark, "I'll be back". machomus maximus ridiculous! I like the gladiator type fighting in Conan the Barbarian much better. I think when guys fight to the death you may see a little fear, more frantic fighting, and maybe even some biting or spitting and maybe even a little begging. You know, the way you would act if a snake crawled in your bed at night. A fast pace.The tigers were real healthy looking and for some reason I always thought they used lions. The contestants entered the arena very elaborately sometimes and so did the feline carnivores. Maybe thats the way it was; I don't know.Don't get me wrong this is still a very good movie. If you like a little tussle in the coliseum mixed with some emotional stuff then rent it. I may even buy it some day. I say, a big thumbs up, let the movie live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose all the hype surrounding Gladiator really heightened my expectations of the movie but once it has been taken off the big screen it really loses its gloss and power. Movies that stand the test of time are the ones that are still good to watch on the small screen because they contain interesting plot elements/twists and great dialogue. Gladiator contains none of the former and an average amount of the latter. This story was meant to be an action film but contained a lame dull cliche'd ending. No great Roman hordes overthrowing the Corrupt Emperor, really made me and my friends feel short changed and that is difficult to say after sitting through a 140 minute movie. The Special effects were brilliant and its worth a look for them alone but its not a movie I will watch again in a hurry and will not stand the test of time. There were no plot twists, just predictable gladiator fighting scenes and a good battle in the opening scenes between the Roman army and the Germanic peasants. As far as epic movies go Braveheart is better in pretty much every aspect that counts - plot and acting, as well as Bravehearts' battle scenes being less movie-goer friendly and more gruesome and realistic than Gladiators'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I perhaps had too high of expectations for this film. I am a big Russell Crowe fan and the hype surrounding this movie was rather positive. However, whenever you see Ridley Scott's name as director, you should have reservations. I feel that Scott is right up there with Jerry Bruckenheimer in the making of MTV video movies. The stories tend to have some style and little substance. In Gladiator you get that style, but sadly, very little substance. Although Crowe was very good, that is no great feat, Crowe is always good. The problem with this movie was the real lack of supporting players. Phoenix was rather one dimensional and Oliver Reed was dead, literally. Perhaps I am being too negative, the movie is certainly entertaining and worth the rental, but it is not Spartacus, not even close. You want to see some kick butt fighting, check it out, but there are few Oscar clips here. Perhaps I should be more complimentary, it was Ridley Scott!</fullReview>

Why oh why did Scott have to trim off some of the most important scene building moments just to get to the action quicker.

Or for a more modern analogy, it's more along the lines of the grandiose pomposity of the "Titanic" movie or "The Patriot." But it's far from being an important or classic movie in the canon (although admittedly in my opinion there are other duds in the "Top 250" IMDB list, such as "Braveheart" @ #66).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is probably the best blockbuster of the summer. It has grisly and rousing action, wonderful technical direction from Ridley Scott, and masterful performances from Crowe and Pheonix. Flaws always first. The opening battle sequence is confusing, and tries to be chaotic, when it is just incoherent. However, the rest of the film justifies Scott's technical brilliance (more on that later). The screenplay isn't as much a story told with action sequences but a string of action sequences with some connecting thread. However, it allows for some great acting. The script introduces a startling relationship between Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix) and his sister Lucilla (Connie Nelson), giving Pheonix and added dimension to chew through. And does he ever. One of his three films this year, Pheonix proves that he can act in several diverse roles. This will probably garner him on Oscar nomination. His snivelling, ambitious emperor provides a fine foil for Crowe's Maximus. Crowe finally cements his star status with this film, after amazing turns in The Insider and L.A. Confidential. His performance is brutal and intense. In fact, the screenplay spares nothing on his character, giving Crowe several powerful scenes (the climax, his prison conversation with Lucilla, and his earlier conversation with Marcus Aurelius). He'll probably get an oscar nod as well. Now, the direction of Ridley Scott. I am not a huge fan of his, so I was pleased to see him handle both the technical and narrative direction with equal aptitude. His technical direction is superb, ranking with Blade Runner and Alien. For the first (arguably second) time, however, he has paid attention to the story (the first being Thelma and Louise). And it has paid off handsomely. Look for Gladiator to have the most nominations at the academy awards this year (I'm guessing 11).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening scene here is similar to the opening scene in "Saving Private Ryan"..just substitute horses for boats, tunics for fatigues and helmets for..well..really BIG FANCY helmets. Anyway... any time a movie kicks off with a severed head, you know you're in for some rollicking family fun. Even King Arthur takes a break from Camelot to join the party.Seems that Commodus (Phoenix) is the Marcus "W" Aurelius of Rome. He wants his dad's old gig. Dad wants to give the job to workingman's hero Maximus (Crowe). Ergo...bye bye, Pops. Commodus then gets "Braveheart" on Maximus' ass, tearing up his vegetable garden, and his wife and kid. So what we got here is a WWF-worthy death-match type conflict. And away we go.....In the immortal words of Peter Graves in "Airplane".."You like to watch gladiator movies, Timmy?". Well, you could do lots worse than this one. For starters, some neat cinematography courtesy John Mathieson. Djimon Hounsou doing his "noble savage" thing straight outa "Amistad". Derek Jacobi grabbing the "I Claudius" toga for a redux. Oliver Reed in a Moroccan approximation of Fagin. Connie Nielsen looking almost as good as she did in "Devil's Advocate". And Phoenix getting that nasty Jack Palance evil-eye thing down to a tee and pasting it onto a little Nigel Tufnel spoiled-rock-star panache. Hey. What's not to love here?This is a real Dino De Laurentus type old-style epic. A "Spartacus" for x-genners. "Gladiator" is gonna take home a handful of awards for costuming, cinematography and scenic design, which it deserves. Not as certain about the major nominations, but nobody involved with this picture has anything to be ashamed of. Solid entertainment the way mama used to make it. And Crowe gets to go home to Meg Ryan either way...Oscar or not...and that's what I call a win-win situation, kiddies. Saw this one on a big screen TV but if it goes back into theaters before the Oscars, I'll be on line. This has "Panavision" written all over it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator, directed by Ridley Scott, and starring Russell Crowe as Maximus Decimus Meridius, is one of the few movies that touches your heart leaves you with a beautiful vision of a time that has long ago passed by. Starting from the inspirational beginning, depicting Maximus as a leading general during Rome's hard fought battles with Germania, all the way to the face off between Maximus and emperor Commodus, the son of Marcus Aurelius (the last of the so called Five Good Emperors), this film provides the viewer with an entertaining representation of the Roman Empire. Gladiator captures your attention like no other movie in two different ways. Firstly, the highly original gladiatorial battles are very exciting and entertaining. (You will be kept at the tip of your seat. I guarantee it!). Secondly, a great part of the movie is devoted to the development of a wonderful and deeply emotional plot, which makes the ending very appropriate and one-of-a-kind. I would also like to add that, contrary to popular belief, Gladiator hold historical accuracy, in the sense that Commodus indeed was murdered by an athlete. In conclusion, I would like to recommend this movie to everyone! Regardless of your feelings for on-screen violence, I believe that you will enjoy this film. You will walk away with a new appreciation for freedom and family.</fullReview>

This movie came so close to being great but it missed something. Naturally, compared to some of the other flops that came out this year, it's a really good movie. I just didn't feel fulfilled at the end. Sometimes, movies are supposed to make you feel that way, but I don't think Gladiator was supposed to make its viewers leave the theater going "Huh?"

With that established, probably the most fascinating thing about this film is that it plays out almost exactly like _What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?_ for men. The conflict between Phoenix and Crowe for the approval/authority of the father figure (at least on Phoenix's side) parallels very closely with that of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in the earlier film. Seriously. Watch both of them and then try to say that you can't possibly imagine Phoenix breaking out into that creepy "I've Written a Letter to Daddy" song. Ugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In all seriousness, will someone please try to explain to me what is it in this movie, besides the awesome action, that makes it that good. Honestly, I must have seen this movie a solid 7 times, twice in theaters. Every time I go into it trying to find what all the buzz is about. I still don't see it. Mind you, Crowe was great, most of the battle scenes where definitely on point, but why is it so good. What am i supposed to take out of this movie?If you ask me it's overrated, but it could have been much better. The plot lacked as the movie progressed and the final battle was anti-climatic. No one can honestly tell me going into the final battle that they could not predict the outcome. It was by far Maximus's weakest opponent.A pretty good movie, but if you ask me, I'd rather see Braveheart ten times before i watched that movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films, like, EVER!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love, love , love this movie!! I'm not into action flicks, or historical ones but on recommendation from my best friend I watched it. I was amazed. The acting was outstanding, and always under brilliant direction. You were always utterly convinced that Russell Crowe was the good guy and Joaquin Phoenix was utterly evil. The people who say Phoenix is living off his late brother are wrong as his plays the role of Commodus brilliantly. The story is, I admit, the traditional Spartacus/Ben Hur/ every other Roman film story but this didn't make much of difference. I enjoyed every minute, even the fighting which I don't usually like in a film. The special effects used to create the Collseum were outstanding, even without considering all they had was a 50 foot square stand. Everyone I know who has seen this film has enjoyed it. My eleven year old brother loved all ther fightiong and gore and my best mate and I loved the romantic plot line and the well written dialogue. I would sooooo say everyone should see this film. 9/10!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant action sequences, variable philosophising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[There is a spoiler in this review for the first few minutes of the film...]Ridley Scott has made some brilliant action films in his time, including the stunning Alien series and Blade Runner, possibly the most lauded sci-fi pic ever made (at least until The Matrix came along...) In Gladiator, he turns his talents to ancient Rome, and tells the story of Maximus Decimus Meridius, Rome's most respected general who suddenly finds himself an enemy of the state when he refuses to pledge loyalty to the new Caesar, Commodus (well played by Joaquim Phoenix). His family slaughtered and his status destroyed, he is captured as a slave and sold to a gladiator trader...Russell Crowe is the lynchpin in this film - his performance captures the complex loyalty and nobility of the ancient Roman soldier perfectly, while his exceptional poise and good looks ensure that he is the focus of attention throughout the film. He is particularly good when at his fieriest, as when he reveals himself to Commodus in front of the crowds at the Coliseum. His performance is the thing which holds this film together and makes sense of some of its less believable moments.He is well supported by the rest of the cast, in particular Connie Nielsen and Joaquim Phoenix. The action sequences are also stunning, although I lost some of the impact they might have had because I saw the film on video. This is really a big-screen epic and should be enjoyed that way for maximum effect. The stadium sequences are the best bits and there are plenty of them - keep your eyes covered if you are squeamish...So what's missing? Basically the film is at its best when it gets on with being what it is - a mighty fine action movie set in ancient Rome. It disappoints slightly when it tries to be more: some of the dialogue is too Hollywood by half and undermines any serious point the film is trying to make. Furthermore, the characters' relationships are not explored in enough depth to allow the film's philosophising to work, and I personally was relieved when it moved on to the action sequences, which really are riveting. The worst thing of all is that the film is about 25 minutes too long, so that the dramatic tension which would make the film work as a whole is lost because the film is too slow at points.That said, Gladiator is a really entertaining film and well worth watching, in particular to watch the mighty Russell Crowe mature into the fully-fledged superstar he was born to be. He has already proved his acting credentials in LA Confidential and shown the depth of his talent in The Insider - in Gladiator he steps up to the plate and relishes the hero role in magnificent style. It is also nice to see someone trying to recreate the epic genre, and although Scott's film is not perfect, it makes a decent fist of a difficult style. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a year that featured more misses than hits, there were some diamonds in the rough. Among these was Ridley Scott's "Gladiator". "Gladiator" is sort of a departure for Ridley, who usually is into features portraying a dark and depressing future("Alien" "Blade Runner"). Gladiator is a period move, but is not exactly historically accurate-for instance, there was no "Maximus" and Commudus ruled far longer than the span of time in the movie. But regardless of this, it's still a compelling story, pulled off convincingly with excellent performances by Russel Crowe(Maximus) and Waiken Pheonix(Commudius). There are also some nifty battle scenes, particually the Battle of Carthage recreation. I wasn't too big a fan of the Romans vs. the Germans battle at the beginning though-the editing was just a little too strange. But overall, the film is pretty good, and I wouldn't be suprised if it gets nominated for a few Oscars(Especially considering the slim pickings this year)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I decided to see the movie, I had no idea of his impact. I thought it was just one of those blockbusters such as "The Phantom Menace". But I was impressed of Russell Crowe's performance in the Insider, a superb film. So I just went to the cinema, sat back in my chair and let the film overwhelm me. I missed no second of it; it was great. The music, the great pictures, great actors and again a superb Crowe. Some of the scenes were immortal: the moment they entered the arena, the opening scene, ... Maybe it is the most impressive film I've ever seen (yeah even better as Braveheart, my favourite). All right, maybe this film was not historical correct and had not such a great story such as the Godfather but that's of no importance to me. There are other things that make from this movie an all-time classic, just sit back, relax and be impressed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is one of the best films of the year. I hesitated to see this film for a long time for many reasons; however, when I saw it the other night I was thrilled. "Gladiator" is a masterpiece with all the trimmings and is destined to be an instant classic. Also, "Gladiator" is laced with great scenery including the Roman coliseum and enriched with the history of Roman culture. Watching this movie was an experience I will never forget because it is like watching history come alive. Learning about the Roman coliseum, gladiators and life in Rome. The film is so rich with history of these items people do not even have to visit to learn about Rome; nonetheless, if "Gladiator" did one thing it made me want to visit Rome. Gladiator" is an energetic, action packed, drama filled thrill ride which will excite everyone. Two other movies came to mind when I was watching this film. "The Patriot" and "Braveheart" were very similar to "Gladiator" because they all contain unique action sequences, will become classics and all star actors in Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe, who have become major players in Hollywood. "Gladiator" may not win best picture of the year at oscars next year, but it will win over the hearts of viewers when they rent it at their local video stores. I can't wait to let everyone know "Gladiator" has become one of my favorite films. I hope everyone will enjoy it as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Must See" film for guys and a reason to buy a DVD player</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you happen to come across another review of this movie that draws comparisons to other films of the same genre, such as "Spartacus," or "Ben-Hur," I would immediately stop reading it. I strongly believe that a film should be judged on its own merits.If you want to find fault with this movie, there are certainly opportunities to do so, but, in my opinion, this movie is a rare gem with only minor flaws.Regardless of what critics might say, if a film has a lasting emotional and visceral impact on me, then I will strongly recommend it to others.The combination of stunning visuals, a moving musical score, and top-notch acting are the reasons why I ran out to buy the DVD (get the 2-disc set) when it was released. There are few movies that I would want to watch more than one time. Two examples are "Braveheart" and "Boys Don't Cry." Both excellent films, and very moving, but once is more than enough.By contrast, I can never get enough of Russell Crowe ("Maximus") or Ridley Scott (the Director) who are the real stars of this film.Ridley Scott is a genius for transporting the viewer to alien worlds whether they are in the far future ("Blade Runner") or the distant past, as he does here in Gladiator.If you are guy and the opening battle sequence does nothing to get your blood pumping, then you are, as Maximus exhorts his soldiers in that scene "...already dead."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful romp through Rome.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie straight off will not satisfy history buffs or IFC fans. However, it is full of smooth dialogue, great lines and scenery, and tons of emotion. I didn't expect to be wowed, but some things just did it to me. I tried not to like the plot, but was simply overwhelmed by the spectacle. Still I cannot go higher than an 8 due to those plot points. (if you read any of these reviews, you'll know... i'll spare you another list of flaws).However, this is Russell Crowe's film. He oozes dignity, machismo, bravery... he is just 'da man. Now while I'm not a huge Russell Crowe fan, this movie was made for him. He dominates it like a Colossus, overshadowing other roles as simply the coolest character around. His acting wasn't as colorful as some... Commodus was better acted... but he carried the image of the practical soldier who just wants to go home to the hilt. A hero to look up to, which is missing in the modern culture for the most part.In all though, the film was a fantastical romp through the Roman world. Sure it had glaring inaccuracies. Sure it had silly plot leaps. But it was a movie to slam you into your seat and make you watch. A well cooked steak and potatoes kind of movie. I heartily enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thinking about some of the best movies I have seen, perhaps a common element is having a hero, someone who inspires you to be something more. Out of the thousands of movies I have watched I struggle to think of one that has better produced and portrayed a greater hero. "Maximus", a name you will not forget, and a character to live on through the movie ages. Russell Crowe, the man played him with more than enough brilliance to make this character my idol. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I feel I cannot watch this movie and go back to things exactly as they were, because it is a vision into how things can be. Into how you can allow yourself to be. Not a gladiator, but a person of true courage, care, honour and heart. Although I have seen it four times, the memory of how I felt after seeing it the first time is strong enough to know how others may feel seeing it the first time. Just so inspired, perhaps saddened by its drama, but incredibly impacted.This film is just an absolute classic with all the elements a movie can ask for. One of the best soundtracks of all time, some of the best action scenes I have ever seen, and some truly exceptional performances. Yep, thus far it deserves the Oscar as does Russell Crowe, as does Oliver Reed or Richard Harris, as does the music, the costumes etc. But if it doesnt get it then it doesnt matter, because it needs only to be in the reach of my hands, so that when I feel weak, I may switch it on and watch my hero on screen showing how it can be done, and see how movies should be made. This inspired me in many ways and creates so many different moods. This is an all-rounder. I love this movie and it is for others and myself to admire.One of the best ever and my all time favourites, and a thank you to the makers for it.</fullReview>

The acting was very well done as well, not the greatest, but certainly good. I thought the plot was also very good, though there were some shades of Spartacus and many other films I've seen before. However, I found one weak feature, the ending. The last twenty minutes I thought were very weak. It seemed as though the screenwriters didn't know where to go once the end was in sight.

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott attempted to do to sword-and-sandal pictures with this movie what James Cameron did for highfalutin disaster pics with Titanic. In other words, a bombastic, explicit, harrowing, no-holds-barred epic. And succeed the action auteur has.Russell Crowe plays Maximus, a loyal general in the Roman army. The Romans have conquered most of the civilized world, and there is only one outpost remaining. The stolid Maximus and his troops overtake the enemy, earning the grace of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). The dying Emperor calls his general to his bedside and tells him that when he's shuffled off this mortal coil, he wants Maximus to be the "defender of Rome" and the leadership of the empire to go not to his son but back to the long-abandoned Roman Senate. It's quite a radical plan for the Emperor to have, and Maximus, against his own wishes, consents. When the aged Aurelius dies, however, the plan changes. The Emperor's snotty, belligerent son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) assumes command (which is easy, since he's the son and no one else knew of the Emperor's plans) and orders the execution of Maximus. The stunned general is led off, but naturally defeats his captors. He becomes a slave and is eventually sold to Proximus (Oliver Reed, in his final movie) and is forced to fight as a gladiator in arenas for the amusement of the aristocrats (severe shades of Spartacus!). And, of course, he must somehow win his freedom, get the girl (who happens to be Commodus' sister), and avenge the murders of his wife and son, which happened when he was to be executed.Crowe grips his sword with an unyielding passion, gladly taking up the mantle passed to him by such golden-boy icons as Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford. He's been touted as the Next Big Thing for a while now, but he seems like he'll be sticking around. Check him out in L.A. Confidential - or if you're in the mood for mediocre fluff, try Virtuosity with Denzel Washington. But Gladiator is the absolute pinnacle of Crowe's relatively brief career. The Aussie magnificently holds his own as an action star and still finds time to emote properly. (Ah, I'm such a sucker for a good emote!) Those of you who want to see him shirtless, you're in luck - however, in some of the scenes he's buried in some seriously huge and obtrusive armor.Crowe's Maximus is completely loyal to the empire, and it blows his mind that he could go from being so highly respected in the land to being a slave. But this is not a morality tale of how a well-off man must suffer so that he may know the less-fortunate; in fact, there's not much moralizing here (aside from the usual vengeance-shall-be-mine theme). Once he's escaped his executioners, Maximus adopts an attitude of grim determination. He's relentless in his goal - he MUST save Rome. This kind of character development we don't get to see much in action movies, and while the movie is exceptionally well written for such a genre film, it's really Crowe's show. A lesser actor might have grunted and grimaced his way through much of the dialogue, but Crowe was more than up to the task. This was a blockbuster at the box office, and with great reason. This might even be one for the ages. My policy is to never overpraise a film as a "classic" (or, worse yet, "instant classic," as if you only needed to add water), so I'll restrain myself here. The best way to find out if a movie is a classic is to wait 20 years. This way you get a more subjective historical perspective on the film - who's to say that in 20 years we'll think of this film as a nostalgia piece of the early 2000's?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People need to learn some history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all of you who keep complaining about the historical inaccuracies of the battle I suggest one thing. Go beyond, as one commentor put it, the "Junior High version of history". The way that the Roman legions fought while conquering the Italian penninsula in 300-200's BC was not the way they fought from that point on. By the time 300 AD rolled around the legion had been almost completely replaced by cavalry to deal the "barbarian" invaders. This movie was set around 180 AD, so unless you think the romans changed thier entire military approach all at once, don't you think it is possible that there was some evolution in tactics between the Pre-Punic era and then? The static conception of history that these commentors employ is really indicative more of a wish to show thier intelligence than anything else. Different Roman generals fought different ways on different terrain at different times. Was the battle scene fully acurate? The questions itself is sort of stupid, as that battle didn't happen. Is it consistent with the way that Marcus Aurelius' campaigns were handled at that time? To answer that we need to go beyond the simplified view of history that high school history books, and some commentors here, use to dumb down the issue enough for comprehension by children. All of this is beside the point. Movies aren't made to teach history, they are made to tell stories. Therefore, the relative accuracy of the movie is not of as much importance as whether or not the story is being told well. And by well I mean does it evoke strong emotional or cerebral responces in the viewer. For those commentors that think it did not, fine. I happen to disagree, but perhaps I am simply more susceptible to this type of movie (I also liked Braveheart a lot). But this whole vien of criticism that focuses on the historical inaccuracies is for one in some cases simply misinformed, and in all cases only relevant in so far as it enlarges the ego of those commentors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know it's useless complaining about inaccuracies in these historical movies, nobody really cares and if the end results are entertaining all is forgiven. Let's just say, as many others have pointed out, in battles Roman legions just did not fight as depicted here.Technically the movie is poor. Ridley Scott has used his old trick of using muted colors and shooting in murky light to cover the fact that the effects are not very good. It worked in BLADE RUNNER but here it doesn't work at all, and the computerized scenes are very obvious.As always seems to be the case in these historical films the British and Irish garner the acting honors. Derek Jacobi, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed are fine in their roles but Joaquin Phoenix doesn't register in his at all. Connie Nielsen is attractive but doesn't have too much to do.I have never been able to understand the appeal of Russell Crowe. I find his acting range very limited and with his squat physique, pudgy face and shifty eyes he hardly suggests an heroic figure. Useless to say any of that to women however they just do their (smiling slightly) routine. It must be his muscles and deep voice.Some blood and gore in the arena scenes for those that like that sort of thing and no doubt the movie will do a blockbuster rental business but I found it all rather a bore.</fullReview>

However, although I found this film exceedingly long and somewhat boring at points, I do believe I sympathize w/ it's overall message. Its message is although it's centered around the ignorance and inhumanity of Roman pop-culture of the ancient world it's really parodizing and somewhat mocking America's bloodthirsty obsession w/ sex and violence in today's trashy pop-culture. At some points, it plays out like a Shakespearean tragedy. At others it plays out like a John Woo actioner. I do think that Jouquin Phoenix proves himself as an actor, since I've not seen him anything but two small previous roles including 8mm. Otherwise, I do believe that the technology of the times was so fantastic-seeming it's hokey. Overall, I'd recommend the DVD for the fans who'd really enjoy it, since there's another 21/2 hrs of deleted scenes and documentaries on another disc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One must sit back and think a bit after seeing this particular flick of Russell crowe's. what's the question?: "how lucky can u get?" I've been watching Mr. Crowe since he has been on the movie scene and he has always managed to catch my eye in whatever he has been starring...one thing that really helps him is his manly dark voice. It gives him an aura of being in command and that he knows what he's saying &amp; doing.Joaquin plays the evil-doer excellently in this film.His crying was quite believable.He wants what all children want of their fathers but he never gets it..well, at least,not in the way he wanted it. All round applause for all the artistes BUT Russell crowe just does it toooooooo nicely. What a performance!! The dialogues are sooooooooo great &amp; original. when he takes off his mask &amp; reveals himself..that long speech he gives in a definitely sexy tone should be etched in gold. .... "... i will have my vengeance, in this life or the next." ...that must have scared Commodus out of his skirt alright.Mr. Crowe's best movie yet...Ridley scott does a perfect job..standing ovation for him. Truly deserving a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic masterpiece that lives up to the hype.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Gladiator' is one of those rare blockbusters that actually lives up to the hype. Produced in the mold of old fashioned Hollywood epics like Ben-Hur, Cleopatra and Spartacus, this film was every bit as spectacular as they used to make them in the heyday of the studios. With a lavish budget and an eye for detail, director Ridley Scott (`Alien', `Blade Runner', `GI Jane') combines the splendor of ancient Rome (brought to life in stunning detail through awesome, computer generated visual effects) with a human story of gripping intensity, to create one of the most complete entertainment experiences I can remember in quite some time.The story involves the fall from grace of Maximus, a famous general of the Northern Army whom Marcus Aurelius favors over his own son for succession to the throne. When Marcus dies before making this wish known, his son Commodus is elevated and orders Maximus killed. Maximus escapes his executioners, but is taken as a slave and turned into a Gladiator. This sets up a dramatic confrontation between Maximus and Commodus in the Roman Coliseum.This is an ingenious meld of fantasy and reality that plays fast and loose with historical fact. Marcus Aurelius was, in fact, a roman Caesar during the period in question. His portrayal as a kind and thoughtful leader was accurate. He would come to be known historically as the `Philosopher King' and the `Benevolent Dictator'. He was also a great military leader and conqueror. Commodus was altered considerably from historical accounts, but the essence of his evil and egocentric personality was well represented. By historical accounts, Commodus was fair and blond. He was not the sniveling brat who avoided battle as he was portrayed. In fact, he fought by his father's side for the last five years of Marcus Aurelius' life. Nor was he passed over by his father for succession. Marcus was proud of Commodus and named him Caesar at the age of five. He publicly named him as his successor at seventeen.It is universally accepted that Marcus Aurelius died of plague in March of 180 A.D. and not as depicted in the film. There is no historical record of any general named Maximus. Commodus died in a carefully planned coup d'etat, strangled in his bath by a gladiator named Narcissus. This is also at odds with events depicted in the film.Despite these inaccuracies, much of this film maintained a great deal of historical authenticity. Commodus did indeed cease the conquering wars and focused on gaining favor with `the mob', a derisive term used by the Patricians to describe the masses. He would give away food and other gifts and hold extensive games to keep them amused. He was also wildly popular for personally fighting gladiators in the arena, just as depicted. He was a ruthless dictator, who had numerous attempts made on his life, and he routinely had Senators and other enemies executed. His was a reign of terror and debauchery that rivaled that of Caligula.The most impressive feat of historical authenticity was the computer generated views of Ancient Rome. These were done in meticulous detail and consistent with what is know from records and ruins. The costumes were also precise and authentic, as were the battle tactics seen in the opening battle. This film brings Ancient Rome to life in a way that is more realistic than ever before.The story was a cross between the story of Commodus and the story of Spartacus. Spartacus was a roman soldier who deserted and who was taken into slavery, later becoming a gladiator and then the leader of a slave uprising against Rome. (For those who enjoyed `Gladiator' and have never seen `Spartacus' starring Kirk Douglas, I highly recommend that you dig it out of the rental stacks.)This film was a directorial masterpiece. Though the battles were intense, the graphic violence was understated without losing effect. Scott uses strobe photography to intensify the battle scenes rather than showing a great deal of gore. Scott chose to emphasize the human story, binding us to Maximus emotionally through excellent character development. This is a classic struggle of good against evil that turned the viewer into a devoted member of the Roman mob. It is a story that hooks you and doesn't let you go. Scott understood the importance of this and made sure that the human story didn't get lost in the spectacle.The acting was superb. Russell Crowe is becoming bigger than life as a box office attraction, and with good reason. His performance was awesome, offering both physical and emotional prowess. Joaquin Phoenix was also deliciously evil as the self tormented Commodus. This breakout performance for Phoenix is Oscar worthy in a supporting role. At seventy years old, Richard Harris dusted himself off for yet another powerful supporting role as Marcus Aurelius.The sound on the DVD was excellent and it included an entire second disk of extras, including an interesting featurette on the making of the film. It was enjoyable to have an opportunity to see another side of Russell Crowe. He always plays such dour characters that it is fun to see him continually mugging for the camera and telling jokes. It is refreshing to see that after all the fame he has enjoyed, he doesn't take himself at all seriously.This film was off the rating charts. I deducted two points for historical inaccuracies and still gave it a 10/10. They don't make films like this anymore. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first action movie that I can say has satisfied what I was expecting action-wise. From the beginning battle between the Romans and the Germans the action is not the clean, water-off-a-duck`s-back gunfighting, but raw, swordfighting action, showing just what war was like back then. But this is much much more than an action movie. It`s an epic drama about a general, Maximus (great performance by Russell Crowe) who has the favor of the Emperor, more favor from him than the Emperor`s son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix, the enemy who you can feel for and almost sympathize with), who, in jealousy, kill`s his father, kill`s the Maximus` family, and sentences the Maximus to death. Maximus escapes, and then becomes a slave of a former gladiator, who trains him to become a gladiator in a small town gladiator arena. But when Commodus, assuming the empire, re-opens the gladiator games in the Colliseum, Maximus must fight again and again, by order of Commodus, so he`ll be killed. Keep in mind, the fight scenes in Gladiator are the closest to Saving Private Ryan that I`ve ever seen, although nowhere near that gory, and aren`t for the squeamish. And tiger lovers won`t like one scene. But the overall movie is so much better than 90% of the trash that Hollywood belts out. It should be a candidate for Best Picture, and Russell Crowe should win best actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Gladiator in the theater, and loved it. I commented on it on IMDB back in May, 2000. I just purchased a copy on DVD, and noticed that in the beginning, in the moments just before the battle against the German barbarians, that the battle cry the Germans are heard to make, is from the movie Zulu! It is repeated at least one more time during the battle. I'm not complaining, but just thought I'd bring this up(as I just watched the movie Zulu yesterday, also on DVD).Happy hunting!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another decent, but horribly overrated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it with critics? They laud mediocrity, and all too often pan excellence.This movie is an excellent example. No doubt, it is a somewhat watchable film, for the most part. If you want to know what's good about the movie, read one the multitude of idiotic reviews singing this movie's praises.First, I realize some people accept that the film was not historically accurate, but some maintain that it largely is true to the period. The latter point is nonsense. For starters, the film opens with a battle of such historical inaccuracy that it is almost literally laughable (at least chuckle-able). This is spoiler, but not for the plot. If you don't want itty bitty spoilers, skip to the next paragraph and just take me at my word. Okay, here we go: Ridley Scott sacrifices historical accuracy to "spice up" this battle, big time. In five hundred years, a Roman Legion never fought so poorly. If one did, it would have retreated and the general been killed. Let me tell you something every Junior High Social Studies grad should know: Roman Legions (like the Greek Phalanx before it) dominated not because of individual skill, but because of regimented formation combat. Individually, the barbarians were by far the better warriors. The bulk of a legion would get into tight formation, and either advance as a unit or await the enemy advance. As the range closed, the legionnaires would throw their pila (remember those spears the Romans were carrying for no reason in the movie?) at the enemy, then draw their gladius swords. They would remain shoulder-to-shoulder, to give them their advantage. They did not use cavalry or artillery in any major way. I have to ask, why couldn't Scott have shown it as it was? It was just as bloody, and would have actually educated a few people.Ridley Scott is at his worst as a director in this film. It is time he got some psychological help, to conquer his phobia that the audience might actually be able to see what is happening. Must every action scene be either pitch black or featuring a cut every ten frames?This is yet another Hollywood film destroying historical accuracy, and it is only mediocre (in the worst sense of the word). Believe the hype at your own peril.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider myself a movie-goer. I went to see Gladiator and i was just left breathless and wanted to see more. I saw the movie another time at an iMax and recently bought the DVD. I give Gladiator a 5/5 stars. Some people may question my decision. What i hear a lot of the time is that there wasn't enough action. I agree with that to some extent. But i remind those people that this is not supposed to be a pointless shoot and kill, schwarzenneger-type movie (though i enjoy his work too), this is supposed to be a movie about epic proportions which shows the advancement and corruption of Rome and how a Gladiator defied it. That was exactly what i expected, and i was not only not disappionted, i was left breathless. I was sorry to leave the theatre after those amazing 2 and a half hours. Now, i cannot say that the movie was flawless and perfect. There were minor things like Commodos talked too much or the Senate seemed insignificant to him, though they were clearly stating that they weren't. Other than that, i cannot see anything else wrong with the movie. I was also drawn back by Russell Crowe's performance. I was very impressed my The Insider and thought that Russel or anyone else couldn't do better. When i saw Gladiator, I knew that Russel Crowe is a REAL actor and you don't look at the price tag he/she demands to see if they can act. I am now very much anticipated Proof of Life and any other movie that he will star in, no matter how dumb the plot seems. His acting has also gotten better, from Quick and the Dead to LA Confidential to Insider to Gladiator. I expect that this will be rising until the highest possible extent.In other words, if you haven't seen Gladiator or even heard of Russell Crowe, get out of under that rock and go to your nearest video store. You will not be disappointed. That is a guarentee.</fullReview>

If people can't acknowledge that, I think they are very short sighted. I noticed that the biggest criticism received is that this movie has an very unoriginal storyline. Well, in that case most love story movies, cop shows, natural disaster films, and science fiction films are horrible too. Give me a break, ideas are made to be built on, this movie does a spectacular job of a Gladiator story. Just see it, it's worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time i heard about the Gladiator, I thought it would be all action and no story. Although the story wasn't that complicated, it was really compelling to watch. There are some political issues discussed in the movie but do not expect intrigue like in the "I Claudius" series (although Derek Jacobi who played Claudius also stars in "the Gladiator"). The whole movie looked great and reminded me of movies like Spartacus and Ben Hur. The action was very well choreographed and was fun to watch, even if it was a little gory (we have to be realistic: using swords can be a bloody affair). Russel Crow carries the movie. You really feel his pain when his family is killed. Actually the entire cast was good. Hans Zimmer did a excellent job on the musical score. The runtime of the movie is about 155 minutes, and not once when i watched the movie i was bored, the movie is over before you know it. So "The Gladiator" is a movie you have to see at least once in your life.</fullReview>

The film was for me a brilliant balance between great majestic sets and the lives of real people. There was no soft sugar coated heroics here, just ordinary people caught up in moments of history. I found myself really understanding Commodus and his reasons for doing the things he does in the film. The man grew up unloved by a father he seemed to worship, it was bound to mess with his head. The fact is there were no clean-cut bad or good guys, it was just people, surviving, from royalty right down to the slaves, and surviving is was real life is all about.

		<fullReview>While I am sure that among the hundreds of IMdB reviews for this movie there has been mention of this, I would like to note that remarkable similarity between Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR and another movie, Samuel Bronston's 1964 production FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE directed by Anthony Mann.SPOILER ALERTSTRENGTH AND HONORBoth productions share a number of similar attributes. Both films were assembled by a superb production team and directed by consummate craftsmen. Most telling is that both films cover the same historical period with similar story content and themes.Both films open during the final Roman campaign against the Germanic barbarians under Emperor Marcus Auriliuis.Both films have the Emperor selecting a gifted general and long-time associate to become his successor, not his libertine, corrupt son, Commodus.Both films have Marcus Aurelius dying under mysterious circumstances prior to the announcement of succession, and Commodus becoming Emperor, with disastrous consequences for the Empire.Both films have a prior, unspoken relationship existing between the general and Marcus Aurelius's daughter, Lucilla.Both films have the general and Commodus fighting a final, public duel to the death.Both films unapologetically embrace Roman life and culture without reference to pro-Christian themes found in more traditional Hollywood epics.DUST AND SHADOWSWhere these films diverge are on the personal and political levels.Unlike Stephen Boyd's general in FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, General Maximus Decimus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, is a happily married man with a wife and young son that yearns to return home to them following a long, bloody campaign. Their deaths by the new Emperor's order compel Crowe's character to seek revenge against Commodus.Please note that Mel Gibson was initially approached to play the lead role. MAD MAXIMUS, perhaps?Equally significant is that Lucilla has a young son who is threatened by Commodus, which adds the emotional conflict for Maximus.Finally, there is a strongly hint of incest between Commodus and Lucilla in GLADIATOR while FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE embraces a more libertine lifestyle.On the political level, both films address different themes that were appropriate at the time of their release.Both films ask: What is the idea of Rome?For FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, it is the question of inclusiveness of the various races within the Empire as articulated by the late Alec Guinness as the philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius.The meeting of the provisional governors along the Germanic frontier, the Senatorial debates, and the attempted assimilation the conquered Germanic peoples into a greater Roman world are part of this theme. This theme is personified by the slave Timonides played by the late James Mason.Commodus' corruption and destructive policies hastens Rome's eventual decline and dissolution and the onset of a dark age in western civilization.Such themes as inclusiveness are appropriate for the mid-Sixties with the Civil Rights movement, youth protests, and wars of liberation confronting policy-makers.For GLADIATOR, the dying Marcus Aurelius, played by Richard Harris, calls upon Rome to return to its republican, pre-imperial roots. The behind-the-scenes machinations of the reform movement within the Senate are examples of this theme, which is personified by Roman senator Gracchus played by Derek Jacobi.Given a generation that has experienced Watergate, Iran-Contra, and Whitewater, this theme has resonance.Unlike FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE which emphatically state that Roman's demise is inevitable, GLADIATOR suggests that the eventual decay of the Roman Empire is staved off by the timely intervention of reform-minded patriots and a new generation as personified by Lucilla's son.WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO DIE SALUTE YOU!There are of course a number of other areas to praise both films - excellent directions, production values, acting, etc. Will the success of GLADIATOR start a new cycle of epics?Michael Mann has started work on a movie about the epic battle at Thermoylae between the defending Spartans and the invading Persians, with George Clooney being considered for the lead role.In 1962, a film entitled 300 SPARTANS told the same story and starred Richard Egan.History does repeat itself.Special thanks and appreciation to Derek Ely's excellent book EPIC FILM: HISTORY AND LEGEND.</fullReview>

So, when I got home from work the next night, I plopped down on the sofa and spent the next few hours glued to the telly. This movie is AMAZING!!!!!! I watched it, then watched all the special features on the second disc, and ended not getting to bed until about 2 in the morning. Russell Crowe may have been noticed by Hollywood in L.A. Confidential, but this is the movie that made him a STAR. He is amazing, going from strong and forceful Roman General, to showing remorse for his wife and child, accepting his fate as a slave, then realizing that he has a chance to go to Rome and perhaps extract his revenge on the evil Commodus. This is not just a guy movie, as there is alot of emotion in it. Love, loss, happiness, and more... This is now my favorite movie of all time. If you havent seen it, RENT IT AND WATCH IT. If you dont feel the same way I do, well, then... Watch it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked the film for it's spectacle (and for Russell Crowe of course!). I like spectacle films, especially when they're dealing with the Roman Empire. I must remark that "Gladiator" isn't worth much historically spoken. It's 99% fiction and 1% history. Marcus Aurelius was succeeded by his son Commodus and the latter was in fact a hideous man, but he wasn't murdered in the Colosseum by a gladiator who actually was an army general. There are other flaws in the film, but those are based more on historical misunderstandings than on faults by the screenwriters. If you want to read about this, an author named John Kelly wrote an article about this. It appeared in one of our Belgian newspapers, I don't know the original, English title of the article (sorry!). But on the other hand, I don't think it was the meaning of the filmmakers to make a historically correct film. I think it was their meaning to make a great spectacle with massive scenes and they succeeded in that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mighty tale from ancient Rome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Gladiator undeniably on of the most powerful and emotional movies to come out in a long time. The plot in itself is simple, but powerful one and colored by complex personalities and political struggles of Rome. While not attempting to be historically exact, characters for example are taken from actual persons. General Maximus is based on modest Cinccinati of Rome who just wanted to be family man after winning the war. Commodus was a real Roman Emperor actually strangled to death on Colosseum by a gladiator (he liked to fight against gladiators, but gave his opponents swords made of soft lead so he could always win). Acting is excellent, Russel Crowe especially unforgettable as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix is well cast as dreadful but unfortunate Emperor. Good camerawork and warm colors really pump life into Ancient Roman Empire. There are also computer-generated special effects, but they are not used excessively as in some movies (SW: Phantom Menace for example) and merely support storytelling and image of believeable Roman world.On the blood and gore department, Gladiator shows everything that is necessary to the story and doesn't go to extremes like some historical movies.Overall, Gladiator is much more than just a return to spectacles-it's a whole new perspective into an era. A Warm, touching movie with powerful plot and at the same time excellent historical spectacle made with good taste. Highly recommended.My Rating 9/10</fullReview>

This is a Great movie, I would recommend it to anyone. The violence is not that bad for the type of movie it is. There are some scenes that are brutal.

Oh yeah, that's Russell Crowe. That guy is "tuff!" Every scene he's in, he finds a new way to show the audience that he's a hard-ass. It's really funny when I think about it. That I'm writing the 1128th review for a movie that's as harmless as the latest installment in the LAND BEFORE TIME video series. This movie should not be the topic of debate. It matters so little.

Ridley Scott is great like always. I must say I still like "Blade Runner" &amp; "G.I. Jane" better. But Gladiator is still a top rate movie. The movie does have a few slow places.

The story is riveting, thrilling, captivating - yet plausible. It has all the ingredients of the perfect guy movie: a villain that you develop a seething hatred for, and a hero with such courage, strength and conviction that you can't help but feel his every pain, share his every emotion, and admire the hell out of him.

		<fullReview>I actually went to rent another movie, but it was gone, so I went for ?Gladiator' because a friend had recommended it. I didn't really know what to expect ? I didn't really even know what it was about. I started watching it, and after the first scene thought it was just going to be another movie full of violence and gore. I must tell you ? you have to stick with this movie. I recall at one stage, the temptation to go and do something more productive (I know - I'm terrible), but I didn't. I'm very glad I didn't; as it progressed, it got better and better, with a very powerful ending. Maybe it's because I'm not an expert critic on movies, but I don't know what people were talking about; the acting seemed great to me.My advice ? If you haven't seen it, go and rent it now. I'm usually more of a comedy person myself, but even so, I thought ?Gladiator' was truly excellent!</fullReview>

It is a rollercoaster ride from start to finish and will keep you hooked throughout. The sword and sandals epic makes a welcome return to the cinema and I only hope there are more classics to come in the next few years as we saw with the likes of Spartacus and Ben Hur of the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a decade in the wilderness Scott has made a triumphant return with the exciting "Gladiator". I did, admittedly, take a while to get into this but once I got caught up in it I was swept along with the spectacle. Terrifically cast with good, charismatic actors the powerful acting raises this above the level of many recent blockbusters. The battle scenes are exciting and gory (and, interestingly enough, put us in the same position as the blood-thirsty audiences in the colisseum)and counterbalance the film's quieter moments successfully. The storyline is nothing new and there are no hidden depths, but, it is made with such panache that it is hard not to like. Special mention for the touching dedication to Ollie Reed-a real character who brought a bit of colour to our screens and gives a good final performance here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most films are 'quite good'. That, as a critical comment, is applied to the kinds of films that are well-made, thoughtful, etc. Gladiator is not 'quite good'. It is beyond goodness. Watching it, on the first weekend it came out, in a packed cinema and the volume turned up to the max, it actually felt like the Christmas you've always wanted as a child.Russell Crowe is 50% of the reason the film is so great, as he actually makes you believe in, and care about, the character. The other reason it's so good is Ridley Scott; this is easily his best film, by a mile and a half. Buy the soundtrack, DVD, poster...it's the best film of the year, and the best film I've seen since Face/Off (1997).What begins in life, echoes in eternity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie lived up to the hype that accompanied it. The fight scenes and the opening battle scenes were breathtaking and seemed all too real . The vistas of classical Rome were impressive. On the downside I think that Joaquin Phoenix was a mediocre choice for the role of Commodus . He just didn't seem truly evil. Instead he overacted and seemed to be trying to convince the audience of his malice. Crowe's character Maximus lacked direction and conviction and so the movie as a whole lacked a central objective. Instead the individual yet fabulous scenes stole the show. To sweep the Academy Awards like Braveheart did I think that Gladiator needed to become a fuller epic by weaving in more war scenes . As one review mentioned already there is room for a movie depicting the roman legions and their wars. But in this movie the war was a backdrop and it was underutilized. Honourable mention at the awards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't live in the States, so by the time Gladiator got here, I had a fair idea of what to expect - an impressive, well acted, well directed historical spectacle. And since Russell Crowe is had impressed me in the past, I went and saw it. About five minutes in I got a strange feeling that I'll end up disagreeing with the reviews.Wow, did I ever. Let's start with the acting: inconsistent best describes it. Crowe was good, though not up to his L.A Confidential and Insider standard. Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed turned in decent performances as well. Joaquin Pheonix overacted a bit but for the most part I thought he did an okay job. Richard Harris was ridiculous and Connie Nielsen was very pretty, but calling what she did acting would be a stretch. The kid was very annoying. Now, the other problems: Many sequences in the movie were so dark I couldn't see the actors' faces. Obviously not a good thing. Is this meant to convey the darkness of Maximus's predicament? The oppressiveness of the Roman Empire? The treachery of Commodus? I wonder...Still, the biggest problem was the screenplay. A lot of the dialog was plain silly, and I spent much of the movie wondering what motivated some of the characters. The whole thing seemed horribly one dimensional and contrived.Maybe it's just me? Well, I went with four friends, all of us with very different tastes. None of us enjoyed Gladiator, and I think my friend summed it up best when she said she was very impressed, but she doesn't think she liked it.Despite my rather negative opinion, I'm going with a 5/10 on account of the movie's better performances and some nice cinematography. But as for Crowe films, I'll take L.A Confidential any day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see film - but with some flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dont get me wrong - i totally enjoyed this film. It has action, history and love all rolled into one. In other words, passion simply oozes out of the screen at you. However, I felt that the link between the battle scenes at the start and the gladiatorial combats was a bit weak. In fact, the battle scenes were in my eyes far more spectacular than the colluseum scenes. I wanted to find out more about the roman army - i wanted Maximus to continue his campaign. The scenes of the Roman army in combat were so utterly realistic that they took my breath away. I wanted to find out how this army conquered all of europe - hence my dissapointment when it was over after one battle scene.So, the vista is left open for someone to tell the story of the Roman Legions - not about some trivial gorey battle in the Collesium, but about the real life and brutal facts about being in a Roman legion and going out there and conquering the world. That is a story that is still untold, and is waiting for some director to really do it justice.On a final note - Russell Crowe was superb in this film - absolutely brilliant. A long , and Oscar awarded career awaits this guy. Watch out for him...</fullReview>

Maximus tells the emperor he must go home and see his wife and child. Not long after, The Emperor's son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) discovers that his father was planning on letting Maximus take charge of Rome and puts Maximus in the Roman arena, to battle the champion gladiators. And, wouldn't you know it...in the blink of an eye, Maximus has become a hero!Gladiator is an exciting, excellent and breathtaking flick.

		<fullReview>What good is one man to an empire like the Roman Empire. Why should one man be important? The Gladiator answers these questions fairly. With beautiful scope masterfully done by veteran director Ridley Scott, Gladiator forces us into the broken life of Maximus, played very well by Russell Crowe. A commander of the Roman Armies and a surrogate son to a dying Roman Emperor, Maximus just wants to return home. He has seen too much of war.In his humility, he declines his dying Emperor's wishes for him to take the throne, and leaves the boon to the Emperor's spoiled rotten son, Commodus (of which Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour-de-force performance.)Because of his jealousy over his father's love, Commodus is sick with envy over Maximus's importance. In his ignorance, he makes Maximus the main attraction of his new Collusium in Rome, where the warrior, now gladiator, must face death and thrill the crowds -- in turn, making him to be a legend beyond his own Imperial name.With fine acting, a wonderful screenplay and excitement galore, this movie captivates.</fullReview>

Crowe esspecially is a great gladiator/general, his face shows all the hardships one would face in such a trying time. The betrayl of Maximus (Crowe) makes the viewer feel nothing but contempt for the old Emperor's evil son.The rest of the movie aside, the one image from this film that will last is Maximus walking through the long grass fields with his brushing against it. It does bare resemblance to The Thin Red Line in this respect.</fullReview>

I think that Ridley Scott is the cinematic Messaiah, but his needs to see someone about his mental health; from his movies, I'd say he is a little off-kilter upstairs.</fullReview>

Ridley Scott is at his best with this movie, Russell Crowe, along with all of the other actors in Gladiator, gave an outstanding performance. The story is striking and compelling, and the action is just awesome. Also, the music played a big part in making the movie as emotional and moving as it is. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard are amazingly talented artists. I will say it once more, GLADIATOR IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott scores a palpable hit with 'Gladiator'. I've seen it twice now, and know that I will revisit this tale of heroism and integrity for the rest of my life. Musically powerful; photographically virtuosic, 'Gladiator' is a tale told of a man, by a man. Russell Crowe is astounding as Maximus. Richard Harris carries the weight of a waning empire in his eyes. Joaqin Phoenix seethes a rage of Shakespearean, Lear-like proportions. Oliver Reed knows Life, so near to death is he. I'm blessed by this film. Thanks to all of you who performed with Strength and Honor to create it for us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is a story about Maximus Decimus Meridias (Russell Crowe) a general in the Roman army. The emperor chooses him to be the next emperor to follow him instead of his son. Angry, his son, kills the emperor that night and announces that sadly he is now the emperor of Rome, while ordering Maximus to be executed early in the morning so no one will challenge him. But Maximus escapes and races home to try and save his family from the emperor arriving to late and finding his son and wife killed and their house destroyed. As he is recovering he is picked up by a slaver who sells him as a gladiator, Maximus is now forced to fight in the arena and slowly makes his way to Rome where the new emperor has ordered that games will be held. Maximus decides that he will go to Rome and try and find the emperor, fueled by the deaths of his family he will try to kill Commodus, I won't tell you the ending because you should already have seen it and know what happens but i don't what to spoil it for you if you have not. Gladiator has superb action shots and is on of the best I have seen in a long time. Get it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was excellent. I went to the theater expecting a movie more in the line of "The Patriot". In other words, a good popcorn action/war flick, nothing special but still not a bad movie. What I found was a masterpiece. This movie blew me off my feet. The actors were perfectly casted. The storyline was excellent. The acting was some of the most memorable in many years. The special effects were amazing. The Cinematography was perfect. The battles were incredibly realistic and beleivable. Russell Crowe(Maximus) was perfect at playing his role; a Sad Hero. Throughout the movie you are made to believe that all he is trying to do is win his freedom. He has no "save Rome" attitude as I thought he would before I saw the movie. I thought he was going to be a "Rebel" trying to save the people. But what he is, is a man trying to win freedom and revenge against the man(who is the King's Son i.e. the Prince) who slaughtered his family and the king(who happened to be his best friend and the father he never had). By the end he finally wins his freedom.I wont ruin the surprise ending for you. I will say that it is deliciously ironic though. All in all, this movie is flawless and "Awesome" in the true sense of the word! this movie deserves "Best Picture" at the academy awards! And Russell Crowe deserves "Best Actor"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great epic story of Maximus Decimus Meridias, a grand Roman General of the Felix Regiment who decides to take revenge on the Emperor who kills his wife and son. In the movie, except for the first battle, he's almost always a Gladiator, having been taken a slave in Spain. Under the rule of Proximo, the greatest of all Gladiator trainers, Maximus, through the popularity as a great Gladiator, will have his revenge... I simply love this movie. The music, action, story, characters, costumes...everything. I found about 2 mistakes; one being a repeating crossbow which would come 500 years later, and the other a servant named CICERO. This movie will make you laugh, cry, and most of all excite you. A great treat for historians, I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley is back and better than ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the most beautiful action films ever. Ridley Scott uses his skill to put together a film which combines everything that we already hold onto from previous Roman epics, whilst adding new flavour to the genre, making it seem fresh in its style, yet classic its delivery.Russel Crowe puts forward his best performance since 'L.A. Confidential' as a man who takes the position as a General in the fierce Roman army. He works his way through battles until finally his chance to return home has come, only to have it dashed by the wishes of his Emperor and the actions of the Emperor's evil son, played by Joaquin Phoenix. Not only does Crowe give us a chance to see his character's emotional side, but his vengeful side.Joaquin Phoenix gives us a performance that only he could pull off with such precision. He shows Commodus's evil intentions and willingness to take over from his father, but he shows the result of his eagerness as he slowly crumbles under the pressure of his fickle empire. You can't help but hate him, but feel inclined to pity him and his situation.Ridley Scott's first film for quite a while, he uses tricks that made him as famous as he is to bring action and beauty through in such a fantastic blend that the movie shall remain with you for a long time. And the amazing soundtrack from Hans Zimmer only makes it better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend told me I must watch this movie, I'd been meaning to anyway but hadn't got around to it. "I can see you in the lead role!" I was told, not that I would have fitted into Russell Crow's armour.I'd seen the promotions and expected to see a series of gruesome Roman fighting and there was but there was a story as well. Yes it was 'Brave Heart' in a different skirt, but that to is one of my favourites.It was the first time I'd seen Russell Crow but he's definitely on my list to look out for now. He was magnificent and played a powerful lead role when you consider the cast.What a poignant film for Oliver Read to play Proximo his last role, for me the man lived his life to the full even if it was his own way.Richard Harris was excellent in the short part of Marcus Aurelius, (I should spend some time about the real character).Derek Jacobi got out his old Claudian robes to bring the touch of authenticity and I'm sure Joaquin Phoenix studied John Hurt's Caligula before playing such a magnificent role as Commodus, definitely shows promise.I found the story very moving and struggled to maintain my dignity at the end. I'm afraid I get more emotional than most ladies with such sad endings.Worth every penny and if you like a good cry maybe better watched at home with a big box of tissues!

		<shortDescription>It is acceptable but ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is an acceptable film . After a long period of time, it's a good sample for the historical kind in cinema .In "Gladiator" the good men &amp; the bad men are completely distincted, so film takes distance from the bed of the drama which needs characterizing , &amp; pays more attention to narration &amp; showing of a historical story (which is its claimant) .Players are very well , specially "Russell Crowe" &amp; "Joaquin Phoenix" but the battle field in the beginning &amp; gladiatorial races are not as good &amp; as great as previous samples such as "Spartacus" ... or "Brave heart" at all.Perhaps more slow motion scenes in the beginning battle &amp; mean while coliseum races emphasized more on that legendary and epic sequences, the attraction which was created by "Sam Pekin Pah" (in his different films) and used by "Mel Gibson" in "Braveheart" is weak here .It is not important that the story is not adapted completely to history , the admirable object of Cezar Marcus Aurelius (changing the empire to republicity) , the bad character of Commodus , &amp; the goodness of Maximus (and his hate toward Commodus) justifies characters' behavior and the sequence of happenings .Direction (except the rapid speed &amp; distressed mise en scenes used in battle field and some races) is the same as expected from Ridley Scott , cinematography with great longshots and sufficient light (with the help of special effects) makes available the greatness needed for a brilliant historical film , edition meanwhile the film creates the suitable rhythem and prevents the audience from indolence , even mean while the long dialogues with alternating closeups .Music is very effective in creating environment , too . It never disturbs the audience . But , the most remarkable element in "Gladiator" is Russell Crowe &amp; his admirable play , the player who shined with "L.A. Confidential" , equalled to Al Pacino in "The Insider" ... and showed his ability to play any role in "Gladiator" . Russell Crowe is a real star in Hollywood and the world of CINEMA .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How good is the movie Gladiator? Let me count the ways. One, the direction is beautiful. Ridley Scott, who directed Blade Runner, has done an impressive job by creating a gritty dark look much like Saving Private Ryan did. Two, the performances are great. The characters have deep feelings and emotions, and are portrayed beautifully by a great collection of actors. Three, the script and the story sounds like Shakespeare. While it is not, if Shakespeare were to have written a story about a gladiator, it would be this movie. And finally, four, the action makes sense and makes you jump at the same time. This is one of the best movies not only of the year, not only of the decade, but also of all time.Some critics have called it depressing. Well, it is in a way. There is little or no color to the film. Like I said, the cinematography is similar to Saving Private Ryan. The story is also a little depressing, but just about every story ever made is depressing if you think about it. The ending to some people may not seem happy. But, to those of you who have seen the film, the main character Maximus found exactly what he was looking for and wanted so bad.I'm now about to give away the story, but if you have seen the preview you know it anyway. Russell Crowe plays as Maximus, general of Roman's army in Germania. He is the best general in Rome's army and is admired by the emperor as a son. But all Maximus wants is to return home to his wife and son. The emperor's son, Comodeus, is selfish and wants the throne now before his father can hand it over to the senate. As you guess, Comodeus kills his father and blames Maximus for the crime because of his father's love for him. Maximus escapes only to find his wife and son have been assassinated by the new emperor.Maximus is picked up and sold as a slave where he must fight as a gladiator to win food. Here his master learns of Maximus's tragedy and tells how he too was betrayed by the emperor. His master takes Maximus and his other gladiator slaves to Rome to compete in the 180 days of games ceremony set up by the new Caesar.The fight scenes are quick and bloody. Sometimes it is hard to see what is happening. It took me a few minutes to get used to the angles and wild motions of the camera. This is not a movie for children for the blood gets almost unbearable at times. However, fight scenes are not what this movie is about though the trailers may deceive you. This is a movie about redemption, revenge, war, and peace.The thing that impressed me most about Gladiator is how well it is written. The words move as smoothly as the story. The plot reminds me of Shakespeare. A general becomes a slave because of a jealous emperor. The slave who became a gladiator. A gladiator who defied that emperor. And how that gladiator found his revenge. The ending scene reminds me of so many Shakespeare plays its almost funny. As much as I want to tell you about it, I won't. This isn't as much a movie as it is an experience. An experience that no one should miss.By the way, for all you a**holes who gripe about how films like this are unrealistic, well, that isn't why it was made. Few movies are made to be history lessons, and when they are they suck like anything. Realism is important, but historical accuracy is not. This movie is made to be entertaining, and it accomplishes that like no movie I've ever seen.Even if you didn't like it, but it for the fact that it's on two discs; TWO FOR GOD's SAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off let me say that the best way to enjoy this movie is on a big screen, with loud sound. Seeing this movie in the West Edmonton Mall's Silver City theater was perhaps one of the greatest and most involving cinema experiences I have ever had. The deafening roar of the crowd, the clash of steel, and the incredible visuals on a huge screen drew me into the movie like no other film has.Pretty much everything about this movie is amazing from start to finish. My only warning is that some scenes may be a little to brutal or graphic for some people (I know even I cringed a couple of times) and you might be a little careful who you watch this with. Ahh, who cares! The experience'll probably do them good. 9/10 on My Personal Scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator was a superb film and all the cast were excellent. However, it is a pity that the history could not have been more accurate (though Hollywood has improved it's knowledge of weaponry since the epics of the 1950s)!Maximus could never have reached the rank of General because he came from the ranks. Roman Generals were part timers (Senators doing a bit of military service). Also when did you last see a General LEADING his troops? Marlborough, Napoleon, Wellington, Montgomery, Eisenhower, even Stormin' Norman did not take part in the action they simply directed it.Maximus would certainly never have been sold into slavery. Citizens were either banished or given the option to open their veins. Nor would he have had a regimental tattoo.The scenes of the Games were good but I think lions would have been better than tigers. As to balls and chains and those mask like visors - definitely out. The Praetorian Guards uniform was somewhat off as well. Why were they in purple and black? Presumably because these are the cinematic colours of EVIL and VILLAINS. This would explain why poor old Joaquim Phoenix virtually lived in those two colours!One piece of history that was correct. Commodus DID shock Patrician Rome by appearing in the Games. They had stomached (just) Nero's poetry and singing a century earlier but Commodus' antics were going a bit too far. He was killed by a gladiator but he was strangled whilst in his bath. It is suggested that this was at the behest of his mistress who was a covert Christian and wasn't too keen on his treatment of her sect.Great Movie. Great Action. Pity about the History.</fullReview>

There are movies were you dont mind about that, but this is a Ridley Scott film. In his earlier works he has shown how to connect a brilliant story with great visual effects (e.g. Blade runner). I suppose, Scott wanted to make something like the "Ben Hur" of the 21st century, but it isnt. After all, a laudable try to revive this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What have the Romans ever done for us?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, a declaration of interests: as someone with a lifelong interest in the classics and a working knowledge of Latin, there was simply no way that I could have not gone to see this film. The fact that it was by Ridley Scott, one of my favourite directors and a fellow Teessider, was the icing on the cake.Sure enough, he hasn't disappointed. Gladiator is an excellent reinvention of the swords'n'sandals epic, a genre which all but died out decades ago. The plot and dialogue are pretty hackneyed, but Ridley Scott's trademark visuals and some excellent acting raise the game tremendously. The film's two great setpieces - the battle in Germania and the floor of the Colosseum in Rome - are outstandingly well realised by Scott, and the dream sequences (of the afterlife?) add a suitably mystical-melancholic element to the story.Russell Crowe is, we already know, pretty darn good - see LA Confidential for proof - but in Gladiator he has been an absolute revelation. As Maximus, he is a brooding slab of improbably muscled masculinity, causing women to swoon and men to covertly measure their own pecs for comparison. Crowe dominates the film and completely overshadows the rest of the cast, few of whom, admittedly, are really worth mentioning. Poor Oliver Reed, had he lived, would have enjoyed a Travolta-like career comeback for his turn as Proximo, the Don King-with-a-heart gladiator turned fight promoter. The main protagonist, the usurping Emperor Commodus, is played by Joaquin Phoenix as an irritating spoiled brat - something which at first is just irritating but in the end is quite effective. (Having said that, it's also highly inaccurate, as the real Commodus was much older and ruled reasonably competently for more than a decade - but these days who expects authenticity from Hollywood?).All in all, a very enjoyable, if somewhat shallow, film. It's nowhere near the same level as "Spartacus", the greatest Roman epic of them all (although it's rated nearly 80 places higher than that film on the top 250 - come on folks, get real!). Nonetheless, in a summer of very disappointing films Gladiator is a must-see.</fullReview>

But the main difference between these two films is that "The Gladiator" is very approximate in its historical elements while "Spartacus" (as also other films about Rome and,generally, historical arguments)is very accurate. For this reason, I think that Gladiator is a good film, but not a good historical film. There are too many wrong elements. I can give some examples: in the initial battle we see many crossbows which did not exist yet at the time, or the (marvellous, anyway) scene of the Colosseo with all the flags at its top (it was more similar to Wembley Stadium rather than the real monument!!!) and other little things. Oh yeah....another important mistake: the film shows us Rome as a big city,with streets, with many people and around the central city......NOTHING, no streets, no little cities, only some isolated houses somewhere.....that's not true! Maybe, I'm a little bit meticolous, maybe because I love history....but I think it is to pointed out these little mistakes. Anyway, the film is really good and I gave it an 8!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is by far the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life (and i see just about every movie). The film excels in EVERY aspect. The acting is fantastic, the effects are amazing, the directing is marvelous, and the movie is the best. If you like movies and you know good films, then you HAVE to see this movie. It was bloody, filled with action, and sad. I never cry in movies but i found myself just about to cry in this. And the villain!!!! I HATED this guy!!! You really understand Maximus' (Russell Crowe) anger and his yearn for revenge. I can't say anything except "WOW". See this movie!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent fight scenes, excellent plot (wow, a film with a *real* story!) and very long (nearly 3 hours).I believe Russell Crowe was perfectly cast as Maximus. Maximus is a hero with loyalty to his country and to the old caesar, but especially to his family. He has the loyalty of his army behind him so is adored by just about everybody.Commodus, the whining, cringing, cowardly git was played well by Joaquin Phoenix. As was his sister. She came across to me as being the real emperor of Rome, while her brother was really a whimpering SOB.What beautiful scenery! Computer effects of Rome was eye candy to behold! See computer-animated tigers and blood! The fight scenes were not as gory as I expected. I have seen far worse! Some of these fight scenes, especially the ones which take place in the Colliseum in Rome, are quite spectacular. Shows how the blood thirsty citizens of ancient Rome love to be entertained... (much like todays' blood thirsty movie audiences who love to be entertained by trash like... dare I say... Hollow Man!!!)CONCLUSION: This film is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic classic along the lines of Braveheart and Spartacus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley has created nothing short of a masterpiece with Gladiator. Russell Crowe was incredible as Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix was an excellent villain.Historically, the film was surprisingly accurate. It is not so, as I have seen elsewhere here, that the film portrays Rome as a great patriarch. Marcus Aurelius was the last of the five good emperors, and he did much for Rome in his reign of twenty-plus years. He did die on the battlefield in Germania in 180 AD, most likely of the plague. Commodus was a twisted man who reigned for 12 years. He kept a harem of 300 boys and 300 women. The film does well to portray this - obviously, there is no historically prominent Maximus to take from.The battle scenes and the plot are incredible - I have no qualms with either of them throughout the course of the film. It's more or less a perfect balance between plot development and character development. Either way, the films leaves you spellbound - in 2 hours and 40 minutes I did not look at my watch once.Perhaps most importantly is the fact that Gladiator did so well based on plot alone. Unlike many other popular films, Gladiator placed absolutely zero emphasis on sex. Where would American Beauty have been without a young naked girl? Where would Titanic have been without the legions of 10-16 year old girls shelling out their allowance? (Both aforementioned films come absolutely nowhere near Gladiator.)Again, a salute and a flying 10 to Gladiator. If you haven't seen it, do so as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to take issue with the previous viewer and, for once, align myself with the conventional wisdom on this film; i.e., that it's a keeper. Especially compared with the slick, technology-infatuated, sex-and-violence saturated dreck coming out of Hollywood (not that this movie does not have its share of violence and gore, but always in context and never, in my view, gratuitous) it is refreshing to have a historical film with sweep and grandeur about real characters with some depth. I found Gladiator thoroughly engrossing and beautifully made, although historically it shares some of the fictions of its predecessor The Fall of the Roman Empire ('64) - e.g. that Marcus Aurelius was a patricide (not true) - although to my thinking it is a far superior movie in every respect. Russell Crowe is simply super here - he deserves a Best Actor nomination, no question. My only quibble is that the movie deserved a grander score - John Williams was needed for this one. But all in all, a great show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We need more Roman Epics these days!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's Gladiator is an excellent portrayal of a hero, and a very good film. The opening sequence was just fantastic and the battle/fight scenes were cleverly choreographed.This is a story about good versus evil but it is told so well. Russell is excellent as the hero, General Maximus Decimus Berilus, and Joaquin Pheonix plays the villain, Commodus, exceedly well. His character wasn't over-the-top evil, he had emotion, and his hate seemed to stem from his resentment of his father and Maximus. Don't get me wrong, Commodus was evil but there was a great contrast of his wanting to be loved and accepted, and his suspicion of the people surrounding him. This made for excellent story-telling and added depth to Commodus!It was great to see Richard Harris in Gladiator as Marcus Aurelius. Actually the whole cast was brilliant but it was truly Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott's film! Russell Crowe manages to portray Maximus' stern loyalty and strong sense of justice with ease. We admire Maximus and loathe Commodus- both Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix become the characters. This is an great film and well worth seeing! All I can say is, they should have more Roman Epics. And this film has got enough action and drama to entertain, and with performances and direction to match! Although this is not Ridley Scott's best film (it comes pretty close though) - it certainly adds quality and variety to his resume. Great Stuff, **** out of *****!</fullReview>

It then started to drift with the appearance of the hammed up Commodus. We then enter fabtasyland for a short while while Maximus rides from Germany to Spain and is then captured by slavers in the middle of civilised Rome and taken to Morocco. mmm.Proximo is a great character played by Oliver Reed, but then we get to a series of difficult to appreciate gladiatorial combats that frankly had little entertainment value and were gratuitous.Not that they were't authentic, just that they had little cinematic value.The film then drags on for ages and eventually the almost Goth-punk Emperor fights Maximus in the arena and is killed. ho hum, I was begging for the film to end by now..Now why should this film, which is quite authentic, not implausible and both modern and Roman in morality, be disliked by me so much?I can only echo Ebert that the film is dark, dull, morbid and has no flair. I watched Spartacus on the TV last night, and that is a much better film.Watch that and see what you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was in Rome last year I was quite moved by the visit of the Coliseum. As I had a look at the huge circus and the open basement, I could really imagine it in its glorious days full of shouting people on the rows of seats, Cesar in the tribune, and gladiators preparing themselves for the fight.I hoped Ridley Scott's movie would bring this excitement back and I am not disappointed. Roman way of life displayed in the movie is quite believable. It is a long way from old peplum movies which didn't care much for historical accuracy. However, this search for accuracy is restricted to environment and real events are altered according to the needs of the scenario. This is a bit frustrating and prompts me to refresh my student's memories.In spite of this frustration I like the movie as a whole. Good actors playing believable characters and amazing fight scenes keep in suspense until the end.Sorry for my poor English which doesn't allow me to develop my opinion as completely as I wish ! To summarize, I recommend the movie.</fullReview>

Both of them are simple men (one is a peasant and other is a school teacher)caught in jaws of war, dreaming of returning home. Both are great leaders, ruthless and emotionles in combat, caring their pain deep inside. Both have loyal and charismatic crew around them. Both of them have their noble cause, worth dying for. And their faith is the same.Beside similarity of the main characters. The plot is the same. Both our heroes were betrayed by their superiors and sent on suicidal missions. Maximus didn't became gladiator because his emperor wanted that, but he was pushed into that situation by him. In both movies we can see the best scenes of combat in first 10 minutes. Combat scenes were done with same technique and they too look alike There are many more similarities between these two movies</fullReview>

The picture could easily have fallen into a simple revenge story, which is how the advertisements seem to portray it, but along the way the hero realizes that revenge does not provide enough sustenance to propel him indefinitely. In the end it is his altruistic vision of the ideal of Rome that allows him to fulfil his quest. This is the kind of patriotic hero that has been missing in the movies for so long considering the cynicism of the last decade. Especially compared to the recent "The Patriot" (which is, in the end, simply a revenge story) this is a movie with a hero to be celebrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is the price for freedom? Once I read about a Jewish concentration camp prisoner who is survived fully, because he is able to free himself inside the camp. Freedom from the fear and mental tortures in which he received during his 3 years of imprisonment. Physical tortures and isolation is better compared to mental and thought imprisonment. Nelson Mandela once said 'They can kept me away, but the will not kept away my thoughts and ideas' Maximus Decimus Meridius (if I'm not mistaken), a top rate Roman general, is offered a choice between coming home to his family Spain or take another duty in Rome. He cannot say no and half heartedly decide to rule Rome and stand up for the people and the republic for the glory of the Roman Empire. A condition which was changed by the corrupt politicians and tyrants. Alas, the Empire died and replaced by his son, a disfunctional characters longing for love and acceptance from his father, the last Caesar. Maximus overuled the Caesar and deserted until he was stranded at the gladiator arena. And we are dealing with the imperfect characters; Maximus who is imprisoned by his own rage and pain towards his family, Caesar who is imprisoned by his own fear and hunger for love, his sister who is trapped in her fear and love towards his brother and son and in between good and evil. The audience was placed perfectly in the screen. From the magnificent opening, the barbarian and bloody fights in the collosseum, through many colossal acts and supportive CGI. Russel Crowe (Virtuosity, the Quick and the Dead, the Insider), the humble hero arise not because he is well built like Arnold or with Bruce Willis sinister look. It's because he is merely integrated with the casts and the atmosphere built by the talented movie crews. And so the Gladiator arise, towards the fight for the freedom. A freedom more than just physical, which asks us about how we're dealing towards our own imprisonment. Freedom from fear, hate, anything. Destined to be another Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Black Rain, Alien, Thelma &amp; Louise) masterpiece, the movie itself speaks with the same ambience like his previous movies. So typical and make us stop and think after the movie ends...</fullReview>

One of my friends, who styles himself as a Roman history buff, was sure that the movie would stretch the truth in favor of entertainment value. Sure he would grumble the whole movie, the rest of us drew straws as to which would have to sit next to him opening night, and it was of course me. He grumbled all the way there, but once the movie started, he was silent the whole time. He found stuff he could nitpick after it was over, but while the movie was rolling he was in as much a state of awe as the rest of us. This is undoubtedly one of the best movies I have ever seen, enough so that I saw it three times in theatre. I seldom see movies multiple times, exceptions being Jurassic Park(4 times), Independence Day (2 times), and the Matrix (2 times). I usually love science fiction movies beyond all others, but I can say I enjoyed this movie more than any sci-fi blockbuster I've ever been too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see a Spanish language version of this just for the sheer pleasure of seeing Russell Crowe speak Espanol but unlike the French version this one was in English and subtitled in Spanish.Well, I have to admit this comfortably sized epic moved me. despite the battles, combat and crowd scenes the focus is on Maximus and his emotions as he goes from General to slave to slave-gladiator, losing his family in the process. He is up against Commodus, who unfortunately occupies City Hall, which as everybody knows is hard to beat. After Maximus loses his position at the start, avoiding death only through outwitting his executioners)he seeks revenge not just for himself and his family, but for the ideals of his late boss, Marcus Aurelius, emporer turned republican, who had chosen Maximus as his successor but miscalculated what his son Commodus would do when he found out.So what we get is a rather intellectual sword and slash movie, with good production values and an engrossing story. I couldnt help thinking that even a Roman crowd would blanch at the one-sided battles in the ring. No-one would bet, yet the bookies are shown as very active. The slashing is pretty graphic and its not clear how anyone would last five minutes, let alone be able to retire as Oliver Reeds character did to beome a manager. But the end was moving.As to historical accuracy. Im told by a real expert on the period that some of the characters are historically accurate (Marcus Aurelius, Lydia and Commodus (to some extent). There was a Maximus but little is known about him. Well so what? He enjoyed the show and so did I. Russ Crowe is definitive, Joquaim Phoenix as Commodus is a bit of a ponce but good at the evil bits. Richard Harris did a subdued Marcus Aurelius and I think we have to say Oliver Reed died a good death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting the film that I actually saw when I went to see Gladiator. Yes there was lots of violence, yes there were big name stars and yes there was unrealistic dialogue. But what I hadn't anticipated was, plenty of atmosphere, an absorbing story and not over the top acting (well not a lot). I have read some of the negative reviews and they seem too heavily based on the story being unrealistic, "could not have possibly happened", too violent or not violent enough, "nothing like Spartacus". At least they are trying to make films like Spartacus which had more attention grabbing actors than you can shake a stick at. It would be difficult to say I enjoyed the film as it was a sad story in all where the happy ending was really not that happy. It started with violence and ended with violence. But I can honestly say, I was glued to the screen, thought the soundtrack was superb and believed I was there in every scene. Russell Crowe was made for Maximus although Oliver Reed seemed a bit lost in his part. I would recommend everyone to go and see it for themselves and enjoy it for what it is ....a STORY.</fullReview>

Gladiator is a wonderful piece of storytelling which paints a simple story very profoundly using all the tools available to the modern film-maker.I thought the acting was terrific, and Russell Crowe is wondrous in the role of Maximus, a man of courage and honour. We can all share his pain as he fights for justice for his family and for Rome. Maximus is a real hero who does what he has to do, not for personal glory or for wealth. Joaquin Phoenix plays Commodus very well, at times you even sympathise for the spoilt brat. But this film belongs to Crowe, I can honestly not remember a movie where a central performance has been so guaranteed to catapult the actor to mega-stardom.This is the type of movie cinemas were made for. Take off your cycnic hat and go and see a film that tells the kind of story that made your ancestors believe in real heroes.Every other summer movie judged against this just pales.

		<shortDescription>A special film for one odd reason...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Detractors claim this film is a hollow entry in the Roman gladiator genre for the most pedantic of reasons. Nothing could be further from the truth. This film is one of the greatest ever made because it has the power to move people, specifically myself. I don't mean just move me in the same way that Robocop or the Star Wars saga move me by making me see aspects of my past and how I would ideally change them. I mean that Gladiator moves me by making me look at the details of a life that was, and still is to some extent, slowly dragging me down and making me abandon life altogether, and motivating me to make a commitment in the way I deal with it.That commitment? Like Maximus, I realised that I am not ready for my life to be over until I have made something more of it. Maximus could not die until he had transcended the way in which Commodus had victimized him, and liberated Rome from Commodus' inferiority complex that masqueraded as a dictatorship. As I saw this unfold on the screen in front of me, I took the death of my fiancee and the abuse of my past and saw that the future was not set, and I could still make my life something worth living.This alone justifies Gladiator's place in the 250 best films of all time, in spite of its relatively miniscule flaws. Before I die, I want to shake Russell Crowe's hand. His performance as Maximus reduced me to a tearful wreck, and at the same time moved me to do something nothing else could move me to do: let go and move on. I will always owe Crowe and Scott a huge debt for this film, which means more to me than any film I have seen before (more than five thousand, so don't bother arguing with me about it) or probably will in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool and Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Basic plot: Maximus, a powerful general is loved by the aging Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who appoints maximus to be the next emperor, but his jealous son Commodus murders his father so he can be emperor and keep Maximus off power. He then kills Maximus's family and sells maxi to Africa as a gladiator, where he is taken by Proximo to Rome,where he becomes popular and vows revenge on the corrupt Commodus.The praise:Very well-made. The battle scenes are exciting ,outrageous , exotic and gloriously action-packed , and a feast for the eye. Actually the entire movie is a great eye feast ,with classic sets and cinematography. It also has great suspense ,deviously larger than life dialogue,plot and acting, all leading to a climax that will make you cry.Russel Crowe is an icon, brilliant in a good role, he, in his armor out on the battlefield, under the sun ,with the crowd cheering. A larger than life movie.The flaws: A few slow sections along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film that was a pleasant surprise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't going to see this movie, the ad campaign just didn't draw me in. About a week after it's debut, my friend treated me to this movie and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. It had a great story and the action in this movie was just perfect. I remember just being filled with great excitement whenever a Gladiator fight broke out. I really liked Russell Crowe in this film, an actor I didn't even know existed until this movie was released. I like how they make the bad guy Comodus so maniacally insane in some aspects that you kind of pity him, yet you know he is nothing but a brat and needs his just due. I recommend Gladiator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remarkable Epic, and the best in it's genre......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a success on so many levels. It's a wonderful epic, an intense action/adventure, a touching story of redemption, loss and betrayl, and an all-around rousing entertainment with glorious scenery and atmosphere. Though it's clear that digital computer effects play a part in serving the scenery, it doesn't take away from the enjoyment. In fact, it enhances it. The performances are top notch, particularly from that of Russell Crowe and Joaquin Pheonix, who is deliciously diabolical as the villian. The battle scenes are simply some of the best ever created for cinema, ranking in the same league as Braveheart. This and M:I-2 are the year's best offerings so far, and by far the best films of the summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film of 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my book, no film of 1999 deserved 4 stars. Three Kings, The Insider and American Beauty all got close, but not since Saving Private Ryan, two years ago, has a movie recieved four stars from my critical perspective. Ridley Scott's "Gladiator" is the real deal. Love, passion, action, emotion, and excitement put together one hell of a potpourri to make this the most unique and well-done movie of 2000, and will remain that way. The first time I saw it was opening weekend, and I was not as impressed then as I am now. The first time it was great, but I felt like I just witnessed a bad car accident. The brutality of this movie (Roman behavior and lifestyle) overshadowed my enjoyment of it. The second time, was much better, and the third which I just watched, was nothing short of amazing! Russell Crowe is a bigger bad-ass than William Wallace, and though this movie is not AS good as Braveheart, it is just as enjoyable and unforgettable! Hopefully in March, we'll see Scott and Crowe accepting Oscars for Best Picture/Best Actor-something that is most definitely deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Russell Crowe gives another great performance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is an awesome movie with an awesome cast and an awesome director. Starring Russell Crowe in one of his better roles, Gladiator combines the blood/violence of Saving Private Ryan, the story of a Ben-Hur type deal and grand acting to create a web of decite, lies, fights, and death.Russell Crowe is a well respected general - Maximus. The beginning is like Saving Private Ryan, where the barbarians and the Roman fight each other until one of the sides happens to fall, (the barbarian Germans.) Maximus, after the battle, meets with the emperor who tells him that he is dying and giving the empire to his control. When the emperor's son hears the news, he tries to do all he can do to get the crown (played by Joaquin Pheonix.)In order to gain control, the emperor's son takes the lives of Maximus's son and wife. Maximus becomes a slave/gladiator and learns from one of the best gladiators of all time to regain his freedom - he has to win the spectators before he can win the emperor. Later in the story, Maximus meets up with the new emperor in the Colloseum and the story goes from there.Russell Crowe gives another Academy Award worthy performance. Gladiator is one of the best films of the new millennium!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, Gladiator is the best movie of the year so far. It doesn't bring back the Rome epic, it redefines it. CGI has allowed Ridley Scott to show Ancient Rome as it truly was. Gladiator also has more than just special effects. It has a riveting story of revenge, amazing acting performances, and great action. The action is not as plentiful as in Armageddon, but the scenes do come and they are amazing. Breathtaking cinematography, and an epic as well as solemn musical score help Ridley Scott's grand vision. I predict best actor nomination for Russel Crowe, as well as best supporting actor nomination for Joaquin Phoenix. Go see this movie. NOW!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Words cannot do this movie justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Gladiator fully expecting to be completely bored out of my mind. Instead I came out of the movie with a new all-time favorite. I can't decide where to start on what I liked most. The acting was absolutely brilliant. I have a great amount of respect for Russell Crowe now, due to the strength and compassion he put into this film. However, I feel that Joaquin Phoenix did the best job in acting. He took a character that could have been one huge cliche, and turned him into a sadistic and cruel villian that you actually had a reason to despise.This preformance alone has turned me into a huge fan. All people involved in this film are deserving of any awards they might receive. The manner in which the film was shot was breath-taking. From Germanian forests to Rome, the scenery in this film is amazing. I am also a huge fan of the soundtrack. Rarely has a soundtrack nearly brought me to tears, but this one does almost any time I hear it. Listening to it alone brings back emotions that I've never felt listening to a soundtrack. It's about time that there is a film out there now that makes you want to cheer for the hero, hiss at the villian and see the movie over and over again. Hopefully Hollywood will follow suit with more films like this in the near future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This majestic movie is a joy to watch and illustrates how good a director Ridley Scott can be with the right material which he has in spades here.A throwback to the times when movies like this were the rule rather than the exception GLADIATOR stands proudly alongside the likes of BEN HUR and SPARTACUS;Russell Crowe pole-vaults to mega-stardom as the unstoppable Maximus and it will be interesting to see in which direction his career heads from here. This film was a considerable hit in Britain where audiences responded strongly to Crowe's undoubted charismatic masculinity,interesting in a country whose government seems hell bent on removing all traces of that admirable trait by spear-heading controversial bills and reforms which the people are overwhelmingly against.This is to digress,however,and this great movie should be seen and enjoyed by any red-blooded viewers who revel in fights,fights and more fights.GLADIATOR is the first truly epic movie of the 21st century,do not cultivate the friendship of anyone who says otherwise for they are not to be trusted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most disappointing films I've seen in awhile. I'm a huge fan of Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe, unfortunately their collaboration on this film resulted in an extremely boring film with drab cinematography and no heart. I will admit the opening battle scene is pretty impressive, and all the other battle scenes are above average. Everything in between is mind numbingly boring, the plot was like something out of the Street Fighter games I played as a kid.With an epic film of such scope like this I expected at least some nice cinematography, but it was dark, and uninteresting. The CGI collisium was equally disappointing, it looked like a model out of a computer game and like Roger Ebert pointed out, the fans in the stands were blurry. Ben-Hur or Spartacus were a lot better at giving you that feeling of being in acienct Rome and just sucking you into their world, this movie left me feeling distant from everything that was happening on screen.Although Russell Crowe gives a respectable performance as Maximus, all the characters were uninteresting. I didn't feel anything for any of them and when the emperor was finally killed I was just happy the movie was almost over. If the relationship between Maximus and his family had been more fleshed out I might've felt some more sympathy for him, but when he kissed commodus' sister, all sympathy i had for him disappeared.I think one of the reasons the movie is so popular might have to do with the fact that although there are long boring scenes, you quickly forget about them when people start getting their heads chopped off. It's unfortunate when a movie like this comes out and immediately catapults up to #59 on the user top 250 when films like The Thin Red Line aren't even on the list. Go rent Spartacus for a better film set in ancient Rome.**/***** 2 stars out of five</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I Claudius" meets "Ben Hur"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best parts in this movie are the action scenes. Not only are they expertly done, most of the violence is not graphic but inferred by clever use of sound effects. But, alas, there's a story. It's a variation on the much used "evil twin" formula, which for some strange reason brings to mind Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. It's not always believable, the characters are almost cardboard-like, and the dialogues sometimes range between formula and pretentious. The movie moves sluggishly between the action scenes, and seems to jumpstart each time. In short, it's not a bad movie, only it should (and could) have been much better, shorter and fast-paced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of honor, strength, faith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The element that most impressed me in this film was the underlying faith of Maximus through his many long weary years of trials. One could argue that at a certain point revenge took over as his motivation (in this case, the presentation made the viewers hope for revenge also, as a reasonable response to a Hitler-like figure). I saw revenge as the primary motivator in the Patriot, and it sickened me; in this film I see the death of a dangerous and hated leader as a goal, but not as a driving force. The driving force for Maximus, it seems to me, is to be faithful to a much larger calling. As he puts it at one point, "What we do in life echoes into eternity." It is clear that he strongly believes that he will, in the afterlife, walk with joy with his wife and family by his side, if he stays true, maintains integrity, strength, honor, and principle. In this sense I found the film to be much more uplifting than The Patriot, though in many elements the films were quite similar. Both achieved a scope of grandeur that was unbelievable, both had strong central characters who fight against all odds. But I found one film uplifting, the other depressing, and I think it had to do with the underlying motivations of the characters. Gladiator made me want to emulate Maximus; The Patriot made me hope to never become like Benjamin Martin.Both, though, admirably showed the grit of war without romanticizing it in the least. That seems to be a trend (like Private Ryan) that I greatly appreciate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The second time it's even better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the Gladiator twice and it was even better the second time (which says all about the film). The parallels to Ben Hur (another of my favorites) are extremely strong: the good guy vs. the bad guy, both important persons, both of the same age, the goodlooking but not flashy hero of unwaivering moral integrity, who never lets fury get the better of him (even if provoked), who loses everything he has in life (both lose their family, both lose their status, both become slaves) but nevertheless regains happiness (Ben Hur not only finds his sister and mother but also christian faith, Maximus meets his wife and son after death, another reminder of christian faith.) For all these common aspects, Russell Crowe gives Maximus enough personality to create an entirely new hero.I think the plot is well written, the story intense, the shooting and the computer graphics great. 2 1/2 hrs pass like nothing. I especially appreciated the lack of the nowadays nearly inevitable (but in most cases not only superfluous but also boring) sex-scenes and the happy end that left Maximus with his family and not (out of character) with a new (or old) love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GIVE THEM "BREAD AND CIRCUS"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rome, just like any other empire (British, Soviet and American, etc.), was bent as seeing itself as enlightening a dark world, even if attained by savage conquering. Therefore, historically speaking, it's hard to see these folks as the proverbial "good guys" in some kind of morality play.That said, director Ridley Scott does deliver to us a pretty good movie. I found the performances adequate, yet still couldn't help see Russell Crowe's character (Maximus) as the L.A. CONFIDENTIAL detective character suited up in armor. The same brooding performance. Maximus, for a Roman General, is the typical Hollywood antihero. (Hey...let's mow these Huns down, so I can call it a day, and get home to the wife and kid.) This is hardly original. I've seen better work of his, in such films as the mentioned L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, THE SUM OF US and ROMPER STOMPER. His main antogonist, is the emperor's son, Commodus, played bewilderingly off-the-box by Joaquin Phoenix. The guy is a walking-talking Freudian slip, whom anyone with an ounce of sense wouldn't let him watch a hardware store for an afternoon, let alone an empire. The contrasts between the two leading characters was simply too obvious and simplistic. I frankly saw too much of a parallel in the script, with the relationship of Marcus Aurelius, Maximus, Commodus and Lucilla. It was like this part was lifted from THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. It reminded me of the old Red Skelton quip: "Impersonation isn't the sincerest form of flattery...it's plagiarism!" Well, not as bad as all that, but the screenplay was hardly original, as well. A nice touch, was adding a few older veteran actors (namely Richard Harris and the late Oliver Reed, who gives an excellent turn to his character "PROXIMO"). The battle scenes and the brutal gladiator fights were stunning in their horrible brutality. Serious kudos for not flinching about the awful truths of human carnage. Top marks in this catagory. The computer generated effects have been well mentioned for their disapointing results, by other reviews, so I need not mention them here. Overall, rather overrated, but still generally entertaining fare if you're not looking for something too deep. A classic on the level of SPARTACUS? Hardly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott is back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several context to this movie: the art of war, the struggle for power in an impossibly large empire and the visual grandeur of the ancient Rome. Ridley Scott has put the emphasis on the visual and on the use of power and the use of the masses to sustain and control this power. Very clever, and "Gladiator" is an exceptionally powerful film, albeit a bit overlong and even slow at some points.The visuals are fantastic, I couldn't really see anything that revealed the ancient Rome to be a model or a computer simulation. The war scene and the fighting scenes are amazing, my guess is that the brutality shown here is a bit meeker than what the real thing must have been - the Romans were the worst kind of barbarians, civilized and advanced and yet thirsty for blood. But then again, maybe that was Rome's way of keeping their enormous population in check? Give them spectacles, give them something to shout at, to focus their frustration and anger at - and be sure to point that away from the emperor's palace."Gladiator" goes to considerable lengths to show how a weak emperor loses control over the crowds and how his vision of the empire crumbles before his eyes - this is all very well portrayed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is a thrilling spectacle. It's also a "sword and sandal" Roman epic; the revival of a genre that expired from excess in the early 1960s. Fictional general Maximus (Russell Crowe) is serving under emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). After witnessing another of Maximus' impressive victories (the opening battle-scenes are among the best in the movie), the ailing Aurelius appoints Maximus successor, confident he can restore Rome to a republic. Aurelius underestimates his ambitious son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and self-serving daughter Lucilla (Connie Nielson). Commodus is soon emperor, Maximus a slave fighting for his life as a gladiator.Russell Crowe can make virtually any character convincing and he heads a fine cast. But their efforts are frequently hampered by the simple screenplay (credited to David H Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson). But let's face it, you don't see a film like Gladiator for its script. Director Ridley Scott has put all the money into the computer-enhanced vistas and the action sequences - the impressive battle at the beginning, the gladiatorial fights. These are exhilarating and, thanks to Scott's blurring and whirring camerawork (cinematographer John Mathieson does a fine job), they don't seem as gratuitously violent as Braveheart. Nevertheless, I still feel uncomfortable praising a film which only really comes alive during brutal scenes of human slaughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Positive Comments on a great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When movies of gladiators and Ancient Rome are made, they are either very good....or very bad. Thankfully, this is a very good movie. Russell Crowe (as Maximus) epitomizes the macho, testosterone-pumping tough guy, and turns in an Oscar-caliber performance. The fighting scenes are done masterfully, but of course they are extremely graphic.While the movie is historically accurate to a T, two flaws bother this Latin student. One- Marcus Aurelius was not strangled by his son Commodus; he caught a bad cold while going on a trip to the area which is now Vienna and died. The other mistake, involves the thumbs up/thumbs down policy in the arena. When a gladiator was chosen to be killed, the audience raised their thumbs down, not up.Overall, the movie may have some minor flaws in the dialogue, but I believe that the movie's intention was to show a hero, one who faced adversity and death with little fear. Alas, why can't the world have more Maximuses, people who value hard work and little apathy?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much about this film was fantastic. Russell Crowe gives an excellent performance, which I've come to expect. Ridley Scott gives us something different, as I've come to expect --few of his films seem similar to one another. The cinematography and lighting is gorgeous, although I havesome technical beefs with the DP (please, filmmakers, don't overuse filters--it's a little cheesy). The story is quite something; a historical epic with a good deal to say about modern culture and society (Proximo: "I'm an entertainer." Maximus: "Are you not amused?"). However, I have a big problem with CG (computer-generated imagery). No matter how sophisticated, it always looks strange, and never looks real. Its use is better and more restrained here than, for example, in Star Wars: Episode One (a ridiculous waste of millions of dollars in technology), but here it's still oppressive. I think of all the people who must have put in months of their time making little tiny CG Romans walk around a big CG Colosseum, and I wonder what might have been a better use of their time... Oh well, I suppose I should get used to the CG trend, it seems to be here to stay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be great. It was spectacular acting, and believable for that period of time. I was glad that the movie had a story line and was not just all blood and death. Russell Crowe was an excellent choice for the character of Maximus and should be commended on his acting. Also the director did a fine job in making the movie and should also be commended. It is definetly worth owning or going to see in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maximus Entertainment - spoilers alert!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: This may contain spoilers!!!Not since movies like Ben Hur or Barrabas have I seen such a brilliant portrayal of Ancient Rome and the gladiator fights.Although I found the plot slightly reminiscent of Braveheart (just a bit mind you), it was easy to follow and led in great to the fights in the arena in Rome.The battle in the beginning was well staged, and the camera effects and special effects both add to the realism of this opening piece. And the action isn't over there. The gladiator fights are some of the best seen, including the final one, with Maximus and Commodus rising from the floor of the arena from a trapdoor. I was concerned that the movie would fail me and the weakling Commodus would have some burst of muscles and strength in the final fight, but no, thankfully he remained a weakling and was no real match for Maximus.All and all, a great film. The digital Rome is breath-taking.Five out of five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No other actor can radiate pure Hatred and Anger like Russel Crowe can.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Great film. Ridely Scott brings home another masterpiece. Thank goodness Mel Gibson didn't take the role Maximus because the character was destined to be played by Russel Crowe. I don't think any other actor can show anger better then Crowe, and Maximus has a lot to be angry about. It's almost three hour running time is appreciated because the movie never gets dull and the I was still thinking about the action scenes as I left the theatre. Great acting by all really help the beautiful direction given by Scott. This would have to be my pick for the best film of 2000 so far.&gt;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but No Braveheart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The photography was one of the more interesting things to see in this film, the battle scenes were almost surrealistic and refreshing in the lack of blood and gore. It's enough that we imagine it. Russell Crowe is fine in this role but I really hope he doesn't become some new Stallone/Schwarzeneggar type of action hero now. It was just the next step that they make a gladiator movie but the latter half did drag, I still say that Braveheart was much more compelling mainly because it was about a real person and Maximus lacked that little bit of humor necessary to make his character really human. Richard Harris was wonderful to see. I'd go to see it again just to admire his acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hated, hated, HATED this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love ancient epics. Who doesn't? I grew up watching Kevin Sorbo's "Hercules" TV series and was captivated by it, and I also enjoyed BEN-HUR and JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS. These films worked because they treated the civilizations of Greece and Rome with the utmost respect.So when I first heard about Russell Crowe's new movie GLADIATOR I was on fire to see it. I couldn't wait to sit in the theater and watch Crowe battle tigers and armored monsters with swords.But the movie left me cold, and in retrospect I should have expected as much. Director Ridley Scott (of BLADE RUNNER and the ALIEN films) projects his usual bleak palette on the screen here. For a movie about a glorious regime that supposedly brought light to what was then the known world, GLADIATOR seems so dark and gloomy. Plus, the story is anything but a whimsical joy ride; it's a bitter revenge-fest. After finding that his wife and son have been murdered, the Roman general Maximus (Crowe) is sold into slavery and becomes an angry, violent gladiator. The whole point of the plot is that he must find the man who wronged him - Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the new emperor of Rome - and take his revenge.I'm sorry, but I never knew anger and vengeance were such crucial elements in the Roman epic. As Maximus, Crowe broods and seethes throughout the entire production and manages to suck most of the fun out of the audience. Even the rousing gladiator battles (which took up less screen time than I'd hoped) did little to pique my interest. I tried to get myself to sympathize with Maximus, but I just couldn't. He didn't have a screen presence, unless you count hacking things to bits to be a presence.I also loathed the film's villain, played by a pale, dark-eyed Joaquin Phoenix. Movie villains are supposed to enjoy their time on screen, but Commodus just whines and moans his way to an anticlimactic death no decent villain deserves. If you have a lackluster hero in a movie, you should at least try to make the villain interesting. Not so here. Commodus seems more like an annoying teenager than a ruler, and his only fascinating quirk is the supposed feelings of lust he has for his sister. Their "sex scene" together isn't really much of anything, doesn't go anywhere, and left me feeling nauseated and a bit creeped out.With such insufferably insipid characters I was forced to concentrate on the film's only two positive qualities: the stunning vistas (they are grand) and the fight choreography. Unfortunately, there isn't enough action in this so-called action movie to really get excited about. The few fight scenes are shot with manic camera angles that would be more at home in a music video. And the ultimate battle scene at the end, which by definition should be the best of the bunch, quickly fizzles out like a wet firecracker.Pointless, nasty, nihilistic, and overall the joke of its genre, GLADIATOR is grossly overrated. I desperately wanted to like this film, but it fell way below my expectations of what a historical drama should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie; Computer Graphics Overdone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read in a Los Angeles major newspaper critique that this was the BEST movie of the year, I witnessed this movie expecting a 4 star performance. However I was somewhat disappointed by the extreme use of computer graphics. I deliberately haven't read any comments from other viewers or any other reviews so I could write unfettered. The emperor, the son of Marcus Aurelius, was the best actor along with his father. The fight scenes were excellent but they were mostly camera motion and sound effects. How one man could survive hand to hand combat with a never ending no. of physically fit combatants was hard for me to believe. And lastly, I missed out on hearing a large number of words. My wife seconds the motion on that one as well. All in all a relatively fast-paced entertaining movie but it did not come close to The Patriot which I thoroughly enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enters the arena with a bang !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is going to make you feel something; whether it is repulsion or excitement is a matter of taste, but it will, trust me. Personally, I tend towards the latter emotion, though some of the violence is repugnant, but most of the times more insinuated than truly depicted. The story of Maximus, the Roman army general who loses all but his life and fights his way up in the arena is fascinating though not highly original and the dialogue is not particularly strong as well.But the cinematography is excellent. The opening-scene wherein a Roman battalion take on a Barbarian army is breathtaking and most of the fighting-scenes are really well done also. The moment when the gladiators are waiting in the tunnel to enter the stadium where an armored giant is swinging a huge metal ball around gives you the feeling you are there yourself. Some of the acting is good, as is the music.Powerful stuff on the whole, and surely will fire up your adrenaline-level. Gladiator reminds me a bit of Braveheart, but I prefer this one for its atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey! It's a blockbuster! What more could you ask for!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, watching this capped a weekend of movies that started with Fight Club. This fairly mirthless picture is still lots of fun. The story is fairly unsophisticated, despite the film's length and palace intrigue story lines. Some of the effects and cinematography are stunning. The acting, if not particularly amazing, is still pretty solid.Russell Crowe rocked, but I've liked him since Proof, and he was the best part of The Quick and the Dead. All the secondary characters are decent. It's a pretty good child actor that doesn't incite murderous instincts in me.Fight Club was interesting, because it looked at fighting as a consequence of masculine ennui. Its characters fight to find a sense of themselves or their emotions, things that they've lost because they have lost their fathers. Gladiator's fighters battle because they have to, but Maximus, after initial apathy, also fights, to avenge the loss of his father figure. Tyler and Maximus both lead armies. Hmmm, maybe I should stop there.Anyway, reasonably good fun. Nothing to stretch the brain over. Probably could have used some edits here or there, but then it wouldn't have that overlong "epic" feel. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Hollywood moviemaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me point out, that I loved this movie. It is a stunning visual masterpiece with a superb cast, great direction and awesome camera-work. But seen through the eyes of the archaeologist and re-enactor I am, the movie strangely disappointed me. There was so much effort and money put into this movie, visually it is a masterpiece and in so many details there is correctness (like using 8-shaped chains, or the glasses Commodus drinks out of), yet the equipment and battle scenes, while being deft and stunningly beautiful, lack realism. There were no ballistae shooting whaling-harpoon sized bolts and not even a single pilum even flew, the romans did not advance in formation and they hardly ever used cavalry. Commodus' reign did last much longer than only 60-some days, and while he was crude and over-the-top, he surely was not a whimp. Not even one classical form of a gladiator appeared. So, I'd give it a D+ for historical correctness and a straight a for cinematics -- a great movie, as long as you do not think of it as a history lesson (which are boring to most people anyway :)) Go and see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is nothing short of brilliant, simply brilliant. It is honest in every way. Russell Crowe is so natural as Maximus (as he is in every role he undertakes). Joaquin Phoenix was a dynamite casting choice, and unlike many movie villains, he was complex and had such a wonderful history behind his actions. The whole cast was MADE to act with each other. The casting choices were perfect.The movie is magical because it so easily makes the audience believe its reality. True, the story itself may not be true but Rome was portrayed so wonderfully. Few movies (if any!) have been made that have been so believable in its atmosphere of the ancient, yet surprisingly advanced Rome (though its tastes for sex and violence might have been more than gruesome). However, Ridley Scott has toned down the gruesome aspect so that we can focus on the story at hand, which is moving and very enjoyable.This has become the highlight of the movie industry for the summer, in my opinion. It has fast become one of my favorite movies! I have not done it justice here. It's definitely one to catch in the theatres.</fullReview>

What's Maximus' feelings? Is he unwilling to fight anymore? Why does he fight so hard when he has nothing to live for? Does he care or not? How could Caesar not anticipate his son's rage at being passed over? And if the sister was so cunning how is it she didn't find a way to assainate her brother who paraded around defenseless in front of her every day for 5 years? Or that she would allow her secret plans to be heard by her son? How could a former gladiator slave then go on to enslave more gladiators yet have a self-sacrificing loyalty?The cinematics were a cut above most movies but a cut below Scott's. There were too many different filming styles; in the beginning we have the slow motion blurred battle scenes (yuck). Then CGI-peppered panorama shots (sorry, those CGI falling rose petals, birds and people still don't look quite right). Then (my favorite, the most Ridley-like) lush dream sequences with wind swept European countryside. Compare that to how much more coherent a vision we saw in Blade Runner, and those guys had to make little plastic models and matte paintings.Worth seeing, and the Roman trivia scattered in the skit was neat, but we're not talking Blade Runner or Alien quality stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...then you probably were expecting to see another "Ben-Hur", just as I was the first time I saw it. I felt extremely disappointed. I thought it was dark, boring and I wasn't even impressed with the F/X. Then I saw it again...And it was a revelation. Once you let the film speak to you in its own language (and not the one of the old Hollywood films) then you begin to savor it. Of course there are some ludicrous scenes ( the final confrontation between Commodus and Maximus, for example) that don't change even if you see it 10 times, but one must credit Ridley Scott for having the courage of giving us a new, more authentic look of that era, even though it was much darker and bloody than other representations we were used to see in film. Russell Crowe is perhaps the key to the film's success. His performance is outstanding. I just hope Crowe is not going to become the next Nicolas Cage. I'd like to see him taking more risks as an actor, as he has done in the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, so it's not the most historically accurate document on Roman times. Gladiator rules anyway! Ridley finally hits one out of the park, succeding in delivering not only a very good movie, but one that crosses over to mainstream success... all without compromising his artistic vision, and giving us fans of his work everything we've come to expect from each of his works.Crowe is awesome, Phoenix enjoyably campy... and Oliver Reed, well, this final performance is just a sad reminder of what an amazing performer we have lost.Ten out of ten!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining and captivating film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator was a very exciting and captivating film, the battle scenes and characters kept my interest at all times. Russel Crowe gave an intense and convincing performance. My only complaint is that the movie seemed at times like an unofficial sequel to 'Braveheart' as it concentrated on the same idea of a would be farmer whose revenge inspires him to fight for the good of his people. In short, it is a good old fashioned epic well worth watching but nothing we have not seen before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I'd heard the new Roman gladiator movie has been made, I'd gotten excited and had high expectation. I'm not trying to say I didn't like this movie. I loved this movie and want to see it again. I think that I'd expect a movie, a masterpiece like ben-hur. This movie should have been a masterpiece with these marvelous actors, big budget, talented director.When I first saw "Gladiator", the one thing I didn't like was ending. in ending scene the whole theater starts laughs. too cheesy to touch. How could Lucilla and the people let Roman Emperor's dead body abandoned like that? I think there's lack details of how brutal, devilish the emperor was. and how much the people in Rome hated their emperor.Joaquin Phoenix was the most outstanding part to me. Russell crowe was a gorgeous and excellent figure as always. I hope there would be lots of Oscar chance to come!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. I wonder however if anyone else spotted that the sound-track purporting to be 2nd century AD German warriors psyching themselves up for battle was actually poached from Zulu starring Michael Caine. That was I think a little joke from Ridley Scott.Don't however let that put you off, this film will be regarded as a classic in years to come. Russel Crowe shows great maturity as a actor and certainly has the presence to handle the lead role in an epic movie. Kirk Douglas and Charlton Heston can now see that they have a worthy successor.Let this film stand alone and please lets not have "Gladiator 2, the sandals' return".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things I like about GLADIATOR (warning: spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. The battle scenes. Even on second viewing, they had me on the edge of my seat, teeth locked, fists clenched. "Are you not entertained?" Maximus demands. Yup, I sure was. I was scared, horrified, nerve-wracked and at times revolted. But bored? Hell, no!2. Marcus Aurelius. In every other movie that shows Caesar Marcus Aurelius, the director slobbers all over him and makes him out as an all-wise philosopher. Ridley Scott portrays him more like what I feel he was: a well-intentioned fool.3. There are NO CHRISTIANS in this movie! Scott broke Rule One in Roman-Epic-Making, which saith the plot must be at least tangentially about conflict between persecuted Christians and evil heathens. Of course, Christianity in Imperial Rome started out as just an insignificant player among many, many cults. For once we not only get a hero who isn't a Christian, but a hero who is devoutly and warmly pious in the old pagan traditions.4. The acting. Everybody does a wonderful job. Crowe is so subtle that Phoenix upstages him, but they're both excellent. Crowe, as always, is a master at hinting at deep thoughts that just barely ripple the surface of his face. Phoenix gives us a wonderful villain, provoking both pity and disgust, whose footsteps on the path from good to evil are clearly visible behind him. Nielsen, Jacobi, and Hounsou all enrich the movie, and even Harris (perfectly cast) gives a good performance. And Oliver Reed is delightful; if he is playing himself, as the stories about him suggest, then he must have been an interesting man to know. It took a lot of good acting to rescue some of the lamer dialogue, but by God they did it.5. The coliseum. Some of the rest of Rome looked too colorless and washed out to be believable, but the coliseum was spectacular. And those tigers! How magnificent! This truly was the "grandeur that was Rome."6. Tragedy. Not only does Maximus die, but his death achieves almost nothing. We know the Republic will never be restored, the "light" that is Rome will be snuffed in the Dark Ages, the dream will die. But Maximus has kept his integrity; he has fulfilled his word to his emperor by seeing that Commodus will not rule Rome; he has done his part to try to restore the Republic, even if it is in vain, and that may not be such a small achievement.7. Hans Zimmer's score. Somebody said he lifted it; I don't know if that's true, but if he did then he lifted it from the right place. It's simple and powerful, perfectly chosen for the scenes. The Celtic wailing was a bit much at times, but I don't think Zimmer did that part.8. A small touch, but a good one. Lucilla, bending over the dying Maximus, does not say "I love you," which she surely must have been thinking. Instead, she says "Go to them." Which, when you think about it, is really a much better demonstration of how much she cared about Maximus than the more obvious line would have been.And some things I didn't like...1. The ending. Ten points for having the guts to kill the hero off. But Lucilla's and Gracchus' "truly this was the noblest Roman of them all"-type posturing was pompous and unnecessary. If we had to have an epitaph, it would have been better just to have Lucius say one sentence: "There will be no more games as long as I reign." Of course that would probably be historically inaccurate, but since when did that ever stop a good storyteller?2. Tigers Lite? An adult male tiger weighs 500 pounds. I don't care if you're Arnold Schwarzenegger, if one of those things jumps on your back, you're going DOWN and staying there.3. Maximus' home. Farmers that stand immobile, a mother and child we never get to know before they die. It all sounded so much better when Maximus described it then when we saw it.But I'm just carping to show that I paid attention. GLADIATOR's a magnificent movie. For heaven's sake, fork over the money to see it on the big screen.</fullReview>

In all of my favorite films, I can pick out at least a few small problems, whether it be in dialogue, acting, or plot inconsistencies, but with Gladiator, everything is completely perfect.

		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is excellent film. It has very strong message of honesty, honor, dignity and love. Do you still remember this words...? Russel Crowe is in a role of Maximus, Roman general, who is favorite of Marcus Aurelius, Roman Cezar, who wishes Maximus to be a Roman Protector, a guardian of Roman republic. Aurelis son, Commodus, has some other plans... Maximus was very popular amongst Roman army, but, over the night everything changes... In this movie, Ridley Scott guides us through ancient Rome, through it's plots, factions and nasty tricks. Great camera, picture, music and effects is visual luxury; movie has action, story, great players and moral. Oliver Reed is great as Proximus, the spirit of old Rome, honest and bloody, when human life has very little meaning. Violence in this movie makes the point - in movie where human life on battlefields has no importance at all, it show us how meaningless and horrible and monstrous is taking human life in Arena, or killing helpless women and children for political causes...Russel Crowe is really good. His tired face is representing human struggle between honor or surrender...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am writing this, because I cannot leave the line blank. Read the comment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Academy Awards show, the host, Billy Crystal, claimed to be able to read people's mind and thoughts, and when Russell Crowe's face was shown in the big TV screen, Billy said something like "..I could use a cigarette.", and those who got to see Crowe's face might have noticed that he had the same facial expression as in all his films, a serious face. I personally believe that is something to admire, being so serious all the time. We don't see Russell smiling or laughing a lot, but that doesn't affect his acting skills at all.Crowe did an excellent job as Maximus in this movie, Gladiator. The rest of the cast was very good, including Joaquin Phoenix, who surprised me with his great performance.The plot is pretty good, I wouldn't say it's VERY entertaining, it has some very few dialogues that could be considered boring, but overall, it's a great script.The recreation of the ancient Rome is just excellent. The architecture of the buildings and The Coliseum is just fantastic. People in charge of that deserve a lot of credit and recognition.The movie could be considered long (over 150 minutes), and some people might find a few scenes boring, but generally the movie keeps the viewers paying attention all the time. The fight scenes were very good, people who aren't big action fans might enjoy watching this film (though it's not completely action, a little drama too).Crowe's character in here is very interesting. It's the kind of person that expresses the kind of feelings that make you think he doesn't fear anything, he always knows what to do next and he thinks the right way. While watching the film you get to like the character.The ending is tragic but at the same time happy. The "bad guy" dies and the "good guy" wins, but something that maybe people weren't expecting, the good guy dies too. Maximus takes revenge, killing the Caesar, and then he dies, but if you think carefully, you'll notice that he actually wanted to die, to be together with his wife and son again, in the life after death.This was a good movie. It's not the kind of movie that really "gets into you" and causes strange feelings and such (not many movies do that), but it's a good film and certainly worth watching. I'll rate it with a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>almost the top of its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The battle scene in Gladiator presents the dichotomy of the human butchery below and the serenity of the sky above. That image becomes the theme of the film itself. Like all worthy films, Gladiator is a love story. Love being a complex emotion with two faces, it is the character of the cruel and cowardly emperor Commodus that truly stitches this movie together. As Commodus, I found that Joaquin Phoenix gave a performance comparable (if not exceeding) that of no greater a portrayer of cinematic villainy than Christopher Plummer. Plummer, the most noted Iago, Shakespeare's ultimate bad guy, of the 20th Century, also assayed the part of Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964). In that, lesser, film Plummer's Commodus provides the common foe that enables the love connection between Sophia Loren and Steven Boyd to shine. In Gladiator, Phoenix's brooding depiction of a man balanced on the edge of insanity lends his victim the pedestal of greatness, and in turn propels Gladiator above other Ancient Roman era epics, with the exception of Ben-Hur. It is love that sends Commodus over the edge, not love of a woman, but love of himself, when he finds that he can't truly kill his father, the emperor Marcus Aurelius, whose spirit carries on in the person of the betrayed general and eventual gladiator Maximus (Russell Crowe). The battle scene and the scenes of gladiatorial combat are not cheap gore. They underscore the inherent brutality of that place and that time in history. There is blood, but just enough to make the point intended. Another theme in Ancient Roman costume epics has been the birth and fruition of Christianity, most notably in Ben-Hur and The Robe. This is touched into the canvas of Gladiator with a fine brush, as if Seurat had painted the scene, but it never comes forefront, almost thankfully. Like the sky above the battle scene, it is simply there, in the love of Maximus for his absent wife and son. There are some noted actors who contribute to Gladiator: Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius; the late Oliver Reed; and Derek Jacobi (who has had plenty of experience in a toga as the star of the I, Claudius series). Gladiator is a worthwhile and uplifting film, well-acted and well-directed. It does not succeed to the top of its genre, but very nearly so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me the best part of the movie was the beginning. The battle seen is the best, I have seen, of any movie. Past movies have depicted ancient battle scenes with clean soldiers, on unsullied battlefields and with uniforms that are just fresh from the dry-cleaner. This battle scene encapsulated to a degree never seen before what any battle must be like. But, in particular, it accurately depicts a Roman campaign with a battle weary/hardened Roman legion, dug in (like some unit, in the filthy trenches from the First World War) with their superior technology and training facing a barbarian horde. The battle itself was magnificent!The rest of the movie was less plausible. I welcome any twist on historical fact (c.f. Shakespeare in Love) however this one lacked something. Maximus seemed to give in and accept his lot when "picked-up" by the gladiator owner. If my family had just been murdered I would made an attempt to escape and headed straight for my legion and then marched on Rome.The scenes at the Coliseum and there on were lacking too. Comodus not just murdering Maximus on immediately hearing of his survival just doesn't seem right to me. The last ten minutes were the usual sentimentalist rubbish. The writers obviously couldn't agree on an ending.However, all-in-all a good spectacle. I give it 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie...but no Braveheart (or Titan AE)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first time I'm aware of that the "sword and sandals" epic has really made a comeback. I've never seen Ben-Hur or Spartacus...but I'm sure they're quite different from this. The whole time I was watching this I was getting vibes that while this was a great movie it was not trying to show us what Roman Times were really like, but rather trying to please the crowd and get more money.Still, I liked this movie and it is a lot more intellegent than most of the other films that will be coming out this summer. Surprisingly, this film is 70% talk. If you go expecting Bloodsport you'll be disappointed. The plot is interesting, well thought out...but it was too long. I think the movie was trying to become an epic that will be remembered..and all great epics are 3 hours long. There are too many scenes that seem unnecessary.The best part of this movie is Crowe. He isn't another hollywood pretty boy like Tom Cruise...so you can actually believe that his character is there in the action and not just dancing around pretending to hit each other on screen. He's a good actor I guess, though I can never really tell. He was nominated for best actor, though, and thats good enough for me. I also liked that one guy, something-Phoenix. He was good for his role as the films villain (probably the summers only villain that will have some redeeming qualities, therefore being a real character) SPOILER ALERT The climax of this movie, however, is weak...totally anti-climactic and out of character. It's too simple as well...hero challenges villain, hero wins...hero dies...movies over. I liked how when the villain died that didn't make a big thing out of it, with slow motion and all that, it makes it more life like that way. But the ending made me stop caring. When the hero died, I wasn't as sad as I could of been.This movie reminded me of Braveheart...both telling the story of one man making a differince in his fight for freedom. But I enjoyed Braveheart more...I liked the music better, the characters were more interesting, and the setting was so much more beautifal and intriguing.But it was fun, and it had a brain...something many movies you see this summer will not (60 Second, Big Mommas House, MI-2). It's no Titan AE...but since it isn't trying to be thats ok.This movie earns the following awards: 2nd BEST Protagonist of 2000 (1st going to Cale) WORST Climax of 2000, and STUPIDEST Historical Facts guy...the romans use thumbs up to signal a win, instead of a closed fist. I actually think the filmmakers were aware of this, they were just making it clearer for the average action movie viewer this film will attract to most. Overall this film earns the better than average rating of "a movie that successfully combines good action with an interesting plot, setting and characters...just ignore the ending."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie rocked the collisseum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drawing the line between martyrdom and heroism is what makes Ridley Scott's Roman epic, Gladiator, such a powerful and moving movie. Using some computer generated shots as well as a cast of extremely talented actors, Scott beautifully creates a fictional story that shows the start of Rome's eventual downfall. I don't know too much about the history of Rome, but I didn't need to in order to enjoy this five star movie. Despite all the action and bloodshed, the humanistic issues are what bring this movie above any Hollywood anti-hype it would otherwise get.There wasn't much to this movie that I didn't like. Graphically, there were some great matte scenes of the city and the bird's-eye view of the opening battles added to the war-like feel of the movie (however this scene reminded me a little too much of the Gungans- Droids scene in Phantom Menace). All the gladiator battle sequences were great- brilliantly choreographed and superb in cinematography. The shots were rapid fire, not allowing the viewer to focus on any one image for an extensive amount of time, but slowing down before the victory. Thus, the movie felt like it was more action packed, albeit bloody. The themes of the movie, "Strength and Honor," were always in my mind and reinforced the concept of the tragic heroism of Maximus. Maximus wouldn't be a martyr, nor would Commodus have him that way, so the element of tragic heroism overshadows the movie. Because of this feeling and the intense acting that Russell Crowe puts into his character, the closing scene was extremely moving, almost bringing tears to my eyes. Adding to the emotion is excellent scoring by Klaus Badelt, Lisa Gerrard, and Hans Zimmer. The classical music gives movement to the slow scenes as well as the fast paced battles, yet doesn't detract from the story itself. Maximus deals with human issues such as death, honesty and trust, and loyalty to a cause he believed in. Gladiator was probably one of the best movies I've seen in a while and although it is rather gory with several heads getting sliced off and a lot of bloodshed, the movie as a whole comes through as something that is definitely worthwhile seeing. It probably wouldn't surprise me if some Oscar nominations are given to this movie, either to Crowe or Phoenix, but that won't be for another year. Definitely a must-see movie.</fullReview>

This is nothing else than your average Death Wish - one man goes for revenge flick, only difference is that it's set in the roman empire. Why do we have to see the same story over and over again?

Since his cool-as-hell performance in `The Quick and the Dead' he was the man for the important roles, and here he shows that he's able to carry a whole movie. A truly breathtaking performance, he's the man right now!Good action scenes and SFX, amazing sets and great acting are not enough to distract from the weak plot, but makes at least a typical popcorn movie, and isn't that what most movies are all about? 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very good, in no way is it dissapionting, unless you has unrealistic expectations. I personally think that this is Ridley Scotts best movie since Alien.

		<fullReview>On the whole, I agree with most of the raves. Crowe is pure gold. Jacobi, Reed and Harris carry their profession forward with everything they've done. It's a craft. Phoenix is genuine with each snivel. I am a fan of the sword and horse, thundering battle scene movie. Unfortunately, that first and much praised battle scene promised far more than it delivered...at least at this address. I actually sat forward in my seat expecting great things. It began beautifully. Suddenly the cameraperson developed the shakes. What kind of method is THAT?! Am I meant to FEEL like I am fighting, too? Nausea and disappointment were all I felt. After that, I had to concentrate on the story. The best part of which is the political message. The other bits: wispy wife and child, romance and such- barf bag, please! See the film for the performances and the scenery (breathtaking.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A full, satisfying film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator had the best of thickened plots, complex relationship issues, outrageous effects and realistic settings for this attempt to depict the struggles of a "warrior with a heart" in a nearly heartless world.I found the opening scene powerful in its ability to draw me in to the hard, brutal world of the noble warrior and the Roman emperor, as well as giving a glimpse of the vision of the "next world" held by its protagonist.Especially enjoyable to me were the dynamics of the son who could not force his father's love and the warrior who earned that same love by being a man of integrity, vision and value. The sins of the father's distance are visited on the son, who then visits his own sinful responses on an entire empire.A fascinating study of the best and worst of human nature without going into caricatures, Gladiator was an epic romp, with enough meat to make chewing the bones deeply satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the gore?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a film about Gladiators so where's the gore? Predictable in in the most part, especially for those who are familiar with "The Life Of Brian" or even several Billy Connolly sketches, but moves along at a reasonable pace. I fully expected to see John Cleese selling Otters noses in the arena, and is that really Big Gay Al running the theatre? Manages to keep your interest (it had better - it's a long film) but is a bit lacking in gore. It's a film about Gladiators for goodness sake so a little less mawkishness and a bit more of the old blood and guts wouldn't have gone amiss. It doesn't have to be Texas Chainsaw Massacre but it doesn't have to be Asterix either. And Oliver Reed is fantastic so yah boo sucks to any director who worried about working with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither great nor bad -- good entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a much quirkier film than you would expect from a gladiator epic, and it's going to disappoint some people.First off, it is NOT history, although a few historical characters are used. In the film's defense, it really doesn't try to BE history, either, merely using historical backdrops for a morality play. Although, having said that, the opening battle use of the longbow is an anachronism, I believe; the longbow didn't come into use until the thirteenth or fourteenth century, and its origin was Welsh and English. Minor point, but since I have castigated other movies on similar points ...The performances were outstanding, subtle, and complex, even the sometimes over-the-top performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. Connie Nielsen is especially effective, and for the first half of the film you're not quite sure where her character stands. I thought Oliver Reed was breathtaking in this film. It's the only film I've seen where I liked Reed, and what a shame he passed away during the filming.The script gets pretty conventional in the second half of the film, and therefore predictable. However, the visual presentation is stunning, with washout coloring and inventive camera techniques. I can understand why these might be irritating to other filmgoers, especially if they're expecting a traditional epic. Obviously, I liked it.Overall, it's a good film, not a great one, and not one everyone will appreciate. I think it's overall ranking is excessive, and I rated it a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an epic with no questions asked. Ridley Scott has done his job here. Russell Crowe is a force. His character comes off as a mix between the Terminator and Rambo. He commands every scene and has that "God-like" presence. He plays Maximus, the commander of the Roman Army who is sent to die by Ceasar's son Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix). But when he escapes, he has to join up with these prisoners and fight battles. This film is going to live for a very long time. It has the Braveheart quality but much cooler battle scenes. It may be long but it flows by quickly. I have to give it a 10. Russell Crow is the new action hero and I think he should go the way of Nick Cage(Oscar nod followed by a string of action films). Let's get him two guns, John Woo, and call it a day. He is such a force on screen, you can't help but call him "The Man". Gladiator is a must see and a can't miss. It should be number 1 or 2 on all must see film lists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What we do now .. echoes through history...A true masterpiece from director Ridley Scott, Gladiator has everything a epic movie could wish for. From the battlefields of Germania to the Gladiatorial contests of the coliseum.It stars Russell Crowe as Maximus, a brave Roman General who is betrayed by the evil Emperor Commodus. Left for dead he is rescued by a Gladiator trainer( played by the late Oliver Reed) who trains our hero as a Gladiator. He eventually fights his way to the Coliseum in Rome when he confronts his enemies and his destinyEverything about this movie echoes pure class. The battles, the sets, the direction. The cast is superb especially Russell Crowe, Oliver Reed and our own Richard Harris as the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius.What the author really loved about this film was it's authenticity. Ridley Scott shows the filmgoer what Rome must have looked like at her height, decadent but wonderful. This film is a must for anyone who enjoys real entertainment, after all isn't that why cinema was invented.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has sort of an epic feel to it; the crowds, the sets, and the ambiance in general all work to effectively re-create life as it might have been in the Roman Empire.We begin with Maximus, a very successful Roman general, and Commodus, the incompetent heir apparent to the reigning Caesar, Marcus Arelius. Maximus, after winning a key battle against Germanic hordes, is offered what is essentially a wish by Arelius. Maximus is battle-weary and just wants to go home. While the aging Arelius initially agrees, he is in failing health and recognizes that Commodus isn't fit to rule, and therefore offers Maximus a "protectorate of Rome" position instead, which the reluctant Maximus takes under consideration. If he accepts, he effectively would be Caesar, something that wouldn't sit well with heir apparent Commodus...I thought this film was quite effective on many levels. Maximus was portrayed as a general following the orders of his Caesar, sometimes reluctantly but always to the best of his abilities. Commodus was portrayed as a cruel letch which, if memory serves, he was. And the Roman Senate, a hotbed of intrigue and corruption, served as a curious counterpoint to the concept of a Caesar, showing that not even the Caesars were perfectly free to do as they wished. All in all, a very watchable, atmospheric movie well worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is one of those truly memorable films. The story is harrowing, the bad guys are truly evil, and the heroes are heroic. Russell Crowe plays Maximus, a former general in the Roman Army, and a favorite of the late emperor, Marcus Aurelius(Richard Harris). When Aurelius tells his son, Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix), and heir to the throne, that he will not be choosing him as his successor, but Maximus, Commodus kills Aurelius and has Maximus sentenced to die. Commodus rises to power and has Maximus's family condemned to die as well. Maximus escapes his executioners and heads to his home in Spain to save his family. The Romans get there first, though, and Maximus's family is crucified. Maximus collapses at their graves and is taken prisoner by a slave trader. The slave trader sells him to an entertainer, who has Maximus trained as a gladiator. Maximus is incredible in the ring, and is taken to Rome to fight in the just re-opened Coliseum. I can't tell you any more without spoiling the story, though. The acting is excellent, and the viewer really begins to hate Commodus by the end of the film, and love and admire Maximus. The cinematography is good as well, with vivid colors and breathtaking shots. This is truly a great fight movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is awesome! In fact I watched it 3 times already. The movie had impressive plot. It gave a wide range of emotion from heightened action scenes to moving sorrows of dead loved ones. I could only empathize Maximus! The visuals of the film were just stunning. With the recreation of Rome, I felt I was there. The fighting scenes were just stylish removing the gore in a rather violent and brutal scenes as demanded for by the gladiators. And of course the costumes were elaborate. Commodus's costume enforced his majestic appeal concealing his weak character as an emperor. Lucilla was as fashionable as ever with Eastern influences depicted in the film showing a vast Roman Empire. For sure Russell Crowe will be remembered forever in this film particularly in the Philippines and who knows a nomination for the Oscar (again?)!, and to Ridley Scott, make more films something like this. Kudos to you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ok, in order to talk about this movie of course one gets embroiled in talking about braveheart. i really liked braveheart. it was the 1st good epic in a while. i own it. really, i liked it. however, here are some reasons i have, after much deliberation, decided gladiator is a better movie. there will be some SPOILERS probably. 1. mel gibson is a good actor. i liked him in braveheart and even more in lethal weapon. he has a unique ironical twist to his acting. but i think russell crowe is overall a superior performer. he is quickly becoming a favorite of mine, from what i've seen him in: l.a. confidential (awesome!!), the insider (didn't really like it but he was great), and now this(also some movie the name of which i don't know but i think bridget fonda was in it and it was about magicians). 2. better story. braveheart was very simplistic, which worked, but i thought there was a more substantial plot here. roman politics i personally find very interesting. 3. i could care less that it's historically inaccurate. anyone who thinks braveheart was accurate needs to brush up on some history. geez, robert the bruce was way more historically significant than wallace. 4. i thought the action was better. braveheart had great battle scenes but i thought gladiator's action scenes were more inventive and original. 5. phoenix was real good. some people will say he was too whiny but i thought that was what made it good. i don't know a lot of pathological villains but my gut tells me real bad guys probably have at their core real insecurity issues. a word about the 1st scene - SPOILER!! - i thought the shift to blurriness at the end was great, it was melodic and if they had just had just continued the fight as was there definitely would be even more braveheart comparisons. now, just to be objective, a few problems: 1. the ending. the whole thing with people crowding around him and someone saying "who will help me carry him?" was cheesy and out of place. 2. that part at the beginning where he's riding home threw me for a loop. i don't mind time elapsing quickly but it seemed disjointed. i mean, he rode really far, like across the whole freaking roman empire!! anyways, overall it was awesome. i genuinely think that if both braveheart and gladiator came out at the same time more people would like this, but it's hard to say a new movie is better than one you already love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You already probably know the plot so that i will not tell you of. But this is the best movie of all time. From the campaign in Germania fighting the Ostrogoths and Jutes to....well, you have to find that out! The movie has an all star cast; Russel Crowe from The Insider, Joaqin Phoenix from 8mm, Connie Nielsen from the Devils Advocate, Oliver Reed from A LOT of movies, Djimon Honsou from Deep Rising and Amistad, Chick Allen as a German Chieftain with a severed head and a huge ax. The fighting in this movie is so excessive and well-done, I've never seen anything like it before. The story is not a slacker, it really has plot (a good one i might add). The recreation of Rome was very accurate and the costumes were awesome. I know maybe they usually didn't wear as much but I happen to know that Gladiatorial fights differed from time to time. The only mistake i found was the repeating crossbow, which wasn't invented until 7th Century by the Chinese. But oh well... it still looks awesome. The soundtrack is compelling done by Hanz Zimmer from the Rock and Lisa Gerrard from...? It's a wonderful soundtrack. The Gladia they used in the movie were well-made and the chariots were magnificent with an added blade coming out from the wheel. Buy the soundtrack. This movie doesn't have as much gore as it could have which is a plus since gore has been taking over Hollywood. I've seen this 3 times and I love it more EVERY SINGLE time i watch it. This is my favorite movie of all time, it beats braveheart by 0.5 of a point. I love this movie. It's magnificent. I recommend this to all people, even those who don't like too much gore. This movie doesn't have it. It's a magnificent movie (I'm 13 years old... and I'm a history lover so...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love Ridley Scott. "Alien" and "Blade Runner" both rank among my favorite films. "Gladiator," though, just didn't work for me.Russell Crowe is a fantastic actor, and really ought to be a big, big, big star. Unfortunately, he's not given much to do here. He fights, he broods, he whines...but he's never really forced to stretch his talents.My main quibble, I suppose, is that the movie was clearly going for "Braveheart" effect, and it fails. It was easy to get some sympathy going for Mel Gibson's character in "Braveheart." He was fighting for freedom and justice. Sadly for "Gladiator," it's pretty hard to develop much sympathy for any particular faction within the Roman empire. Where "Braveheart" was able to give us a few effective hallucinations and dream sequences, "Gladiator" shoves it down our throat with oddly-colored, tripping-on-acid dream sequences every five minutes. Yes, we get the point. He misses his family, and he'll see them in the afterlife. Move on already!Apart from the dream sequences, the movie does look pretty spectacular. The Colliseum is an impressive sight. The costumes, for once in a sword-and-sandal epic, don't look like the costume department simply raided the bedding department at K-Mart. And the fight scenes are, indeed, entertaining and visceral.In the end, though, the movie is less than the sum of its parts.</fullReview>

The favorite of Richard Harris' Caesar to take over Rome, Crowe refuses, and ends up as a slave whose only existence is to fight in the arenas, where most of the warriors die very young deaths. Maximus sees this as his chance to redeem himself.Besides Crowe's terrific performance, Harris and the late Oliver Reed, as Profumo, Maximus' master, deliver wonderful performances.The special effects are amazing as well, from the battle and action sequences, to the renderings of the Colosseum and ancient Rome. Gladiator is a top-notch action film, and one that signals Russell Crowe as a major star on the rise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow,I didn't expect this movie to have a plot, but I was pleasantly surprised that it did. The movie's success wasn't based on WHO was starring in it. But the movie itself was able to stand on it's on merit. Simply amazing!!! You leave the theater coming off your adrenaline rush. It's not fair to classify this as an action movie because the action HAS A purpose unlike movies like diehard, and the Damme movies that can only breathe action. Anything else, they suffocate.

		<shortDescription>Gladiator is the last of the great Roman epics, superbly brought to life by an amazing cast, outstanding scenery and special effects, shrewd directing and Hans Zimmer's emotional score.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is the last of the great Roman epics, superbly brought to life by an absolutely amazing cast and some outstanding special effects and scenery perfectly complimented by Ridley Scott's shrewd directing. It tells the story of Maximus, a General in the Roman army sent to Germania under the watchful eye of Emperor Marcus Arelius to conquer the last barbarian tribes holding out. Marcus is dying and after the battle, tells Maximus that he is to become Rome's new ruler. Having broken the bad news to Commodus, his evil son who responds by punishing dad, Maximus is accused of treason and sentenced to death. The rest of the film focuses on Maximus' rise as a gladiator having been discovered by Proximo, an ex-gladiator who has been granted his freedom. Maximus' career culmilates in a brathtaking finale in Rome and the Colosseum. We all know what that means, a final showdown with the newly self-elected Emperor Commodus, providing of course Maximus and his Gladiator friends survive the trials that the new Caesar throws at them. The film itself stands out from previous epics with its technically perfect fight scenes in the Colosseum and at the beginning with the German barbarians.Russel Crowe must be an Oscar winner for his superbly emotional performance as Maximus. The film is very emotional in places and this is perfectly multiplied by Hans Zimmer's score which must also be an Oscar nominee.Joaquin Phoenix portrays evil Emperor Commodus as the weasely snide Roman we all know he is. Oliver Reed's final performance as Gladiator trainer Proximo must also not be ignored. All in all, Gladiator is one of the greatest films i have ever seen and i would strongly urge everybody to go and see it regardless of what you have planned for that day. Purchase the soundtrack too and play it as loud as your player will allow.This film kicks and is easily one that will make you cry your eyes out come the end. 100% easily-and don't forget the Oscars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a nutshell: I loved it! Russell Crowe turns in a phenomenal performance as Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix does likewise as the tormented Commodus. While the cinematography itself is quite dark and brooding, it mitigates the feel of the movie. The battles are well choreographed, and the story moves quickly. I've always been a big fan of Ridley Scott, and he hits one out of the park with Gladiator. Also, the musical score, written by Hans Zimmer, deserves a mountain of praise. You've got to see this one, folks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing a friend of mine said when he left the movie theatre was "Too many small things were wrong. They didn't pay attention to detail. And the old guy was breathing!" (see: scene in Marcus Aurelius' tent)Another friend of mine and I were speechless and on the verge of shouting "Maximus! Maximus" at a volume that most likely would have gotten us a free night in a local police station. Perhaps even with padded walls."Gladiator" is by no means a small movie. It is a HUGE movie.I'm not familiar with the exact moviemaking dictionary definition of an epic.. but I'd say this movie was definitely one. The acting was grand, the scenery was grand, the fights were grand, and also quite surprisingly, the emotions were too.I hate to be harsh on movies, but the day afterwards I went to see "Story of Us".. a cute little middle aged marriage problem drama. Not my kind of thing, especially not after "Gladiator". To those of you who have seen both movies you can imagine what a surreal experience that must have been.My friend was right, as some critics will point out.. the little details weren't quite there... but WHO CARES??? Sit through "Gladiator" in a sizable THX movie theatre and I can almost promise you that you will feel the same way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walking into this movie, I was extremely hyped. Walking out of this movie, I was reading the list of ingredients on the back of the Malteser packet. Enough said.Gladiator is certainly worth seeing - the visuals are impressive, the action is fast-paced, and Russell Crowe is gruff and heroic. But that's about all. The script is so-so; the plot is basic and predictable; and, most disappointing of all, you really don't get sucked in emotionally. I mean, all a film like this aims to do is:(a) present a two-dimensional hero;(b) do some nasty things to his relatives; and(c) get you squirming in your seat waiting for the bad guys to get what's coming to them.It was like this in Mad Max ('Road Warrior' for you Americans out there), in was like this in Braveheart, it was like this in Rob Roy, and it was like this in virtually action/drama ever made. For the film to succeed, an audience should be 'angry' when the relatives get fried, and 'pumped' when the good guy gets revenge. I was pretty non-plussed on both counts.As for specifics:Russell Crowe is good but not fantastic (and nowhere near as good as his performance in LA Confidential)Oliver Reed's character is overdone and annoying (the only thing he adds to the film is the 'pick which scenes Olly is dead in' game - as he died before filming finished and is computer generated in some parts).The CGI effects are, as always, dreadful. Although the stadium itself looks ok from the inside, the wider shots of Rome look fake. Why they PERSIST with these crappy effects I don't know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected something stunning from from this film, and it delivered. Ridley Scott has gone off the deep end at last. He isn't even movie director anymore, in the way people normally think of movie directors. He's an artist who makes things that look good when you project them on a screen -- especially a BIG screen."Gladiator" has a plot of sorts, some good acting, a decent script. But Scott just had to throw those in to get the money. What he did with it was create an icy blue forest, decadent Roman tents lit by fire, an idyllic Spanish farm, and a rendering of Rome in gold and charcoal gray. There is not one "straight" shot in the film. There are filters from beginning to end. He clearly spent more time dreaming up colors than plot twists -- and it paid off. Lots of great shots add to the beauty, plus jolting edits, fast motion, and slow motion. But Ridley Scott didn't just make his own Rome on a computer because he couldn't film the real one, anymore than Whistler painted his mother because he didn't have a camera handy.Don't wait for video, take it all in on the big screen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this film. I have seen it three times and would see it again in a minute. It was much better than Titanic (I would love to see Russell Crowe battle Leonardo DiCaprio...boy, would that be funny!) A lot of people complained that the storyline was familiar and simple. Well, most epics are similar..and why does one need complicated storylines all the time?? I thought it was refreshing to see a character that was truly good, without hidden agenda's or alterior motives. All of the acting was wonderful, but I have to especially mention Russell Crowe. I first saw him in L.A. Confidental (which he deserved an oscar for) and have seen most of his movies. Whether or not they were good (like Virtuosity or Rough Magic) he did a wonderful job. I think the thing that amazed me the most about his performance was the way he could show so much emotion without talking--through his eyes. It made me want to cry, seeing the emotions that man expressed. I have to also mention the acting of Joaquin Phoenix...I couldn't decide whether I despised or pitied him more. Making the audience hate him really demonstrates his acting abilities, imo. The special effects, music, and acting combine to be one of the greatest epics of the past three decades....a must see.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie expecting it to be nothing but guts and gore and lots of screaming. Boy, was I wrong! Yes, there was some of all those things, but what also came off the screen was an absorbing story of a man's determination to bring his life full circle -- make it complete by avenging those who had wronged him. The computer generated effects were far above those of TITANIC and the work done in the battle scenes was simply awe-inspiring. I had a few quibbles: the relationship between Drucilla and Maximus prior to the opening of the movie was not explained and the speed of the opening battle varied from slow to fast and it was hard to keep an eye on any one person. Very minor things! I spent $4.75 to see the movie and it was WELL WORTH IT! I think I've recovered from the belly flop that was TITANIC. I can now go to a theatre and spend my money with confidence. There ARE good movies out there!</fullReview>

It was a pleasure to see someone play the anti-hero in McQueen/Eastwood style. Supporting roles by great veterans like Richard Harris and Oliver Reed (the film is dedicated to him, having passed away last year after a drinking contest on Malta) make the cast and acting performances complete for me. Joaquin Phoenix, While a great actor-to-be, wants to star a little bit to much for my likeing, however he presents a villain devlish seldom seen on the white screen.Thirdly, having a major part in accomplishing that, the music contributes in a great way to the whole ambiance.

		<fullReview>A visual delight indeed. This film appears to be a facetious attempt toward Hollywood and the 21st century moviegoer. It is a true mess of celluloid. While the film possesses a visual charm, it tends to stray in to an array of images that leave the senses feeling sick. It is a difficult film to watch because so much resides on imagery than on historical importance. Yes, it has action, suspense,and beautiful people to look upon (and some ugly) yet, it is forgettable. Scott seems like he lost control of the picture and I don't blame him for the script is so one dimensional and portrayed by the actors on such a corny level-what is one to do? Well, a smart director would give Hollywood and the comfortably numb what they want, A mindless romp through the Roman Empire using high tech imagery and pop celtic/fantasy music to leave us agasped. This is what we get for the money spent? The pop culture eats it up while the higher culture sulks in it's humility for buying a ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb cinematography, breathtaking stunts &amp; excellent performances particularly Russell Crowe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is one of those rareties in Hollywood these days that transcends the boundaries of commercial and independent films. It is a film that is undoubtedly a blockbuster but is so well acted and directed that it simply cannot be categorised as one.The most obviously appealing feature of the film are the breathtaking action sequences especially those in the collosieum. it can be argued that they are simply too fast but the speed of the stunts actually adds to the ferocity of the gladitorial fight scenes.What separates the film however from most of its inferior contemporaries, such as Rob Roy &amp; Braveheart is great acting and direction. Russell Crowe stands tall not merely as a Gladiator but also as an actor with great screen presence and charisma. It is simply the culmination of a series of fine performances following on from L.A. confidential &amp; The Insider. On this occasion it is sincerely hoped that that his achievements will finally be rewarded with an Oscar at the next Academy Awards. The surprise bonus of the film is Joaquin Phoenix however who makes a rather good villain in a departure from his standard bit part roles in films like 8mm.The final postscript should be reserved for Ridley Scott, a particular favourite of mine. His direction is careful yet never slow and simply the latest in a long line of great films -remember The Bladerunner &amp; Alien.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardly original, but terrific entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is not an original film. There's tons of comparisons to "Braveheart" floating around, but there's dozens of movies that came before, and dozens more will come that have this same basic story. Sympathetic powerful man is wronged by those around him, loses everything, comes back to attempt vengeance against the forces that destroyed him. Frankly, there's much better comparisons than "Braveheart". "High Plains Drifter", "Rob Roy", even films like "Payback" just to name a few of many.But this is unimportant. A film like "Gladiator" is not about originality. It's about sweeping vision, high production value, and engrossing entertainment. And "Gladiator" achieves all this extremely well. You'll hardly believe 2 1/2 hours have gone by when you reach the end of this film. The portrayal of ancient Rome is exciting and believable, the story is predictable yet gratifying, and the directing is interesting without being distracting. I particularly enjoyed the rapid cutting of fight scenes, which Ridley Scott has managed to make both exciting and excruciating without showing excessive gore, and without highlighting fake swordplay.While I think the cries of "Oscar!" only serve to illustrate how haphazardly Oscars are handed out, the performances are very good. Joaquin Phoenix is particularly effective as the despicable, creepy, yet pitiful Commodus. Russell Crowe is an excellent fit for our grimy hero, and Connie Nielsen lights up the screen with her refined beauty and presence.Ridley Scott has demonstrated his slick professionalism as a director in a way that has not been seen since "Blade Runner". "Gladiator" is a big movie, and it deserves to be seen on a big screen. Go to the theater before it's too late, there hasn't been a movie as deserving of a big screen and big sound since "Titanic".I rated this movie 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not without faults (the one that first comes to mind is the thumb-out, thumb-in error), but none of them are worth recommending for anyone to see who can stomach a lot of violence. The plot is far from original, a betrayed warrior's wife and children are murdered by the new Roman emperor and he goes through hell and highwater to meet him in the obligatory fight scene climax.The characters in this movie are good enough, but they are always so sad. I think Russell Crowe only smiles once, but then again, his life is in shambles. Joaquin Phoenix (who should be praised just for taking a role whose character's name is Commodus) suffers from some sort of twisted form of the Oedipus Complex. All of the supporting cast do a good job of filling their roles even though they're basically invisible. Just throw-in characters to feed the plot between Commodus and Maximus. And I'm not sure everyone's accents are consistent with how they actually spoke back then, considering the era.What the picture lacks most, though, is special effects. A movie like this should strive to serve up eye-candy, but instead it looks like second-rate computer graphics. I was expecting a glorious view of ancient Rome, but instead the colisseum looks drab, almost like someone snapped a photo of a video game using high speed film. Even the scenes that show flashbacks and past emotions look... easy, for lack of a better word.But I must praise this film for its engrossing qualities. Any movie over 2.5 hours in length is subject to get boring, or at least experience a lull somewhere during the middle. But not Gladiator. The character development is sufficient and it makes us care about the characters and what happens to them. The battle scenes are passable, and the director wisely uses choppy editing techniques to disguise the sword fighting abilities of Russell Crowe and others. Usually that's not a good sign, but the point here is to see and feel the intensity and vengeance that Maximus fights with, and it works.So based on what I wrote in the last paragraph I'm recommending this film. It is by no means transcends its genre and probably will not be considered a classic, but it does well as a stand-alone movie, and it is entertaining.*** (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I were a betting man I would say that I have just seen the film that will win Best Picture at next Spring's Academy Awards. This is the most riveting film I have seen since Titanic, even if it is rather "Braveheart meets Spartacus." It was still inventive, masterfully crafted and just plain awesome. Three thumbs up for this one. LIVE, LIVE, LIVE, LIVE.</fullReview>

One more thing that I would like to point out (that angelo-29 didn't) is the use of different colors related to different characters: cool colors for "the bads" and warm ones for "the goods" (Russell Crowe). Yeah! Russell Crowe... who is he? Where does he come from? I cannot answer these questions, but I'm quite sure where he is going to: fame! He has been a very pleasant surprise to me (and to female surfers I can tell he is very handsome...!). Rossana</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great visuals, plot contrived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw gladiator, I couldn't help juxtaposing it with Braveheart: Very similar story lines and both movies try to be epic in scope (not to mention that people compare the two australian stars, russell crowe and mel gibson). I enjoyed Gladiator's breath-taking visuals and its WWII style battle scenes and even its occasional gore, but i walked away from the movie thinking that it was lacking something. Gladiator lacked qualities that made braveheart a true epic. Perhaps i speak too harshly of gladiator because i compare it to Braveheart, but i thought that braveheart was immensely more powerful. Gladiator's Maximus, though suave, spent too much of early screen time not wanting to be involved (then later being forced into action) whereas Wallace from braveheart is shown as a child to build history and align the audience's sight and sympathy with the soon-to-be older wallace. Beyond little petty things such as that, Braveheart is more more grand in scope than gladiator. Braveheart dealt with the issue a nation of people who were struggling againt tyranny and the passion of one man, further powered by the fury of his slain bride, to free his country. Gladiator shows corruption within one system of government and one man who is quite indifferent about it. Only later... way later does Gladiator push its protagonist into limelight to shake up the scene; but with what motivation? Only that to avenge his lost family (something that braveheart used as its auxillary motivation) and to kill the corrupter of Rome. Sorry Maximus, but Rome became corrupt anyway. Talk about phyrric victories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can be said about this? It was pushed as a bloke movie, but it isn't. Its been suggested it is a mindless action flick, using computer effects to take attention away from a flimsy plot - not so. The script is fine and a hundred times better than the last epic I was unfortunate enough to see in the cinema - Titanic. Gladiator has a lot of heart and yes, the story may be a little hackneyed, there may be reminders of everything from Ben Hur to Caligula, but the acting is superb, the effects (which don't detract from the story) are great and the whole piece is very enjoyable. Proof that the epic isn't dead and that Hollywood can still make decent thoughtful films when it wants to. Excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First the good, I finally got to see what the big deal about the Roman Empire was. When you read it in books and see it in pictures it doesn't have the same punch as when it becomes a living breathing thing as it does in Gladiator. Russel Crowe is great as Maximus and Phoenix makes Commodus the biggest wussy in recent cinema. Overall, I give a big yippie-yahoo to Gladiator for a nice escape from whatever you are escaping from. My only complaint? It was just a wee bit long and the drama-love story aspect of it just was a bit of a letdown. How long did it take Maximus to get from Germania to his house anyway? Did anyone else notice that his hair had grown out? Who cares, right? Enjoy the show...but, I suggest you buy a snack and hit the head before settling in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film will probably go down as an all time good film. The story line was good and the acting excellent. For the best part of the film I was interested although there were times????One problem that I had with the film, was that all the action shots were flashed by jumping from one scene to another without allowing your brain to take in what it was seeing. It reminded me very much of the subliminal advertising where words are flashed up on a screen so quickly, your eyes may see them but your mind doesn't consciously register them.I came out wondering what the hell I had just watched. Never the less, I still feel that this was a great film that would entertain a large spectrum of the movie going public ranging from pure action seekers to those who prefer their action more in the form of a good honest wife loving husband and father.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spectacle worthy of classic Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, my boyfriend complained that it was too much like Braveheart, but that's only on a superficial comparison. Wow, I can't begin to explain what a great film this was. It managed to captivate and excite the entire time. There was humor and great pathos and insane emperors and the noble warrior with a heart of gold. All the things that MIGHT have added up to a cheezy overblown Hollywood machine if the actors weren't so fabulous. Oliver Reed can be proud of his final performance, one of the best of his career. Finally Russell Crowe captures a starring role where he can let his fine acting talent shine while showcasing those gorgeous looks of his. And Joaquin Phoenix makes you both hate and feel a modicum of pity for the tortured and malicious young emperor. It's a flick that can appeal to guys and girls (if the girls can stomach the quick cuts of violence and gore) and DEFINITELY DEFINITELY go see it! the visuals alone of the Roman colosseum, the tigers, and the gladiating sequences are worth the admission.</fullReview>

But he's talking not only to the fans on the bleachers, he's also talking to those watching the film "Gladiator." The film is not a story about a hero - it's a story about the herd - ie: the Roman mob. Would there have been such a tragedy if vox populi (popular opinion) did not ask for it? They were the ones who wanted it. Likewise, we are the ones who are asking for it now. Are we so different from the Roman mob?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a pretty damn good movie, but they could have made it great. Some of the action sequences were sped up, which took away from the coolness of it. Also, some of the dialogue was quite bad, which decreased the value some as well. Plus, the villain, Commodus, did not strike any sort of fear in me at all, or at the very least, respect. Last time I checked, the villains (esp. of movies such as this) were supposed to strike terror in people's hearts, but all this guy does is whine incessantly like a little girl, and I don't know about you, but little girls don't scare me. However, even with all these faults, the movie is still quite good and I'd recommend seeing it. However, if you want a superior epic movie, see Braveheart.</fullReview>

At the very first moment of the movie i knew that i would enjoy it the score by Hans Zimmer &amp; Lisa Gerrard during the battle with the barbarian is really great, we have the feeling of all the "grandeur" of the Roman army, its like nothing can't stand in the way of this highly technical advanced army for this time ... The brutality of the combat (a la Braveheart) is true to what it most have been during this time ... The rest of the movie is just great fight scene, special effect a very well done and not overuse and good dialogue ... Finally i just love the theme of this movie of honor, loyalty and courage values that we should preserve in our modern society ... 9/10</fullReview>

Now this movie didn't earn very much recognition, but I'm sure Gladiator will. The movie had me hooked from the beginning with the battle between the Romans and Barbarians. The panoramic shot of the battle was breathtaking. Russell Crowe delivers one heck of a performance, as one would say "whoa". I heard myself muttering that word over and over again. The battles are very well done and flow with smooth perfection. I was a little disappointed with the ending, but it was definitely fitting, nonetheless. This movie is a must-see, for movie fans of all genres. Gladiator delivers a bit of everything. Perfect 10.</fullReview>

This film is an epic but the computer effects let it down just a little bit. Why is it that in all good stories the women are flaky and the kids always give away the plot?

		<fullReview>Don't expect a history lesson here, but who does that anyhow? It's an ancient action movie in amazing modern visual design!! The computer-generated colosseum &amp; the old city of Rome, the gladiator fights, the set and costume design and, of course, the excellent actors make this movie worth seeing. Russell Crowe is brilliant as the general who...(you surely know the movie trailer), Joaquin Phoenix is convincing as Commodus even though sometimes slightly annoyingly overacting his part, but I especially liked Connie Nielsen as his sister who tries to save Rome from her brother's folly while at the same time being in fear of him.Still the film has its flaws as e.g. the sometimes rather incoherent story line, or its at times overtly annoying score (which in general, in my opinion, was not suitable for this kind of movie--it sounds most often more like the soundtrack for a medieval English history drama). But these are rather minor cracks in an overall very entertaining and enjoyable film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read over some of the past comments and have seen many contradictory statements. Of course this is to be expected from the diverse viewers we have, so I think it may be hard to actually get an average review.I must say that I loved this movie. I have always been fascinated by historically based fantasies, especially medieval and roman. So of course I felt an obligation to see Hollywood's latest attempt. Of course this dedication I have is not a resented one, because many of the past works I have witnessed are very good indeed.So I embarked on my trip to the cinema with little more than a rough idea of what it was all about. I emerged with the feeling that I had in fact stepped back in time.I thought that the whole concept of the movie was excellent. I can never get enough of producer's manipulation of history. The costumes were enchanting, the computer animation for the Colosseum was perfected.The acting, though, was what really captivated me. My favourite being Joaquin Phoenix. Him being the brother of the mesmerizing late River Phoenix, I knew that I was to see some good acting. But of course I had my doubts. In th past many let's say, aspiring, actors have tried to stumble in their siblings success. They then deliver a so-so performance, wrecking whatever status they were on to begin with. This in mind, I believed that Joaquin would be good, but not that good. I was wrong. The way he brought his character's personality to life, was captivating. Every little detail was manipulated so as to bring Commodus' insanity to it's full extent. Though, he was evil, the vulnerability was always there, always seeping through.So to conclude I must give it a score of 9/10. I would give a full 10 but the gore did at some times exceed even my limits.If you enjoy being captivated I strongly recommend you see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thinking to see another silly hollywood action movie with some american rambo-cowboy pretending to be a roman soldier i went to see gladiator. But when the lights went out and the movie started, like everybody else in the theatre, all i could do is hang on to my seat and stare at the screen and be totally impressed. This movie is just amazing, its been years since any motion picture got a hold of me in any way whatsoever (last one was URGA, another must see if you love good movies) I had completely forgot what it was like to be gripped, thrilled and be pulled into a story by a master director. Perhaps the good thing about it was i had no idea what to expect, didn't even know who directed it. After the movie ended the surprising thing was it was the silence in the theatre, everybody was so impressed nobody felt the need to talk. My advice is, if you want to see what a real motion picture is like, go and see gladiator in the cinema. For me this is the ultimate in its genre, completely thrilling action, great dramatic story and totally believable caracters. Of course the fact it shut up 500 noisy macho's in the theatre is something worth mentioning too :)</fullReview>

His opponent Mr Phoenix has quiet a difficult role, the hero is loved by everyone,but he plays a man most people don t like,although he is victim and perpetrator in one person,a complexe character.His growing madness is really impressing. And then Mrs Nielsen between the two different men,her convincing fear against her brother ,such a great performance. Not to forget the other actors which make possible that the audience is dipping in a former epoch and living through it.Also my congratulations to the whole crew in the background.Nothing has really changed since now,we only observe the games in the television and we have not to go to the arena,we want to be entertained and we have reached another form of brutality. This film is like a mirror. Mr Scott uses entertainment that we are forced to see in this mirror.For these efforts an Oscar nomination is waiting, For strength and honor.</fullReview>

What I especially find so amazing is the details - for instance how both the ageing emperor, Marcus Aurelius, and his son, Commodus, have a harelip or how the colour of the light chances: warm and red in Marcus Aurelius' tent as he speaks with Maximus - cold and blue as Maximus steps out of the tent. And historical facts make the movie so much more interesting; how the emperors kept the people happy and in the hollow of the hand with food and entertainment or how the gladiators kept wealthy women "happy" (it was the sword the women liked).Altogether this is not a movie anyone should let go unnoticed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected much before I saw this film and as every film fan knows; you should never expect things before you see a film. So, I didn't like "Gladiator" as much as I thought I would, but I still think it's a good film. It's interesting, the action scenes are great (the opening battle scene is reminiscent of both "Braveheart" and "Saving Private Ryan"), the drama quite interesting, and the acting brilliant. Of course, Russell Crowe has never been better (I haven't seen "The Insider yet, though), and we all know how good he was in e.g. "L.A. Confidential." Joaquin Phoenix doesn't play a very likable character, Commodus is a pathetic loser, but he does a good job with it anyway. Recommended. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting blew me away.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just seen "The Insider" a couple of weeks ago, I was already impressed with Russell Crowe. This film shows his versatility. And maybe it was just the role, but he reminded me of a young Richard Burton.Connie Nielson was excellent also; I had never heard of her before.The one who really awed me though was Joaquin Phoenix. From the movie reviews I was expecting the standard, pure evil bad guy, but this nuanced, complex performance made me feel the inner torture of this character and helped explain how he came to be who he is. I didn't like him, but I couldn't hate him.Even if you don't care for bloody fighting scenes this movie is worth seeing if you love top-notch acting. I will be surprised if we don't hear about "Gladiator" again at Oscar time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Braveheart with Skirts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the summary may seem a little cynical, the most important aspect to remember is that this is a very impressive film. Russell Crowe continues his fine run from 'L.A Confidential' and 'The Insider' and is ably supported by a strong cast. And yes, the battle scenes are excellent, but the overall impression I received from the film was very similar to that of Braveheart. You will see what I mean once you have seen it; the strong lead, the love interest etc. I left feeling thoroughly content with my money spent on the ticket, but felt that the film lacked perhaps the strand of originality which, to my mind is an essential ingredient of classic films, and as such must avoid awarding a full 10/10. The hype is worthy of the film, but I believe it only acquires epic status due to its length and its historic subject matter. Nevertheless, go see it and enjoy - easily worth a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As usual Ridley Scott produces what is visually stunning, almost historically accurate and a picture that holds your imagination for the two plus hours it runs. Russell Crowe is perfect as Maximus the rugged Spaniard who is betrayed by Commodus and wins his freedom in the arena as a Gladiator. Creative sets and use of cg enhance the story but do not intrude on your senses. So don't wait for the video this is a film that deserves to be seen on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie I have seen since Braveheart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see many movies most of them I either don't like or forget what the story was about a week after I see it. This was something special. In an era where studios spend 100 million on special effects and actor's salaries and 5 bucks writing the script this film has great balance of story, action, romance, all the elements that make a story great.The 2 1/2 hours this movie goes for just flies by. If you are one of those people who look for historical accuracy, you will not get it from this picture. The opening seen looked like the beginning of Desert Storm on CNN. But anyhow great picture! If the Academy does not look at this picture come awards time there is something wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott, te saluto! This film was so much better than I expected when I'd seen the trailer, the old city of Roma Aeterna so much better done and the Germans so much more true to the possible truth than in most films! (I still wonder what the German in the beginning says...anyone who knows?) Sure, this is an action movie, but with enough heart and soul to keep you tight in your chair for almost 3 hours, which is more than you can say of most films... Of course, the film is not following the true story (Commodus was, as they say, strangled by a certain Narcissus), but that isn't so important when the film grabs you like this does. So: one complaint: why put in the birds? They're animated and you see it! Why???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie kicked my butt!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is a very simple story. Most of the time, it is a typical war hero adventure. Sometimes it even appears stupid. The plot is not very complex and gets repetitive. The hero kills because he must and that is enough reason for him. He wants to avenge the death of his wife and his kid so he will plow through his enemies until he gets to the man responsible. When he does, he will save the day and all will be well. There are a bunch of other war adventure cliches in between the major plot events. Normally, no matter how compelling the story is, a simple war film will not win me over 100 percent. Although "Gladiator" is very one-dimensional and predictable at times, it surpasses other similar movies. Many elements contributed to grasp my attention and have me surrender to this adventure.As I said the story is simple. General Maximus (Russell Crowe) has just led Rome to yet another victory and the empire has expanded once again. The Caesar, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), is a dying man doubting what he has achieved for his people. Since he has such a close bond with his general he decides to change his mind and ask Maximus to become the next Caesar instead of Marcus Aurelius' incompetent son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Maximus is a simple warrior that only wants one thing: to go home. He knows the exact number of days he has not seen his family. Although he loves Marcus Aurelius, he cannot imagine himself as the next leader of Rome. For that reason, Marcus Aurelius wants him to take over and bring happiness back to the people. As Maximus ponders whether to accept the offer, Commodus finds out about his father's decision. He is heart-broken and jealous and in his rage he murders his father. Quickly he announces himself as the next Caesar. Because Maximus is suspicious and not willing to serve his new leader, Commodus has him arrested and orders an execution. Similarly, he orders Maximus' family to be killed as well. While Maximus escapes, his loved ones are murdered and his house is burned down. The exiled general is eventually captured and bought by Proximo (Oliver Reed) who trains him and many others to be gladiators in a smaller province outside of Rome. Maximus quickly steals the hearts of many spectators and becomes their favorite. Back in Rome, the power hungry Commodus decides to bring gladiator games back to the people of Rome and so a confrontation between the young Caesar and Maximus is evident.Ridley Scott's direction sells this story. He uses dark lighting and vast settings to create a similar tone to the one in "Blade Runner." The darker mood is great in "Gladiator." Not all hero adventures such as this one have to maintain a mostly positive atmosphere. The storytelling is overwhelmingly powerful and very compelling. Dynamic cinematography is effectively used during all major battles and gladiator fights. The music is excellent. It just screams out at you. This simple tale is transformed into the most interesting and engaging picture of this year. Russell Crowe is great as Maximus. He portrays courage, honor, and anger with a warrior's mentality. His repetitive drive for vengeance is forgotten in the way this film is presented. Joaquin Phoenix is even better as Commodus. This is a confused man that wants power, but doesn't know how to get it or what to do with it. He expresses jealousy in sight of anyone who is more loved than he is. That is why he hates Maximus. He believes his father loved Maximus more than he loved him. He wants to feel love from the people of Rome; therefore he will do anything to please them. He wants to be loved by his sister, more than a sister should love her brother. He forces these things and they confuse him. Commodus is in pain and is blind to what he is doing. Ridley Scott makes sure Commodus' eyes are never quite visible in the film. They are always encircled by darkness or make-up. This is exactly the type of character that would be present in the future world of "Blade Runner." Phoenix's performance is Oscar worthy.Because of the performances, the beautiful music, the dark lighting, and the energetic cinematography the simple story of "Gladiator" evolves into an overpowering film. It's good to see a film set in a darker moodier ancient Rome instead of another World War II epic. It's also great to see a movie with so much energy and power that it makes you forget about its simple storyline. Many beautiful sequences in "Gladiator" make this film an unbelievable experience. It is tremendous and seems larger than life. "Gladiator" is better than, say, "Braveheart" simply because of its raw power. "Braveheart" was a great adventure that just wasn't enough in comparison. "Gladiator" is exceptional and surpasses other smarter films in the genre simply because of its overwhelming presence! It will absorb you with all its might. This film might be overlooked during the Oscars because it is another war epic, but hopefully it will get some recognition. "Gladiator" achieves greatness in its dark powerful storytelling and great direction by Ridley Scott. It will be one of the best films of the year. Thank you for making a predictable story burst out as if it was so much more. This movie kicks ass! Overall, a 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been a real master piece and the best movie of the year if a couple of details. The gore is totally exarragated in many parts in which they were not necessary. You expect violence in a movie like this but it was just way too much. Also all the other Gladiators would not have been that nice to Maximus in real life. They would normally just save themselfs. So the movie is not bad but not as good as it could be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even with the typical annoying theater patrons talking and ruffling there packages of Reeses Pieces, this was the fastest two and a half hours of my life. The film was beautifully done and the story line was intriguing. Russel Crowe is destined to be a huge star. I haven't seen him in a film that he hasn't carried.One can't help but see the similarities between Gladiator and Braveheart. A lot has been said about this, and I would have to agree that they are there. However, I can say that Gladiator gives you a much more exciting and uplifting film experience. While Braveheart gave us a dark and dreary Scotland, Gladiator gives us a bold and beautiful protrait of Rome. Gladiator has the dark undertones of its story line, however is filmed in a way that takes them in a lighthearted manor, giving the audience a more exciting ride.I gave Gladiator a 9 out of 10, on sheer excitement. As I sit here and write this review, a get the feeling that it should be higher than that. It was an exiting film and had the great battle scenes that mark a roman epic, however it was a whole lot more than that. The acting was superb and the story was well written. The directing, while not typical of Ridley Scott, was wonderful. His use of CGI was the best I have seen as of yet. He did rely on it, rather used it to make picture more beautiful. The balance between the action and the storyline was perfect. All and all Gladiator was a ride worth taking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sure glad I decided to go see the new epic film "Gladiator." This movie is sure to be a hit with all audiences! Set in the glory days of Rome, the film is about a former commander who is enslaved and must be a gladiator to seek revenge and survive. Could somebody say "summer blockbuster"? It is not inside confidential information anymore, Russell Crowe is not just a fine actor but now he is a big star. His performance as the gladiator was subtle, but yet, powerful. Co-star Joaquin Phoenix also delivered a swashbuckling performance. However, he still has many rivers to cross before he gets to Crowe's acting status. Follow my advice- Do not save it for later, go see "Gladiator." **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After weeks of waiting and waiting to see this movie, I finally got round to seeing 'Gladiator' this afternoon. I'd read a lot of reviews praising it, and I've always liked Ridley Scotts' work. Here he proves again what a brilliant director he is. 'Gladiator' has got to be the best Roman epic since....well, 'Ben Hur'. Russell Crowe is not a name I'd heard of till seeing this film, but I expect we'll be hearing a lot more of him after this. He is simply superb. He has a good mixture of toughness and emotion in it to make you sympathise with him, and will him on. Joaquin Phoenix's bad guy emperor is a brilliantly nasty, and probably a bit mad character, who you want to see get punished. Well, everyone is brilliant, lets face it, cos it *is* a Ridley Scott movie, and he always casts well. All in all, brilliant. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who goes to the movies to be entertained, and expects to come out of the cinema feeling happy, is going to be disappointed by GLADIATOR. This is an unhappy movie with an unhappy hero,unhappy people who lived in unhappy times and an unhappy ending. True, there are tremendous action scenes enhanced by digital sound but to those of us who are now aware of techniques involving blue screens, green screens and CGI, these scenes are just reminders as to what can be achieved by way of computer magic. It is a fact that if GLADIATOR is compared with movies like BEN HUR and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS it would pale into insignificance considering that the makers of the first two movies had only stunt persons and basic 'camera tricks' with which to work although they had the advantage of stars like Peter Ustinov, Robert Taylor. Charlton Heston, Yul Brynner etc etc to bring their stories to dazzling life. Too much computer imagery and too little reality would be my description of GLADIATOR. I stress that this is MY opinion. It may not necessarily be the opinion of others who look for different attributes in the movies they choose for entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The digital special effects were a disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie to see Russell Crowe and the digital special effects. The digital special effects were a disappointment. The biggest being when Russell Crowe went into the Coliseum in Rome for the first time. I was not impressed by the panning around the Coliseum. A good deal of it looked artificial to me. I could plainly pick out the digital stuff. When they were building the Coliseum and there was a shot going over the under construction building it was obviously digitized. In the movie there was a shot from high up towards the ground of the Coliseum and you saw all these small people and they seemed Sim City like. Any scene that had a flock of birds was disturbingly not realistic and poorly digitally created. I am sure that they could have done a much better job. I liked Russell Crowe in this film and just mused to myself what it would have been like if Dr. Wigand could have gone into a telephone booth and come out Gladiatorman and slaughtered all the CEO's of the tobacco companies at the senate hearings. It would have been neat to see right arms flying and heads rolling. The fight scene at the beginning of the film was truncated and did not seem to be as effective as it could have been. Check out Braveheart. The fight scenes in this film are excellent but Russell Crowe does not look like what I envision a Roman to look like. I think of Kirk Douglas. Russell Crowe has the looks of a bloke in an Aussie pub. One of the best performances in the film was given by Oliver Reed. I really feel this is one of his very best. Richard Harris also does fine work as Marcus Aurelius. I did not even recognize David Hemmings of Blow-Up fame. He obviously doesn't have the Dorian Gray portrait thing going on. The Emperor is a puff and I could not help thinking of the Monty Python film The Life of Brian where the Emperor says "What do they find so amooosing?" I recommend seeing this film for the performances of Russell Crowe, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris but do not expect to be bowled over by the digital special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the critics have entirely missed the reason that people want to see this movie more than once and why some call it the best picture they have ever seen. It isn't because of the action scenes or the digitized recreations, both of which are tremendously well done. Nor is it because of the wonderful acting by several members of the cast or Ridley Scott's incomparable cinematography. The fact is, none of these elements is independent; all are choreographed to work toward one theme in the movie. Scott has an exceptional talent for doing this, as shown by his other films such as Alien, where sound and action and acting were so seamlessly integrated to produce a sense of impending doom and terror.But in Gladiator the theme is entirely different and it is all embedded in the character of Maximus. As in all the epic historical movies this is a study of virtue combined with strength. Maximus is at ease with himself, as are we, and the lack of internal conflict would normally cause us to loose interest, but he is such an admirable person that we become only more involved as the movie progresses. The artifice and cruelty of Roman society, and of course the character of Commodus, are provided to enhance the sense of Maximus nobility. But there is something in Maximus' which represents a fundamental link between nature and man, life and death, which is presented with such direct simplicity and appealing honesty that we must be attracted by it.Maximus is a man of the earth, a fact repeatedly illustrated in the movie, from his stated love of the land to the close-ups where he dusts his hands in the soil before battle. More than this, he shows us a man whose strength comes from this devotion to the earth. If Ben-Hur gave us a man to admire for his devotion to faith, and Spartacus a man with noble conviction about human value and dignity, then Gladiator does equally well in showing a man whose attunement with nature is both shield and sword, for whom death and life are part of one experience, and who has taken unshakable faith from those beliefs.A character in TV's presentation of Arabian Nights said that fairy tales show us how to win. I think that drama and acting, at its best, shows us how to be, and the portrayal of Maximus has reached that height. We are all carried along by this earth. The inevitable forces it imposes on us finally transcend the society we create to shut it out. Seeing this illustrated in a film can be a moving experience.If you don't see this, then all you see is a thin plot pumped up by fight scenes and computer graphics, which, however well done, will never be in a class with the great films of the past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most epic movie for years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator by Ridley Scott is easily the biggest and most dramatic movie since...oh, heck, its just GREAT. The story is straightforward and simple, but (as some folks wrongly thought) thats nothing to complain about. The best stories are the most simple ones, and this one is about classic elements like friendship, betrayal and revenge. Granted, its a mens movie. So if you dont like it go see the new Julia Roberts comedy.The Acting is just terrific. Crowe, who already was great in "L.A. Confidential" and "Virtuosity" is going to get an Oscar or ill never again enter a movie theatre. Phoenix is also terrific as his Nemesis who has some very human weaknesses. The supporting cast is also very good. Its also nice to see Ridley Scott back in town.The CGI Graphics are not always convincing; they look too artificial. Most impressive, however, are the battle scenes (did I hear someone say "Braveheart"? As another guy here pointed out, the battle scenes in "Braveheart" looked like a picnic, compared to "Gladiator". Nothing to add here.). The fight against the guy with the face mask, surrounded by tigers, is just breathtaking."Gladiator" is simply the best movie for some years (if you dont count "Star Wars", which is beyond and above competition).Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the hype!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now don't get me wrong, Gladiator is not a bad film, it simply isn't as good as everyone seems to be saying it is. For some reason it has captured the imagination of what I call the James Bond audience, the people who only go to the movies once or twice a year and this has artificially inflated it's rating. There are plenty of other people writing about how good the film is, so I'm going to concentrate on it's flaws.Firstly, it is far too long. Clearly the producers wanted to make an epic like in the old days, but they seemed to have assumed that epic means length. Wrong! I'm sure a half-decent producer could have taken at least half and hour out of the film. It takes far too long to get going. After the inital battle, which for me was the high-point of the film, there is no action for about 45 mins. This is the point where the plot takes place. The problem is, the characters are all so cardboard that the audience can easily work out what the plot is about, and five minutes here would have been more than ample.The fight scenes were some of the worst I have ever seen. You would think Ridley Scott (or his second unit director) would have seen The Matrix, a Jackie Chan film, or at least one Martial Arts film. That is how to direct an interesting fight; long, stationary shots showing off the skills of the stuntmen, not close-ups and constant irritating cutting on movement. It was impossible to work out what was going on in most of the fight scenes.Thirdly, there is far too much CGI. Yes it was impressive to recreate the Coliseum, but then they ruin the effect with overkill. And the CGI tigers were absolutely awful. Surely real tigers would have been cheaper and far more impressive.Fourthly, historical accuracy... oh we don't need to bother with this, after all, it's only a movie...And don't forget the wonderful array of accents!I can't help comparing the film to Ben Hur or Spartacus and I'm afraid that Gladiator comes a poor second in terms of story and spectacle.</fullReview>

The attention to detail in the Roman soldiers uniforms and their battle tactics was very satisfying. It was nice to see that somebody read a history book before making the film. This is a Big Screen movie. It will not have the same impact on the television. See it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an epic, but entertaining nonetheless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator turns out to be a fairly standard revenge story, but one that is good enough so that if you're reasonably willing to be entertained, it will have you cheering for the good guy in the end. The story is not all that deep, and while none of the characters except the bad guy are really fleshed out all that deeply (they're pretty much all stock), you are given enough of the story to make all of the characters' motivations quite believable. The movie occasionally attempts to make a social or political statement, but never really delves into the meaning of it very far before the story changes gears. I was quite impressed by the effects, though, and enjoyed being given the architecture of Rome in her glory than just seeing lots of things blowing up (some shots of the Colosseum are quite impressive). When the action is on, it is good with some exciting, if hectic, fight scenes. But this is not an action movie by any stretch, with the fights really being few and far between. The actors and actresses all turn in very good performances. Crowe's character wasn't called on to display a wide range of emotion or to show a serious internal struggle, as his "job" is made quite clear from early on. But he still commands a strong presence onscreen and easily becomes a hero you feel good about rooting for.While not quite what I'd call an epic, due to its fairly straightforward (though far from dumb) story and lack of a strong message, I was still highly entertained and left quite satisfied at the end. If you're looking for serious subject matter or deep characterizations or loads of action, steer clear. But if you're not overly cynical when a moviemaker is just trying to entertain you, this will most likely be an enjoyable experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Story, but Historically Inaccurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an interesting story, but historically was a little bit mixed up. It combines figures from different points in Roman History. The real General Maximus was declared emperor after conquering Britain, by his troops and some locals. He then went to Germany entered an alliance with the Emperor of the Eastern Empire. He then attacked the Western empire and emperor Gratian and Gratian was killed in battle. Maximus ruled some of the northern and western provinces for a few years and then decided to invade Italy and took over the whole Western Empire for a year or so, then got into a war with the Eastern empire, and lost, and was executed. Marcus Aurelius was an interesting emperor, but he lived 200 years earlier. His chief general in Germany was Avidius Cassius, who usurped him a couple of years before he died, and the conflict forced him to appoint Commodus as joint emperor several years before he died. Commodus went insane, (possibly due to lead poisoning), and was eventually strangled by a gladiator as part of an assassination plot by his sister and his own cabinet. Enjoy the movie, but try to keep it in historical perspective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maximus, a great Roman general commanding troops against the Germans in the second century, is chosen by the aging Marcus Aurelius to be the next emperor. Commodus, Marcus' son, and the only other person privy to these plans besides Maximus and Marcus, kills his father and attempts to kill Maximus. Maximus escapes only to sold as a slave bound for the gladiatorial games. From here, he must survive to have his revenge.The action is very, very good, but the long scenes of dialogue drag. This is a very simple story whose best parts are the action. I must disagree with most IMDb viewers; this is not one of the best movies of all time...but it is entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, yet typical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Russell Crowe did a decent job in this film, the movie certainly lacked in substance. While I will say I was entertained, by the end of the film, I was very ready to leave. To start it off, not only is the storyline cliched, but a good portion of it was taken from Braveheart. In all fairness, any heroic tale will have similar concepts, but there were too many direct parallels to be ignored. Secondly, the acting was nothing spectacular -- Crowe did a wonderful job (with the little he was given to work with), but Joaquin Phoenix left his character as shallow as one comes to expect from a big-budget Hollywood film. There were two scenes I was impressed by in the film -- the opening battle, and the battle re-enactment in the Coliseum. The opening sequence was shot very masterfully -- I thought the camera effects and silence definitely added to the intensity. The scene in the Coliseum was pretty cool, too, but it lacked the depth and sincerity of the opening sequence. Instead, its use of teamwork and anticipation was stolen directly from the scene in Braveheart with the large wooden spears used against the cavalry. The storyline is very uninspired, the characters are shallow, and there is no need to use your brain at any point. All in all, the film lacked depth. It was what has become of Hollywood -- large budget = crowdpleaser = crap. Gladiator, you've failed as a film - 46%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only One Minor Flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is only one flaw in Gladiator and that is that the cinematography frequently takes attention away from what is happening instead of staying decently, and professionally, out of the way of how the action/story is proceeding. There was a time that the camera spun around with no real reason to do so. It might also be said that the choice of color and/or exposure is sometimes intrusive also because it is too unnatural. There are some areas of the story where it would be "natural" as in the Elysian Fields or in the candlelite tent of Caesar. But none of this is too intrusive, it's just that in a masterpiece it is the only intrusive element. Maybe it can be fixed up in later editions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As stated on the One line Summary, this comment will be short, so without further ado here it goes: Hasnt anyone noticed the uncanny resemblance of Gladiator (2000) with the 1964 Classic "The Fall of the Roman Empire" directed by Anthony Mann and starring (only to name a few) Sophia Loren, Stephen Boyd, Christopher Plummer, Alec Guiness, etc..? As I watched the movie on the screen the other day, I could not help but make comparisons all the way. The only thing is that the Generals name was changed from Livius to Maximus, and the ensuing love affair between him and the Emperors daughter Lucilla. Which, in this version, is not fully developed because they never explain in depth, or at least, enough to know for certain, but you can only speculate on many levels. Anyhow, just wanted to give my 2 cents, for whatever they are worth. Hope I did not spoil it for anyone. Sorry guys!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Far and away the best movie I've seen since "Saving Private Ryan" nearly two years ago. I've seen it twice at the theater, and have every intention of seeing it again before the summer ends. I'm fervently hoping that Hollywood realizes how successful "historical fiction" can be. "Braveheart" is another excellent example. Russell Crowe does an outstanding job as the stoic Roman General Maximus. The supporting cast is excellent as well. Gladiator features plenty of action, but unlike so many "swordplay" movies, the action does not seem overly unrealistic. What really seperates Gladiator from so many other similar movies is the fact that one never loses interest in the plot as the action unfolds. There are no tiresome "downtime" sequences, nor does one get a sense that the ending of the movie was rushed in any way. The movie flows from start to finish, and is a great ride for the entire 3 hours.I'm really hoping to see Crowe cast in similar roles...the hero in a serious/realistic movie. I'll definitely take note of any movie in which he appears from now on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this movie is not the best Ridley Scott movie ever, Blade Runner is, it is an excellent way to be entertained. It is a fun summer movie that isn't stupid!!! As opposed to most blockbusters from the summer season, this movie has a plot! And not a bad one. Granted, it is not highly original, and it certainly isn't exceptional, but it is very appropriate for the movie. Russel Crowe's character, Maximus, is very simple, but Crowe has the power to make you care about him, and believe in what he believes. A very good hero indeed. Joaquin Phoenix is satisfying as Commodus, but he relies too heavily on the same techniques to make you feel how is character feels. But he makes you hate Commodus and, that is his role in the movie: the bad guy. He does it well but not incredibly well. Connie Nielsen is good as Lucinda. So, the cast is good, particularly Crowe as the hero. Ridley Scott's directing is perfect. The confusion of the arena is well portrayed, and you see very well how horrible this place was. The sets are incredible, and you can't say what is real and what is CGI. The action sequences are thrilling. As I said earlier, the story isn't too deep or original but it works. Gladiator is a really entertaining movie with a satisfying story.84%</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I haven't seen a gladiator movie in a long time, but, I thought they were all rather simplistic. Sword and sandals epics, they?re called. Togas and tigers. Chariots and fire. Arenas and amphitheaters. Columns and colosseums. The new movie, Gladiator, is chance to see all that stuff. That was about what I expected. Not a day at the beach.You have to remember the genre. The filming expenses became greater than the box office totals, so, they haven?t made this kind of movie in almost 40 years. The subject matter is violence. Got that? A gladiator fights to the death. Therefore, the main course here is bloody, hand-to-hand combat, served with war, duty, ambition, murder, injustice, betrayal, and revenge, with small side orders of politics and philosophy. And for dessert, more blood and death. A friendly word of advice? Don?t sit in the first two rows. By today?s standards, it has to come out different than what?s been done before. It comes out dark, somber, dour, gloomy, and computer-generated. Yeah, I really miss those light-hearted films about ancient Romans and barbarians, too, but what do you think it was really like? I know I wouldn't want to live back then. Neither would Kirk Douglas, Charleton Heston, nor the late Victor Mature, nor the late Steve Reeves, I'm guessing.This movie is getting mixed reviews. I suppose it could have been better in some ways, but that really depends on what you?re looking for. It?s a tragedy, not ?the feel good movie of the summer. Do some people just not get that? This may be the reason for the conflicting opinions. It doesn?t matter if you know the story ahead of time. Just don?t expect to be uplifted and spiritually renewed. All I expected was good acting and some entertainment value. I spent $4.50 at a 1:30 p.m. matinee, and can say I was entertained at times, and certainly didn't feel it was a waste of time and money. Not at all. The ones who get short-changed are women. Their roles in these kinds of movies are nearly always dumb. No exception here.Russell Crowe is always good. He is the movie. If I didn't know any better, I could have sworn that at times he sounded exactly like Mel Gibson, especially in a rare split second when a line of dialogue was delivered with his back is to the camera. Must be the Aussie influence. His commitment to his work, both physically and mentally, is amazing to watch. We have far too few, and can never have too many actors like that. Somebody said they?d pay money to watch him stand around and drink beer. What greater compliment is there?Somebody has to play the bad guy. Joaquin Phoenix has the perfect look for the part, and seems committed, but ends up looking like he?s in over his head. Okay, he got this acting job to do a movie with none other than Crowe, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. That might be a bit intimidating, no? It would be hard for most of us not to look like we suck sharing the screen with those guys. It?s a part for a young Roddy McDowall type, and Phoenix did provided the insipid total psychopath needed, but nobody in this movie was even allowed to have any fun.The late Oliver Reed?s farewell performance was excellent. I loved him in the Musketeers movies of the 70's, and was glad to see him working until the end. That?s one way to go, isn?t it?I thought the special effects were rather seamless, though some of the landscapes do look like gorgeous computer paintings. Though no doubt it makes Rome look better than it was, I thought it strange that I never saw an aqueduct, nor any sunshine. I couldn't tell that England wasn't Germania, and Malta, where a lot of this was shot, is really one awesome-looking place. As far as the action, I noticed from the first battle scene that they had so many fast cuts and too-close close-ups, and so much shaky camera crap that it was mission impossible to actually follow what was happening physical-action-wise from moment to moment. That bothered me, but I doubt they wanted to be too graphic too soon, and figured they first wanted to give a basic feel for the violence, rather than glory in the bloody details. Maybe it was a ratings thing, too. It wasn't quite as guarded later on, though still sometimes challenging to watch.This a must-see, even if it?s just to make up your own mind about the highest-grossing movie of last weekend. You can decide for yourself. That?s the main thing. E-mail and comments are welcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plenty of other folks here have written good reviews about the acting/directing in this film, but I feel a need to whinge.I went to see this film with high hopes and for the most part I was far from disappointed but. there were I feel, failures.The much vaunted special effects were indeed impressive and there were scenes that are truly awesome. However for me the scenes that least required special effects i.e. the fight sequences were ruined by the addition of a bizarre blurring / juddering effect that rendered them unintelligible. Considering it is a film about gladiators you really would expect to be able to see what was going on, especially in the fights.In a sci-fi the effects can be up-front, in a film about gladiators the special effects should be invisible.There that's my whinging over. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film with somewhat low expectations. I don't consider myself a real fan of this genre. My first thought upon seeing the trailer was "Spartacus." After more research, I was concerned this might be a cheap Braveheart-esqe ripoff. I was wrong in both cases. This movie is in a category all to itself, and I loved every bit of it. I haven't experienced a film like this in quite some time ... Gotta go with a "Thumbs Up" in my book. I thought that Ridley Scott did a heckuva job keeping this film moving for the course of 3 hours. I also would say that Russell Crowe is quickly becoming one of the better actors in the business today. His presence on the screen carried several of the movies key scenes. I felt that the plot of the movie was easy to follow, almost cookie-cutter like in that respect, but there were enough turns and twists to keep me satisfied through the course of the film. The effects flat out rock, I was particularly impressed with the opening sequence. This is one that you want to go see again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the preview for gladiator at the cinema I had goose bumps and I knew it would be one of my favorite films.I waited about a month and the less busy day of the week before I went to see it to be sure no one would disturb me. Roman history always fascinated me since I was young. I love the romance,wealth and power of Rome and it's people.This film is the perfect example of the way of life under the control of the ceasars. Gladiator was very well written. The plot is close to reality. The costumes and sets are pieces of art.This movie made me see through roman eyes, through all the violence and blood, through all the hatred and love. This film made me feel...made me cry.As I sit here at my desk, I am close to tears thinking about it.This film really touched me.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott, we salute you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been waiting several months, trembling with anticipation, for the arrival of this film, and I am pleased to say that it did not disappoint me. Russell Crowe is instantly likeable as the world weary General Maximus, commanding the legions about to "unleash Hell" on the armies of Germania. His only aim is to see an end to battle, and return home to his farm and family. Certain events, heralded by the intervention of Joaquin Pheonix as the insane emperor Commodus, spectacularly prevent him from doing so. Commodus is a power mad, snivelling wretch who, when he isn't plotting and scheming to rule Rome, tries his hardest to get his sister into bed. The unfortunate Maximus gets in the way of his plans, and so has to be removed. Maximus winds up in the gladiatorial ring facing a madness far removed from that of the battlefield. He now has a different criteria. To survive the arena and exact revenge on Commodus for the brutal slaying of his wife and son. The battle sequences are bloody, violent and messy, and human life is cheap. But through all of this shines Maximus, a noble but reluctant hero, who touches the life of all those he comes in contact with.The excellent score by Hans Zimmer is powerful and emotional, borrowing some of the choral strains from his Crimson Tide offering, and Holst's Mars theme from the Planets suite. (He was the Roman God of war, after all.) The soundtrack hasn't left my car stereo since I bought it two weeks ago. Reading through other reviews, it seems that people either love or hate this film. I loved it with a passion; something about it touched a nerve. Some scenes left me breathless, while others had me fighting back a tear. I have seen it four times now, and it won't be the last. There are a lot of purists out there who say that Rome was never like this, and that history records these events differently. To these people I say, WHO CARES?! I go to the cinema to be entertained, not watch a documentary. I go to escape from the real world for a few hours, lose myself in fantasy. Surely this was the reason that Cinema was invented.I cannot stop praising this film, much to the dismay of my friends and family. Gladiator should be in receipt of a few statuettes come Oscar time, or there is very little justice in this world. Ridley Scott has, in my humble opinion, produced a masterpiece worthy of praise. We salute you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Titanic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone else see the Titanic parallels here? Kind of a pseudo-epic take on real history. The almost Disney-esque black/white villain/goodguy, the love interest, (although certainly not as direct as the Titanic love interest) and of course, the popular "twist" ending where the hero dies. That seems to be rather popular way of standing out from the standard Hollywood fare these days, but if not careful it can look contrived.Yes, it's formulaic Hollywood on some level, but Gladiator won me over despite that. Beautiful scenery and realistic looking battle scenes (jerky camera, however). Great depiction of the infamous Roman era politics, sons killing fathers, sexual desire for your siblings, corruption...I liked. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is easily the best movie I have seen this year. The main character is tremendously inspiring and by the end of it you are ready to fight for Maximus. In the ending minutes of the movie a hush fell over the theater, and when the credits rolled everyone left in complete silence-to know why you'd have to see it.

		<shortDescription>As the Crowe Flies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I haven't seen a gladiator movie in a long time, but, I thought they were all rather simplistic. Sword and sandals epics, they're called. Togas and tigers. Chariots and fire. Arenas and amphitheaters. Columns and colosseums. The new movie, Gladiator, is chance to see all that stuff. That was about what I expected. Not a day at the beach.You have to remember the genre. The filming expenses became greater than the box office totals, so, they haven't made this kind of movie in almost 40 years. The subject matter is violence. Got that? A gladiator fights to the death. Therefore, the main course here is bloody, hand-to-hand combat, served with war, duty, ambition, murder, injustice, betrayal, and revenge, with small side orders of politics and philosophy. And for dessert, more blood and death. A friendly word of advice? Don't sit in the first two rows. By today's standards, it has to come out different than what's been done before. It comes out dark, somber, dour, gloomy, and computer-generated. Yeah, I really miss those light-hearted films about ancient Romans and barbarians, too, but what do you think it was really like? I know I wouldn't want to live back then. Neither would Kirk Douglas, Charleton Heston, nor the late Victor Mature, nor the late Steve Reeves, I'm guessing.This movie is getting mixed reviews. I suppose it could have been better in some ways, but that really depends on what you're looking for. It's a tragedy, not `the feel good movie of the summer.' Do some people just not get that? This may be the reason for the conflicting opinions. It doesn't matter if you know the story ahead of time. Just don't expect to be uplifted and spiritually renewed. All I expected was good acting and some entertainment value. I spent $4.50 at a 1:30 p.m. matinee, and can say I was entertained at times, and certainly didn't feel it was a waste of time and money. Not at all. The ones who get short-changed are women. Their roles in these kinds of movies are nearly always dumb. No exception here.Russell Crowe is always good. He is the movie. If I didn't know any better, I could have sworn that at times he sounded exactly like Mel Gibson, especially in a rare split second when a line of dialogue was delivered with his back is to the camera. Must be the Aussie influence. His committment to his work, both physically and mentally, is amazing to watch. We have far too few, and can never have too many actors like that. Somebody said they'd pay money to watch him stand around and drink beer. What greater compliment is there?Somebody has to play the bad guy. Joaquin Phoenix has the perfect look for the part, and seems committed, but ends up looking like he's in over his head. Okay, he got this acting job to do a movie with none other than Crowe, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. That might be a bit intimidating, no? It would be hard for most of us not to look like we suck sharing the screen with those guys. It's a part for a young Roddy McDowall type, and Phoenix did provided the insipid total psychopath needed, but nobody in this movie was even allowed to have any fun.The late Oliver Reed's farewell performance was excellent. I loved him in the Musketeers movies of the 70's, and was glad to see him working until the end. That's one way to go, isn't it?I thought the special effects were rather seamless, though some of the landscapes do look like gorgeous computer paintings. Though no doubt it makes Rome look better than it was, I thought it strange that I never saw an aqueduct, nor any sunshine. I couldn't tell that England wasn't Germania, and Malta, where a lot of this was shot, is really one awesome-looking place. As far as the action, I noticed from the first battle scene that they had so many fast cuts and too-close close-ups, and so much shaky camera crap that it was mission impossible to actually follow what was happening physical-action-wise from moment to moment. That bothered me, but I doubt they wanted to be too graphic too soon, and figured they first wanted to give a basic feel for the violence, rather than glory in the bloody details. Maybe it was a ratings thing, too. It wasn't quite as guarded later on, though still sometimes challenging to watch.This a must-see, even if it's just to make up your own mind about the highest-grossing movie of its opening weekend. You can decide for yourself. That's the main thing. e-mail and comments welcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's long. What more needs to be said. You FEEEeeeEEelll The length of this movie and there's nothing you can do about it. Thank God for Russell Crowe or else I would've walked right out. It's actually beautifully shot and the costumes are exquisite. I've always been a sucker for armor. It's got blood and it's got war. It's got slightly interesting sub-plots and everyone in the movie is beautiful. I have to say, I was slightly impressed by the artsiness of "dream sequences" and the unashamed blood bath. But, too long, too draggy and there's nothing they could do about it. It had it's moment and it's memory but I'd never see it again. It's definitely a renter -- but it would be best if you had a wide-screen televison to enjoy the beauty of the filming itself. Defintely NOT an oscar contender. But like I said, Russell Crowe is IN the Colosium (in the house!)</fullReview>

Well crafted and beautifully delivered with a great soundtrack evokes a terrific moviewatching feel.

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott seems to have done it again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great show this was. Gladiator was intense, and extremely well made. The casting was perfect, particularly on the parts of Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Both were startlingly convincing in their roles, and the fighting scenes were absolutely jaw-dropping. There's nothing like brutal violence to make your day complete, right?The only complaint that I have about Gladiator was that I think it was a little too long, but then again, the best movies are generally a bit longer than average. Even more than that, though, were the special effects. In my opinion, if something looks even the tiniest bit fake, then it becomes immediately obvious that the audience is being manipulated, and that takes so much away from the movie. This happened most clearly with the lions toward the end of Gladiator. As a whole, Gladiator was a spectacular film. It should not be missed by anyone (unless you have problems with seeing decapitations) and it will surely be added to Ridley Scott's respectable list of classics. The camera work, the striking use of color, the amazing acting, and the panoramic settings give this film truly epic proportions. Way to go, Ridley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing in the theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected Gladiator to be mediocre thematically, perhaps a cross between The Matrix and Spartacus. As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised. Although I cannot give this film an overwhelmingly positive endorsement, it certainly is worth checking out in a theater. Its greatest strength is, of course, the visual effects. Ancient Rome is recreated so beautifully that my jaw literally dropped during some of the scenes. Additionally, there are some great battle scenes, including a large, "Braveheart-esque" affair and smaller, gladitorial encounters. Overall, it's the kind of brutality you can really sink your teeth into (ie, it's stunning visually and lighthearted enough that you don't really feel bad about being entertained by it).The plot is a bit silly, and the film drags at points. Without the awe-inspiring eye candy, this movie would be merely decent. As is, this is a fine film that foreshadows the kind of film making we can expect with the astronomical increase in special effects quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That Ridley Scott is to be regarded as one of the world's most important and best director (as I always felt despite the lack of power and art in his last efforts), was just proven by the grand-scale drama he directed on GLADIATOR. This is a great movie, mixing high-octane action with deep emotions, striking visuals, wonderful performances and a story that's involving and credible. Despite some freedom to historical fact it is as realistic as any movie ever can hope to achieve. Since I'm not going to give away any insight into the story or character (you should find out about these things by yourself), I'm just going to say: Shakespeare would have loved it, because it's probably the best drama he had never written...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I went to see Gladiator, I expected a trash popcorn movie with lots of special effects - but the film gave me a complete SHOCK !! This is surely the best film I've ever seen (it even overtakes my previous favourite, L.A. Confidential) !!Firstly, the scene : it's breathtaking, absolutely beautiful . The dark and shady forests of Germany, the greatness of Rome, etc. It's so lifelike, that you can feel the ancient air !Secondly, the actors : Russell Crowe is surely the best male actor of our time ! He proved it before in L.A. Confidential and The Insider, but this is even better . He's so real, that it's even scaring ! He became Maximus, that's for sure . But that's not all : Joaquin Phoenix is a disgusting, sadist animal (perfect), Connie Nielsen is elegant and majestic and poor Oliver Reed gave his best performance as Proximo .Despite all these things, you could say it's not enough - some say the movie's plot is too simple and that the conversations are dull and dumb . Well, they are surely not the wackiest and newest sentences, but what did you expect to hear - Shakespeare ?! The plot (I think) is just enough good for an action-drama like this . It's simple, you don't have to think about it for hours !And I've left the best thing for the last time : the movie has a great moral, which is nearly inimitable . Gladiator's power is striking through, the story is shocking and beautiful .I had a great time during watching (3 times) the film (I gave it 10 stars) and I can only recommend it to everybody ! It's a "MUST SEE" !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gladiator" redoes most of the plot of "Fall of the Roman Empire", and steals its stoical Gladiatorial hero from "Spartacus", but it outdoes both in terms of tension, excitement and sheer gob smacking spectacle. From the Private Ryan style opening battle, which makes Braveheart look like a picnic, to the genuinely affecting final death scene for hero Maximus, with a succession of stunning set pieces along the way, "Gladiator" delivers powerful, gripping, thought-provoking entertainment. The acting is particularly fine (Crowe, Reed, Harris of course, but also an impressive Joacquin Pheonix) and one scene in particular goes straight into my top ten movie moments : the airship style shot of the Collosseum, as if the Cup Final were being played between Ostia FC and Capitoline Utd. Good to see Ridley back on form!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throw your history books out the window, sit back and enjoy a roller-coaster of a ride through the life of the fictitious Roman general Maximus as he falls from power, only to regain it as the eponymous Gladiator who wins the hearts of the Roman crowds in the arena. There are some faults with this film - some parts of it do drag - but somehow it is completely compelling, and you can forgive them. All that's missing is the old-fashioned Technicolor look - although maybe that isn't a bad idea considering how graphic some of the fight scenes appear to be (it's what isn't shown that counts).</fullReview>

I was very sad to see that the director couldn't russle up more than 2 action sequences that were any good (fire arrows and large melee w/chariots in the ring). Also the plot was lame, you knew EXACTLY what was going to happen from the first few minutes. Written by rote as they say. Also why on earth did it take two and a half hours?!

		<shortDescription>Entertaining with minor reservations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was entertained, but then I could watch Russell Crowe read the phone book. LA Times review mentioned trite dialogue in script. I think it is a testament to the actors that none of the dialogue came off that way to me. In lesser actors then Crowe or Phoenix, the dialogue would have been awkward and full of bricks. Script/story are full of holes but does that really matter here? My main pet peeve was the undercranking and variable speeds in Cinematography during the battle scenes. Why? Does it train our eyes to accept the intense digital matwork when we get to Rome? I don't know. It kind of got in the way of the storytelling in the battle scenes for my taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW! this was one heck of a movie. this movie was so good because it had u in the movie. the audience in the movie theater was like the "gladiator crowd" This movie had action, drama, emotion, gorry seens (but not too gory) and brief romance. It has everything u need 4 an oscar nomminee. So far, this has been the best movie in 2000. I don't even want to hear any argument involving MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2, or ROADTRIP. Gladiator is the movie that should be seen about ten times in the movie theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator (2000) An Epic For The Ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's brutal, dark, gritty, ugly and nasty and beautifully and lovingly executed. The DVD will immediately be inserted into my library. Oscars will be raining down on this group of filmmakers. This is an epic film for the ages. Yes, it's not intellectual. I would have liked to have been given more info on the guys and girls in the chariots and how they came to be in the games. The playing field was not level - that's for sure. But who were these people with the chariots, the shiny armor and bows and arrows? They had court advantage and yet the fillmmakers decided not to enlighten us. Crowe, as always, was terrific. This guy has it all. And hey, Phoenix was damn good in this. He delivered the goods. Don't read the reviews, just go see this film. I came out of the theater grateful to be alive in this century, knowing I would have lasted about two seconds in that arena. Man's inhumanity to man. The horrible thing is, these games actually took place!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gladiator" redoes most of the plot of "Fall of the Roman Empire", and steals its stoical Gladiatorial hero from "Spartacus", but it outdoes both in terms of tension, excitement and sheer gob smacking spectacle. From the Private Ryan style opening battle, which makes Braveheart look like a picnic, to the genuinely affecting final death scene for hero Maximus, with a succession of stunning set pieces along the way, "Gladiator" delivers powerful, gripping, thought-provoking entertainment. The acting is particularly fine (Crowe, Reed, Harris of course, but also an impressive Joacquin Pheonix) and one scene in particular goes straight into my top ten movie moments : the airship style shot of the Collosseum, as if the Cup Final were being played between Ostia FC and Capitoline Utd. Good to see Ridley back on form!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Erm, where to start....a flawed Masterpiece? A "slightly" overhyped yet enjoyable romp?Got to admit, it WASN'T as enjoyable as I was expecting. Dont get me wrong, you aint saw anything like it before...its just that underneath all the flashy visuals and Ridley Scot's direction (which was in places AWESOME and in others pedestrian) and Russell Crowe (who was awesome as Maximus)THE SCRIPT WAS WEAK.It was TOO simple a story, not challenging at all. I had expected a "Shakespearian" type of story with plots sub plots etc but it was a bit too simplistic. It was a bit shallow, as though the script was written by committee.Want to know the worst thing about it? THE MUSIC...it really was bad in my opinionIt was done by Hans Zimmer (The Rock, Crimson Tide)and you know what, it sounded pretty much the same as that. Imagine a mostly electronic score the same as the rock and you get the picture. Suitable for a Roman Epic...I dont think so...No wonder they used the music from Conan the Barbarian (Poledouris) for the Trailer.....much more appropriate.How could someone like Ridley Scott give the job to Zimmer???The film was eye-popping in places and at least twice I went "F***s sake.." when I saw something new.SUMMARY...???Brilliant but seriously flawed.Braveheart was a better movie overall, and Gladiator WAS influenced by it (I am surprised no-one else picked up on that)In parts Gladiator WAS better than Saving Private Ryan (The opening scene is simply incredible)but for me overall the bad points dragged it down a bit.16/20 "Could have been a masterpiece but isn't"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throw your history books out the window, sit back and enjoy a roller-coaster of a ride through the life of the fictitious Roman general Maximus as he falls from power, only to regain it as the eponymous Gladiator who wins the hearts of the Roman crowds in the arena. There are some faults with this film - some parts of it do drag - but somehow it is completely compelling, and you can forgive them. All that's missing is the old-fashioned Technicolor look - although maybe that isn't a bad idea considering how graphic some of the fight scenes appear to be (it's what isn't shown that counts).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disappointing. A movie about Gladiators should have good action scenes, right? Well this one cuts away every time to some other shot like a dark sky and some guy raising a sword, then it flashes to something else. Endless snippets of almost-action yet no substance. I was very sad to see that the director couldn't russle up more than 2 action sequences that were any good (fire arrows and large melee w/chariots in the ring). Also the plot was lame, you knew EXACTLY what was going to happen from the first few minutes. Written by rote as they say. Also why on earth did it take two and a half hours?! Not to mention the lame and predictable ending. This is a renter at best IMO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sword and Sandal Epic, Revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With `Gladiator', Hollywood resurrects a genre that has been neglected for decades: the Sword and Sandal Epic. These movies have been a Hollywood staple since the days of D. W. Griffith, and reached their epitome in the 1950s and 1960s with such blockbusters as `Quo Vadis', `The Robe', `Ben Hur', `Spartacus', `The Fall of the Roman Empire', and `Cleopatra'. This incarnation of the genre affects all the arty (if not artistic) characteristics of contemporary cinema. The majority of the scenes are dimly lit and so murky that one can scarcely distinguish the actors. Even the obligatory Triumphal-Entry-Into-Rome scene appears to take place in twilight. The direction includes all the annoying characteristics common in recent movies, including innumerable quick cuts, off-center close-ups, and grainy battle scenes photographed in obvious imitation of `Saving Private Ryan'. In addition, most of the actors habitually mumble or whisper their dialogue in the most approved Actors Studio fashion. The tendency of modern actors to swallow their lines, pioneered by Marlon Brando and James Dean, is deplorable enough in contemporary settings. In a film that purports to depict an historical period when men actually prided themselves on their rhetorical ability, unintelligible speech seems grossly out of place. Under the circumstances, the stentorian delivery of Shakespearian actors would have been far more appropriate. After all, the Romans revered Demosthenes and Cicero as much as they did Ceasar and Pompey.Needless to say, `Gladiator' is a very bloody movie, rather more so than parents would probably wish to inflict on young viewers. I would venture to say that "Gladiator" has the highest body count of any film of this genre that I have seen since Cecil B. De Mille's 1934 opus, `The Sign of the Cross'. In this sense, however, quantity does not necessarily equal dramatic impact. A battle to the death between two gladiators in Stanly Kubricks `Spartacus' had impact because they were developed characters, and the audience sympathised with both of them. On the other hand, the violent deaths of a hundred people in `Gladiator' means nothing to the audience because they are all simply ciphers. In order to satisfy the modern audience's supposed appetite for pyrotechnics, a major battle is staged utilizing large quantities of Greek Fire, a weapon that would not be invented until five hundred years after the era depicted in the film. An even more glaring anomaly is the hero's horseback ride from Germany to Spain through country that looks rather more like Arizona than Europe, and his sudden and unexplained instant transposition from Spain to Africa. If he were really so weak as to be unconscious or delirious for the duration of the journey, as the audience is apparently expected to believe, than why would anyone as pragmatic as a slaver have bothered to bring him along in the first place?`Gladiator' depicts the period of Roman History during the reign of Commodus, reputed by Roman historians to have been one of the four worst rulers the Roman Empire ever had (the others being Nero, Caligula and Septimus Severus). Commodus was all the worse for having succeeded one of the most able of the Roman Emperors, his stoical father Marcus Aurelius, whose volume of `Meditations' is still in print today. In `Gladiator', Commodus is depicted as a patricide, which was, curiously enough, one of the few crimes of which he was not guilty. In reality, Marcus Aurelius died of plague in what is now Hungary while preparing an expedition to extend the Empire to the Vistula River. Commodus, who had delusions of being the reincarnation of Hercules, actually did participate in gladiatorial games, a circumstance which scandalized his subjects. It was somewhat analogous to the President of the United States associating with punk rockers or outlaw bikers. He was eventually murdered by members of his own household, on the theory that it is better to do onto others before they do onto you. Perhaps the most glaring anachronism in `Gladiator' is the implication that, upon the death of Commodus, the Roman Empire reverted back into a republic. Actually, there followed one of the most bizarre and grotesque episodes in the history of human government, in which the Praetorian Guard actually auctioned off the Roman Empire to the highest bidder. Obviously the producer's audience research determined that a satisfying happy ending would sell more tickets than the far more dramatic, and infinitely more cynical, real ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as a concept movie gets/a perfect Verhoeven pic shot by Ridley Scott</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Gladiator` is the symbol of Hollywood`s renewed intrest in medieval subjects and stories.Since techno-thriller self-destructed under the burden of Hollywood`s commercial expectations enchant history became the new well of ideas for moguls.This is why `The 13th Warrior` hit the silver screen and why `Joan of Arc` got funding from Hollywood.`Gladiator` takes as back to the past when Western Civilisation wasn`t as great as we know it since the majority of people weren`t aware that there is only one God. `Gladiator` is the story of the Roman general Maximus who gets involved in royal plots during the time of Marcus Aurelius` reign.Because of his position he gets punished but he escapes death.Unfortunately his family gets slaughtered and he becomes a slave that ends up as a gladiator in Roman Arena.In Rome Maximus plots to avenge his family`s death and to take Roman Empire back to the right path. `Gladiator` is a competent return to`swords and sandals` mythology and the movie doesn`t fail where it`s predecesors did.It is expensive,large-scale story with great actors.Performances of Russell Crowe and Oliver Reed are especially enjoyable and Joaquin Phoenix really gives edge to the character of Commodus,the villain Emperor.Russell Crowe iz amazing and his acting really fits the epic scale of characters behaving and tragedy. Since `L.A.Confidential` it was obvious that Crowe is `the next big thing` and he finally proved it again in `Gladiator`. The script has fine moments but it is generally routine stuff.It isn`t edgy but it does make mistakes concerning history.I mean I ain`t no historian but authors avoid the religious aspect of the plot.Even though Crowe prays to one God while the young `Replacement Emperor` and his sister use plural in religious conversations. The ending is a nice idea but it is bad written and bad writing includes cheesy lines spoken by `as hard as it gets` Crowe. `Gladiator` also features a supportng role Djimon Hounsou the `Dream Works SKG nigger`(remember him in `Amistad` also made by `Dream Works SKG`?). Ridley Scott`s direction is mature and atractive and he proves true the thing Michael Mann said about him to Crowe(Mann said that Scott is among top two percent of shooters in business).His direction is inspired in visual sense and thus he gives us some hot sword fighting and animal action.The shots of Arena in all it`s glory are impressive and kudos also go to cinematographer John Mathieson who shot Kevin Allen`s masterpiece `Twin Town`.Ridley Scott can`t avoid the classic `Dream Works SKG` blueish colour orientation but this is a legit landmark of the studio.... Overall `Gladiator` is a must-see not because of it`s substance but because of the fact that it interprets some of the classic myths of human culture in the manner of a 100-million studio picture which is fine. I hope that great box-office result of this movie would boost production of such anticipated projects like Michael Mann`s `Spartans` with George Clooney and Verhoeven`s `Crusade` with Arnold Scwarzenegger. If Verhoeven had directed `Gladiator` it would have been a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good-looking movie. Let's get that out of the way. The character actors are very good (including Derek Jacobi, thrown in perhaps for associations with "I, Claudius"?). Crowe is good enough, although he isn't given a lot to work with, meaning he doesn't have very interesting lines. The Hans Zimmer score is predictably derivative: Holst, Orff and now Dead Can Dance -- things that go thump-thump-ahh-ahh. But the "atmospheric" style seems to be in vogue at the moment. It really interfered with my enjoyment, though. The historical accuracy was wildly varied: pedantic details of the manmade environment peeked out from wholly unrealistic scenes. You can hire consultants to reproduce period textiles, but not period sensibilities. The writer and director have to find those in reading some of the plentiful sources that have come down to us from Rome. I wonder how much time they devoted to hearing the voices of ancient Romans before staging their big computer crowd scenes. Spartacus took up some serious issues, even though it was quite corny. This is just a revenge tale with exquisite production values. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seems to take liberties with some aspects of history, but is close enough that it's more accurate than most stuff coming out of Hollywood. The fight scenes are excellent and the fact that a man could do what the main character did seems impossible. The production was great with epic proportions and worthy of an Oscar.The acting was good though at times fair. The power of the story and plot carries this movie. The scenes and confrontations are memorable and powerful. Russell Crowe did an excellent job convincing me he was who he was playing, but the best performance was put out by Oliver Reed. He was magnificent as the slave owner of the gladiators. I thought it was him when I first saw the character, but was not sure till the end credits as he protrayed the tough old gracious retired obviously successful gladiator of times gone by. The performances of the young emperor and his sister/concubine are not as powerful, but adequate. Richard Harris does a better than expected job as the old ceasar.If one can handle Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart you can handle this movie, though one gladiator fight sequence may out do what was in those movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy film, though not without flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is an epic film. A moving story with good characters. I must compliment all the actors, Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix especially. I felt I understood all the characters, each had motivation, goals, and a personality. To those who have belittled Phoenix's performance, I suggest you check whether he was merely playing an unlikable and deranged character very well, or if his actual acting was lacking. I think the former is the case. I did notice a few flaws. The first was the excessive and obvious use of CGI, which I feel gave the movie an unreal and unbelievable look at times. The second flaw involves the historical accuracy of the film. While this only slightly detracted from the film, I did find it distracting. For example, I seem to have noticed stirrups in use (certainly the actor's foot position suggested stirrups), which weren't invented until the millenium after the time depicted. Pens and paper, and other minor inaccuracies were to be noticed if you were in the know. As I said though, these minor inaccuracies did not take away from the depiction of the film. Of course, the largest inaccuracy is the eventual outcome of the film, with regards to the fate of the Roman empire, which I will not reveal. In the end however, this is a story, for entertainment, not a historical documentary, and I am more than happy to forgive and overlook such transgressions in the name of a good film, which this definitely is. The only other complaint I have about the film was the use of cuts to the 'dream world'. These cuts are confusing for most of the picture. Who is having them? Why? What do they mean? They gave the film a disjointed feel to me. Though eventually the reasons for these 'dreams' becomes clear, their execution left something to be desired for me. The conclusion? "Gladiator" is a fine film, worth seeing. The closest to an epic film I have seen in some time, "Gladiator" regales with war and love, vengeance and madness. What more can you ask?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing I want to say is that the film was far better than I expected. The fighting scenes were good, the acting too, and the special effects were just amazing... I was really impressed how the film showed the ancient Rome , a great work of the special effect crew.But the story was just the same old thing. Bad man cheats good man and becomes king (in this case: emperor) , and good man fights for justice against the bad man although he's inferior. Well, you can also find that in Shakespeare's pieces, so this is certainly nothing new. And because the characters were all in all clichees, this is not shown very good either. Another point: the film is, historically seen, not correct: Rome never became a republic again, and Commodus reigned until 191 AD. And he was certainly not killed in the arena... The last point: Maximus is quite a stupid name, it just means "the greatest", and romans didn't name their children like that... well, these are all just unimportant details... 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable mess!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talk about an oxymoron! This movie was, in general, a disappointment. Nonetheless, I enjoyed watching it. It started out beautifully. The opening sequence was fantastic! The cinematography, mainly in the first few minutes of the movie, but throughout the entire length of the movie was wondrous. Yet, the story went from interesting and inviting to plain stupid. At first I thought this movie would be a direct remake of "The Fall Of The Roman Empire", but unfortunately it was not. Somewhere along the line, this movie lost its balance. I think it happened at the point where Maximus leaves "Germania" in search of his family. It seemed as if the director of this movie tried to take elements from "Conan the Barbarian" and "Spartacus", and incorporate them with the main story from "The Fall Of The Roman Empire". The fight scenes were astonishing, though too many special effects were used in this movie...at certain moments in the movie I felt like if I was watching "The Phantom Menace"--ugh! All those things contributed to making this movie a mess. However, I would surely recommend this movie to others. Although this movie is more than two hours long, it's not boring. The most notable thing I can say about Russell Crowe is: America, meet your newest star! For those who weren't familiar with him or his work prior to this movie, prepare yourselves. He's the next big thing--everyone else move over. He's got the talent, the looks, and the presence to become a movie STAR. Also, I liked seeing the great Richard Harris as the emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Furthermore, I was impressed by Connie Nielsen. At first I thought, why cast a Danish actress in a role that could easily be played by an American or British actress? But she really did a fine job in this movie. In addition, I liked the costumes, though they were too unrealistic, but they were striking. On the other hand, so much money was spent on special effects to show how wonderful ancient Rome was; yet in the entire movie, you only get to see a couple of minutes of shots of the city. Also, Joaquin Phoenix's acting was terrible, though he does have the look of a villain....maybe when he's older he'll make a better villain in a movie. While the ending was very similar to the ending in "Braveheart", I feel that toward the end, this movie redeemed itself. The last twenty or so minutes of this movie were pretty good. I just might go see this movie again, for the action scenes. **1/2 out of ****. By the way, wasn't that the kid from "Life Is Beautiful" playing Russell Crowe's son?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>G.C.S.E Latin at it's finest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't think of it as an Epic, I thought of it as a G.C.S.E Latin fictional 'Roman Life' book on-screen, but with additional storylines, vivid adventures and heart-warming dialogue. (ok, not ALL of it was 'heart-warming', but it certainly did touch me).It was truly action-packed with various twist and turns to maintain interest of the viewer. I also highly appreciated the fact that the film jumped straight into it and prevented me from napping before the story had begun!A big slap on the back for Russell Crowe. I think that this was his first 'major' film, and it was brilliant. Also the same for the actor that played Lucius. I'm sure we'll see more of him in the future.My mother said that this was the best film that she'd ever seen and I respect her judgement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Early Favorite for Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the ad for Gladiator, and realizing that Russell Crowe was the main character, I was determined to see it. His portrayal of Bud White was what made LA Confidential transcend to another level. Finding out that Ridley Scott was the director made it 100% certain that this was a film not to be missed.From the opening of the film, with the wheat blowing softly, leading up to a battle that combined the frenetic camera work similar to Private Ryan mixed with the brutality of Braveheart all set to Hans Zimmer's great score, I was hooked.Here is a film that includes all the pre-requisites of being a hit. Superb acting from all the leads (Joaquin Phoenix - I didn't realize he could act that well!?) Richard Harris as the elderly Caesar, the late Oliver Reed, and Djimon Hounsou all did superb jobs. What MADE this film what it was though, was Crowe's performance as the betrayed General Maximus.The sheer emotion and depth that Crowe brought to what could have been a cardboard replica of a historical figure proves with no doubt that he is now one of the top actors in Hollywood.The vulnerability mixed with the intensity, with the ever underlying thirst for revenge drives the character and subsequently the film. It is doubtful one will see a better performance than the scene where Maximus discovers his family killed.With a lavish set design, aided by stunning CGI work, the viewer feels literally immersed in the world of old Rome. The battles (the best one being the Barbarian Horde) are staged elaborately, and truly evoke the quality of what they must have been like.This movie is similar in some ways to 1995's Braveheart, yet differentiates itself enough to be truly original. It is a strong possibility that come March, Ridley Scott could be standing at the podium holding Oscar. Of all the films that have come out in the past year, this is one that NOBODY should miss!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unique Opportunity for a Great Actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies in recent memory. Not because it is "perfect" film by any means; it definitely has it's flaws. But it is worth the price of admission if only to see superb actors such as Russell Crowe, Jouquin Phoenix, Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, Derick Jacobi, etc. strut their stuff.While many people who have been Russell Crowe fans for years will resent the fact that many are touting "Gladiator" as Russell Crowe's "breakthrough" role, fans long ago noticed there was something unique about this guy in such film as "Proof", "The Sum of Us", "Quick and the Dead", "L.A. Confidential" and "The Insider".But in spite of the films flaws, Crowe fans will not be disappointed in "Gladiator" because they get a chance to see him carry the entire weight of a big budget film (he's in practically every scene) on his ample shoulders. As with Vivien Leigh in "Gone With the Wind", it is hard to imagine this film working without the presence of Russell Crowe.He makes the most believable gladiator I have ever seen on film. I'm sorry, but as much as I loved "Sparticus", I never believed Kirk Douglas could be a real gladiator. He looked more like a gymnist; I never believed he could survive in the Coliseum.But as good as the other actors in "Gladiator" are, and as good as the effects and fight sequences are, the plot and script could not have been as compelling with any other actor but Russell Crowe playing Maximus.There is some unique quality about this guy (perhaps the strange mixture of violence and compassion in his face) that brings an absolutely unique contribution to this film. His acting covers the gaps in the script....mostly done with his facial and body expressions since he is rarely given quality lines to say. (Most of the lines in the film are a bit corny or cliched. It's a good thing they had this brilliant cast!)For example, we are expected to believe that this man, Maximus, who is capable of the most excruciating violence, is at heart a tender hearted family man who simply wants to go home to his farm. It is left up to Mr. Crowe to make us believe this, and he rises to the occasion in spades.Someone pointed out to me that Crowe does not speak one word of dialogue from the time that Maximus is sent out to be executed by Commodus to the time he is in the gladiator ring shouting, "Are you not entertained?" The fact that, throughout this long sequence (20-30 minutes) I never even noticed Maximus never spoke, is just proof of the unique abilities of Russell Crowe as an actor. This is one guy who could have easily been a silent movie star; something that can't be said for 95% of the actors around today.As "Gone With the Wind" would have been just a so-so well made movie with nice production values without the presence of Vivien Leigh, so too would "Gladiator" have only been a so-so movie without the presence of Russell Crowe. But because of him, it becomes a symbol of brave people everywhere fighting everywhere against unbelievable odds. Let us hope, as with Vivien Leigh, that the Academy recognizes this unique talent and gives Mr. Crowe his best actor Oscar!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's go back in 180 AD...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though the plot of Gladiator is completely fictional, using historical characters requires keeping a certain accuracy. In this respect it is intersting to learn who Emperor Commodus really was... Marcus Aurelius became emperor in 161, and until 169 he reigned in cooperation with Lucius Verus, husband of his eldest daughter Lucilla. Then the latter died. In 177, Marcus Aurelius associated his son Commodus to official functions in order to prepare him for the succession. In that sense, Marcus Aurelius reestablished the blood succession. Marcus Aurelius died shortly after the victory against thr Danubian barbarians near the actual Vienna in 180, but, he wasn't strangled by his own son as in the film, but died or of the plague or of exhaustion.Commodus becomes emperor, but shows little ability to succeed in his new functions. He concluded a quick peace with the barbarians, came back to Rome and actually did not care about politics. He lived in his world of laziness and lust. Lucilla was very angry at him and did not like his lover Bruttia Crispina. She set a plot and an attempt was made to kill Commodus, but it failed. This marked the beginning of a series of executions within the royal circle and the senate. Dio Cassius, Roman senator said: "The fear was shared by us senators.He killed an ostrich, cut off its head, and came towards us with the head in his left hand, brandishing his bloody sword in the right. He wagged his head to show he would do the same to us." When he entered the senate, the senator had to salute him in this way: "You are Lord, you are first, you are most fortunate. You are Victor, you will be victor; from everlasting, Amazonian, you are victor". More than that, Commodus was clearly a mad man, influenced by oriental religious practices. He wanted Rome to be called Commodiana, and the Legion Commodian.. He called himself the Roman Hercules, and styled Rome the "Immortal Fortunate Colony of the Universe"! All the months were given his names: Amazonius, Invictus, Felix, Pius, Lucius, Aeliuys, Aurelius, Commodus, Augustus, Herculeus, Romanus, Exsuperatorius. He applied Exsuperatorius (his own image of Jupiter) to himself regularly to show that he surpassed mankind in many ways... Many statues represented him as Hercules. Commodus loved the games. He often went to the amphitheatre and entered the arena dressed as Mercury, beginning his exhibition barefoot and in his tunic after having got rid of his garments!. According to the historian Aurelius Victor, he was "so depraved that he often fought in the arena as a gladiator"!! He had a real fascination for gladiators and wild beast, and when he wanted in January 193 to kill two senators in sacrifice and to make a procession in Rome at the head of his gladiators, it became necessary to get rid of this dangerous psychopath! His surroundings plotted, and Marcia, his favorite lover handed him a cup of poison, and he was then strangled in his bath by his coach, Narcisse, on December 31, 192. The reign of Commodus marked 12 years of terror, lust, cruelty and greed. He was obviously a megalomaniac. If a date can be fixed for the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire, it would be his reign. In the film, his folly is well represented, but in a different way though. We can see that he is a megalomaniac the way Ridley Scott made him enter Rome, and through the fact that he wants to rule alone. We als see that he loves the games, since he introduces 150 days of gladiators' fights. But his obsession with religion has been replaced by an incestuous love for his sister, whom he nearly consider as a goddess. But he didn't die in the arena (though he often fought as a gladiator), but was murdered. Nevertheless,with an astonishing photography and editing, Ridley Scott's Gladiator is one of the best epics of the last 20 years, and will remain as such in many people's eyes...hopefully!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stirring film with an impressive performance by Crowe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an impressive film, highly recommended. Russell Crowe has gone beyond his performance in L.A. Confidential and shown himself to be a truly first-rank actor. Maximus is portrayed realistically and vividly, and you leave the film feeling that he really existed and that you met him. Only a stone will view the film and not feel his pain. Russell Crowe makes this film, outshining even Derek Jacobi as senator Gracchus (whose part is on the small side) and Richard Harris as the aged Marcus Aurelius (who seems now always to play himself). Crowe gets my vote thus far for best actor this year. On the whole the film strikes and excellent balance between the action sequences, the power struggles of the empire under a bad emperor, and the passion of Maximus for his family. From an historical point of view, this film does many more things right than wrong, which is remarkable for any film these days. On the minus side, the viewer may come away with the impression that Commodus' reign was relatively brief, but he ruled from 180-192 C.E. What the film does best in those terms is to portray aspects of Roman religion, in Maximus' devotion to his household gods. Some may be disappointed that there are too few actual scenes of gladiatorial combat (the film's title is somewhat deceptive) but I think most viewers will find this a relief. The film is violent but it does not dwell on the violence needlessly, and many opportunities for gratuitous depictions of violence were wisely skipped. Add to this an impressive and haunting musical score and you have a wonderful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie for the 3rd time this afternoon, the ending still brought me to the point of tears. Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe combine to give one of the most powerful performances in an action/adventure/drama film since Saving Private Ryan. Other than Stand by Me, which i saw when i was just a kid, Gladiator, and Private Ryan are the only 3 movies that have ever brought me to tears. I only wish i would get an email address or agent address for Ridley Scott or Russell Crowe, just to write a letter of appreciation for the film. I saw MI2 the other day, and was grossly disappointed. More like Mission Ridiculously Proposterous, Gladiator is a far superior film. After i saw it the first time, i just sat there after the movie was over, unable to describe how much the movie touched me. I have recommended it to everyone from my mom, to Fraternity buddies, and have gone to see it each time with a new group of people who were seeing it for the first time. The soundtrack as well is amazing. The music alone brings me to tears, and as soft as i sound, i rarely cry at movies, where everything is scripted. But i listen to tracks 15,16, and 17, and i get teary eyed. The music is just very powerful and the vocals are incredibly haunting. Hans Zimmer did an amazing job, and while Hans did the ST for MI2, it doesn't compare. The whole package is an emotional tour de force, that isn't just a hack'em up bloody gorefest, despite the amount of killing that does occur, it has a story and emotion and brilliant acting by Russell Crowe and supporting cast. It's a must see for the summer, and a must own when released on VHS or DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good graphics, good gore special effects, awesome decapitations. About an hour and a half of useless boring talking head crap that should've been cut or infused with decent writing. Semi-interesting but ultimately flat story. Reminded me of "Payback" (Mel Gibson takes on the mob) minus the humour. This guy was UNSTOPPABLE.. I mean, why didn't he just take on the whole Roman army himself? Totally unbelievable.The special effects are awesome, the fight scenes are stylistic masterpieces. I have been to Rome however, I have seen the Coliseum, and I don't think it would ever look quite so "gold". Actually, everything looks "gold" in this film, giving the film a somewhat tacky commercial sheen. I wish he'd done something a little more rough around the edges like Spielberg did in Saving Private Ryan. The one dimensional story never approaches the emotional impact of Kubrick's "I am Spartacus" climax either.Still, I must admit that this would make for a very nice Imax experience. The set design is impeccable and the background detail is meticulous. If you ever fantasized about visiting ancient Rome, this is as good as it gets.</fullReview>

Commodus then murders his father and sends Maximus to be executed. Maximus survives the forthcoming execution and flees in search for his family - who he finds hung in his home town. He then rides forth to become a gladiator to avenge the sinister Commodus. There are some fantastic battle scenes but what makes this better from all the CGI'd sci-fi films is content and depth. Commodus loves his sister for more than just being a sister (reminiscent of Star Wars) and some of the minor characters are executed with precision. Russell Crowe was believable, realistic, well hard and quite frankly a master in his role of Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix lacked edge but delivered as the sinister Commodus and the late Oliver Reed played a final memorable performance as Maximus' trainer. Ridley Scott's direction is awesome. This movie shows what CGI effects should be used for. Although gory, this is not disturbing - this is deep and portrays a powerful and awe-inspiring message.

And, of course, the film isn't historically accurate, but who would have expected it to be?Now, I don't mean to say that Gladiator isn't worth watching.

She plays a tough aristocratic lady not to fool around with; her relatives (Marcus Aurelius and Commodus) don't want her as an enemy! When the story develops the true nature of Lucilla reveals as mother and fighter for the right cause but trapped in the web of her brother. Nielsen (well educated, speaks 7 languages fluently) must have prepared herself quite good for the role. Oliver Reed is quite impressive as Proximo, the big boss of the gladiators. While filming Reed died in Malta from a heart attack. Joaquin Phoenix is fair enough as Commodus but not as impressive as the other main actors (including Richard Harris as the old and tired Marcus Aurelius, the old Ceasar).The photography is astonishing and sometimes breathtaking. The creation of the old Rome is quite an achievement. It is amazing what they can do with computers these days. (I read that the scenes of Proximo in the second part where computer generated because of Oliver Reeds death) The few times repeated weat scene works well and gives a peacefull quiteness to the violence and blood shed.It is an excellent movie and I'm sure that we will see more historic dramas in the near future.</fullReview>

Richard Harris did well, and the Oliver Reed pieces were also good.

		<fullReview>.....the more I think about it, mediocre. After so many duff movies since Blade Runner I was sceptical that Scott had suddenly become the great auteur we once expected of him after the afore-mentioned android epic. And so it proved. The direction is frankly awful in the first half. As an executive once said of 'Heaven's Gate', there is scene after scene of beautiful images, but no film. Too adverty, too many filters and irritating slow-mo. Curiously for an epic, Scott shoots a lot of the film in close up which does not work. How did Crowe escape execution in the wood? Damned if I could work it out. The close up and fast cutting of the fight scenes proves disastrous too. Why do it? Because it's in vogue, so forget personal directorial vision. Ben Hur is years old but the fight scenes here pale in comparison.Why did he choose to film the whole thing as if you are seeing Rome through light tinted sun glasses? Perhaps to create a disconcerting atmosphere of facism, but the overall effect is one of mental illness. Rome was sunny, that's why they managed to hold games for 120 days in a row. The constant squinting at sepia soon grows tiresome. The ending was moving but it's going to be if you cynically go for the film making by numbers approach. It's routine, push the buttons stuff. Why did he insist on having music playing in the background throughout most of the film? It's a comman complaint against documentaries at the moment and is distracting here as well. Just give us a sense of reality for a moment, please. The use of (I think) Holst's 'The Planets' is el naffo as well.Classy actors are used as window dressing. Crowe is one note. Despite the hype, Oliver Reed is given little to do. It's not a dead loss, the strange atmosphere is compelling, but there's a sense that contemporary film makers have forgotten how to tell a story and could care less. Check out Spartacus as a reminder. Great performances, especially Olivier, and a cracking script too. For those who want to see a proper historical epic, see Tarkovsky's 'Andrei Rublev.' It's awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually speaking, Gladiator is fantastic, the depiction of Rome being particularly impressive. Furthermore, even at two and a half hours in length, the film is never boring, and I can't complain about the acting, either.It's too bad therefore, that the ending is so mediocre. The entire production seems to fall apart in the last twenty minutes or so, climaxing conveniently rather than realistically. And, of course, the film isn't historically accurate, but who would have expected it to be?Now, I don't mean to say that Gladiator isn't worth watching. In the end, it's a good way to kill a few hours; just don't expect it to amaze you. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After many years of neglect, Rome has found itself again in the spotlight... for the second time in one year! Like Titus, the version of Titus Andronicus released earlier in 2000, Gladiator brings new life to the sword-and-sandal genre and to a supposedly dead chronotope. Another similarity between the two films springs to mind: to both belongs a much-discussed apparent lust for gore, accompanied by an introspective and self-conscious wariness of violence in the media. Without going into details that might spoil the plot of either movie, it should be noted that both movies: 1. are rife with violence and blood, taken to levels of extremity not customary even in modern theater 2. focus on this violence in its capacity as spectacle 3. examine the role of the film's audience through highlighting an audience in an ampitheater (in Titus, once at the end, in Gladiator constantly) Through a synthesis of these three points, each film examines the role of violence as a spectacle today, in the modern ampitheater of the mass media. In effect, the viewer is forced to question the enjoyment he's gotten from the movie. In Titus, this question takes the tint of psychology -- is the viewer sick to laugh at Titus' jests amidst his horror? In Gladiator, the examination turns political and asks how much power the culture industry (the emperor in Rome, Hollywood today) has over the populace... its answer is quite an act of narcissism on the part of Dreamworks, but it contains truth. But the special effects are spiffy keen and there's lots of blood, so what's not to love? :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie for the 3rd time this afternoon, the ending still brought me to the point of tears. Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe combine to give one of the most powerful performances in an action/adventure/drama film since Saving Private Ryan. Other than Stand by Me, which i saw when i was just a kid, Gladiator, and Private Ryan are the only 3 movies that have ever brought me to tears. I only wish i would get an email address or agent address for Ridley Scott or Russell Crowe, just to write a letter of appreciation for the film. I saw MI2 the other day, and was grossly disappointed. More like Mission Ridiculously Proposterous, Gladiator is a far superior film. After i saw it the first time, i just sat there after the movie was over, unable to describe how much the movie touched me. I have recommended it to everyone from my mom, to Fraternity buddies, and have gone to see it each time with a new group of people who were seeing it for the first time. The soundtrack as well is amazing. The music alone brings me to tears, and as soft as i sound, i rarely cry at movies, where everything is scripted. But i listen to tracks 15,16, and 17, and i get teary eyed. The music is just very powerful and the vocals are incredibly haunting. Hans Zimmer did an amazing job, and while Hans did the ST for MI2, it doesn't compare. The whole package is an emotional tour de force, that isn't just a hack'em up bloody gorefest, despite the amount of killing that does occur, it has a story and emotion and brilliant acting by Russell Crowe and supporting cast. It's a must see for the summer, and a must own when released on VHS or DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott has done it again (creating a superb motion picture, like Blade Runner and Thelma &amp; Louise). This time, he has made the first good picture on Imperial Rome since "Spartacus", a picture appealing even to those who do not appreciate the genre. From the opening scene to the films closing, the audience is drawn into the story and into history, led by brilliant camera work, solid acting, a captivating musical soundtrack setting the mood for every scene without interfering with the picture, and brilliant cinematography. Characters are well developed and realistic, true to historic records (in fact, history tells us that Commodus, the Emperor, was even more of a megalomaniac than he is portrayed in the picture. If the script writer had portrayed him as he really was, audiences would probably have considered it as too much of a Hollywood clich...). The computer-designed scenarios are breathtaking, notably of the Colisseum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator takes you back to the days of the Roman empire and gives a perspective of what life in 180 a.d. might be like. Not since the days of Ben Hur or Spartacus have we had a movie like this. It tells the story of Maximus, the saluted Roman general who becomes a slave and a gladiator after Commodus, the sinister son of the old emperor Marcus Aurelius, through patricide takes over the position of emperor and slays the general's wife and son, destroying his life. Maximus swears revenge and fights his way to the mighty stage of the Colloseum in Rome, where he squares off with his foe.I saw this movie at the premiere in a theater with over 600 seats, a screen reaching 65 feet from side to side, and the most brutal THX sound system this side of the known universe. The place was packed to the brim with people, dying to see this movie. From the beginning to the end, two and a half hours later, this movie delivers on all levels! Everyone in the audience started to applaud when the movie was over, something I haven't experienced since the premiere of Episode I, as they, just like me, were in utter awe of what they had just seen.From the acting to the photography, from the music to the realistic brutal violence, this movie never failed. It's a master piece deserving both a second and a third viewing at the cinema, and a definite pre-order when it hits DVD. Ridley Scott hasn't made anything this good since Blade Runner and Alien.I can't recommend this movie enough. You simply have to go see this picture now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there's one thing that gets to me while I browse through movie reviews, it's pedantic, bitchy rants about "historical inaccuracies." I'll be honest--SCREW HISTORY! You don't go to the movies for a history lesson; you go because you want to scarf down popcorn while seeing two people kick the flying crap out of each other! Intelligent movies are the ones you watch at home... with the exception of Gladiator. Sure, some people can say that it's all action and not much else, but compared to the rest of the action epic crop, Gladiator pumps the most brain power out of all of them. Name another action movie this year that makes you wanna go "ick" at Commodus' incestuous advances towards his sister. Name another action movie this year that almost brings your critical ass to tears when General Maximus comes across the ashen remains of his old life. To end it all, name a Roman epic that tops Ben-Hur and Spartacus in spectacle, and you have Gladiator. Sure, Kirk Douglas would beat Russell Crowe into a body cast, but I'll go with Ridley Scott's prettier, CGI-powered Rome. And it's by DreamWorks, which is always a good thing in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As my summary suggests, this is classic example of a legendary "hero" way back when, with battles and death galore, tinted with unsurmountable odds and a love interest to boot. Clooney (Maximus) plays his role surprisingly well as talented general who, after his initial escape from death, battles for vengeance on his own. And we all know nothing is more dangerous than a man who has nothing to lose. Despite what you might think beforehand, the fight scenes are NOT repetitive; each has its own flare and creativity that will interest the most of you, if not sicken you with special effects (plenty of blood; not for the weak stomach). My only complaint is the way the final scenes were handled; they seemed set up (unbelievably I might add) and they made you expect a huge battle to conclude the story, but it never happened. That foible aside, I had high hopes and was not disappointed.If you've seen Gladiator, you may think I'm over-generalizing it, and well, I am. If you haven't, for the most part, it's well worth your money, because everyone needs a little fantasy story with honor, loyalty, and heroism ironed into their head. When we see someone achieve something like that, even in a movie, although me might not know it, we feel refreshed at what a single human can accomplish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb insight into the intrigues of power in ancient Rome.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went just reluctantly to see Gladiator, with the idea that it would fall wide short of Spartacus, but I was mistaken. Its 150 minutes passed quick as lightning; after the first time I saw it I was so amazed that I couldn't quite make up my mind as to the real quality of the piece, so I read some reviews and talked to some pals and got multifarious feelings that ranged from `A royal stunts-and-special-effects surrounding a void' to `A landmark that will get all the Oscars'; so I decided to enjoy it again and make myself clear. This movie has an excellent plot of noticeable roundness, full to the brim with nerve and surprise. Though it hasn't all the appeal to me of Spartacus, it doesn't lack depth. A weak point: It spares too much in blood and crudeness, which would be very valuable not for morbid curiosity's sake but as an effective means to represent the most brutal aspects of the Roman Empire and to make us reflect on the value of human rights nowadays and when compared to the most sophisticated of ancient civilizations. A good movie for lovers of both Schwarzenneger and Stanley Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>("Blood &amp; Guts in Ancient Rome" - sorry ladies, this film is *not* called "Russell Crowe gets his Kit Off")</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An epic worthy of the best traditions of this sort of cinema. Top notch acting, an opening battle scene that almost does for that time period what Saving Private Ryan did for WW2 - it recreates the sheer horror inflicted by the Roman Army. Later, the actual gladiator scenes in Rome are also convincingly portrayed. The cerebral elements where we follow the moral strengths and weaknesses of the characters give it more substance than a mere action movie. Its main weakness is probably that which most big Hollywood epics have had - no more than a passing attempt to use the film as an art form - this, as the gladiator organizer says, is entertainment. (Note - from the little history I've been able to glean, the storyline - who kills who - seems to be largely fiction, although the portrayal of the characters of the main players seems reasonable enough and the other details are apparently quite well constructed. So we get quite a reasonable picture of the Empire in this context if we ignore the plot. Perhaps some historians reading this will want to add details about the lives and deaths of Marcus Aurelius, Maximus and Commodus just to keep the record straight.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Crowd Pleaser, for me though...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This will make a lot of money. I'm telling that right now, it'll make a hell of a lot of money, and Dreamworks keeps hitting the jackpot with last year's success with American Beauty and this year, GLADIATOR.Even though this will make LOTS of dough, I on the other hand was disappointed. There were all the ingredients to make a Best Picture film, but it didn't quite come close, in my opinion.The film had Ridley Scott, first of all, one of the most influential film-makers of all time with films such as Blade Runner, Alien, or Thelma and Louise. Hans Zimmer was behind the music, who I consider to be THE GOD of film music. Then there were the actors who I thought all of them including Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Dijimon Honsou, Derek Jacobi, and many others, pulled off a wonderful job. Now, the problem was with the pace of the film. There were great action sequences, great dramatic cinematography, great sound, but the pace of transitions and each scenes to be the problem.The pace of the film seemed to give almost a blockbuster-typish pace of fast-paced, moving camera with the music overtone between scenes which in many respects threw the film off. What's great about epics made by filmmakers such as David Lean or Francis Ford Coppola is that they have moments for the audience to take in what they have just seen and sometimes just enjoy a moment of silence, almost, by just staring into a great landscape or a character who was in despair or deep in thought or etc. The pace that was almost like Michael-Bay-type threw of the film for me, personally. Each sequences were so well done, that I don't think any of the audiences might have gotten bored by five or seven seconds of silence between some of the scenes. This was a very DIFFERENT film than the other Ridley Scotts in terms of the story telling and the work of the cameras in many of the scenes.One problem I had with some of the visuals, which is usually hard to find in Ridley Scott films but there was anyway, was that many of the angles of the collusseum or the city of Rome or inside the CAESAR's palace, was that they seemed to close down the view. There seemed to be too many BIG master shots and then just CLOSE-UPS that there wasn't really any shots for the audience to look around at the people or the normal structures or objects that might have given the audience more of an open feeling, rather than just watching something that someone else shot for them to see.Also, there was an awkward problem with the screenplay because of some of the dialogues, but mainly because of the ending. I will not include it in here since you might have not seen the film yet, but you might feel awkward as I did in the end.Other than those, it was a GREAT crowd pleaser. Also, great images as usual like any other Ridley Scotts but somehow, very different. But anyway, I in someways liked the film, but I was disappointed to see a film that could have been SO MUCH better. ** 1/2 out of **** or a B/B+ rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many good things about Gladiator. Foremost is the costuming. I've only seen better once before (The Cook, the thief, his wife and her lover.)There is a good chance it will be rewarded for this. Joaquin Phoenix can feel proud of his work. Seen Mad Max? Well so has Crowe and I feel he could have done better, but as it stands my heart was racing 2 or 3 times during this movie so he carried it off. The opening battle is pure cinema and hits the mark but from there the plot drags. I had no problem with the camera work that others have complained about. I felt it successfully represented what it was intended to. Overall it seems to me that Gladiator could not overcome the restrictions it placed upon itself: it wanted to recreate both Rome and and the Roman movie and the idea is solid but old ideas and money are rarely enough. Nice try. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great battle scenes, fine cinematography, excellent musical score, first-rate acting. For these reasons, I enjoyed the film.However, I really would have preferred it if they had made up the names of the characters and the world in which the action took place, rather than butcher Roman history. Examples: Marcus Aurelius groomed Commodus as his successor almost from the time of his birth (he was given the title Caesar when he was five years old, and became joint ruler with Marcus in 177, three years before Marcus' death); Commodus is reported to be blond and handsome, and saw himself as another Hercules; Lucilla did plot against him, but was found out and killed in 182, early in Commodus' 12-year reign; Commodus was lecherous -- having a harem of 300 concubines and an equal number of young boys for his sexual pleasure; he often appeared as a gladiator in the coliseum spectacles; he was smothered to death as a part of a plot led by Eclectus, his imperial chamberlain, Quintus Aemilius, commander of the praetorian guard, and Marcia, his favorite concubine, not killed by a General Maximus, who does not even appear in the biographies of Commodus that I have read.I suspect that they could have made a movie just as exciting if they had made it historically accurate, and somehow I would have found that to be preferable. However, it would have been far more difficult to find a hero, which is probably why they decided to create characters and events and pass them off as history. Too bad.</fullReview>

To those who complained about the correctness of the history events: 95% of the whole literature is just fantasy, the rest of 5% is fantasy inspired from reality. What do you think Spartacus was indeed like? Like Kirk Douglas? How about Cleopatra, Moses, Jesus, Columbus, Shakespeare and all others? Do you think they did exactly what you saw on the screen?

A smooth pace that keeps you interested all the way through. Amazing performances, great action, realistic but still reminded me of some ancient Roman fable. Excellent job by Ridley Scott.

		<shortDescription>Excellent fight scenes, boring storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm very confused about my opinion on "Gladiator". The dull "just-speaking" parts nearly put me to sleep and (SPOILERS AHEAD) the depressing scenes of Maximus learning the truth of his family seem to drag. Yet the scenes of Maximus and his fellow Gladiators fighting the Romans as a team are brilliantly coordinated, cool enough to stand the test of time and are carried powerfully by Russell Crowe. I guess I come to this conclusion: if I rent it to see it again, I'll probably FF to watch the fight scenes over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very well-made film with great acting and an interesting story. Yet I left the theatre disappointed. There was just something missing in this grand epic. Maybe character development?I would have loved to see the early years of Maximus and Commodus. Why is Maximus so beloved by the emperor - because he is a brave, honourable man? Why does he have such a low opinion of his own son? The fact that Maximus is the emperor's favourite is just a given. The reasons for that are never explored - we are simply told that that's how it is. So we never know why Commodus is who and what he is. In that sense I find the story to be just too simple.That doesn't mean it isn't worth watching. It just didn't grab me as much as I thought it would. Maybe it's a case of too high expectations!6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly magnificent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't make any comments until I saw this film twice as I wanted to be sure I wasn't just overwhelmed on first viewing. But the second time confirmed my feelings - this is a wonderful film.To those who don't think Gladiator is an epic - I'd almost agree. It is really a very personal story - that of Maximus and his desire for vengeance against the Emperor Commodus. The grand scope and effects in the film are really there just to underline this fact. They do this very well - the opening battle scene is huge and the scenes in the arena are wonderful (but if you can't stomach blood - don't go!). The scale of the film is epic with an excellent recreation of 'the Glory that was Rome'.The casting was generally good - concentrating especially on classically trained Brits in supporting roles. But the real focus of the film IS Russell Crowe as Maximus. He is on screen for most of the film and I can't imagine anyone else playing the role - he is the soul of the film and if he hadn't done such a good job the film would have been a disaster. He portrays Maximus' grief and rage superbly - in words, looks and gestures (I don't think I've ever seen anyone act so much with their eyes before...) You will not believe how menacing the line 'I will win the crowd' can be until you hear it.This should be the role that finally gets Crowe the recognition he deserves. He should have had Best Supporting Actor for LA Confidential, the Best Actor this year was a very tough category. Next year there shouldn't even be a contest - I don't think that anyone will dominate a film as much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see for all movie enthusiasts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: There are a few spoilers in the later parts of this review, so those of you who haven't seen the film may only want to read the first paragraph.After 1999 has come and gone, leaving us with such masterfully made movies as American Beauty, The Matrix, Fight Club, and many others, Gladiator is the first blockbuster of 2000 to be able to be ranked in the same level of quality filmmaking as 1999's masterpieces. Ridley Scott's directing is breathtaking and very innovative, the acting is very solid throughout the entire cast, the sound is wonderful, the production design is terrific, the editing is incredible, the cinematography is beautiful; all of the elements of filmmaking in this movie are perfect textbook examples, with the possible exception of the screenplay. The plot of this movie is very simple: a Roman general, named heir to the empire, is robbed of his position before he can accept it, and must escape his death only to be captured and sold as a gladiator. He then must try to exact his revenge on the new emperor from his lowly position of gladiator and slave. And now for the possible SPOILERS, so those of you who haven't seen the movie may want to stop reading.However, despite the simple plot, this film is actually quite deep. It is a drama, not a melodrama, which means that the movie is driven by the characters, not the plot. This film focuses on Maximus and Commodus, the gladiator and emperor. I have heard complaints that the female lead did not play a very big part in the movie. Well, no, she doesn't; that's why we call her part a "supporting role". The spotlight in this film belongs only to Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, who deserves much more credit than he has been given for his role in the film. Crowe is excellent in his role as the main character, but his character is a very straightforward one. He is the perfect good guy, strong, courageous, loves his family, intelligent, and has good sportsmanship in a sport whose sole purpose is cruelty. Maximus is a true hero, one that can inspire the audience, but his character is not nearly as complex as that of Commodus; I think that Commodus' character is the most interesting aspect of this movie.First of all, regarding Commodus, (and here is a very big spoiler), the most common complaint I have heard about the movie is that it is just ridiculous to have Commodus fight Maximus in the Coliseum at the end of the movie. However, if any of you go and do some research on the real emperor Commodus, you will learn that he actually fought over a thousand matches in the gladiator arena. Of course, they were all set up so that he would win, but that's also exactly what he tried to do in the movie, isn't it? Commodus is so fascinating because he is not your stereotypical "I love being evil and I hate everybody and I want to conquer the world" villain. He is very mentally disturbed, having been raised in a sheltered, silver spoon childhood in which he basically taught himself his own set of values and virtues, which are not the same as what the rest of the world's values and virtues are. He is evil, but in his own mind he does not believe he is evil. He thinks that he is a victim, and that he is only trying to achieve the love and respect that he believes are rightfully his. He is insanely jealous of Maximus, who commands the love and respect of everyone who knows him, seemingly without any effort, while Commodus himself tries so hard to be liked and still he gets himself nowhere. He also wants desperately to be loved by his father and sister, who love Maximus instead. Maximus has taken Commodus' place in his own family, and because of this, he feels justified in his cruelty. This jealousy also explains why Commodus would fight Maximus in the arena. Maximus has been a better brother and son than Commodus, and so to prove that he is better than Maximus, he must be a better warrior than Maximus.I went into this movie expecting to see an action-packed epic, but I quickly found that I enjoyed the film more when I began to watch it as a character study about Commodus with some very cool fight scenes, rather than a fighting movie with a sadistic, weak bad guy. I suppose that in this respect it is very much like Fight Club, which also tells the story of the mind of a man who turns to a life of violence and destruction. So if you like to watch action-packed movies with violence and great fight scenes, you'll love Gladiator. If you like to watch movies that make you think, you'll love Gladiator, provided that you actually do think. And if you like to watch excellently made, beautiful movies, you'll love Gladiator. This is definitely a must-see for all movie enthusiasts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have waited for about a year to see this and was not disappointed. The direction,effects and action sequences were at time mind blowing.Russell Crowe plays the lead with refreshing understatement and reminded me of Richard Burton at his very best.The story is very very loosely based on the last days of the Roman Empire but allowing for some poetic license we were transported to a time when life was cheap and the contentment of the mob was paramount.The film even had moments of humour especially from Commodus the errant son of the Marcus Aurelius but it was his evil which was superbly portrayed by Joachin Phoenix.This probably wont win the best film at next years oscars, due to it not being about life in modern America but i doubt i'll see a better film this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you don't like this film after the first half hour you'd better leave and save yourself another hour or two - it goes on &amp; on and doesn't improve with age. This is an epic with no heart and soul - lots of oh-so-evil bad guys and goody-two-shoes, sweetness &amp; light nice guys. You don't feel much for anyone in it, unlike other modern 'epics' like Braveheart, and computerized SFX or not, it can't hold a candle to the likes of Ben Hur/Spartacus etc. In fact, even the effects are not really all that impressive - and if the acting and script had been better I probably wouldn't have noticed, but I had so much time on my hands that I started trying to guess where the 'real' actors and sets stopped and the 'virtual' ones started. It's not quite like Titanic - the effects are not so impressive, and the acting is nowhere near as awful - but it does unfortunately come to mind. Still, at least go &amp; see it in a decent theatre, it will shrivel away to nothing on the small screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have waited for this movie almost a year. It's easy to be disappointed then. I was not. I have seen the movie twice, and will see it again.Actually, we have seen it all before: We saw Titanic go down in many movies, but never as realistically as in the movie from 1997. We saw D-day in The Longest Day, but when we saw Saving Pvt. Ryan in 1998 we felt we were there. We have seen gladiators fight and ancient Rome hundreds of times, but this was something different. Why? Because of the possibilities of modern technique. You actually felt you could almost smell what you saw.But Gladiator wasn't just special effects - it was a dramatic story as well.Ridley Scott, I thank you for bringing back the genre I love so much, the historical epic. Let's hope the era for these films starts again.There is only one bad thing with this film: it will lose very much on the small TV screen. See it on the big screen while you can!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I have to say I had not heard much of this movie before entering the cinema to watch it- my mind was open for anything that would come on screen for the next 2 hours or so. It was a disaster- a fatal disaster to watch this movie. I tried to live up to some distance period of "great-movie-making" but it all fell to the ground. The dialogue was cliche- the actors were medicore- the pictures was nothing special compared to what it wanted to be. The film really tried to "be something special." The mistake made was that it tried way to hard. There was no really flow in the movie, the sequences was put together as sequences and not as if they where made for the same movie.I was disappointed and would never recommend anyone to go see this movie. Ridley Scott may have done it before but fails to do it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the year's best; a startling experience. **** out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GLADIATOR / (2000) ****Ridley Scott is an master at manufacturing highly visual motion pictures with energetic, luminous stories. "Blade Runner" and "Alien" dazzled us with high tech action and suspense. Now the roman epic "Gladiator" vividly captures the time period and atmosphere in which its characters inhabit. This is an excellent looking production, one of the year's best. The movie is a visual tour-de-France; beautiful scenery, awe-inducing sets, convincing cinematography, and believable costume designs bring the ancient Roman Empire to life on screen.The story, set in 180 A.D., details the bitter life of the highly proclaimed General Maximus (Russell Crowe). We first meet him as he reigns a bloody victory after combating a slew of savage barbarians. Dying roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), greatly respects his favored warrior, and even chooses he, over his conniving son Commodus, (Joaquin Phoenix), to rule the dynasty after his passing. The emperor wishes for Maximus to restore the republican government to Rome.When Commodus perceives his father's intents, he is furious. Before Aurelius is able to explain his final demands to anyone, his own son murders him as well as Maximus' precious family, and orders his father's favorite to death. Maximus is underestimated, however, and escapes his condemnation, only to be captured soon afterward and sold into a slave camp led by the greedy Proximo (Oliver Reed). There, he and several other hopefuls, including Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) and Juba (Djimon Hounsou), are trained as gladiators, brutal and dehumanized warriors who fight one another to the death to amuse a live audience."Gladiator" contains a descriptive and clear first act. The set up and introduction defines the situations, characters, and motives respectfully. The character development is unordinary although extraordinarily effective; Maximus and Commodus are explained as the story progresses. The audience discovers more about them as the movie intertwines with perplexity. This method of character expansion devises depth and involvement within Maximus, Proximo, and Commodus and his good-hearted relative, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). Russell Crowe ("LA Confidential") undoubtedly will be further recognized as a sensational actor after his appearance as the gladiator. This determined actor conquers his role with complexity and optimal intensity. His performance is more solid than his in the Oscar nominated "The Insider." Joaquin Phoenix ("Clay Pigeons," "8MM") is diabolical and mischievously believable. Connie Nielsen ("Soldier") also shimmers in her timid but decisive performance.The confrontation scenes between Commodus and Maximus are hypnotic. The movie grants profound power when the two arch enemies discover each other's identity for the first time. "Gladiator" portrays its riveting characters with style and penetration; I really cared about the compelling figures in this movie.I did find a few trifling external problems within this otherwise flawless production. The film's combat sequences are high impact, intensely believable and some of the most involving moments in movies this year. However, the camera work often deprives us from indulging in the shear graphic qualities of warfare. Sometimes the scenes are too sketchy and brief, unlike the fighting in "Braveheart" and "Saving Private Ryan."In a time of the year when high-brow movies are rare, "Gladiator" offers clever writing, smart dialogue, involving characters, and perfect timing. This film is a feast for the senses, an overwhelming jolt of energy, a touching journey into the past. "Gladiator" is not merely a movie, but it is an experience.</fullReview>

Well how wrong an i, with Gladiator he has gone back to the days of 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner' where he knew exactly how ro gage the visual impact. Scott has done with the sword and sandles epic, that he did with the sci-fi genre breathed life into it. I highly recommend this to action fans, as well as to anybody interested in flims and film making, there are some glorious touches in this piece. My only downside would be the length a tad long in places might not be to everybody's liking. Anyway only a small downer, on what is a true blockbuster of a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not since the days of Kirk Douglas and Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner(for that manner) there has been a movie of such tremendous scope and power ever constructed in a motion picture of this magnitude on an epic scale. This was a far cry from the recent glorification of "Titanic",and it was well worth the change. I put it on the same ground level as Stanley Kubrick's "Spartacus",and William Wyler's "Ben-Hur",but it gives more of a volucity and surroundinged then ever since Mel Gibson's picture "Braveheart",especially the scene where Russell Crowe's character takes on the German tribes in one bloody battle opening sequence. But the part of the colisseum in Rome is one eye-popper here,and where he battles two opponents and a man-eating tiger is well worth the admission. If I had a choice of a movie to see on a Friday or Saturday night(whether the local mutilplex or the area drive-in theatre),I would see "Gladiator" again,and again!!!!!! HAIL RUSSELL!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator seemingly brings back the "Epic" film (although the true epics included thousands of extras and larger than life productions and with CGI none of that extravagance is necessary). Gladiator is by no means a great film. The plot is paper thin, the story lines moves from point A to B with unfaltering linearity, and the end battle is somewhat of a disappointment. With that said, however, Gladiator was incredible to watch, making the audience watch in amazement as bodies are sliced and diced in the gory arena battles. Russell Crowe is great (per usual) as Maximus, lending credibility to some of the more ridiculous dialogue and Joaquin Phoenix is superb (again per usual) as the tortured Commodus (unfortunate name). Y2K has not produced the great films of 1999 (American Beauty, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich) yet, but Gladiator is a nice try.</fullReview>

It also proves beyond a doubt that films of this genre are never going to become 'unfashionable'.Though I've seen LA Confidential, I'm not actually overly familiar with Russell Crowe's work, but I have to say that from this point onwards, I'm going to look out for anything that he's in with interest.I'd give this film a strong 9 out of 10. The only complaint (and this isn't going to be a spoiler!!) is that I left with the feeling that they'd perhaps edited it rather harshly for whatever reason, and that we as the audience had maybe missed out in order to keep the length down, though maybe I'm wrong.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I planned to go see Gladiator for the first time, I knew it would be good. But to be honest, I never expected such an incredible motion picture. Russell Crowe delivers his best performance yet. Joaquin Phoenix, a relative newcomer to the movie industry, does an incredible job as the lauded Emperor. It tells the story of a General(Russell Crowe) who is betrayed by his new Emperor(Joaquin Phoenix). His family butchered and his life destroyed by the Emperor, General Maximus finds himself in the ranks of an ex-gladiator who trains slaves to fight in the rink. But Maximus is bent on revenge. And so an epic battle between good and evil unfolds in those heart-pounding two and a half hours. The battle scenes are terrifically put together. They even rival the ones from Saving Private Ryan. And as for the casting, I don't think anyone could have been better cast. So far, Gladiator is my top vote for best picture of 2000(And I've seen everything). A little bit of friendly advice.

		<fullReview>Gladiator, as far as I can tell, is the best roman-history movie I've ever seen. Set during Rome's conquering of Europe, Gladiator is about a good-hearted General Maximus who, after skillfully conquering Germania, is heir to the dying Marcus Caesar's empire. But when Caesar's son hears that he is not the one to inherit his dad's throne, he kills his father, proclaims himself Caesar, then arrests Maximus because of disrespect for him and kills his family. When Maximus escapes from execution and discovers of his family's death, he is picked up by Gladiator trainers and trained to be a Gladiator. The movie was really good in cinematography as the scenes of the catapults and ballistas and flaming arrows in the sky, the colosium and the inside of the arena were absolutely stunning to see. During the sword battles, things got really bloody, sometimes the battles got messy and you could not comprehend what is going on: For instance, you can hear a sword cutting flesh, but on the screen all you can see is a complete shifty blur. But still, that does not take away the spirit of the movie, with the truly fantastic acting, the cinematography, the plot, and the drama involved. There were about 2 or 3 scenes where I nearly cried. The movie involved a LOT of blood and violence, such as when Maximus uses two swords like a pair of scissors and cuts off a gladiator's head, or when a female archer falls of the chariot and is later sliced in two by the spiked rod that sticks out of the chariot wheel. If you like intense battles and good acting, along with blood and guts, look no further.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Ben Hur? Indeed it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first Roman epic for many years, so many were ready to rip into it, with comparisons to Ben Hur and Spartacus awaiting.First things first, this easily holds up to the aforementioned epics, whilst surpassing them in several areas (the realism for one). Secondly, it puts Russell Crowe into the running for the "real man" roles that Harrison Ford and Mel Gibson are getting too old for.The whole cast come off looking well, especially given the fact that there were only 35 pages of useable script. Add to that the fact that from those pages, Ollie Reed and Richard Harris would still refuse to use some of the dialogue because they didn't like it. Much of the script was done in situ. A Roman epic as done by John Cassavetes?The only sticking point (performance-wise) was the occasionally hamminess of Joaquin Phoenix's Emperor Commodus (given that his name is also used to refer to a toilet, he's forgiven). He more than makes up for this by being very effective the rest of the time (thus he only rates a 0.2 on the Ustinov scale of hammy scenery chewing).The action scenes are stunning, easily outdoing Ben Hur's justly famed chariot race. Crowe comes off best here, though only just - his whole performance carries the film. With a presence you can't fail to be pulled in by, Crowe scythes through armies and gladiators alike, becoming a firm crowd favourite along the way.As with Spartacus, the events here are based on real Roman history. The two Marcus Aurelius and Commodus were previously portrayed by Alec Guinness and Christopher Plummer respectively, in The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964).One final note. Rest in piece Ollie. A comeback would have been welcome judging by the performance he gave here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't remember the last time I walked out of a theater so satisfied with a film I'd wanted to see so badly. My expectations were raised repeatedly, as the first and second trailers plus the glowing recommendations of friends who'd seen it equaled the possibility of a huge disappointment.Thankfully, the work of Ridley Scott, Russell Crowe and others did not let this moviegoer down. While the plot was good and well done, Gladiator's strength lies in its great battle sequences. You want blood? You got it. You want guts? You got it. These battles are some of the best I've ever seen on film.A certain MTV Movie Awards winner for Best Fight Sequence... the hard part will be deciding which battle to pick.While the battle sequences will be the number one topic of discussion as you're walking out of the theater, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the great performances from the main actors. I doubt Crowe has ever been better, there's a good chance you'll be chanting his name along with the crowd during the Coliseum scenes. Probably not Oscar-worthy, but you never know... Joaquin Phoenix deserves some recognition as well, he makes a good villain. From the moment he arrives on screen, the audience immediately hates his guts. By the time that these two finally meet, you'll want to see Phoenix get what's coming to him quite badly.A great movie, the best I've seen this year (so far), and a certain DVD purchase in the winter. But don't wait... see this one on the big screen. It's well worth the price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected little from this movie. All I had to go on was a preview and a bunch of commercials and promos playing during WWF (not that I'd be watching WWF, er...). So the first thing that comes to mind is: It'll try too hard to be both Spartacus, Ben Hur, and Braveheart but only mediocre and trying to show a bunch of repetitive fight scenes with average dialogue and no plot, and try to cash in on the role of a gladiator as another action movie.I'm glad I was wrong. Let me tell you, the one thing this movie has is character. All the roles are played with such life in their own ways, that it makes it far easier to imagine living in Roman times (though most of the actors were obvously not Roman, but we never portray other cultures that accurately do we?)The desires and views of the gladiator owner seemed believable and real, and the emperor's daughter in the movie had a firm yet willingly distant outlook on her environment.Caesar didn't have the exact effect of a Roman emperor I'd expect, even at his private dwellings, and seemed more like Obi-Wan Kenobi in some ways, but still he played well enough. (I guess altering the shape of the actor's skull to fit the role is out of the question.)Maximus, the hero, was noticeably not the invincible solo-man who rises to power by kicking everyone's ass and saying "FREEEDOM!" one too many times. In fact, he seems reluctant to be in his current position (of course you'd be) and shows more hope to die quickly without anyone taking notice rather than triumph.The main strong point of the movie is its tone- while harsh, it has both a sense of realism and a sense of telling any grand tale. The opening battle is so choppy and confusing, it adds greeatly to the effect of not only being surrounded by countless enemies in the nearly unseeable night, but the thought in the back of your mind that says "So I'm supposed to survive all this?"The gladiator fights, on the other hand, are close up and give a chance to see the fight from the hero's eyes, and not from the distance of the gladiator seat. Maximus kills through both strength and luck- even with armor, both strategy and weakness must be exploited, and this general is fully knowledgeable in that. He doesn't charge in like a madman, but only strikes when he expects to win. I felt this gave more credibility to the fights, especially seeing the fragility of the typical human against the slashing of steel.This movie requires you to care about its characters as well. You must place your eyes within the characters through each scene, and realize their plights. The movie mixes both a present day familiarity with a portrayal of life 2000 years old, which is sometimes accurate and sometimes altered simply for the audience to swallow easier.The other part of this movie that makes it great (and has been criticized for) is its very play-like atmosphere at times. It shows characters through archetypes, with lines and dialogue that represent who they are, even in their shifting moods. Oftentimes drama is used in place of what could be more normal scenes, making the movie seem more like a grand performance, where the characters and story is shone in vivid life. It tells a story well in its few hours, as if it could be transported to an Elizabethan play with no problem (minus CG effects).And as most movies try to be too much (Star Wars: TPM), or have no idea where they are going (Battlefield Earth), this movie knows its goal- to tell a story, and tell it well.And for that, it beat my expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was marvellous. It's high time we had some more epics of this type, and though quite a task to take on, this has succeeded beyond all expectations. It also proves beyond a doubt that films of this genre are never going to become 'unfashionable'.Though I've seen LA Confidential, I'm not actually overly familiar with Russell Crowe's work, but I have to say that from this point onwards, I'm going to look out for anything that he's in with interest.I'd give this film a strong 9 out of 10. The only complaint (and this isn't going to be a spoiler!!) is that I left with the feeling that they'd perhaps edited it rather harshly for whatever reason, and that we as the audience had maybe missed out in order to keep the length down, though maybe I'm wrong.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I planned to go see Gladiator for the first time, I knew it would be good. But to be honest, I never expected such an incredible motion picture. Russell Crowe delivers his best performance yet. Joaquin Phoenix, a relative newcomer to the movie industry, does an incredible job as the lauded Emperor. It tells the story of a General(Russell Crowe) who is betrayed by his new Emperor(Joaquin Phoenix). His family butchered and his life destroyed by the Emperor, General Maximus finds himself in the ranks of an ex-gladiator who trains slaves to fight in the rink. But Maximus is bent on revenge. And so an epic battle between good and evil unfolds in those heart-pounding two and a half hours. The battle scenes are terrifically put together. They even rival the ones from Saving Private Ryan. And as for the casting, I don't think anyone could have been better cast. So far, Gladiator is my top vote for best picture of 2000(And I've seen everything). A little bit of friendly advice. Go see it twice. You can enjoy the awe of it all the first time, then enjoy the terrific dialogue even more the second time(at least that's my theory)My personal vote: 8,00$/8,50$(It's a long story, but that is my rating system)How to see: Cinema</fullReview>

The only thing wrong with this movie is that Joaquin Phoenix, who plays the king, or prince, or whatever, isn't as sweet or naieve as his character in 8mm. Still, I saw this movie with two of my friends, and there was not one thing to make fun of. If you have ever seen a group of teenage girls at a movie, that is an incredible feat. Watch for Gladiator to win oscars for cinematography, costuming, and supporting actor. (Russell Crowe will probably not be nominated, because the academy is notorious for snubbing the "hero" of action films. Just take my advice, if you like any movies, and even if you don't, see Gladiator. It's worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to be able to say this movie was good but sadly I cannot. I even the saw movie a second time hoping I had perhaps missed something first time round but whichever why you look at it Gladiator is just plain bad. As an Epic it fails dismally, the lack of a storyline, poor acting and the incredible length and pointlessness of the dialogue scenes make sure of that the only saving grace here is that rome looks fairly good although due to bad camerwork you dont ever get a proper look at it. As an action movie again this movie falls short both because of its attempt to be an epic and also because of the very poorly shot action scenes. Ridley Scott seemed to think it would be a good idea if he actually didnt shoot any action and instead threw together a bunch of second long shots of blood and swords flashing in an attempt to recreate "the chaos of battle" all this seemed to recreate for me was the mild nausea I experienced while watching the Blair Witch Project. If all this wasnt enough after 2 and 1/2 hours of attempting to build a climax it seems the writers decided they had run out of time (as if it wasnt long enough already) and shot one of the stupidest and most pointless end scenes ever. The story seems to be building to another big battle scene with the invasion of rome and then all of a sudden Maximus is in the arena with the roman emperor?!? Oh well I could go on forever pointing out the flwas of this so called epic but instead ill just warn you not to waste your 5 bucks.</fullReview>

It didn't work. I could never tell who was hit, who wasn't, and what was going on.The use of art cinema techniques in the dream sequences were a waste of time. They didn't work with an "epic" movie.Crowe was awesome as Maximus, the effects were great; it was a great film with minor flaws that cracked any flow in the movie. Redo the fight scenes and maybe fix up all the fancy artistic stuff that was only there to look neat and this movie would be a 9. Instead, I'd give it a 7 at most.Not worth a second viewing.

		<fullReview>Gladiator is the best movie that I've seen so far this year. I worried about being disappointed by it, but I knew from first scene that I was in for a real treat. The battle scenes were outstanding. Every shot was like lightning, giving you a feel of what hand-to-hand combat must be like. Scott handled the gore extremely well, too. You see blood, but it's not slow motion, throw-up from all the disgusting gore. You THINK you see more than you really do. The characters are well thought-out and surprisingly complex. Maximus is tormented by his lost family, and his personal bounds of honor. He kills because he has to, in order to seek his revenge and/or survive. Even with all that you think Maximus is, there remains an air of mystery about him, largely due to Crowe's brooding charisma. We still don't know all that goes on behind that sloping brow. Commodus is deliciously evil and complex. Yet, we feel that all his conniving and his wickedness stems from his longing to be loved, first by his father and then from his people. He doesn't want to destroy Maximus; he wants to be him, for Maximus has the love of the people and of the Emperor. Commodus' unnatural affection for his sister Lucilla stems, again, from his longing for his father. The Emperor Marcus Aurelius loves Lucilla; Commodus projects the love he is denied onto the child that their father loves. Lucilla is a good example of a head-strong female ruler, much absent in epic films. She knows what she wants (Maximus), yet in keeping with the times, she doesn't force convention if it is not in her or her son's best interests. The only problem I had was that of Maximus' and Lucilla's past history. I think that, instead of having them be past lovers, that they could have been friends, with Lucilla being attracted to him, but never acting upon it until now. It never followed up enough with the backstory that was given, and I think this would have been a better, and easier explanation. On the whole, I give it two thumbs up. My friends and I already declared it that after the opening scene.</fullReview>

This movie was action packed with some violence on the gory side (though like Braveheart, does not lower the quality of this movie).

		<shortDescription>I love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing I want to say is I love this movie. It is only the second movie I've seen starring Russell Crowe, and in the words of my buddy and fellow movie critic, Robert G. Cash, "I think I'm in love with Russell Crowe." Similar to his character, Bud White in L.A. Confidential, Crowe is soft spoken, hard as nails, and outstanding as the principled and intrepid General Maximus Decimus Meridias.Maximus is favored by the dying Emperor, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), to take over as the keeper of Rome upon the Emperor's death, and is given the charge to destroy the corruption rampant in Roman society, turn the government back over to the Senate and end the rule of the Caesar's forever. The Emperor's jealous and power hungry son, Commodus, played very well by Joaquin Phoenix, is distraught when he hears of his father's intentions and sets out to destroy Maximus and everything near and dear to the General. (By the way, Commodus is the Latin word for commode. No wonder nobody likes this guy.) Commodus orders the General's death, but is startled when Maximus shows up later in the Colosseum of Rome as a slave and a gladiator, determined to exact revenge on the new Emperor "in this life or the next."Richard Harris, always one of my favorites, gives a great though short performance as the aging and good hearted Marcus Aurelius Caesar. Connie Nielsen with her classical look is perfect as Commodus' sister Lucilla, forced to keep her unstable brother happy while at the same time aiding her former beau Maximus. It is good to see Oliver Reed again as the slave trader and gladiator trainer Proximo, and even though Reed died part way through the making of this film and they had to digitize some of his scenes, he is still a better actor dead than the entire cast of (we demand more money than we deserve) "Friends".The battle and fight scenes remind me of Mel Gibson's Braveheart in their realism and brutality of sword combat, however, the scenes seem more surreal than Braveheart and the "cut aways" are often too quick to really see what is happening.Finally, just my two cents when it comes to movies about ancient Rome in general. Why are there never any Italians? Is Rome not in Italy? Did they not talk like Al Pacino in those days or what?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie in a Long Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it extremely hard to believe that many critics voted this movie below an 8/10. "Gladiator" carried more presence, more power, and more energy onto the screen than any other movie in many years. All cinematic elements came together - the casting, the story, the setting, the costume, the score - everything.Russel Crowe's inspiring portrayal of the noble general Maximus brought faith back into the art of film-making. Maximus was played with such conviction that it was very difficult to remember that this was just a movie. What made Maximus so captivating was not his aggressive role as a fighter, but his loyalty to his family and his genuine care for the goodness of Rome. Crowe brought to life the very human qualities that all people wish to achieve: honor, courage, valor, respect.Crowe's on-screen nemesis, Joaquin Phoenix, also played his role as Commodus with an innate passion. Commodus was ingeniously portrayed as the evil, immoral emperor - the man for whom Maximus is to seek vengeance upon.The other cast members, Connie Nielson as the emperor's sister Lucilla, Oliver Reed as the ex-gladiator turned entertainer Proximo, and Richard Harris as the all-powerful Marcus Aurelius , were all outstanding in bringing to life the emotions of this time period.None of these actors could have achieved such on-screen genius without such an awe-inspiring and intriguing story. It has been a very long time since this genre has entered movie theaters, and "Gladiator" sure brought that history to life. One was only spell-bound to the experiences and events that the people of that era lived through. It is about time that a movie came along that shared this important piece of history with modern society, so that people today realize and appreciate the goodness of our current society.The spectacular landscapes and sets also adds to the beauty and realism of the film. The background and Coliseum scenes were put on screen with such precision. The costumes were also appropriate to this time period. The score was also an element which added to the drama and powerful impact of the film.Walking out of the theater I was nothing less than completely satisfied. My faith in movies was completely renewed with this movie. Gladiator stretches beyond the role of a conventional popcorn movie, for it is something that leaves the viewer with a new sense of inspiration and a new understanding of a monumental era in our history. Maximus' role also goes beyond the call of duty since it provides us with a new sense of how life should really be lived: with honor and courage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long but good movie about Maximus, a general who fights for Caesar loyally and cannot wait to go back home to his family. Unfortunately, Caesar Marcus dies and Commodus takes over, a crying mommy boy who just does not like Maximus. After seeing his family murdered, Maximus ends up being picked as a slave who will fight as a gladiator. Good acting, grand costume, and the best battles in the Colosseum (since RETURN OF THE DRAGON) make this a must for any fan of epics or all out sword fights. A good movie to see again, if not for the overly long beginning and the obvious (we know Commodus is a loser as he starts crying to his father.) It kicks butt!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator was a great movie until the fight scenes. Ridley decided to use an up-close-and-personal technique to make it look like you are actually in the area with the Gladiators. It didn't work. I could never tell who was hit, who wasn't, and what was going on.The use of art cinema techniques in the dream sequences were a waste of time. They didn't work with an "epic" movie.Crowe was awesome as Maximus, the effects were great; it was a great film with minor flaws that cracked any flow in the movie. Redo the fight scenes and maybe fix up all the fancy artistic stuff that was only there to look neat and this movie would be a 9. Instead, I'd give it a 7 at most.Not worth a second viewing. Watch Spartacus instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is the best movie that I've seen so far this year. I worried about being disappointed by it, but I knew from first scene that I was in for a real treat. The battle scenes were outstanding. Every shot was like lightning, giving you a feel of what hand-to-hand combat must be like. Scott handled the gore extremely well, too. You see blood, but it's not slow motion, throw-up from all the disgusting gore. You THINK you see more than you really do. The characters are well thought-out and surprisingly complex. Maximus is tormented by his lost family, and his personal bounds of honor. He kills because he has to, in order to seek his revenge and/or survive. Even with all that you think Maximus is, there remains an air of mystery about him, largely due to Crowe's brooding charisma. We still don't know all that goes on behind that sloping brow. Commodus is deliciously evil and complex. Yet, we feel that all his conniving and his wickedness stems from his longing to be loved, first by his father and then from his people. He doesn't want to destroy Maximus; he wants to be him, for Maximus has the love of the people and of the Emperor. Commodus' unnatural affection for his sister Lucilla stems, again, from his longing for his father. The Emperor Marcus Aurelius loves Lucilla; Commodus projects the love he is denied onto the child that their father loves. Lucilla is a good example of a head-strong female ruler, much absent in epic films. She knows what she wants (Maximus), yet in keeping with the times, she doesn't force convention if it is not in her or her son's best interests. The only problem I had was that of Maximus' and Lucilla's past history. I think that, instead of having them be past lovers, that they could have been friends, with Lucilla being attracted to him, but never acting upon it until now. It never followed up enough with the backstory that was given, and I think this would have been a better, and easier explanation. On the whole, I give it two thumbs up. My friends and I already declared it that after the opening scene.</fullReview>

Scott's pacing of the film is impeccable, so when it's over you realise that you haven't looked at your watch once, or even realised you'd been sitting down!So much praise has been given to Crowe for his performance, and I can only add to it. The same quality of performance is given by his screen-nemesis, Joaquim Phoenix, whose portrayal of a ruthless, yet terribly vulnerable leader must surely be Oscar material. The late Oliver Reed delivers the kind of performance that makes us forget his last years and remember him for the great actor he once was. There is also a stirring musical score from the unstoppable talent of Hans Zimmer.This film must surely be the cinematic event of this year - and it will make one hell of a DVD!

		<shortDescription>Digital effects are fine in some situations, not in others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no problem with the use of digital effects where circumstance, be it money, danger, the death of an actor, etc requires their use. However, I was most bothered by their use in this movie in situations where they seemed to be there simply for their own sake, and often not illuminating the plot, characters, or situation. The most obvious example of this, and, frankly, the one which bothered me the most, was a scene between Maximus and Marcus Aurelius, I believe, on the battleground. The snow was obviously digitized and the two actors seemed to be standing behind a "snow curtain," not unlike the "rain curtain" I saw used in a touring stage production of _Singing in the Rain_ a few years ago. Neither actor had more than a couple of flakes on his costume in a pretty furious flurry. Also, the foley that we were hearing in this scene was that of the wind whistling, implying that there was at least more than the breath of wind which the snow's lugubrious progress down the frame, occasionally drifting back up into our field of vision again. It is true that snow DOES do this from time to time, but not in the company of winds more than a breeze. Perhaps this is a nitpicky thing, but it and a few other unnecessary digital effects somewhat destroyed my full commitment to the world which Ridley Scott so painstakingly created. This sort of effect can be easily achieved with some plastic snow, (and/or rosepetals, in the case of another scene) which any self-respecting propshop can give you, and an industrial fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't of thought that Russel Crowe could match his performance in the "Insider", but he does in stunning recreation of late 2nd Century Rome. This film has been called Ridley Scott's finest film since "Bladerunner". Wrong! It's his finest film, period. Mr. Scott has finally goven up trying to imitate his brother, Tony, and returned to more traditional story telling (forget G.I. Jane). The story is compelling, with real meat to it (some of it cleaved!).There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film. Even the minor historical inaccuracies work (stirrups on the horses, for example). The supporting cast are all given wonderfully realized characters to play. Watch for Oliver Reed to get a posthumous Oscar nomination next spring. Production design,a fantastic score, photography- it's a real repeater. Which is why I've seen it four times so far, with more viewings to come.Congratulations, Mr. Scott.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say that I saw this in an old theater with natural reverb, that was freezing the whole time. I've noticed Ridley Scott movies have a slightly muddy soundtrack. It's hard to describe, but it's noticeably when you view them. The natural reverb of the theater made it difficult to understand some of the movie, but I still found myself enjoying this movie.Fuzzy, muddy, indistinct? I don't think so. Practically every scene in this film is beautifully shot, and looks like it could be turned into a painting. From the contrast of fire against the dark woods in the beginning, to the fights in the Coliseum , this film looks amazing. The cgi people weren't going for stark realism, but a very stylized look and I believe it works. If you look at the Coliseum the first row of people is real, and the second is cgi, and for the life of me I couldn't tell the difference. Since everyone seems intent on comparing this to Braveheart, I'll do the same. To put it simply, it makes Braveheart's cinematography look amateurish by comparison.On top of the amazing cinematography, you have a completely immersive score. I never found it cheesy or manipulative, and I HATE manipulative scores (for example: Braveheart). What can I say about the story? It's a simple revenge story, but that really doesn't matter because the execution is so masterful. It's about death and redemption. My only complaint is that it seemed like some of the plot was cut out to make this more of a summer movie. I'm sure the dvd will fix the situation, though. Is this completely historically accurate? Of course not, and it doesn't pretend to be. It's a fictional tale, told in a historical setting. Demanding 100% historical accuracy from a movie that doesn't claim to be historically accurate is absurd and unfair.Overall, though, I don't really care what other people think about this movie. To me it is a work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strength and honor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one boils down all the elements of "Gladiator", this is the one phrase in the entire film that stands out the most to me. These are ultimately the words Maximus (played by a stunning, rawly powerful Russell Crowe) lives by and dies by. To most of us at the other end of the two millenia mark, the idea is corny, a punchline for a bad joke (indeed, I felt that this have been the point of the little satirical presentation outside the Collusium). For soldiers, men who put their lives on the line every day, it's a way of life. It's what kept Maximus going, even after everything he ever loved or fought for (the ideal of Rome, the emperor that he fought under for so many years, his family) were no more. There's no honor in going to your grave with business unfinished. To finish it, therefore, you need strength. As the Romans were always hailed as a practical people, the motto makes perfect sense to me.But "Strength and honor" go beyond even that simple definition in the film's context. Not only does Maximus use his strength to survive another brutal day in the arena against five heavily armed and armored opponents, but he lends his strength to his comrades-in-arm in a fixed reenactment, turning a certain slaughter into a triumph. Not only does Maximus' sense of honor stop him from hailing an emperor who has none of his respect, but also makes him spare the life of a fallen opponent the entire Collusium wants him to end...until the moment he doesn't.Harlan Ellison has written that it is never the common man who changes things, but the uncommon man. If Ridley Scott's sheer visual epic is anything, it is a celebration of that man, a man who still believes in "Strength and honor".</fullReview>

This movie had a lot going for it, an excellent lead actor in Russell Crowe, great costumes, and beautiful scenery. What disappointed me about it was the use of familiar plot lines that are in almost every other film of this genre. A murdered family, so the hero is driven by revenge. A crazed leader in Mr. Phoenix as Commodus. Gee, I've never seen the son murder the father before to get control of the throne. And the downfall of this really long picture was the lack of action. Hey, I think the fight scenes were great, all four of them. The rest was machismo talk. Besides, if you know your history, you walk in already knowing that Rome never becomes a republic again, and the senator Gracchus meets a horrible untimely death.

		<fullReview>Get ready for a visually stunning movie that will touch your soul, make you cheer, and make you cringe all in one shot. When the royal highness isn't getting his hand kissed by the people, and when the camera doesn't pan above the Roman Coliseum, and when you aren't truly feeling involved in this simple but wonderful story of a brave general turned slave turned Gladiator, you are cringing every time a sword cuts into a man's flesh. Even the violence was visually stunning. This movie (and I won't give away too much), has a battle scene comparable to that of Saving Private Ryan's opening battle. Although not as long and drawn out, it brilliantly sets the tone for a movie 2 hours and 34 minutes in length which seems like and hour and a half when it's all done. Kudos on the casting job. Crowe delivers with a bang and he is proving once again that he belongs here. Give him a part and he will play it, much like the rest of the LA Confidential alumni. Gladiator is a film of potential epic proportion. But it won't become an epic unless people make it that way. It's a wonderful cinematic experience not to be missed by anyone who would appreciate a movie of this caliber.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to join the people who are disappointed by this movie. Yes, it's entertaining. Yes, it has some beautifully designed scenes. Yes, my wife was in tears at the end (which is seldom) - so it obviously touches some strings of one's soul. That's good enough. But... the Gladiator is full of cliches (pardon my French). Watching the movie I was constantly comparing it to other films. During the opening battle scene my wife whispered to me - "Well, it's Private Ryan set in ancient Rome". Yes, it is. Same jerky camera movements, same gore. The plot is almost scene to scene copy of Braveheart with overall atmosphere of Spartacus. We see the hero going through the field and touching grass tops - hell, I've seen this in dozens of Soviet movies about collective farms. Gladiators' cubicles are just like a modern prison - do you remember the episode when Maximus and his fellows come to the Colliseum for the first time dressed in blue (denim?!) outfits? Haven't you seen this in many movies like "Lock Up" or "Tango and Cash"? It's indeed a terrible mix of many previously seen movies.But what disappoints most is the final - as pathetic as the ones from the Soviet Stalin era pictures. Though it is a common feature of most Hollywood products. Being an European I can not understand the love of American directors to endings that leave nothing to one's imagination. The Evil is punished, the Good wins. Well, maybe I'm asking for too much from dream factory (grin). But the problem stays. These endings spoil even the best movies like "Saving Private Ryan". Watching it I was praying "Good Lord, do not let this old Ryan salute Miller's grave". God did not listen to my prayer (another grin). Well, maybe its a punishment for my sins. Nevertheless the "Gladiator" is worth watching - for its sometimes really stunning visual effects, for very good performances of Russel Crowe and Oliver Reed. I've been really missing a good historic (even if pseudo-historic) movie about ancient Rome or Greece. Maybe I was expecting too much.-six out of ten-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott finally delivers the goods again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Gladiator" three weeks ago, but only now I've got the opportunity to write a comment: the opening battle sequence alone is absolutely impressive and perfectly sets the tone for Maximus' story. Russell Crowe was good but with his powerful Jeffrey Wigand (from Michael Manns modern classic "The Insider") still in mind, he didn't impress me as much this time around. Yet, I can't think of another actors to be more suitable for such roles as Russell Crowe and it's clearly to his credit that "Gladiator" is such a fine movie. Joaquoin Phoenix is much less convincing, I actually found him pathetic. But that is as well one of the few minor weak points in an otherwise decent script: they should have come up with a tougher, more dangerous emperor - Commodus never convinced me as a serious nemesis for Maximus. Richard Harris, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed (if much of his appearance in the movie had to be computergenerated due to his death during the shoot, then I must say, the result is baffling - it's never obvious, though you might guess where they used CGI) and particularly Derek Jacobi as the senator who strives to dethrone Commodus were so good in their roles that they easily compensated for the shortcomings in the characterization. Visually, "Gladiator" is ravishing to look at and the battle sequences are some of the best I've ever seen (dull remake of Braveheart? Bah! Braveheart is self-indulgent and plain idiotic - eat your heart out, Mel Gibson). Admittedly, there were some images in the movie similar to those in Leni Riefenstahls NS propaganda movie "Triumph of the Will" but so what? There is no fascist ideology (neither obvious nor hidden) in Ridley Scotts film to worry about. If Scott borrowed images from Riefenstahls propaganda piece then in the intention to establish the sense of epic proportions, to show the power and glory of the Roman Empire, nothing else. "Gladiator" has been compared to "Ben Hur" and "Spartacus" - time will tell if it once will be hailed as a classic. I personally like it more than "Spartacus" (from which maestro Kubrick distanced himself), but it comes nowhere close to Wylers "Ben Hur". But it must be said that it is Ridley Scotts best movie for a long time (though, by no means as good as Alien and Blade Runner), exciting and breathtaking. Bring up "Hannibal"(8,5 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best film I have seen this year. It generally takes an exciting prospect to get me out of my seat and down to my local cinema, and this film has that quality. When I first heard about the film, I was intrigued, especially when I heard Ridley Scott was to direct. Then people started talking about the remarkable special effects and fight sequences. I'd read some preview comments in the national press and that interested me more. I think what impressed me most about this film was not the prospect of Russell Crowe and friends in leather (however...), but the fact that there is no sex, no swearing, no gratuitous violence (apart from what is appropriate to the storyline). I thought the film was well-acted and not too far-fetched, quite believable in parts and very touching in certain scenes. I would go and see this film again (I probably will), and although I'll buy it when it's released on video, it's best enjoyed on the big screen. This film is an EPIC. Go and see it if you haven't already.</fullReview>

No offense to Crowe(I really loved The Insider), but he's no Mel Gibson and Braveheart, with all it's weaknesses, is so much better than the computer-generated Gladiator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an historian I can't resist commenting on the movie. I teach a course on Roman history and frankly. . .I LOVED IT! Granted, as in all films, they run right over most of the historic details (such as Commodus ruled for 12 years and did not die in the arena but instead was strangled by a wrestler) but what the heck, it was other things I was looking for. I've visited Rome several times and was stunned to see the relatively good accuracy of recreating the arena, especially the details such as the awnings. One of my students who traveled to Rome with me was by my side at the movie, and when the scene first shifts to the arena we were on the edge of our seats, noting the details and were thrilled, pointing out where we had stood. Nor did Scott go 50s Hollywood with thousands of gladiators fighting it out at once, the games were terribly expensive and even in Rome a fight with fifteen or twenty on a side was a big show, except of course for the famed dedication of a water works project during the reign of Cladius were supposedly five thousand fought in one day in a fake naval battle.If you want to catch a sense of what Rome really looked like, the sense of the power of the cult of gladiatorial combat, and visually what a Roman army looked like (though not quite fought like) this film will do it. And, as well, if you want to get a bit of a creepy sense that you too might have been seduced by the power of the games, as the character of Oliver Reed so beautifully explains, then definitely see this film.The battle sequence at the start was stunning and incredibly well acted, though I still wait for the day when the moment of contact between the opposing sides is done correctly, with mass formations, shields overlapping, piliums (heavy Roman javelins) flying. But yet again, what the heck, it was pretty darn close!I hope Gladiator sets a new trend towards films set in other historic periods and with it the effort to recreate the look of that time. I know that a lot of my more stuffy peers will sniff, whine about details etc. but when you are trying to motivate a 100 level freshman survey class, this film will spark the interest and get the questions flowing, which can then be directed into "real" history.One question though and I hope someone responses. Was it me or did I hear the battle chant from the movie Zulu? Zulu is one of my favorites and I could swear that twice I heard the banging of the shields and battle chant at the very start of the movie when the Germans attacked. Let me know, its been bothering me.Enjoy the film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>satisfying epic, whatever the nit-pickers say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been reading numerous comments about this movie over the last few weeks and I've been amazed at how pedantic many of the criticisms have been. To all those of you complaining how weak and cliched the screenplay is I'd ask you to name one movie set in Ancient Rome where there is no clunky or camp dialogue. What do you want,exactly? How would you have improved it? Have a go, if you think you're so hot.I'm not saying it's perfect by any means. However, on balance, any reasonable movie-goer should be able to admit that the triumphs outweigh the failures: beautiful cinematography (the complaints that the choppy editing in the fight scenes make it difficult to follow...please...don't you think the intention might have been to give the viewer the feeling of being in the heart of the action?),strong performances (Crowe's magnetic in a slow-burning, intensely powerful, dignified performance: can you imagine if Mel Gibson, or...eek...Arnie had been given the role?; Pheonix was superb with a complex and fascinating villain; Neilson was quietly impressive as a woman torn between 4 men: father, ex-lover, brother and son; even Oliver Reed proved he could act when he could be ar**d) and a screenplay that was not without cliche, but was able to tell a big story very concisely (the scene with Commodus and Lucilla arriving in Germania had barely 100 words of dialogue, but gave us mountains of information about both characters).Those of you complaining that there was not enough back-story or information about the motivations of the key characters, do you honestly need every last detail to be explicit? You are allowed to use your imagination sometimes.To conclude, I'd say that it delievered everything that one could ask for from a film of that genre, and I felt I'd had my money's worth...even on second viewing. You can nit-pick any film you care to mention, but why not just sit back, enjoy the spectacle and let yourself be transported to another (historically inaccurate, fair enough criticism)era for a couple of entertaining and sometimes moving hours?</fullReview>

I think Russell Crowe did a good job, but nothing about the Maximum role required him to act that hard. The best moment for him in the film was when Lucious approached him in the Gladiator holding cage ... very genuine acting. This film need more humour and tender moments.

Apparently, she was having a great time and loved the movie. I thought the plot revolved around punishing patricide, but my wife thought it a sweet story of frustrated love.For some reason, we saw entirely different movies.Getting back to the trailer, I hope someday there is a movie that matches the trailer's promise. I was willing to put up with a cardboard plot if the action and computer graphics were spectacular. They were not. The scale was all wrong... not realistic but cartoonish. In many scenes the action had a curious jerkyness, as if there was not enough money to create 30 computer frames per second so 15 had been used. I had hoped for an experience of 'being in Rome during a gladiator fight' but it failed to deliver.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's masterful "Gladiator" concerns a, you guessed it, gladiator who's family has been gruesomely butchered and has been thrown out of his position as general by the emperor Commodus. Soon, Maximus fights his way into the harsh world of the gladiator, and begins to defy an empire. Commodus soon realizes that he is becoming the underdog and is literally losing his fame. Soon, he develops a plan. The musical score is extremely beautiful and yet heroic and powerful. I have a gut feeling that will be nominated for Best Original Score.The director, Ridley Scott, who's previous films include the frightening "Alien" and the action-packed "Bladerunner", does a wonderful job as director in this flick. He knows when to use a tool and when not to, and sometimes he needs to know how explicit a tool can be, and he succeeds in this. The acting is superb. Russell Crowe is an instant Oscar nomination, and the guy (I forget his name) who plays the African gladiator is superb, and he might snag a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The sister of Commodus puts on an O.K. performance, and while Commodus is a weak and pathetic character and the actor does that well, he is pretty fake. Now, since my review is coming to an end, here is what this will receive: Nomination for: Best Actor Best Sound Best Supporting Actor (Maybe) Best Picture (A chance it will be) All in all, this is a 10 out of 10 movie, even though it has small pieces that are a little off-course, it's still a 10. All hail Gladiator!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOTE: Before you read my rating you must be informed that as I was watching this film at the CAROLUS theatre in Nijmegen (Netherlands) at 13.30 on Saturday the 20th of may 2000 there was a constant disturbance by two people in the back, who talked all the time. Except during the break, then they kept quiet, of course. I must also say that I despise thy, thoucompanions and thou friends, who spoil other peoples movie experiences, simply because thy don not appreciate the movie or because thy behave in the same way at home, where you watch movies on TV. If it is the first than, please go away and if it concerns the latter, than please, wait 6 or 8 months and rent it, for then thy can speak to thy companion and do anything you like and not spoil it for others as well!!!!!!!!!This might have affected my final rate for the film!!!Now for my review, of course Gladiator was good. It had a lot of action, which was brilliantly coreographed and filmed by the way, quite a lot of blood (though the film was not very gore) a great soundtrack, good actors, especially Russell Crowe (as the revenge driven Gladiator), River Phoenix (as the psychopathic ceasar) and Connie Nielsen (as the suppressed and terrorised Lucilla). But I also liked Djimon Hounsou and Ralph Mller a lot. The plot actually was good too there were just 2 bothers if you ask me, first of all there are far too many boring politics involved for this action ? revenge pic, plus there are a few visions, Crowe had in this film that I found very unfitting, especially that in the end. Oh yes I almost forgot, I didn't like the ending very much. The basics were good but the was it was carried out was way too melodramatic. Standing there and stumbling for many seconds falling, then of course the FINAL words of the hero!! But there were more good than bad things here besides a lot of blood, sadness, sorrow, depression, madness, it all really made you feel for these people. I even had tears in my eyes at one point or two, just as I had with another epic film I saw, which is another classic in my eyes and funny enough has somehow a similar plot (as for the basic revenge story), Braveheart. These are the two best epic classics of the past 10 years and surely two films that may not be missed.As you may have noticed I found the ending rather bad, regarding the rest of the film, this is also the reason, why I say, Gladiator was good, when it could have been HUGE, GIGANTIC, EXCELLENT, it could have been TITANIC!!!But it still is a classic, so stop reading and go see it!8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning, Spoilers ahead.Gladiator might not be the greatest film ever, it might not even be the best this year but it is most certainly the best Hollywood hype film for years. While I was watching this I though of the other Ridley Scott film I had seen, Blade Runner, and the two share similarities. An incredible set design and background, the cities in this film look real, an unbeatable character who is beaten and an evil which must be destroyed. It is also clinical like Blade Runner, yet it had me in tears at the end. The similarities end here and I think Gladiator is a much better film because the supporting cast and the lead actors are allowed to flesh their roles out more. There are also many different moods going on here.Gladiator is in many ways a tragedy, in the manner of Greek tragedy, where there is double crossing and death at every turn, only it is blasted on to the big screen and comes alive. The end reminds me of Hamlet a bit as well. Russell Crowe yet again shows he is a really good actor, and Oliver Reed had his best part in years, indeed as Proximo he has one of the best speeches in the film about what it is like to fight at the Coliseum, but this film is made in many ways by Ridley Scott and the little details he puts in in the huge crowd scenes, especially the ones at the Amphitheatres. Truly breathtaking in scope yet as very small, all Maximus wants to do is go home, if there has been a better huge budget film since Blade Runner, I don't think I've seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not know movies like this were made anymore -- or even could be made.The production values go beyond lavish -- this is truly a Hollywood Spectacular.Somebody really did their homework -- every detail was brilliantly executed. However the Romans of that period in history did not have tempered steel (which made its debut in the 14th Century) but is sure looked better on screen than the iron or bronze weapons the real gladiators would have carried.There is true genius in this film: costuming, photography, art direction and most of all the acting and direction.Ridley Scott outdid himself. The sheer size, scope and grandeur are breathtaking.Russell Crowe heads an incredible international cast that had to truly believe in this film to achieve the greatness that the audience sees on the screen.Whoever did the matte paintings (no credit given) be they on the traditional glass or CGI deserves a special mention. They transport the viewer to a place that is so unreal it becomes real.In the credits there is a brief homage to Oliver Reed -- who died the day after the film was released in the United States... I do not know how they worked that credit into the release that I saw but I do appreciate it.This is an instant classic and will go down in filmatic history as 'A Movie For All Time.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator wants to be rousing entertainment, but it's like a talented painter doing a paint-by-number kit and trying really hard not to go outside the lines. It was such a faithful retelling of standard, cliche gladiator movies that I could mouth most lines before they were uttered. It's probably the most faithful remake in history except for Psycho. Which is not to say it doesn't manage some entertainment value. Russell Crowe is well cast, Joaquin Phoenix surprised me with his range (by showing he had some), and Connie Nelson gave a subtle performance when I would have expected something more heavy-handed. But the action sequences are choppily edited and filmed through a haze, making it hard to tell whose blood it is spraying across the screen (I could only assume it wasn't Crowe's character's). I give it a six; anyone giving it higher than a seven is very easily amused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, this movie is outstanding of its kind, and should be ranked with Ben-Hur and Spartacus. However, there was something not completely satisfying about this movie. I think I've put my finger on how I feel about it. It was cold, not entirely human. Partly this is due to the characters. Maximus, the good guy, is not exactly the life of the party. Commodus, the bad guy, is a much more interesting character (and was awesomely portrayed by Phoenix), but in the end is too troubled and evil to be appealing. All of the characters are either in trouble or troubled, and the lengthy story has to move along at such a speed that each scene has to show one of these troubled, humorless characters making a decision or moving the plot along in some way. That is, the characters are mechanisms to move the plot along (and the plot itself is a mechanism to show off the awesome spectacle of the movie itself), and none of them wind up being very appealing, or very human. Which is why I think Spartacus is probably the better movie in the genre. In that movie the humanity of the characters was central to the plot. They were not machines.</fullReview>

I do not agree although I feel that Gladiator is up in that league of films. It has a great story although not historically accurate. People get into the characters and there is some very good acting here. The only complaint I have of this film is that of the camera views at certain times. They can be extremely close and quick which makes it hard to see what has happened. This is true in many of the action scenes. Still I was amazed by the action and the beauty of the many scenes.

		<fullReview>Despite the initial revenge by the numbers feel of the first half of the film, Crowe carries this film magnificently in his slide from hero to abject despair and redemption of a sort.On first watch, there are many similarities with the first Mad Max film - hero doing his bit for "society", wife and kid at home. His family is killed by the bad guy and the remainder of the story is a rollicking ride to see how the revenge is pursued and ultimately obtained.Being an American film where the good guy has to win, that he will get his revenge is without doubt, only the path matters.Phoenix's character is almost a caricature of a bad guy, with no redeeming features whatsoever; the byplay with the Senate mostly lost in the story.Ultimately a satisfying story - the sweeping opening battle designed to either solidify Crowe's character's battle mastery and general status, or to self-justify the cost of staging the battle.Enjoy..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i guess maybe i was expecting too much of this film, and you know how it is, when you go in with high expectations, you almost always come away feeling a little cheated when it does'nt live up to the hype.. that's the way this gladiator was for me. the shots went so quickly i could'nt tell what was happening from a blow by blow standpoint and it made me dizzy. the best movie in my opinion that recreated sword,arrow, knives and other weapons of distruction in a period that was before the gun was braveheart... that's is what i measured this movie up to, and it did'nt measure up. along with battle scenes being frought with and overabundance of quick cuts, there were some non battle scenes that were just too long and boring.. so in my opinion battles scenes to quick short and jerky and a plot that an 18 yr old high school student could have written.if you want to see good fighting and heroism, do not see gladiator...save your money and rent braveheart instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator seems to me the first good film of the year 2000. Many of the people I know have compared it to be better than Braveheart. I do not agree although I feel that Gladiator is up in that league of films. It has a great story although not historically accurate. People get into the characters and there is some very good acting here. The only complaint I have of this film is that of the camera views at certain times. They can be extremely close and quick which makes it hard to see what has happened. This is true in many of the action scenes. Still I was amazed by the action and the beauty of the many scenes. This film is very good. Go see it in theater if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film but not quite an epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Think of the Roman Empire and classic films like Sparatacus and Ben Hur spring to mind. Russell Crowe gives a compelling performance, and indeed one that could match Heston or Douglas. They however had the great benefit of a quality script. The special effects are awesome, the fight scenes breathtaking , and the opening battle gives Spielberg a run for his money.If only some of the cash could have been diverted to the script then a true epic ,to be remembered for years, would have been created. All in all, a fantastic film which hits the crossbar of true greatness. I give it a nine</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Russell Crowe shines as a Roman Mad Max...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the initial revenge by the numbers feel of the first half of the film, Crowe carries this film magnificently in his slide from hero to abject despair and redemption of a sort.On first watch, there are many similarities with the first Mad Max film - hero doing his bit for "society", wife and kid at home. His family is killed by the bad guy and the remainder of the story is a rollicking ride to see how the revenge is pursued and ultimately obtained.Being an American film where the good guy has to win, that he will get his revenge is without doubt, only the path matters.Phoenix's character is almost a caricature of a bad guy, with no redeeming features whatsoever; the byplay with the Senate mostly lost in the story.Ultimately a satisfying story - the sweeping opening battle designed to either solidify Crowe's character's battle mastery and general status, or to self-justify the cost of staging the battle.Enjoy..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is nothing special, it's just good. At times it looks great and at other times it looks artificial and simply stupid. The character of Commodus is incredibly annoying, although I say that, he is the most interesting in that he is not your usual scheming cowardly little prick that you encounter in films like this, but is also deeply disturbed. The best scene in the film involves Commodus and his father in the build up to the murder, brilliantly acted by Harris and Phoenix. The story is dull in it's familiarity, there's nothing there really but your basic " i want to get home to my family, oh shit my family has been killed by the bad disloyal Commodus so now i must get revenge because i am good and loyal". Having said that, the battle and fighting scenes are very entertaining with plenty of fine decapitations. Considering all the trash produced in the nineties which Gladiator stands high above, it's worth going to see just for having some element depth, and not just being dumb futile crap. I'd say it would rank just about in my top 30 films of the nineties. Although with Scott's other films Bladerunner and Alien this does not compare. Gladiator is just good, nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People are so cynical these days</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read many comments and thoughts on the film Gladiator (not just what's written below) and it's come to my attention that this amazing piece of film-making is going to be one of those movies people love, hate or are non-plussed about.I've seen many people who have commented on the historical accuracy of the film. Well, no offence, but I'm not a student in history and I don't really care about details. I can't speak latin and I didn't want to go and see a movie that was subtitled for the apparantly less intelligent or observant viewer. Also, no matter what archaeology tells us or what history books inform us of, the actual look and design of the film was still speculative, based as it is on a culture two thousand years ago. They were trying to tell a story, not go back in time, and I think what they presented on screen was more than enough.A reviewer I saw on TV recently wanted to know 'why has Hollywood taken a thirty year step back to make such plotless films?' So, the golden age of cinema is dead, then, yes? All Hollywood churns out is putrid re-hashes of old ideas and that's it, yes? And as for no plot, I really don't think the film can be accused of that. It sets itself up nicely and travels through to an excellent and deserved conclusion. No passion? No heroism? If you cannot see that on the screen then the cynic in you is obviously your strongest trait.My own personal view is this - Gladiator stirred something in me that I have not felt in a long time. It dealt with personal pain and revenge and did not get fouled up by modern-day values and twenty-first century political correctness. It even portrayed the Roman Empire as the preferrable alternative to the barbarians throughout the known world, even showed their belief system and that it actually worked for them. In short, Gladiator was an honest film that simply laid out the details and told you how it was. I loved it for everything it was and everything it gave to me. Many people's views I have read have basically enlarged a single aspect of the film they didn't like. People are so cynical these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's been a long time coming, but finally another gladiator flick hits the big screen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Ridley Scott brings this blockbuster epic tale of ancient Rome to a modern audience. Russell Crowe plays the general to Marcus Aurelius Caesar, Richard Harris is the emperor, who defeats the Germanian army. In the aftermath, Caesar dies of "mysterious" causes and his son, Joaquin Phoenix, takes the crown. He orders Crowe to be executed, but Crowe escapes, only to be trained by Oliver Reed as an arena gladiator. Crowe becomes a favorite of the bloodthirsty crowds by the time that Phoenix learns of his escape. Soon, Phoenix and Crowe will have to come across one another's path. The film has great flavor for the period and solid acting and good computer enhanced effects, but the battle scenes are too often done in a stylized, close-up manner, which makes it difficult to discern exactly what is happening. Sadly, Reed died during the filming and, thus, this is his final film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Any time you hear the word 'classic' applied after one week, be wary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is a good movie, and well worth the price of admission. If you believe the hype surrounding the film, though, you will be disappointed -- this is not a 'classic' now, nor will it ever be. Walk into the theater expecting a fun time, however, and you will be rewarded with one (but as another reviewer stated, please leave the kids at home. This is a film that richly deserves its "R" rating... I will leave it at that)."Gladiator" tells the story of Maximus, beloved and skillful general of the Roman army and Marcus Aurelius' choice (rather than his own immoral son Commodus) to rule the Roman Empire after his death. The film starts out with a great winter battle scene (although filmed in an annoying and difficult-to-watch hand-held camera style, very similar to the first half hour of "Saving Private Ryan"), moves quickly to the premature death of the Caesar and the order given by Commodus for Maximus' (and his family's) death, Maximus' escape from execution, and his being forced into slavery and the illegal bloodsport of the gladiator. As a battle-tested general, Maximus makes a natural gladiator, and when Commodus reinstates the gladiator games in Rome (to bolster his popularity in an attempt to overthrow and eliminate the pesky Senate), Maximus is given his opportunity to enter Rome and gain his revenge.Interestingly, at a point where the story should be picking up some serious steam for the home stretch, it runs out of gas, and the film pretty much coasts the rest of the way in. We are given some great action scenes, good performances (notably Phoenix as the slimy Commodus, Reed (in his final role) as gladiator owner Proximus, and of course Crowe, as Maximus), and great effects, but the momentum created during the first hour is not maintained for the rest of the long film.Give "Gladiator" a try, most will be glad they did. It is a fun movie and a good start to the summer movie rush. Just don't expect an epic classic... expect eye candy that satisfies. These days, can we expect more than that?</fullReview>

And as such, GLADIATOR delivers on many levels as a satisfying cinematic experience. Russell Crowe is a big-time star. He is the film's center, no doubt. His enthusiam as the film's hero, Maximus, creates a powerful character for the audience to embrace. He is honorable, strong and practically fearless in battle. Alongside his strangth comes a particlarly touching human side, a vulnerability that will make women swoon and men wonder lies within their own hearts as well.GLADIATOR, like its star, is brutal, menacing, thoughtful and complex.

		<shortDescription>Two thumbs way up but only for second...I wouldn't want to lose them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was reassured within the first five minutes of this film that Ridley Scott was present and accounted for. The opening battle scene was almost psychotronic in it's atmospherics...like a Roman version of Alien. Wow! I love this director. Russell Crowe has definitely arrived too. He takes charge immediately as a believable Maximus, a great general with character, courage and the loving loyalty of his men...men of one of history's greatest armies. ("When I give the signal, let loose hell.") This guy's an alpha-male with a capital alpha! The movie follows his destiny as he navigates the twists and turns of Roman politics, greed and power. He is betrayed by a vile dweeb, a dying Marcus Aurelius Ceasar's son, who orders Maximus and Max's wife and son killed. This succeeds for the family but Max escapes and is spun off on a Jean Valjean-like journey of redemption and obscured identity. Except instead of becoming a mayor, he becomes...you guessed it...a Gladiator. Apparently, he is a gifted scrapper and builds quite a reputation. He comes to Rome and settles up the score. Riveting. Engaging. Awesome. The acting is superb. The script is intelligent and marvelously credible considering the difficulty scriptwriters have with historical movies, at least as far as I'm concerned. And it is terrific history! Very accurate. This presupposes that I know some Roman history...well, of course, I do. It had some tragedy which my companion (my wife) always finds intollerable and of course I gave her my standard speech about how film is not always supposed to make you feel warm and fuzzy but rather challenged and sometimes jolted. And as usual, it was hopeless. No way any movie gets an Oscar vote from my wife when kids get killed. However, she made me proud by brightly acknowledging that the violence was not gratuitous, in fact she said "it was necessary to the advancing story arc and was done tastefully." At this point, I felt some pride from how well she had learned her Film 101 lessons. In summary, I was glued to the screen for 150 or so minutes and I believe that I saw the best Ridley Scott has ever done...certainly a must see. This may not be a "chick-friendly-flick" although you never know.Lary9</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank God for Gladiator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was beginning to think that no one would ever make another Roman epic, which would have been a shame because no other genre can match it.But this is something else.It isn't Spartacus, nor (thank god) is it Braveheart, unlike Braveheart there does remain at least some historical accuracy.Ridley Scott delivers a modern masterpiece in that it is a historical piece without a modern feel.Those first battle scenes really had my blood pumping, and it didn't feel like gratuitous violence, it challenged Saving Private Ryan for the best battle scenes I have ever seen.Thankfully with all the main characters having died at the end there will not be a crappy sequel or franchise made out of it, it stands alone, which is only right.The performances are actually faultless, I mean really faultless.Russell Crowe is totally believable and kicks ass with a vengeance (dare I say, he makes Charlton Heston look like a real pussy.)When he kicks the crap out of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix, who wisely decides not to do what Christopher Plummer did under similar circumstances and go over the top but emanates twisted villainy so that we really hate his guts)I really felt like cheering.I am so glad he didnt spend half the film moping about his wife and kids, he just gets on with what he does best, kicking ass.In support, Richard Harris looks like death warmed up as the ailing emperor Marcus Aurelius (I hope that was just make up for his sake)but exudes quiet tired dignity as a man who has had enough but cannot die lest Commodus get his slimy hands on the imperial throne.Derek Jacobi is also great as a wily old senator who knows every trick in the book(his first Roman role since he made his name in I Claudius more than 20 years ago)and there is a grotesque cameo from the obese David Hemmings as the master of ceremonies (to think he was once a sex symbol)These three, together with the late Oliver Reed were called by Scott "the four Horsemen of the apocalypse" and it is ironic that it is Reed who died during filming, who looks the best, and he really throws himself at his role as a beefy, experienced Gladiator trainer and is memorably larger than life (ironic as there is at least one of his scenes which is a CGI image of him)Even dead, Reed can act his fellow thesps off the screen.Ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about death... *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*WARNING* SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW*Some of the reviews I've read here just miss the point altogether.A short while ago I watched this film for the first time, and came away feeling reasonably entertained. I was not entirely inspired, short of a minor hankering to skim through my old history books, but I didn't think too much about the film following that. Just the other day I was asked to come along and watch it again, with a friend who is very much interested in Roman history. He agreed to pay half my ticket, so I figured what the hey...It was upon my second viewing that it became clear to me this film was a lot more than just about the story we see on the surface. The story is not about revenge, the story is not about Rome, the story is not about Commodus or Aurelius, or the Roman empire. Rather the story is about death. From the opening swells of the score, we see the idealised final moments of Maximus' life, as he brushes his hands over the wheat field, walking to join his wife and son in death. Then the story begins, showing Maximus at one of his most private moments, dreaming of this ideal moment. Ultimately, the film is to be closed by the same sequence, which then closes the circle, immersing Maximus in his own private heaven. The constant usage of the supernatural imagery in the film ensure the theme is reinforced regularly throughout the remainder of Maximus' life. Upon discovering the death of his family, he loses his will to live, but his responsibilities in life constantly thwart his will to die. Maximus has things to do (in this case to avenge his ruler and family) before he dies.I'll go out on a limb here, but : I believe many modern western audiences would find Maximus a hero. But few in the audience can quite understand why they do so, after all, he is a walking meat grinder who kills mercilessly, right? I venture they do so because he is the personification of every single member in the audience's wish : an ultimate desire to ensure they can make amends/tie up loose ends before passing into the afterlife, whatever they might (or might not) conceive it to be. Maximus does this, and quite literally drops dead the moment he fulfills his responsibilities to his self and his dead master in life.Put in this context, Ridley Scott's directorial decisions made perfect sense to me. The use of Lisa Gerrard's haunting, almost spiritual vocals in the soundtrack were spot on. Also worth noting was a device specific to this film : Used as reminder of Maximus' desire to join his loved ones in the afterlife, the shot/sequence of him sliding along the ground with eyes closed was interrupted when his business in life was incomplete, but unimpeded when he was at peace. Then there were the little things - when Maximus was to be put to the death by sword, he pleads for a soldier's death, a "clean" death. The discussions about death with his Numidian slave friend, and finally the last conversation he has with Commodus before they fight to the death, where he quotes Aurelius' about smiling back at death.Technically? The story we see on the surface employed a tremendous amount of creative license. To the people faulting the film for this creative license, I say go watch the discovery channel if you want a documentary. This film rather was using devices applied on a day to day basis by sci-fi writers, without the cries of historical inaccuracy either. It's quite obvious to even the most naive of viewers (?) that Ridley Scott was telling a fictional tale set against the backdrop of historical truth, rather like "Titanic" did to seemingly far fewer complaints. This is a pretty common device in storytelling, and to people who have problems with that, I can only say learn to tell the difference between a story and a true story.The script for this film was sufficiently well performed not to draw too much complaint, and the special effects if a bit comic book were used sparingly and only to create a sense of place quite effectively. I have heard people commenting about being disappointed or unimpressed by the fight sequences. I personally cringed, but to those who found them tame, I point them with a grin to Maximus' remarks after killing several people in the arena "What is the matter, are you not entertained? Is this not what you paid to see?". Indeed the film was also making rather pointed references to us, the viewers in that respect.A warm, if a tad brutal treatment of notions of "the perfect/clean death". 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator - a 'chick flick' that appeals to everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people use the term "chick flick" to describe any movie with emotion, implying most guys couldn't stand a movie with deeper meaning than just people blowing each other up. If that were true, Gladiator would be classified as a chick flick, but the guys I know who have seen this movie have loved it. And I love it, too.It's filled with star-making performances, especially in the three leads - Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielsen. Phoenix and especially Crowe did an exceptionally good job, I thought. Maybe this is just because, as a big fan of the "sword and sandal" films of days gone by, I wanted to see some young hotties get into togas and armor. But I think I would have enjoyed this film even without these two very attractive actors as the leads.Gladiator is over two hours long, but I never could tell. The story of Maximus (Crowe) and his quest for revenge against Commodus (Phoenix) is so engrossing I never once looked at my watch. The set and costume design, as well as special effects, are fantastic. Yes, this movie is bloody, and if you're under 14 you probably shouldn't go see it. But the focus of the story isn't the fighting. It's about the lengths humans will go to for love - to avenge their love, as in the case of Maximus, and to be loved, as in the case of Commodus. It's about love, and if that makes Gladiator a chick flick, then it's a chick flick. But it's the best gosh darned chick flick I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Riveting Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chances are you know something of this movie, and have heard the excellent reviews for it. This is largely to the fact that, as a summer epic, "Gladiator" is a very watchable and entertaining movie, delivering all the big-time action some want to see, while still maintaining a level of clean dialogue and plot to spark the interest of the more discerning viewer.Russell Crowe, as the hero Maximus, is very good. He is excellent at playing the outraged but moral good guy stuck in a position he can do nothing about (a la L.A. Confidential), and he is brawny enough to pull off the action hero look.I especially liked Joaquim Phoenix here. The part he plays, the new Caesar Commodus, is partially based on fact (unlike the entirely fictional Maximus). He's the only one here who really manages to convey the sense of decadence and depravity that pervaded the upper classes of Roman society during its decline. In my mind, Phoenix stole every scene he was in.There are a couple problems. For one, director Ridley Scott (who did Alien, amongst others) concentrates more on heads getting chopped off then what could have been a rather engaging plotline, which is reduced to the bare points necessary to drive the action. This movie also falls into the ridiculous assumption Hollywood always seems to make that the upper class of any society has a British accent; it may not be a huge deal, but it's a pet peeve, and it makes no sense. Why would there be any particular accent? The battle scenes, while exceedingly bloody, are also a bit contrived, and don't seem real at all. Scott also makes some incredibly obvious attempts at symbolism using background colors that no one will miss, and it loses some significance because it's just so obvious.All in all, this was a very good movie. It was fun to watch, and I was entertained for 2 1/2 hours. The combination of action, good acting, and semi-intriguing plot makes this a shining example of the blockbuster epic, sure to entertain just about anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am aware that if a movie makes more than $16.50 at the box office that everyone's supposed to call it corporate Hollywood crap and find fault in it, but I was VERY impressed with this film. Of course I was amazed with the effects, but I also thought it was extremely well written and acted. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix portrayed their characters extremely well, with Crowe playing the hero to perfection and Phoenix being the perfect brat with moral issues. There was a great deal of violence, but I found it to be used well in the story. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's one thing that elevates this film from standard, schlocky fare and that's Russell Crowe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GLADIATOR is not a new story or an overly deep one, but it does entertain. There's a lot more range and depth to Russell Crowe than most Americans have seen up to this point. I, for one, look forward to watching him again and again. Besides the fantastic art direction the only thing keeping your eyes on the screen is Crowe. He gives a subtle, powerful, honest portrayal in a film that wouldn't have been half as good without him. It's not an easy role to pull off and could have fallen into the realm of the ridiculous. No one has tried to make a roman costume epic since the late 60s and the debacle of CLEOPATRA. However, the actors and the filmmakers take their subject matter and characters very seriously, grounding the action in a time and a place one can only imagine. Actually, thanks to Mr. Scott and some amazing computer facts, we don't have to. Rome is alive and well, rearing it's ugly head at the cineplex.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it's a fine film, they took huge liberties with "history", in the name of a great story. In reality, although Commodus was indeed Marcus Aurealis' son, and though his father had doubts about his ability to rule, he was only truly insane after his sister &amp; a friend plotted against him, and he found out (and hung them from a tree).Commodus was supposed to appear at a huge event, dressed as a gladiator, to shock conservatives &amp; senators. This was the last in a long line of jokes that his peers considered in bad taste - so bad they poisoned him (and then strangled him, when the poison didn't work).Marcus Aurelius died of the plague, while visiting a city, to decide how to improve sanitation in the city - he was considered a true "Philosopher King".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a woman, and maybe I was in the mood for this movie, but it was not that "gorey" to me. I used to watch all of the old gladiator movies including "Ben-Hur", etc. with my dad and I was really looking forward to seeing this.During the fight scenes, the cinematography changed to an art form and it was not bloody like most other movies of this type. You would see what a soldier did and it was to the point,so the director did not play on blood scenes, and if you enjoy history at all-this really happened and it is very interesting to think that they had to fight with their wits much more to survive. The horses were beautiful.I did chuckle a few times, though, because it really was like modern day FOOTBALL. It only seems about 5 years ago whereas people really did not care whether football players broke their necks, or when to stop them from playing if the player had 2 or more concussions....The gladiators had to train in the minor divisions (baseball) and then perform for Rome spectators. The colloseum was just like a "football field" for our entertainment. George Harris was excellent. After his acting abilities and his well spoken articulate lines, the other actors did pale in their performances after his in some scenes. Sometimes, sadly, you could not hear what they said, but the special effects were above average. I was surprised at their costumes, because they were not what I have been used to or imagined from history carvings and statues.I did expect more lions than just 3 tigers, and was hoping I would see a lot of lions and Christians (because of history). I did think it would be a more realistic account of that, but that was okay ( it would have probably made the movie more inhumane). The story line was a good one.</fullReview>

It could make you wonder if they are covering up special effects flaws. Why not just show the action?Still a worthwhile movie. A bit slow in parts but you got to know the characters and see their pain, suffering, greed, lust, revenge and honor. Great performances by Crowe and Phoenix.A great adventure.

		<shortDescription>Probably the last of the great Roman epics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've trodden this route before. Anyone familiar with the Kirk Douglases and Charlton Hestons of the world will recognise what this film is about. It was interesting to note the number of elderly people in the cinema, another indication that this film was a throwback to a bygone era.Having said that, it was visually stunning, the cinematography added another dimension to this genre. The battle scenes were vivid and exciting and the scenes in the colleseum kept me enthralled. Russell Crowe was a fitting choice for the part of Maximus and generally it was well cast apart from the irritating Lucius. Oliver Reed chose the perfect vehicle for his swansong and filmic epitaph.Despite enjoying it as a thrilling spectacular and not finding it long at over two and a half hours, at the end of the film I did have a certain sense of deja-vu. Apart from technological advances there was nothing new that would differentiate this film from the the Cecil B de Mille epics. Still, I ask myself is there anything wrong with turning out a good old-fashioned movie with all the tricks that entertained previous generations.However, there was something about it that left me pondering that as we are now in the year 2000, perhaps we demand a little bit more. Maybe we've spent too many years watching too many films to be surprised, and that's my biggest gripe - there was nothing surprising or unexpected about this film.Still perhaps I'm over complaining. I felt I got my moneys worth and would certainly recommend it to anyone who was unsure as whether to go or not. There is a lot to enjoy about this movie and I suppose if it happens to be on the box on a Good Friday in a few years time, I'll probably tune in again. So it's a thumbs up from me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i cannot comment on this film without first saying how this is the first film where I have actually wanted to meet the cinematographer and congratulate him on a job that for myself, made the film. The photography in this film is breathtaking. Every flashback sequence, every battle, every exchange is made in short beautiful to watch. The camera is one minute showing us the most brutal of deaths in a battle sequence that I must say is the most realistic I have ever seen, and the next conveying the audience to the heaven-like sanctuary that is Maximus' home. I don't believe I have ever actually looked forward to the filler shots in between scenes.However beautiful the film looks, the dialogue is sometimes lacking. The actors make best use of often cliched speeches and emotional one liners (not least Crowe), but the dialogue just never seems to 'fit'. The exchanges between characters seem forced and, well, like you've heard them before. A small fault in an otherwise great film.Definitely see gladiator. Whether it's just to marvel at the first-class filming or the braveheart style sequences of utter brutality that will forever be etched on your brain, it's a classic story and a classic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although quite impressive of a movie in its acting, cinematography, story line, etc., its studio(s) did the movie a disservice by putting the best scenes of the movie onto the trailers. I don't just mean the ones you see in the theatres or on TV, but the clips on talk shows where the actors/actresses plug the movie.Sadly, this follows the tradition of Disney's Touchstone Pictures (circa late 1980's early 90's) where the crux of the movie was given away in a five-minute trailer (e.g. The Doctor, 1991). The bad news is that word of mouth precluded many others from seeing the movie once word got out. The good news is that the Disney exec's finally wised up and "trimmed" back on the trailers for future films.In many ways, it truly is a magnificent picture. I just hope that future movies of this great caliber aren't "diluted" by too much foreknowledge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! That's all I can say after watching "Gladiator". And you know what? I'm not writing this review immediately after watching the movie like I usually do. I'm writing this review after watching the movie for the SECOND time. Yep, I saw this movie on opening night and then went and saw it again two days later.Gladiator is about a Roman General who's a hero that becomes a slave, then becomes a gladiator, and finally a hero again. General Maximus (Russell Crowe) refuses to support the young Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) as he suspects foul play after it is discovered that the current Emperor and father to Commodus is found dead. Maximus becomes an outcast and eventually a slave as he is bought by Proximo, a man who engages in the sport of gladiating by supplying the slaves that will eventually be killed in these gruesome competitions. To Proximo's surprise, Maximus not only survives competition after competition but he becomes the favorite in almost every competition. But there's more to this man's success than skill alone. There's revenge.Russell Crowe is not one of the better-known actors but he's fast becoming one. I saw him in "Insider" and was blown away with his performance there but when I saw this movie I gained an even deeper respect for this man. He is one talented actor. The rest of the cast is no sack of potatoes either. This is probably one of the most talented group of actors assembled for one film.Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, Dereck Jacobi, the list goes on and it's hard to find a weak actor in the group. I was particularly impressed with Joaquin Phoenix. I thought he played the young Emperor with a wonderful mix of child-like poutiness and scheming villany that was a good counterpart to Crowe's character. Connie Nielsen's portrayal of Commodus's sister, Lucilla, was equally well done and at times made you feel a bit uncomfortable as the hint of an incestuous relationship between her and Commodus possibly existed.The good thing about this movie was that there was a good storyline to backup the strong cast. The dialogue was appropriate to the story and unlike many of the other "testosterone" filled movies, this one didn't suffer the fate of cheezy lines.Overall, a definite must see but I must warn you. There is a tremendous amount of graphic violence so if you're faint of heart this may not be the movie for you. If this sort of thing doesn't bother you, you must go see it. For your information, the real Commodus did participate in gladiating and was rumored to have amassed a record of 1000 wins so he was no slouch in the gladiating ring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, Commodus ruled 12 years after the (natural) death of father Marcus Aurelius, and not for the year (or whatever) depicted in Gladiator. And, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix ) may have been a more daunting foe for Maximus (Russell Crowe) in the ring, judging from what we know of his athletic prowess, even without the "advantage" of his having "insured" himself of victory (no spoiler). (In fact, a powerful wrestler strangled Commodus to death at the behest of Commodus' trusted advisors in 192). Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. The opening scenes of Gladiator alone are worth the price of admission. How WERE the Romans able to conquer and control almost a quarter of the world's population? Take in the first 30 minutes of this film. Then you'll know. Ridley Scott has a genius for film making (which always begins with the visual). Reminds me of Kubrick. He knows how it must have been, or could be, or should be. So, you rearrange history a bit to create a first class story. So what? The script, the performances, the mood and tempo of action can't disappoint, unless you're so oriented to plots laced with video game inspired characters and disaster scenes that only a third century vintage Freddie Visits Mission Impossible will stir your senses. Sorry Roger, two point five? (I thought I'd never say this) you are dead wrong. This is a terrific two plus hours of first class entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator movies are not high on my list. But Russell Crowe is, and for good reason. He delivers. And what does he deliver? Integrity, intimacy, and most of all, emotional truth.Sitting there in the darkened theater, uncertain as to what level of violence was soon to assault me, it wasn't until the moment that the great Richard Harris opened his arms (and heart) to embrace his son, Commodus, that I knew this was a film that I could trust.Beautifully matched with the talented Joaquin Phoenix, who more than held his own against the formidable Crowe, I found Crowe's performance as Maximus one of gravity, sensitivity, and a dignity of character not often found in films today. The relationship between Maximus and Lucilla was both balanced and believable, and as much as I would liked to see some steamy loves scenes with Crowe, the lack of one in Gladiator actually enhanced the films credibility.

		<fullReview>Gladiator movies are not high on my list. But Russell Crowe is, and for good reason. He delivers. And what does he deliver? Integrity, intimacy, and most of all, emotional truth.Sitting there in the darkened theater, uncertain as to what level of violence was soon to assault me, it wasn't until the moment that the great Richard Harris opened his arms (and heart) to embrace his son, Commodus, that I knew this was a film that I could trust.Beautifully matched with the talented Joaquin Phoenix, who more than held his own against the formidable Crowe, I found Crowe's performance as Maximus one of gravity, sensitivity, and a dignity of character not often found in films today. The relationship between Maximus and Lucilla was both balanced and believable, and as much as I would liked to see some steamy loves scenes with Crowe, the lack of one in Gladiator actually enhanced the films credibility. There was a naturalness and ease also in the relationship between Maximus and the soulful Djmon Hounsou.Ridley Scott's exciting direction was flawless (as usual) and the action sequences, while violent (it is a Gladiator film after all) were imaginative, visual, and expertly choreographed.

		<shortDescription>You will either love or hate this movie. I loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That being said, I can honestly say to forget the 'reviews' from those who didn't even sit through the whole movie. That's just whack. But it really is the sort of show that some people just won't like. If you're a history purist, the story and characters just won't add up. But mostly I don't think the negative reviewers see the depth and get annoyed with the violence. The movie does have plenty of violence. But gore? I don't know what Mary Poppins spinoffs they've been feeding on, but there's a whole buncha movies out there that have more gore. Gladiator flashes the 'chop off the arm' or the 'split the skull' scene very quickly. You know it happened but barely see it.There is much more to this movie than action or gore. All the main actors are good or better. I saw a touching scene here, a real feeling there. And hell, no movie and I mean no movie has ever before given viewers so much of ancient Rome to look at. What a great job of computer rendering!For those who haven't been watching movies for 40 years, this is the same basic story that was the basis for the 'Fall of the Roman Empire', made in the 60's. Sophia Loren was Lucilla, Stephen Boyd as Maximus, Christopher Plummer as Commodus and Obi Wan Kenobi as Marcus Aurelius. Similar but different, I prefer Gladiator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley is one of my favorite directors only because of the visuals!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well Ridley Scott is the director of 2 of my favorite movies of all time, Alien and Blade Runner. I also like Thelma and Louise.I think that Gladiator is a good film, but not a great one. I think that it doesn't beat Thelma and Louise (the film seems to be very underated because everybody said that Gladiator is Scott's best film since Blade Runner or even Alien).Ridley Scott's good sense of casting is casting is very present in Gladiator and he knows who to direct an actor.Russell Crowe is very good : I mean he is Maximus ! But I think that the best performance is give by Joaquin Pheonix (maybe it is because his character (Commodus) is the most developed in the film). Pheonix is so incredible that he steal every scenes that he appears !!! Connie Nielsen is impressive has the frightened sister of his younger brother. She is also very beautiful !The supporting actors are very good too begining with Richard Harris who gives a very credible performance. The late Oliver Reed's first lines are funny and he is also credible. Djumon Hounsou (sorry for the wrong spelling) is good too, but I think that we don't see him too often. Derek Jacobi is always very good. Spencer Treat Clark give a very good young performance as Lucius.Now technically the film is impressive. The camera works are well done and the cinematography (Ridley's force) is outstanding! Some may not apreciate the effect during the battle scenes. I think that it is a kind of violence censure. The violence is often suggested more than shown. It could have been a lot more gory ! So I think that the fast editing is a good thing, but I was disapointed the first time that I saw the movie (I've seen it twice). The score is very good. Hans Zimmer deserved to be in the Top 10 greatest and prolific Hollywood composers. The score: The Rock meets The Thin Red Line: 8.5/10 . The CGI effects disappointed me in the first viewing, but it grow on me the on the second viewing!Ridley Scott's direction is NOT at his best but the actors are very well directed and Scott's vision of Rome is well represented. The themes in Gladiator are a bit similar to the themes of Blade Runner, but here stop my comparision with that masterpiece. Surprisingly, there is a "intimate feel" in that film and that feels good to have Ridley back! (Unfortunatly his next is going to be bad ("Hannibal" staring Sir Anthony Hoptkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Ray Liota). Ok maybe not, but I have a bad feeling about it! Ridley's cinematography (with the help of cinematographer John Mathiesen) is impressive and he really shows his influences of David Lean. The shots in Morocco remind me a lot of Lawrence of Arabia !I think that the weakest point of the film is the story. It is not very weak, but it is clich and there are a lot of deja vu espacially if you had seen Braveheart two days before ! The characters are not very deep and there are some little plot holes.Well, I think that it is the Hollywood film that you must see this summer if you only want to watch one, but don't expected a masterpiece it is not. ...A kind of Titanic movie...8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With "Ben Hur" and "Braveheart" who needs "Gladiator"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I anxiously anticipated the new Ridley Scott film starring one of the most talented actors in the film arena today; Russel Crowe, only to be greatly disappointed. "Gladiator" is a compilation of "Braveheart" and "Ben -Hur", trying to capitalize on the same formula (in not even a subtle way) that worked so well for these two films. However, it is completely unsuccessful as it's main character is flat and one dimensional, it's plot full of holes and additionally, a great visual disappointment from the man who gave us "Alien" and "Blade Runner".It seems obvious that Scott could not decide whether to make this film an action or character driven piece. Trying to copy the successful formula used in "Braveheart" was a waste of time. The audience was given no real emotional attachment to the film's protagonist, Maximus, played by Russel Crowe. Therefore, we don't really care where the plot takes him, making the fight scenes less effective despite clever editing and well choreographed maneuvers. We do not see the sincerity, or passion that so easily hooked us into Mel Gibson's Character, William Wallace, in "Braveheart". Instead, we see a one dimensional character whose demeanor remains constant whether he is winning, losing, fighting, or even about to die.The plot follows that of "Braveheart" but also "Ben Hur" without the poise of Heston or the emotion that rocked a chariot race. It fails in it's attempt to be lumped into the category of a herioc epic.The most worthwhile thing in this film, by far, was the performance of Joaqin Phoenix. As the evil Roman emporer he was both dark and vulnerable. His character was despicable but also left you pitying him, understanding his actions at times, cruel as they may be. This film should excel Phoenix's career and propel him into a wider range of roles, after all he was the best thing about the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator, being a Ridley Scott film, has a wafer-thin story tarted up with a lot of arty photography and editing, and a barrelful of nifty special effects. (If Rome didn't look this way, it should have.) Again, because it is a Ridley Scott film, the wafer-thin story is a ripping yarn which trots along at a spanking pace. The movie's value as an historical document is probably dubious. Undoubtedly I will soon be backed into a corner by one of those twits who needs to inform me, in stentorian tones lest anyone in the county should miss one second of his tiresome display of erudition, just how inaccurate the film is. Historically inaccurate it may well be. It also lacks a decent cookie recipe. Since it isn't a documentary or a cookbook, neither of those two flaws is pertinent to its value as entertainment. Gladiator is a wildly entertaining two and a half hours of moviemaking, and I enjoyed I tremendously.Make no mistake--the testosterone level in this film is very high. It is a manly film, with manly swords, manly male bonding, manly armor that puts Francis X. Bushman's millinery in the 1926 Ben Hur to shame, and a whole lot of manly men doing stuff that manly men just gotta do. At times it looks like "WWF Goes to Rome." Normally this kind of thing is a howling bore, but Gladiator's hormones never reach the point where they choke off the higher cerebral functions. It's all I ask for in a summer movie.I have some quibbles. As a fan of the C.B. DeMille Sword &amp; Sandal School of Epic-Making, I keenly felt the lack of the portentous beginning narration and the mid-film orgy, complete with dancing girls in peach chiffon and much wanton consumption of grapes. I was mollified by the film's conceit that the Romans spoke with a teddibly, teddibly British accent. Even Joaquin Phoenix gives it a good shot. The stalwart hero (Antipodean though he is) speaks in a decent, upstanding American accent. This is as it should be, and I applaud the decision to follow a time-honored tradition in epic filmmaking. Some things are just sacred, dammit.Connie Nielson, who plays Lucilla, has nothing much to do except stay out of the way; she is beautiful in an unmemorable sort of way and is completely charisma-free. I'm sure she will have a busy and lucrative career working in the action genre, where she will be cast repeatedly in the secondary role of "Accessory," usually a wife who supports the hero through thick and thin despite his manifest lack of worth. No aging action star need ever be concerned about Miss Nielson upstaging him, as he would with an actress of more screen presence. Joaquin Phoenix gives a wonderful, slimy performance as the full-tilt batty Commodus, and the Merry Band of Gladiators perform their limited roles adeptly and with much attractive sweat. Djimon Hounsou does yeoman service in the important Woody Strode role. Oliver Reed gives the first--and last--understated performance of his career, and Richard Harris is. . .well. . .he's there. I'm happy to see Derek Jacobi in the cast (or indeed in any cast); no film about imperial Rome would be complete without Claudius.Should you have somehow missed the significance of the film's advertising--and what rock have you been hiding under if you have--this film is Russell Crowe's show all the way, and what a show it is! Crowe has a physical presence that is reminiscent of Brando. He's displayed his technical chops in previous films; in Gladiator he proves that he is a STAR. (The fact that he looks darned good in a cocktail-length sheath is neither here nor there. Really.) To borrow from Elinor Glyn, Russell Crowe has "It" and I think this film will easily place him in the paid gadzillions, courted-by-politicians, tabloids-in-your-face category.One caveat. Parents of young children, this film is called "Gladiator." It is not called "Fluffy Bunnies of Rome" or "Teletubbies of Antiquity." It has exactly what you would expect from a film called Gladiator: spouting blood, bouncing limbs, stabbings, impalings, beheadings, fire, war, pestilence, questionable fashion choices, and violent death both human and animal. Please, leave the kiddies at home.Obviously, Gladiator is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. If it is, don't wait to see it on the small screen; it's a wide screen experience. The effects will be chopped up and cheesy-looking on television, and this will force you to pay close attention to the story. You'll want to avoid that. Rush right down to your local theater, and catch this puppy on the big screen. It's a "with butter" kind of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Russell Crowe... swords.... emperors... Roman epics... *sigh* what a raging pit of testosterone fuelled action! I loved it! I am so proud of Russell Crowe... Australians are definitely making their mark on Hollywood, that's for sure. But as for the movie, I enjoyed it thoroughly. There really is nothing like a good, emotionally charged tale of heroes and revenge. Joaquin Phoenix was devilishly good as Commodus and as I have already mentioned, Russell will always be a hero! I did find my mind drifting from Gladiator to Braveheart from time to time... the people's hero, hard done by by a king or emperor, wife killed, tormented by guilt and sorrow, seemingly beaten. Until they conquer and emerge a celebrated hero even though their whole fight to glory was based on little more than revenge in both films. And there was something strangely similar about the catch phrase 'Strength and Honour' (Freedom!?) But still, Gladiator was highly enjoyable, a film definitely worth three hours of my time. Go Maximus!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pictorial excellence - cultural regression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so "Spartacus" is 40 years ago and lacked CGI sophistication. At least it was about a basic human theme. It's a shame the superlative acting talents of the entire "Gladiator" cast were used to serve a story of a Roman general seeking revenge against a corrupt emperor. For what? To see who gets to run the massive slave state of Rome for another few years? Whether Rome was Republic or Empire was a moot point to the 50 plus per cent of the population who were enslaved. "Spartacus" on the other hand is based on a real incident involving a real issue: freedom vs. slavery. "Gladiator" is bogus history. It is a fascist work. Ridley Scott's brilliant evocation of Riefenstahl when Joaquin Phoenix enters Rome is no accident. But didn't he realize that the whole plot as well was just an totalitarian wetdream? The movie never challenges the basic assumptions of Roman rule. For all his failings, Kirk Douglas, did that - and profoundly so. I think it's nice that Russel Crowe wanted vengeance for losing his wife, son and luxurious villa. Spartacus just wanted to die a free man.And an observation about Ridley Scott's pictorial genius. His set design reminds me of pre-Raphaelite painting knock offs, something one might find on the dust jacket of a "historical" novel. Kubrick's Rome and Roman countryside had the spare lean authenticity of archealogical reality. Scott's silvered, coppered and bronze frames, crammed with "stuff" looked just that - crammed.And an observation about Scott's action: Does anyone notice that the swordplay and much of the fighting occurs in a blur or blizzard of camera-swishing? Very "Batman and Robin." When Russell Crowe is about to be executed, his escape and table- turning is so swish-panned as to be unseeable. This happens again and again. The defeat of the charioteers in the arena: the coverage is askance and oblique. It lacks the simple integrity and graceful genius of a Jackie Chan move or something Bruce Willis might do or... dare I say, the way Kirk Douglas might handle it. I liked "Alien," I liked "Thelma and Louise." I'm beginning to worry now about the upcoming "Hannibal."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exciting hack and slash movie, but little else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billed as an epic (and certainly long enough to be one), Ridley Scott's "Gladiator" had me anxiously waiting for its release for almost 3 months. Imagine -- Spartacus meets the modern movie techno-wizardry! The potential was enormous.The opening scene, with its hundreds, if not thousands, of soldiers, overwhelmed me by its sheer magnitude. Scott captures the fear, bloodiness, and brutality of war while at the same time, embuing Gen. Maximus (Russell Crowe) with an amazing gift for leadership. The repulsive beauty of violence has rarely been captured as well on film.Though the action scenes were amazing, the plot left me wanting more. The superb acting by Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodius was skillfully complemented by Connie Nelson's Lucilla, conveying to us their tension-filled relationship. However, the basic premise of paternal neglect begetting cruelty never truly sells. Kudos to Phoenix for valiantly trying to rescue this crucial plot weakness with his acting skill.Crowe remains, throughout the movie, nobly removed from the rest of humanity. This is both his strength and weakness, as his relationship with Lucilla was unconvincing. Though both actors were great individually, their on-screen chemistry never truly smoldered. Not enough attention was paid to their history and I left the movie wanting more."Gladiator" begins on a strong note but fails to capitalize. If you're looking for a great modern epic, stick to "Braveheart" or "Saving Private Ryan." Excellent action and CGI can only compensate so far for weak plot development.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. It ranks up there with Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan, and other classics. Ridley Scott has taken a forgotten era and breathed new life into it. There hasn't been a film of this greatness of the Roman Empire since Ben Hur. I have seen many movies in my lifetime, and this is one I would go back to see again.The story line was great. The battle scenes were second only to (once again) Braveheart, and Russell Crowe was perfect for Maximus. I truly enjoyed this movie and would recommend this to movie goers of all ages (with the exception of young and timid audiences). This film had no swear words and very little sexual innuendo. It is truly a great work and Ridley Scott, Russell Crowe and all other contributors to this film should walk home with full hands on Oscar night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator was not like I thought it would be. It starts out as the fearless General of Rome brings his army to victory again and again, without as much a flesh wound made to him, despite his poor armoury. Then, the great, mighty, old, and dying Caeser favours the General over his own son. He says to him, "You are the son I should have had." So Caeser wants him to be the new Caeser within days. The General (named Maximus. Figures, why didn't they call him Mighty One already?) says he will need some time to think about it. After all, its' a hard decision to be given ultimate power over the greatest empire of the world, and have unlimited riches, over going back to his little farm in the middle of nowhere. Big mistake, the Caeser tells his son that he doesn't love him anymore, and that he never did, he would rather have Maximus on the throne than him. The son decides that he should die (duh). He also decides, after being proclaimed Caeser, that Maximus and his family should die. Of course, nothing can kill Maximus, and he escapes and rides across the world to attempt to save him family, only to find them hung on crosses.He is later found with a rotting shoulder (amazingly enough, he is wounded) by a mob of slaves. He is taken to a slave camp, and sold. His master wants to use him as a Gladiator. Throughout the rest of the movie, Maximus wins the crowd over the Caeser, defeats the undefeated, reveals himself to Caeser, tries to get his army (fails), fights Caeser in the Colleseum (challenged by Caeser himself, what an idiot.Despite my negative attitude, it was a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator, being a Ridley Scott film, has a wafer-thin story tarted up with a lot of arty photography and editing, and a barrelful of nifty special effects. (If Rome didn't look this way, it should have.) Again, because it is a Ridley Scott film, the wafer-thin story is a ripping yarn which trots along at a spanking pace. The movie's value as an historical document is probably dubious. Undoubtedly I will soon be backed into a corner by one of those twits who needs to inform me, in stentorian tones lest anyone in the county should miss one second of his tiresome display of erudition, just how inaccurate the film is. Historically inaccurate it may well be. It also lacks a decent cookie recipe. Since it isn't a documentary or a cookbook, neither of those two flaws is pertinent to its value as entertainment. Gladiator is a wildly entertaining two and a half hours of moviemaking, and I enjoyed I tremendously.Make no mistake--the testosterone level in this film is very high. It is a manly film, with manly swords, manly male bonding, manly armor that puts Francis X. Bushman's millinery in the 1926 Ben Hur to shame, and a whole lot of manly men doing stuff that manly men just gotta do. At times it looks like "WWF Goes to Rome." Normally this kind of thing is a howling bore, but Gladiator's hormones never reach the point where they choke off the higher cerebral functions. It's all I ask for in a summer movie.I have some quibbles. As a fan of the C.B. DeMille Sword &amp; Sandal School of Epic-Making, I keenly felt the lack of the portentous beginning narration and the mid-film orgy, complete with dancing girls in peach chiffon and much wanton consumption of grapes. I was mollified by the film's conceit that the Romans spoke with a teddibly, teddibly British accent. Even Joaquin Phoenix gives it a good shot. The stalwart hero (Antipodean though he is) speaks in a decent, upstanding American accent. This is as it should be, and I applaud the decision to follow a time-honored tradition in epic filmmaking. Some things are just sacred, dammit.Connie Nielson, who plays Lucilla, has nothing much to do except stay out of the way; she is beautiful in an unmemorable sort of way and is completely charisma-free. I'm sure she will have a busy and lucrative career working in the action genre, where she will be cast repeatedly in the secondary role of "Accessory," usually a wife who supports the hero through thick and thin despite his manifest lack of worth. No aging action star need ever be concerned about Miss Nielson upstaging him, as he would with an actress of more screen presence. Joaquin Phoenix gives a wonderful, slimy performance as the full-tilt batty Commodus, and the Merry Band of Gladiators perform their limited roles adeptly and with much attractive sweat. Djimon Hounsou does yeoman service in the important Woody Strode role. Oliver Reed gives the first--and last--understated performance of his career, and Richard Harris is. . .well. . .he's there. I'm happy to see Derek Jacobi in the cast (or indeed in any cast); no film about imperial Rome would be complete without Claudius.Should you have somehow missed the significance of the film's advertising--and what rock have you been hiding under if you have--this film is Russell Crowe's show all the way, and what a show it is! Crowe has a physical presence that is reminiscent of Brando. He's displayed his technical chops in previous films; in Gladiator he proves that he is a STAR. (The fact that he looks darned good in a cocktail-length sheath is neither here nor there. Really.) To borrow from Elinor Glyn, Russell Crowe has "It" and I think this film will easily place him in the paid gadzillions, courted-by-politicians, tabloids-in-your-face category.One caveat. Parents of young children, this film is called "Gladiator." It is not called "Fluffy Bunnies of Rome" or "Teletubbies of Antiquity." It has exactly what you would expect from a film called Gladiator: spouting blood, bouncing limbs, stabbings, impalings, beheadings, fire, war, pestilence, questionable fashion choices, and violent death both human and animal. Please, leave the kiddies at home.Obviously, Gladiator is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. If it is, don't wait to see it on the small screen; it's a wide screen experience. The effects will be chopped up and cheesy-looking on television, and this will force you to pay close attention to the story. You'll want to avoid that. Rush right down to your local theater, and catch this puppy on the big screen. It's a "with butter" kind of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so "Spartacus" is 40 years ago and lacked CGI sophistication. At least it was about a basic human theme. It's a shame the superlative acting talents of the entire "Gladiator" cast were used to serve a story of a Roman general seeking revenge against a corrupt emperor. For what? To see who gets to run the massive slave state of Rome for another few years? Whether Rome was Republic or Empire was a moot point to the 50 plus per cent of the population who were enslaved. "Spartacus" on the other hand is based on a real incident involving a real issue: freedom vs. slavery. "Gladiator" is bogus history. It is a fascist work. Ridley Scott's brilliant evocation of Riefenstahl when Joaquin Phoenix enters Rome is no accident. But didn't he realize that the whole plot as well was just an totalitarian wetdream? The movie never challenges the basic assumptions of Roman rule. For all his failings, Kirk Douglas, did that - and profoundly so. I think it's nice that Russel Crowe wanted vengeance for losing his wife, son and luxurious villa. Spartacus just wanted to die a free man.And an observation about Ridley Scott's pictorial genius. His set design reminds me of pre-Raphaelite painting knock offs, something one might find on the dust jacket of a "historical" novel. Kubrick's Rome and Roman countryside had the spare lean authenticity of archealogical reality. Scott's silvered, coppered and bronze frames, crammed with "stuff" looked just that - crammed.And an observation about Scott's action: Does anyone notice that the swordplay and much of the fighting occurs in a blur or blizzard of camera-swishing? Very "Batman and Robin." When Russell Crowe is about to be executed, his escape and table- turning is so swish-panned as to be unseeable. This happens again and again. The defeat of the charioteers in the arena: the coverage is askance and oblique. It lacks the simple integrity and graceful genius of a Jackie Chan move or something Bruce Willis might do or... dare I say, the way Kirk Douglas might handle it. I liked "Alien," I liked "Thelma and Louise." I'm beginning to worry now about the upcoming "Hannibal."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review may contain spoilers, but not many, they are not plot threatening, because there is not much of a plot.Gladiator... the posters were most exciting, and the hype was very convincing, but unfortunately for us, the film didn't quite live up to expectations.The plot was slow and drawn out, and the spectacular views we saw in the trailer were either very short, or didn't happen at all! The acting was very good, apart from the old Caeser when he died, you could still see him breathing which I thought was a bit amateurish. It spoiled the effect for me.The main thing that was lacking was the empathy for the characters. Maximus obviously had a bit of a bad time, but you didn't get the sense of his pain that a good movie will provide. Well written characters either endear themselves to the audience or make the audience hate their guts. The audience have some emotional response to the heroes or villans, but this film didn't do that.I didn't hate the new Emperor, just as I didn't care when certain events happened to Maximus in the middle and end of the film.The fight scenes were the only redeeming feature of the movie, but they could not save this stunningly mediocre offering.I am disappointed because I thought this would be great, but cut an hour and maybe it would be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was terrible. Remember those toy books they used to sell, where they had a bunch of heads, and a bunch of bodies, and a bunch of legs, all on pages divided into threes, and you'd match the stock parts up and get these fanciful creatures? Apparently so did the plot writers on this thing. Lets see, a noble hero wins a war against odds but someone wants to get him. ooohh... flip flip flip, and then they kill his family... I wonder what will happen next? flip flip flip Oh, and now he's a gladiator, I wonder if he'll get killed? Oh, a gladiator who overcomes all odds and becomes a hero, complete with the plucky african friend who knows bush medicine and the burly german gladiator. That one's never been done before. This movie was completely formulaic. It was nothing more than flimsy glue to serve as a vehicle for Ridley Scott to show off his shiny toybox full of digital effects.To the effects' credit, the panoramic shots of rome were very cool, but Ridley went a bit overboard. Come on, Ridley, you couldn't afford a real tiger? The CGI tiger when it lashes out at the main character was the fakest movie creature I've seen since King Kong. The only way he could have made it any less convincing would have been to dress up two elementary school kids in a costume made of paper bags and orange and black construction paper. And the camera work for the battle scenes, which tried to depict the confusion of battle, only ended up being visually disturbing because there was no fluidity. Like another poster said, you were really not sure what you'd seen.I won't even touch the glaring historical inaccuracies. For all of the detail they researched to put together the pretty scenes, you'd think they could have not completely fabricated major events in the history of Rome. Am I the only guy who remembers world history from High School who wasn't disturbed by that? With the three or so plot writers they had on this thing they couldn't have found one who would have come up with an ending that didn't completely and blatantly contradict historical fact? The historical fabrication is probably about the only original thing about the plot.Not taking the plot into account, I'd give this a 5/10. The panorama scenes and some of the circus stuff is worth the prices of admission alone. But rating this as an actual movie, plot included, I'd have to give it a 3/10. If Braveheart and Spartacus were life partners and spent their box office earnings to create a robotic love child, it would be this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait for video. (Spoiler alert)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want an enthralling, tear-jerking epic about revenge, love and heroism, don't consider "Gladiator". Although the film had its riveting points, which included the battle scenes, there were the same number of negative points.Let's start with accuracy. I'm sure you may not be as much of a historical nut as I am, but there were a number of anchorisms in this film. For example:1. The real-life Commodus (portrayed by Phoenix) always wore a lion's skin, beard/mustache, was obsessed with Hercules and it was never certain whether he was responsible for murdering Marcus Aurelius or Lucius Verus. Although he was a suspicious factor with their demise.2. Commodus was very paranoid, and banished his wife Lucilla to an Island (presently Malta) where she was later hunted down and killed. In the film, she appears from the begining to end. Odd?3. On the throne, the letters IMP CAES AVF appear. In reality, it would be IMP CAES AVG, which meant Imperator Caesar Augustus. (Just a Roman Royalty "rank" if you don't know what I'm talking about.)There are plenty more to name, but that would be irrelevant, because this film was meant for the Hollywood moviegoing public, not a nitpicking perfectionist like me.The acting was quite poor. It doesn't take any brains to figure that out, or the fact that Roman's spoke Roman (Vintage Latin) and not English. Despite Richard Harris' brief role he didn't put forth his best effort, or show emotion in his character. Russell Crowe struggled with wooden acting, at first, but after a while his character picked up.This movie wasn't boring. I can assure you of that. But it did have its problems, and some may discrimate like I did. Whatever view point you expect, wait for the video rental release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator an instant classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie last Friday and was absolutely blown away, walking out of the theater saying it is now one of my favorite movies. Not for the intense action from start to finish. Not for the intriguing storyline which accurately depicts roman life (as far as I know). Not for the special effects, video and audio which are breathtaking to say the least, leaving holding the arms of your chair for dear life almost screaming to you friend beside you THAT WAS INCREDIBLE, MORE, MORE!!! Not for the touching "can't be" love story which leaves a know in your heart. Not the incredible acting on the part of Rusell Crowe or his charming easily understood accent. Not for the bad guys who you just want to strangle to save the good guys the trouble. Not for the incredible soundtrack, a sort of Conan style big orchestra power music. Not for the originality of the movie itself, a sort of mix between BenHur and Braveheart. Not for the directing with huge scenes leaving you to wonder how they filmed it all. Not for the general casting, the production team, the little odds and ends that come together to add the finishing touches. BUT FOR A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THESE IN JUST THE RIGHT PROPORTIONS. It's so rare to see movies that don't have a little too much of something, be it melodramatic acting, abnormally large special effects or too harsh music, etc. This movie has just enough of everything. One of the first movies of the twenty-first century... it's an instant classic, even epic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Up until now I thought that I had seen the best film I was going to see for along time, in The Matrix. I went into Gladiator with high expectations, and they were blown away. WOW! This film started, with an epic battle, and from that point on I was enthralled. I sat there for near enough two and three quarter hours, just absolutely blown away.Normally these films start off with a huge battling fight seen, lose themselves in the middle for about an hour and a half, then you get another fight seen, to polish off the movie. This started with the traditional seen, but from then, the story kicked in, and the whole picture took off. Every scene of violence was necessary and well demonstrated. The acting and direction was amazing, in particularly, Russell Crowe, and Joaquin Phoenix. They played off each other very well.The special effects were amazing, I from what I have read they managed to generate the crowd of multi-thousands by just using 40 actors????I can't say enough good things about this movie, in fact I can't even think of one thing I didn't enjoy, everyone should check this movie out, although it gets gory at some points, but it needs to. An epic adventure of good versus bad, which never has a dull moment, not for a second.I won't spoil the story be explaining what happens, but anyone who goes to see this film will have spent a wise ?5. All I want now is the DVD!</fullReview>

As the credits were rolling, I saw a man several rows in front of me get up and leave with a boy no older than 10. That made my skin crawl.

		<fullReview>If you want an enthralling, tear-jerking epic about revenge, love and heroism, don't consider "Gladiator". Although the film had its riveting points, which included the battle scenes, there were the same number of negative points.Let's start with accuracy. I'm sure you may not be as much of a historical nut as I am, but there were a number of anchorisms in this film. For example:1. The real-life Commodus (portrayed by Phoenix) always wore a lion's skin, beard/mustache, was obsessed with Hercules and it was never certain whether he was responsible for murdering Marcus Aurelius or Lucius Verus. Although he was a suspicious factor with their demise.2. Commodus was very paranoid, and banished his wife Lucilla to an Island (presently Malta) where she was later hunted down and killed. In the film, she appears from the begining to end. Odd?3. On the throne, the letters IMP CAES AVF appear. In reality, it would be IMP CAES AVG, which meant Imperator Caesar Augustus. (Just a Roman Royalty "rank" if you don't know what I'm talking about.)There are plenty more to name, but that would be irrelevant, because this film was meant for the Hollywood moviegoing public, not a nitpicking perfectionist like me.The acting was quite poor. It doesn't take any brains to figure that out, or the fact that Roman's spoke Roman (Vintage Latin) and not English. Despite Richard Harris' brief role he didn't put forth his best effort, or show emotion in his character. Russell Crowe struggled with wooden acting, at first, but after a while his character picked up.This movie wasn't boring. I can assure you of that. But it did have its problems, and some may discrimate like I did. Whatever view point you expect, wait for the video rental release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator an instant classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie last Friday and was absolutely blown away, walking out of the theater saying it is now one of my favorite movies. Not for the intense action from start to finish. Not for the intriguing storyline which accurately depicts roman life (as far as I know). Not for the special effects, video and audio which are breathtaking to say the least, leaving holding the arms of your chair for dear life almost screaming to you friend beside you THAT WAS INCREDIBLE, MORE, MORE!!! Not for the touching "can't be" love story which leaves a know in your heart. Not the incredible acting on the part of Rusell Crowe or his charming easily understood accent. Not for the bad guys who you just want to strangle to save the good guys the trouble. Not for the incredible soundtrack, a sort of Conan style big orchestra power music. Not for the originality of the movie itself, a sort of mix between BenHur and Braveheart. Not for the directing with huge scenes leaving you to wonder how they filmed it all. Not for the general casting, the production team, the little odds and ends that come together to add the finishing touches. BUT FOR A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THESE IN JUST THE RIGHT PROPORTIONS. It's so rare to see movies that don't have a little too much of something, be it melodramatic acting, abnormally large special effects or too harsh music, etc. This movie has just enough of everything. One of the first movies of the twenty-first century... it's an instant classic, even epic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Up until now I thought that I had seen the best film I was going to see for along time, in The Matrix. I went into Gladiator with high expectations, and they were blown away. WOW! This film started, with an epic battle, and from that point on I was enthralled. I sat there for near enough two and three quarter hours, just absolutely blown away.Normally these films start off with a huge battling fight seen, lose themselves in the middle for about an hour and a half, then you get another fight seen, to polish off the movie. This started with the traditional seen, but from then, the story kicked in, and the whole picture took off. Every scene of violence was necessary and well demonstrated. The acting and direction was amazing, in particularly, Russell Crowe, and Joaquin Phoenix. They played off each other very well.The special effects were amazing, I from what I have read they managed to generate the crowd of multi-thousands by just using 40 actors????I can't say enough good things about this movie, in fact I can't even think of one thing I didn't enjoy, everyone should check this movie out, although it gets gory at some points, but it needs to. An epic adventure of good versus bad, which never has a dull moment, not for a second.I won't spoil the story be explaining what happens, but anyone who goes to see this film will have spent a wise ?5. All I want now is the DVD!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard someone say that this is a "guy-movie" - I beg to differ. While it is definitely gritty, the emotional value of this movie is what I found most impressive. Russell Crowe's portrayel was completely convincing and moving. It never occured to me to take tissues to this movie, but I wish I had.On a separate note, as dark, bloody and gripping as this movie was, the most disturbing thing I saw was at the end. As the credits were rolling, I saw a man several rows in front of me get up and leave with a boy no older than 10. That made my skin crawl. Please take the "R" rating seriously; this is no show for children.</fullReview>

The characters were great. The degradation of the Roman empire at this point was quite well portrayed -- Commodus was nuts and the gladiator games were dehumanizing. Despite all this Maximus was quite an inspiration and powerful character. It was a long movie but kept me entertained the whole time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was terrible. Remember those toy books they used to sell, where they had a bunch of heads, and a bunch of bodies, and a bunch of legs, all on pages divided into threes, and you'd match the stock parts up and get these fanciful creatures? Apparently so did the plot writers on this thing. Lets see, a noble hero wins a war against odds but someone wants to get him. ooohh... flip flip flip, and then they kill his family... I wonder what will happen next? flip flip flip Oh, and now he's a gladiator, I wonder if he'll get killed? Oh, a gladiator who overcomes all odds and becomes a hero, complete with the plucky african friend who knows bush medicine and the burly german gladiator. That one's never been done before. This movie was completely formulaic. It was nothing more than flimsy glue to serve as a vehicle for Ridley Scott to show off his shiny toybox full of digital effects.To the effects' credit, the panoramic shots of rome were very cool, but Ridley went a bit overboard. Come on, Ridley, you couldn't afford a real tiger? The CGI tiger when it lashes out at the main character was the fakest movie creature I've seen since King Kong. The only way he could have made it any less convincing would have been to dress up two elementary school kids in a costume made of paper bags and orange and black construction paper. And the camera work for the battle scenes, which tried to depict the confusion of battle, only ended up being visually disturbing because there was no fluidity. Like another poster said, you were really not sure what you'd seen.I won't even touch the glaring historical inaccuracies. For all of the detail they researched to put together the pretty scenes, you'd think they could have not completely fabricated major events in the history of Rome. Am I the only guy who remembers world history from High School who wasn't disturbed by that? With the three or so plot writers they had on this thing they couldn't have found one who would have come up with an ending that didn't completely and blatantly contradict historical fact? The historical fabrication is probably about the only original thing about the plot.Not taking the plot into account, I'd give this a 5/10. The panorama scenes and some of the circus stuff is worth the prices of admission alone. But rating this as an actual movie, plot included, I'd have to give it a 3/10. If Braveheart and Spartacus were life partners and spent their box office earnings to create a robotic love child, it would be this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a must see. I went into the film after hearing negative reviews, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. I went in knowing that it was a fictional account of history, and so I watched it as if it were a fiction story completely separate from any truth. With this in mind, the story was immensely entertaining. Not since Braveheart was I moved to tears by the sense of honor, valor, and sacrifice that surrounds this film.The music was excellent as well. Lisa Gerard and Hans Zimmer are an excellent combination. I'm going to buy the soundtrack as soon as I can.Now mind you, this is not a 'deep' movie, and won't win any awards for best picture, actor, etc. However, if you are looking for a pick-me-up (especially in today's climate of deciet and corruption), this is the movie for you. If you enjoy films about the power of individual freedom, personal responsibility, and the strength of will to achieve it, then you will LOVE Gladiator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today is the 5th of May. Cinco de Mayo celebrations are in full force here in Phoenix. Cinco de Mayo is the Mexican equivalent of St. Patrick's Day with the exception that these celebrations include firing guns in the air all night So we reacted to these events in the usual way. We went to the movies!!Gladiator (Ridley Scott) Starring Russell Crowe and featuring a bevy of faces we know and love. Written by David H. Franzoni and John Logan, with perhaps half a dozen or so screenplays between them. The ones that stand out either for being memorable or awful are Bats, Amistad and RKO 281.It's generally known that Ridley Scott doesn't take his filmmaking lightly. Let me go a bit further and say that Ridley Scott disembowels you with the intensity of his craft. Oh God! I just looked at my hands and I've bitten my nails down to the quick. I hate it when I do that. This film grabs you from the very first scene, as we are witness to a spectacle of a battle that turned a little too Blair Witch-y for my taste. Jim can attest to my aversion to camerawork of this type. Just give me a bucket. Other than the occasional blotchy camera-footwork, this is a fascinating look at an event which occurred during the Roman Empire. Although not historically accurate and, from what I gather, deliberately inaccurate, we are swept away in the stunning cinematography, the lavish sets, the extensive use of CGI that melds almost seamlessly with the real (except for the tigers, I heard that they were real and really hungry too!) and the dramatic intensity of the story. We are introduced to Maximus (Russell Crowe), a general and confidante of a Roman emperor (played by a near-dead Richard Harris), who's life is completely turned around in a web of jealousy and treachery (beautifully done by Joaquin Phoenix). We watch as he tries to regain his life and exact revenge on those who caused him to go from a respected general to a slave to a gladiator in the Arena games. The fight scenes are spectacular and gory - definitely not for the squeamish. I know that more than a few will love the Amazon Women archers in the Coliseum games (right, Jim? ). The drama as seen through Russell Crowe's eyes is touching and has given me a better respect for this actor. Kudos to Derek Jacobi and the now very dead Oliver Reed. The latter playing his last role magnificently (I almost didn't recognize him). I have heard this film likened to Braveheart, Spartacus and Ben Hur. And definitely not to be viewed on mere videotape. This must be seen on a big screen. No two ways about it. Although if I really wanted to be in the middle of a war, I could probably just go outside the theatre to the nearest Macayo's Mexican Grill's Cinco de Mayo celebrations, but I think I prefer the splendour of Ridley Scott's newest foray in history-fiction. Don't miss it.Chris Fata North American Ambassador Trash City Magazine</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An idea done before but done exceptionally well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Die Hard started a trend so did Braveheart. It is often hard to capitalize on one predecessor but Gladiator/Maximus does. It almost left the same impact on me as did Braveheart. I dont think anyone will say its better, only because its not Oscar worthy, but if there was an Oscar for action sequences then this would kick ass. In most epic action movies the action gets lots and the sequences are boring and dragged on(13th Warrior). NOT this film. Well done. Any movie which makes you want to cheer for the hero has done its job. Ridley Scott is the king of beautifully shot films in epic proportions. On some of his films he had a hard time showing the emotion and intensity within his epics, all you have is cinematography. The emotion and intensity is created by Russell Crowe and Phoenix. One you hated the other you cheered. I doubt if there will be a better action film this year but lets hope, its still early. Im counting on MI2 next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a nutshell Gladiator is a cinematic masterpiece. The cinematography was stunning along with the cast. It marks a long awaited return to form for Ridley Scott after his last "epic" 1492 ended in disaster. This films also marks Russell Crowe as the new action star of the millennium. Joaquin Phoenix in an understated role as Commodus deserves credit. The amount of effort that went into the detail of the era was incredible as well as the choreography of the fight sequences.What Scott set out to achieve proved what a great director he really is.This film will surely be the Best Motion Picture of the year at next years Oscars, with Crowe and Scott picking up their respective crowns.

		<fullReview>The only problem with this movie is - the length! Epic it may be but Ben Hur it is not, therefore I think Mr. Scott would have been wise to "lop off" maybe 15-20 minutes, probably in the "death dream" sequences and certainly the longer moments between Lucila and dear brother. Overall, the film is magnificent and what a tribute to Olly Reed - wherever you are you should be as drunk as a skunk over this one. Russel Crowe must now be seen as the quiet man with the hard face and soft heart - surely Hollywood will now give him the roles that he so justly deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, the movie was not horrible. In fact, the movie itself was excellent. The music was mood-setting, the scenery exceptional, the graphics realistic, the storyline interesting and the cast outstanding. Russell Crowe plays a general captured and sold as a gladiator after almost being killed by the late emperors selfish son. What was so horrible was the fact that killing for sport (The occupation of gladiators) was an all too real thing in ancient Rome. The graphic battle scenes in the coliseum depict the horror of what actually happened. This film is definitely one to be viewed in theater for full appreciation of sight and sound. Though not recommended for those with weak stomachs, this 2 1/2 hr movie will keep you into it from beginning to end.</fullReview>

Why? Because Phoenix really gives the more complex, layered, performance. Don't get me wrong, Crowe is good, very good as Genereal Maximus. It's just that I think Phoenix has the more demanding role, and he carries it off beautifully. All the rest of acting is good, especially Connie Lielson as Commodus' sister. And the effects? Totally seamless, very impressive. There's a shot "flying" over the coliseum that's exciting. Scenes where the gladiators enter the arena to the roar of the crowd (great sound work as well) and the camera pans around the tiers filled with people are spectacular. The whole film is packed with detail from the crowds to the costumes. In addition, director Ridley Scott makes good use of altered color balance in battle sequences and process effects to create Maximus' dreams of his wife and son and his desires to meet them.Having just finished reading Steven Pressfield's novel "Gates of Fire" (about the Spartans fighting the Persians in 2000 BC) I think it'd be great to see Scott direct, and Crowe star, maybe as Dienekes (he's too old for the character that tells the story).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today is the 5th of May. Cinco de Mayo celebrations are in full force here in Phoenix. Cinco de Mayo is the Mexican equivalent of St. Patrick's Day with the exception that these celebrations include firing guns in the air all night So we reacted to these events in the usual way. We went to the movies!!Gladiator (Ridley Scott) Starring Russell Crowe and featuring a bevy of faces we know and love. Written by David H. Franzoni and John Logan, with perhaps half a dozen or so screenplays between them. The ones that stand out either for being memorable or awful are Bats, Amistad and RKO 281.It's generally known that Ridley Scott doesn't take his filmmaking lightly. Let me go a bit further and say that Ridley Scott disembowels you with the intensity of his craft. Oh God! I just looked at my hands and I've bitten my nails down to the quick. I hate it when I do that. This film grabs you from the very first scene, as we are witness to a spectacle of a battle that turned a little too Blair Witch-y for my taste. Jim can attest to my aversion to camerawork of this type. Just give me a bucket. Other than the occasional blotchy camera-footwork, this is a fascinating look at an event which occurred during the Roman Empire. Although not historically accurate and, from what I gather, deliberately inaccurate, we are swept away in the stunning cinematography, the lavish sets, the extensive use of CGI that melds almost seamlessly with the real (except for the tigers, I heard that they were real and really hungry too!) and the dramatic intensity of the story. We are introduced to Maximus (Russell Crowe), a general and confidante of a Roman emperor (played by a near-dead Richard Harris), who's life is completely turned around in a web of jealousy and treachery (beautifully done by Joaquin Phoenix). We watch as he tries to regain his life and exact revenge on those who caused him to go from a respected general to a slave to a gladiator in the Arena games. The fight scenes are spectacular and gory - definitely not for the squeamish. I know that more than a few will love the Amazon Women archers in the Coliseum games (right, Jim? ). The drama as seen through Russell Crowe's eyes is touching and has given me a better respect for this actor. Kudos to Derek Jacobi and the now very dead Oliver Reed. The latter playing his last role magnificently (I almost didn't recognize him). I have heard this film likened to Braveheart, Spartacus and Ben Hur. And definitely not to be viewed on mere videotape. This must be seen on a big screen. No two ways about it. Although if I really wanted to be in the middle of a war, I could probably just go outside the theatre to the nearest Macayo's Mexican Grill's Cinco de Mayo celebrations, but I think I prefer the splendour of Ridley Scott's newest foray in history-fiction.

		<fullReview>As Die Hard started a trend so did Braveheart. It is often hard to capitalize on one predecessor but Gladiator/Maximus does. It almost left the same impact on me as did Braveheart. I dont think anyone will say its better, only because its not Oscar worthy, but if there was an Oscar for action sequences then this would kick ass. In most epic action movies the action gets lots and the sequences are boring and dragged on(13th Warrior). NOT this film. Well done. Any movie which makes you want to cheer for the hero has done its job. Ridley Scott is the king of beautifully shot films in epic proportions. On some of his films he had a hard time showing the emotion and intensity within his epics, all you have is cinematography. The emotion and intensity is created by Russell Crowe and Phoenix. One you hated the other you cheered. I doubt if there will be a better action film this year but lets hope, its still early. Im counting on MI2 next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When going to a Ridley Scott movie, I always feel a sense of security that I will be delighted with the cinematography, if nothing else. This foray into computer enhanced filming is horrible. Cleopatra, 30 years ago, was far more realistic since it was...well...real. Certainly, computers reduce the cost to produce a movie of this scope, but one is always aware that one is looking at a computer image. In old movies, where sets were built, there was no way to be sure that the movie wasn't filmed at an old ruin. The scenery was made of physical materials, not virtual images. Every time I saw those little pixels in the Coliseum flickering I was totally distracted. The whole movie, from a technical standpoint, is a case of "The Emperor's New Clothes."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this the day it came out over here. Had been waiting for it for a seriously long time. Lived up to my expectations.Loads of typical epic elements are present in this film. Death, glory, love, lust, blood and adventure. The overall plot isn't too different from Spartacus, but should be treated as a completely different film. I mean to say that there can't be just one film on Roman gladiators. There's no point in making a benchmark of a film. It just limits the possibilities.The actors were brilliant, and most of all Crowe, who just slips into every role he gets with the greatest amount of ease. We've now discovered a new generation of good actors, and definitely in the form of Crowe. Harris' short-lived role was well played, and the late Oliver Reed puts in a marvellous performance as Proximo (an honourary post-humous award of some description wouldn't go amiss!). Phoenix was relly menacing in his place, and made me hate his character's guts!The camerawork in some places was reminiscent of that of Janusz Kaminski in Saving Private Ryan. It's a good technique that gives the audience the feeling of chaos and atmosphere. Ridley Scott uses his usual flair to produce some excellent visuals, like the Collisseum (even though over half of it was CGI).Last but not least, Hans Zimmer's score was perfectly suited to the task of capturing action and intimate moments in the film. During the battle scenes the music often sounds like Gustav Holst's 'Mars, Bringer of War' from his Planets suite. Very good idea. Well suited to the scenes of combat and war.Overall, Gladiator is an amazing spectacle. And I'd like to finish by saying: RUSSELL CROWE RULES!! But I won't (lol)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best I've seen in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many movies that we all watch are disapointments because of all of the hype that surrounds movies (especially summer movies)now. I was extremely excited to see Gladiator based on the trailer and the reviews I had read. This was one of the few movies where I was not disapointed at all. Russell Crowe was outstanding as Maximus, as was Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. Although I thought the movie could've used another battle scene or two, not once did I have to look at my watch or wonder when it was going to end, even after the 2 1/2 hours I just wanted more. I won't go into the story line, because most reviews have already done that. What I will say is that the first scene, the opening battle is in my opinion, the best scene of the film. The cinematography for that scene was perfect, and like so many before me have said, it rivals the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan. Maybe not as intense, but the sheer action in the scene is breathtaking. The entire time I was watching it I couldn't help but compare it to Braveheart, which in my opinion is the greatest movie of all time. Although I still think Braveheart was a better film, Gladiator held it's own. It is an epic, just as Braveheart was, and deserves to be held in the same regard.Bottom Line: It just makes you want to learn how to sword fight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I have seen many comments saying "Why gripe about inaccuracies in the film?"Well, I agree, it is an enjoyable film. But the inaccuracies were a bit distracting to anyone who knows something about the period.Imagine if you saw a political thriller about the Cuban missile crisis, and, in a final dramatic scene, there is a threatening call from President Lincoln to President Yeltsin about the Chinese missiles being placed in Cuba. What? It makes no sense? But who cares about historical accuracy?Now, I know most Americans (and perhaps others) know little about Rome from the end of the New Testament until Constantine reaches the Milvan bridge and spots a cross (maybe with a little bit about "Hadrian's Wall" in between), but there are many who know that Commodus didn't die a few months into his reign, know that Lucius Verus Iunior (I suppose that would have been his name) never existed, and that the republic was not restored circa 185 (or ever). And for those of us who do know this, seeing an eight year old child saying he is Lucius' son, or seeing Commodus' death is just as disconcerting as seeing President Lincoln ordering that General Lafayette drop the atomic bomb on Serbia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gladiator was a disappointment to me personally. I wanted the story to be more believable and I wanted to care more for the characters. This is not to say that this effort is not worth seeing. Richard Harris and Russell Crow give excellent performances. The overall look of the period was captured well however the battle scenes, while intense, were so chopped up, one would think the editor, Pietro DiGiamimo had drank too much coffee. The quick camera work along with chopped editing actually made me dizzy. A mixed bag for me but this film should appeal to those who like epic, action thrillers. Though a bit too long, there is enough action to make it bearable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little soon to remake Braveheart, don't you think?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly, I was disappointed by this movie, and I had suspicions that I would be. Before I go into the, why -of-it, it is important that I make an introduction. Ridley Scott permanently captured my imagination, and many others as well, many years ago with "Bladerunner," which still ranks in my top list of science fiction movies, despite recently losing it's number one spot (my own) to "The Matrix." "Bladerunner" had been preceded by the also incredible "Alien," which led me to believe that Mr. Scott would become one of the great directors of all time. "Legend," which followed, though fun to watch Tim Curry, as Darkness, was a bit childish and thin, and "Someone to Watch Over Me," was a bust. Even the much praised "Thelma and Louise," which was ground breaking in its introduction of leading women characters as hero/anti-hero, (characterizations only previously allowed for men), despite its hype and popularity, did not completely win me over either. I could go on and on and throw a brick at, "Black Rain," or "GI Jane," but that's not the point. I can only say I have not been impressed with any of his work since 1982. Now in all fairness it does take a lot to impress me. And perhaps if I were viewing these films as the work of an aspiring film-maker, I might be less critical. But I expect more from my heroes, and so now I will tell you what I found so lacking in "Gladiator." About an hour into the movie, I turned to my companion and said, "I've seen this movie before..." First of all, to me, talking during a movie, is the first sign of trouble, as her listening to my comment, was the second sign. Any film worth it's salt will go from beginning to end without so much as a peep from me. And this is the way it should be. Now many of you might say, "so what, we 'love' remakes," or in fact, "everything is a remake,..." and you wouldn't, sadly, be too far from the truth, (which is perhaps my greatest lament about the mainstream movie industry to begin with.) Some remakes have not been that bad, and I wont waste any of this time elaborating. The movie I originally had in mind with my comment was, "The Fall of the Roman Empire," which was pretty much the exact same story with Alec Guinness as the dying Marcus Aurelius; Christopher Boyd, as General Livius,(not Maximus), selected by Caesar to be Rome's guardian, while it remakes itself as a republic, (Caesar's dying wish here as well); Sophia Loren, as Lucilla, the princess; and most importantly, Christopher Plummer, as Commodus, Caesar's son and murderer, in a captivating performance, (as opposed to Joaquin Phoenix's listless interpretation of the same character), in an otherwise tediously long film, (a full 34 minutes longer than "Gladiator." The characters names are mostly all the same, as is the story, and sadly the dullness. Now I do realize that this movie was made in 1964, and most of you out there have not seen it and could care less, But I expect more from my great directors. Unfortunately, this was not the only movie herein that I had seen before. Also built within Gladiator, and becoming more apparent half of the way through, one noticed desperate story line similarities with "Braveheart," in the drive behind the hero's plight, and fate. This pathetic resort to imitating plot lines from Oscar winning films, should be relegated to fledgling directors, and not from one of the best. The similarities do go on, I could mention "Spartacus," and several others in the Roman genre as well. All old films perhaps, and once greatly in need to have been remade, though now no longer. All in all, in-between the action packed sequences, the picture moved slowly, begging for more scenes with special effects. Which it did not ultimately produce. We saw the best of this the film had to offer halfway through. In fairness, I loved a lot of the images, which reminded me that Mr. Scott now has the right to include any images he wants, and will not have to resort years from now from releasing a "director's cut" of this movie. I only wish he could have relied more on his intuition and less on what I perceive as, a catering to the least common denominator of the film going audience. So for the most of you, go see it and enjoy it, and forget everything I say, because you may not be expecting as much more, as I have, and will continue to do, while waiting for one more "Bladerunner," to come forth from this talented film-maker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Category Rankings on a 5 point scaleSTORY(3) : An above average "man-wronged" incarnation that gets dragged down by lifeless subplots and broad level political schemings.CHARACTERIZATION (3) : Neither heroes nor villians are properly explored. None of them have any wants and needs beyond the obvious. Noone is occupied w. the culture of the time. Commodus is bad because he wants his sister but they never show his egomaniacal nature.DIALOGUE(2) : Some truely great lines from Maximus and Proximo can't cover-up the obtuse expositional lines. People speak in such broad generalisms ("We must save Rome from the politicians, Maximus") that it offended me.PROD. DESIGN (2) : People are just too outfitted in this movie. Too much jewelry, too much armor, too many cloaks. Statues abound, even in field tents. And the lack of sunlight throws everything into a depressingly muddy haze.EFFECTS (2) : Dark and blurry. Nothing is distinct and detail is non-existant.DIRECTION (4) : Speed rules the day. Good luck trying to determine what is happening during the initial battle. But I understand what Scott was going for and I believe he partially succeeded in demonstrating the speed and skill of warriors and gladiators alike.ACTING (4) : Very, very good performances unfortunately wasted.OVERALL : 18/35Gladiator appeared to have tremendous potential.It had all the pre-requisites of those all-to-rare films that can at once entertain, inspire and educate. Sweeping set pieces, heroic feats of courage and villianous deeds of deceit that actually happened!I mean ---- after seeing the first two shots of this movie (hand in the wheat shot and Maximus w/ the bird shot) who among us did not believe that we were going to see something of a transcendent nature? I certainly did. Even after the first 30 minutes I felt like it was fulfilling my expectations. The small touches : Maximus' faithful dog, the frost sticking the blade in the scabbard, the small statues of Max's family leant a certain "realness" to the opening reel that never carries over.Unfortunately, some sloppy directing, a poorly concieved story, and some of the stalest dialogue ever helped to ruin the film for me. Not to mention the complete WWF'ing of the gladiator concept and some poor effects/art direction. They took a great concept and turned it into a parody.Yes, I know I need some cheese w/ my whine but I'm just tired of seeing movies where things so blatantly violate my suspension of disbelief. When an effect is clearly just that - you can't help but be bounced out of the story. Each of the effects shots of the city and the stadium appeared to have been done by a different effects house w. it's own individual style. To compensate for the poorly done effects a dark shadow was cast over the entire production to hid the shortcomings that CGI brings.(NOTE : I have heard that the in all locations save LA and Arizona movies are shown at 75% of their original brightness. So this could have some effect of how good the effects looked.)When dialogue is spoken on such a broad level (for international translations, of course) that you are re-writing it in your head, viewership becomes tetious.When things end in The Big Fight(What ever happened to The Palace Coup?) the film becomes just another typical Hollywood production.When lip service is giving to the "Afterlife" and "gods" and "the senate" and those ideas are never explored beyond being character arc or plot mechanisms you feel cheated.In my opinion the kung fu aspect of Gladiator is what gets it such high marks among audiences (especially on the internet)."Damn, did you see the way he stuck those two swords into that guy and then chopped his head off with both blades! Awesome!"Now I have no problem w. styling violence but the type of one- up-manship that has been occuring since SPR and the Matrix ultimately hurts things that really matter. Story and character.And saying that this movie is about for violence in society is like saying that ID4 is about the SETI Program. Allegory is great but when the movie fails on the surface - the sub text can never save it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply the best movie I've seen this year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first walked into this movie, I thought it was to be a Braveheart clone. After the first scene, I knew I was wrong. This movie blew me away. It had everything you could possibly wish for in a movie. Character development, which is sometimes lacking in movies where violence is overwhelming, was incredible. The main character, Maximus, shows significant signs of perseverance and endurance throughout the movie. I am not going to say what he does or how he does it because I want EVERYONE to see this movie. I know, I'm some people have said "oh it's too violent" or "it was so gory." Honestly, I think every slash of a sword was necessary. The producers did not attempt to tone down what would really have happened in a Roman-Empire style battle. Actually, I enjoyed everything they threw into this. I couldn't help having a great time watching some of the intricate fighting scenes. Basically, if you are at all interested in Roman history, like good old fashioned war movies, or just want to have a good time, see this movie. I recommend this to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointingly Lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When going to a Ridley Scott movie, I always feel a sense of security that I will be delighted with the cinematography, if nothing else. This foray into computer enhanced filming is horrible. Cleopatra, 30 years ago, was far more realistic since it was...well...real. Certainly, computers reduce the cost to produce a movie of this scope, but one is always aware that one is looking at a computer image. In old movies, where sets were built, there was no way to be sure that the movie wasn't filmed at an old ruin. The scenery was made of physical materials, not virtual images. Every time I saw those little pixels in the Coliseum flickering I was totally distracted. The whole movie, from a technical standpoint, is a case of "The Emperor's New Clothes."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this the day it came out over here. Had been waiting for it for a seriously long time. Lived up to my expectations.Loads of typical epic elements are present in this film. Death, glory, love, lust, blood and adventure. The overall plot isn't too different from Spartacus, but should be treated as a completely different film. I mean to say that there can't be just one film on Roman gladiators. There's no point in making a benchmark of a film. It just limits the possibilities.The actors were brilliant, and most of all Crowe, who just slips into every role he gets with the greatest amount of ease. We've now discovered a new generation of good actors, and definitely in the form of Crowe. Harris' short-lived role was well played, and the late Oliver Reed puts in a marvellous performance as Proximo (an honourary post-humous award of some description wouldn't go amiss!). Phoenix was relly menacing in his place, and made me hate his character's guts!The camerawork in some places was reminiscent of that of Janusz Kaminski in Saving Private Ryan. It's a good technique that gives the audience the feeling of chaos and atmosphere. Ridley Scott uses his usual flair to produce some excellent visuals, like the Collisseum (even though over half of it was CGI).Last but not least, Hans Zimmer's score was perfectly suited to the task of capturing action and intimate moments in the film. During the battle scenes the music often sounds like Gustav Holst's 'Mars, Bringer of War' from his Planets suite. Very good idea. Well suited to the scenes of combat and war.Overall, Gladiator is an amazing spectacle. And I'd like to finish by saying: RUSSELL CROWE RULES!! But I won't (lol)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best I've seen in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many movies that we all watch are disapointments because of all of the hype that surrounds movies (especially summer movies)now. I was extremely excited to see Gladiator based on the trailer and the reviews I had read. This was one of the few movies where I was not disapointed at all. Russell Crowe was outstanding as Maximus, as was Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. Although I thought the movie could've used another battle scene or two, not once did I have to look at my watch or wonder when it was going to end, even after the 2 1/2 hours I just wanted more. I won't go into the story line, because most reviews have already done that. What I will say is that the first scene, the opening battle is in my opinion, the best scene of the film. The cinematography for that scene was perfect, and like so many before me have said, it rivals the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan. Maybe not as intense, but the sheer action in the scene is breathtaking. The entire time I was watching it I couldn't help but compare it to Braveheart, which in my opinion is the greatest movie of all time. Although I still think Braveheart was a better film, Gladiator held it's own. It is an epic, just as Braveheart was, and deserves to be held in the same regard.Bottom Line: It just makes you want to learn how to sword fight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I have seen many comments saying "Why gripe about inaccuracies in the film?"Well, I agree, it is an enjoyable film. But the inaccuracies were a bit distracting to anyone who knows something about the period.Imagine if you saw a political thriller about the Cuban missile crisis, and, in a final dramatic scene, there is a threatening call from President Lincoln to President Yeltsin about the Chinese missiles being placed in Cuba. What? It makes no sense? But who cares about historical accuracy?Now, I know most Americans (and perhaps others) know little about Rome from the end of the New Testament until Constantine reaches the Milvan bridge and spots a cross (maybe with a little bit about "Hadrian's Wall" in between), but there are many who know that Commodus didn't die a few months into his reign, know that Lucius Verus Iunior (I suppose that would have been his name) never existed, and that the republic was not restored circa 185 (or ever). And for those of us who do know this, seeing an eight year old child saying he is Lucius' son, or seeing Commodus' death is just as disconcerting as seeing President Lincoln ordering that General Lafayette drop the atomic bomb on Serbia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ok here's the deal. This was a good film. Sure we realize it is Spartacus meets Braveheart, but that can be gotten over. Costumes, set, and especially the exterior shots of Rome were very impressive dispite the Colluseum looking slightly fake. I really enjoyed this right up to the end. Russle Crow gives a fantastic performace as Maximus, and was completly believeable. However one thing stood out. Joaquin Phoenix. Was he like the newphew of the director or somthing. He was terrible in the role. Every scene he came on i couldnt help bury my head in my hands. Some scenes were so bad, i could only imagine they were not reshot because the director didnt want to deal with him. Bad casting. But otherwise, GREAT movie, definitly worth the money, especially if you are into some bloody action scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 2.5 hour film was, easily, half-an-hour too long. There are several spots where boredom sets in during oh-so-excessively-too-long scenes. Yet, Ridley Scott opted to use rapid jump cuts during the battle scenes, leaving me almost dizzy, and not totally certain of what I had just seen.At 2 hours, this would be a much better film.

		<fullReview>Gladiator delivers, and I'm not talking pizza. Although there's plenty of red stuff flying around from time to time. This movie is an extremely well-crafted epic with sweeping vistas, spectacular scenics, breathtaking scenes of battle and fighting heroics, strong supporting roles, and a refreshingly cliche-free script which I did not find at all predictable. The tension was gut-gripping, the characters rich and mythic. Can you tell I was enthralled? What a role for Russell Crowe, who shows here just what he can do in a lead role. He has arrived for good, and we're the better off for it.I heartily recommend this movie. A fulfilling cinematic experience. Please seek out a theater with a great sound system and good projectors. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As high as my expectations were when I went to see Gladiator, they were met and exceeded. This film rests squarely on the shoulders of Russell Crowe, who gives a performance that is superior even to the one he gave in the Insider. I'll be shocked if he isn't nominated again this year. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard's score is the best I've heard in years, and Ridley Scott keeps the action moving at a frenetic pace, right up to the last match. While the film may draw comparisons with Spartacus, keep in mind that it is a totally different movie. And Crowe's performance easily outmatches that of Kirk Douglas. The early favorite for Best Picture, go and see Gladiator. I promise you won't ever forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What potential! What happened?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" was the one film I was really looking forward to seeing this summer (asides from X-Men). So when I finally got to see it, I was all set up to really enjoy a summer epic-- not blockbuster or action flick, but an epic, because I expected no less from Dreamworks or Ridley Scott. What I got instead was a film that was stunning and breathtaking in every way, save the script. The script for "Gladiator" dragged the entire film down. What essentially happened-- and it's disturbing how easily this pattern applies-- is that the writers broke down the script for "Braveheart" and rewrote it using shallower characters and stilted dialogue. The actors did a superb job with the pathetic material they were given, particular note being given to the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe. The visuals, particularly Scott's stylized way of altering the contrast and film speed during the action scenes to lend it that "unreal" aspect, were amazing. I have an amazing amount of respect for the SFX people who did the Colisseum-- really good job, guys. The pacing was also very nice. They managed to make a very dense movie. However, the script continually kept the film from hitting true epic greatness-- despite the best efforts of everyone associated with it. After having read articles about the script problems "Gladiator" was going through, it's easy to see where the problems stemmed from. Likewise, the only other problem I found with the film was the score, which was a bit heavy-handed and predictable (then again, the predictability comment could be handed over to the script as well). My friends and I could predict EVERYTHING from opening shot to final scene within about five minutes-- perhaps just because we saw "Braveheart", perhaps because the script didn't take the risks it could have. Why didn't Proximo have moral problems with being a gladiatorial profiteer even after he KNEW the psychological issues gladiators get? Or even if he was so caught up with the thrill and the popularity-- why wasn't his character given more depth on this level? Why didn't the script go into some REALLY difficult places-- like forcing Russell Crowe to combat his friends? Why wasn't more done with the concept of winning over the mob as creating political power? There were so many issues that could have been addressed that weren't-- and it was sad. Overall, an impressive piece of cinema-- if you look beyond the script. Congratulations guys-- with a good script in hand, you could have had a legend. As it stands, you have a fun evening diversion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great epic - Great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great film!Ridley Scott of `Alien', `Blade Runner', and `Legend' fame has delivered a wonderful and moving film.The opening battle scenes between the Roman Legions and the barbarian hordes in Gaul were equivalent to the opening scene in `Saving Private Ryan' and the brutal attack in `Paths of Glory'. Absolute reality ? cold, miserable, dirty, dangerous, vicious, - but organized and executed with Roman efficiency and uncompromising courage. I felt I was there and I really didn't want to be there.Russell Crowe is terrific. The movie Hero with Charisma is back. He is the link that ties the movie together and there are no false steps. No over or under acting ? just a performance that makes you believe that Maximus existed and had to do what had to be done.Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius should get a Oscar nomination for his performance.Jacquin Phoenix is the psychotic Emperor Commodus and proves the maxim that a great movie with a larger than life hero always needs a great villain.While the special effects were exciting and important, I didn't think that they dominated the movie or accounted for its success. I give the credit to old fashioned directing, great screen play, wonderful music and cinematography, great sets, editing, and fine acting.The Games`Spartacus' was about the training and the revolt of gladiators. `The Gladiator' centers on what it would be like to actually participate as a gladiator in the `Games'. For about seven hundred years ? from the Etruscans to the fall of Rome ? the Games bound the Roman culture together. On a weekly schedule throughout the Empire - tens, hundreds, and thousands died to entertain the populace. Ridley Scott presents the Games as simply part of the Roman life ? no moralizing, no cute scenes, no Christians, - just its brutality and its vicious, addicting, emotional appeal.Gritty, tough, epic in scope and very moving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on Tuesday, it was breathtaking. The opening scene had a battle betwen armies that was so realistic that I imagined myself in the midst of battle. I did not find one error in this movie (concerning production). I saw this movie as a combination of Spartacus, Double-Impact and the Sixth Sense, in a rather beautiful way. Now this movie puts special-effects to good use and you cannot tell reality from computer-induced events. I still can't decide if the aerial views of ancient Rome were an actual city or computer-generated. The plot is good and splendid.The battles are the most realistic and bloody I've ever seen in any gladiator/fighting movie, you literally see blood sprinkles in the air. You feel as if you are the condemned man going to meet death at the arena. Certaintly this movie is greater than Braveheart and will surpass it at the box office. It's an epic, that's all I can tell you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the first trailer for Gladiator(around superbowl time), I thought about how much potential for greatness this film could possess. In a genre that has been ignored for thirty years, it's refreshing to see a movie that will no doubt be a catalyst for a surge of new epics. Russel Crowe = bad hombre. It's one thing to see a hero who displays excellent prowess with a gun - like the protagonists we love from westerns and cop movies; it's something altogether different to see a warrior slay his enemies with primitive weapons like swords, spears, and morning stars. I won't go into detail, but the battles in this movie are phenomenal. One last element of Gladiator that makes it a different type of film than Braveheart is the computer generated imaging that makes the ancient Rome real and possible for the movie. Also, this movie will probably not win Oscars like Braveheart because people viewed Braveheart as one man's(Mel Gibson) vision.You can't not like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth seeing, but misses out on greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about this film, I knew it would either be one of the best films of the year, or one of the worst. There was no middle ground. I'm happy to report that the former is the truth. This film took a very exotic and little used location, and needed to make it convincing to work. It succeeds admirably. The dreary landscapes, ragged populace, and gruesome attention to detail quickly make the viewer forget all the "tits and togas" films of the sixties. The film establishes a strong hold, and never lets up. It seems that ever since the success of the relatively intelligent Titanic, and failure of moron trash like Godzilla, every action film advertizes itself to be "character driven", or "plot centered". This usually means a character will talk about how much he is loved by someone, and proceeds to die an exotic death followed by the self-indulgent tears from the actress playing loved one. Not so here; the plot seems to flow from the personality of the characters, and even though cliches and cheap emotion are plentiful, the film is so earnest and determined, such things are forgiven. The characters also find the right note; Maximus is dignfied and silent, a man of action who leaves words to the politicians. Commodus is cowardly, inexperienced, and stupid, but also dangerously ruthless and ambitious. The sister also strikes the right note, posessing the intelligence and courage her brother lacks, but also develops empathy and a concern for others. The only wrong note is the fellow slave played by Houson. Real gladiators were vicious criminals or rebellious slaves, but Houson is too nice and benign to be convincing as either. There also was no really good villain, like Mesalla in BenHur, or Edward in Braveheart. Commodus is too pathetic to really hate. The plot is effective, but seemed focused on the wrong things. It would be better to tell the film from Maximus' eyes than the omniscient narration that kept pulling us away, into the Senate chamber and Commodus' bedside. Scott also makes a few directing mistakes, such as showing us the coloseum early and a huge procession, diluting the effect of Maximus' first coloseum battle. The dark, brooding photography helped set the mood, but many times made things hard to see. It also seemed to lack the epic sweep and power of Spartacus, BenHur, or Braveheart, and some battles were hard to follow, particularly the charioteer fight, which chariots were wrecked but it was unclear how. Still, this is a pleasant surprise after the meager offerings of Y2K, and while it may not be a classic, it is a good start for a promising summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a long, LONG time. I can't believe that the same Ridley Scott that gave us awesome movies like Alien and Blade Runner directed this dross. The movie is way too long, as this plot could have fit in a 60 minute after school special. Half of the movie consisted of sped-up battle scenes, in which guys hit each other with sticks while the camera operators shook the camera around so you couldn't tell how el-cheapo their special effects were. The other half of the film consisted of one of the characters talking to another one of the characters in very slow speech, with overly dramatic lighting and music finishing up the scene. I counted about three unique expressions coming from Maximus-he looked forlorn, then he looked depressed, then he looked....well, make that two unique expressions. The next time you want to go see a good Ridley Scott movie, rent Blade Runner and save yourself the trouble of having to sit through this mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with movies today is that they try (and the key word here is "try") to enlighten us. They attempt to push lenghty ten minute monologues on our materialistic existence or the superficiality of mankind down our throats. What these movies and directors and screenwriters behind these movies fail to realize is that 98.9% of the world's population could care less about being enlightened. When I sit through a 3 hour movie, I want it to be entertaining. I don't wanna shell out 8 bucks to be preached at. Gladiator is the perfect example of a movie that the majority of moviegoers want to see.Gladiator has it all: a villain, a hero, a king, lots of gore, and beautiful cinematography and direction. While not being a breakthrough film or a one of a kind masterpiece, it's got all it needs. People want to see movies like this. They want that adrenaline rush right before a fight scene, they want to root for the hero, and they want that instant feeling of gratification and pure elation when the hero wins, no matter how strong the forces against him are.The hero in the movie is Russell Crowe, and he's great. The rest of the cast was good, but the one person holding this entire film up is Crowe. And why shouldn't he? The movie is centered around him. This movie is exactly what he needs. He's gonna become a household name.I give this movie a 10, not because it's one of my favorites, and not because it's a masterpiece (because it isn't), but because it embodies what a film should be. It's not superficial or preachy. It's just a good old-fashioned story delivered to us in a beautiful package. I'd be willing to shell out 8 bucks for the ticket (plus 3 for a Dr Pepper) to see this movie any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes Yes Yes!This movie is fantastic!All the performances ranged from good/great to great/fantastic.The story was solid, even though it may not have been the best ever written.The cinematography was rich and interesting. The sets/CGI are fantastic, You'd think ancient Rome still existed today.For some reason I kept getting reminders of The Phantom Menace, (in both the visuals, and dialogue/plot). I liked the look of the Phantom Menace, but was dissapointed in the execution slightly. This movie made my opinion towards Episode I even less favourable.No not everyone will love it, but only the TRUELY cinical will think that it is the worst movie they have ever seen.My advice is see it...judge it for yourself.Later,Lukas</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best epic in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie this long and epic cannot be summed up easily, but suffice to say that the movie is a must-see, and that lovers of many genres will find the movie to be quite satisfying. The movie contains a lot of action, and even though the action is often brutal, the director stays away from extreme gore and made-to-shock fight scenes. The plot development is great, with only minor loopholes, and the characters are all believable and easy to get to know. The camera-work is great, as is the script. Ridley Scott has come up with another winner and classic, though not in the same vein of 'Alien' or 'Bladerunner'. Russell Crowe, (who showed us that he could act tough without overacting in 'L.A. Confidential'), shows us again (as the gladiator Maximus) that sometimes the most believable emotions are the ones left to the mind. Sure, there are times when his face gives away what he is thinking, but most of the time you find yourself captivated by his stage presence. And then there is Joquin Phoenix, who convinces you that he truly is a mentally troubled Caesar, loving his position of power, and yet still playing children's games, deadly as they are. Connie Nielsen also convicts the heart with the emotion that she gives to her character, showing us her strong side, as well as her sorrow for her brother Commodus.Overall, this movie can be compared in length, plot, and character to 'Braveheart', but I would give 'Gladiator' the edge, and two-thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as Braveheart, but cooler.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the first trailer for Gladiator(around superbowl time), I thought about how much potential for greatness this film could possess. In a genre that has been ignored for thirty years, it's refreshing to see a movie that will no doubt be a catalyst for a surge of new epics. Russel Crowe = bad hombre. It's one thing to see a hero who displays excellent prowess with a gun - like the protagonists we love from westerns and cop movies; it's something altogether different to see a warrior slay his enemies with primitive weapons like swords, spears, and morning stars. I won't go into detail, but the battles in this movie are phenomenal. One last element of Gladiator that makes it a different type of film than Braveheart is the computer generated imaging that makes the ancient Rome real and possible for the movie. Also, this movie will probably not win Oscars like Braveheart because people viewed Braveheart as one man's(Mel Gibson) vision.You can't not like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth seeing, but misses out on greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about this film, I knew it would either be one of the best films of the year, or one of the worst. There was no middle ground. I'm happy to report that the former is the truth. This film took a very exotic and little used location, and needed to make it convincing to work. It succeeds admirably. The dreary landscapes, ragged populace, and gruesome attention to detail quickly make the viewer forget all the "tits and togas" films of the sixties. The film establishes a strong hold, and never lets up. It seems that ever since the success of the relatively intelligent Titanic, and failure of moron trash like Godzilla, every action film advertizes itself to be "character driven", or "plot centered". This usually means a character will talk about how much he is loved by someone, and proceeds to die an exotic death followed by the self-indulgent tears from the actress playing loved one. Not so here; the plot seems to flow from the personality of the characters, and even though cliches and cheap emotion are plentiful, the film is so earnest and determined, such things are forgiven. The characters also find the right note; Maximus is dignfied and silent, a man of action who leaves words to the politicians. Commodus is cowardly, inexperienced, and stupid, but also dangerously ruthless and ambitious. The sister also strikes the right note, posessing the intelligence and courage her brother lacks, but also develops empathy and a concern for others. The only wrong note is the fellow slave played by Houson. Real gladiators were vicious criminals or rebellious slaves, but Houson is too nice and benign to be convincing as either. There also was no really good villain, like Mesalla in BenHur, or Edward in Braveheart. Commodus is too pathetic to really hate. The plot is effective, but seemed focused on the wrong things. It would be better to tell the film from Maximus' eyes than the omniscient narration that kept pulling us away, into the Senate chamber and Commodus' bedside. Scott also makes a few directing mistakes, such as showing us the coloseum early and a huge procession, diluting the effect of Maximus' first coloseum battle. The dark, brooding photography helped set the mood, but many times made things hard to see. It also seemed to lack the epic sweep and power of Spartacus, BenHur, or Braveheart, and some battles were hard to follow, particularly the charioteer fight, which chariots were wrecked but it was unclear how. Still, this is a pleasant surprise after the meager offerings of Y2K, and while it may not be a classic, it is a good start for a promising summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that sucked mightily!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a long, LONG time. I can't believe that the same Ridley Scott that gave us awesome movies like Alien and Blade Runner directed this dross. The movie is way too long, as this plot could have fit in a 60 minute after school special. Half of the movie consisted of sped-up battle scenes, in which guys hit each other with sticks while the camera operators shook the camera around so you couldn't tell how el-cheapo their special effects were. The other half of the film consisted of one of the characters talking to another one of the characters in very slow speech, with overly dramatic lighting and music finishing up the scene. I counted about three unique expressions coming from Maximus-he looked forlorn, then he looked depressed, then he looked....well, make that two unique expressions. The next time you want to go see a good Ridley Scott movie, rent Blade Runner and save yourself the trouble of having to sit through this mess.</fullReview>

While not being a breakthrough film or a one of a kind masterpiece, it's got all it needs. People want to see movies like this. They want that adrenaline rush right before a fight scene, they want to root for the hero, and they want that instant feeling of gratification and pure elation when the hero wins, no matter how strong the forces against him are.The hero in the movie is Russell Crowe, and he's great.

He's gonna become a household name.I give this movie a 10, not because it's one of my favorites, and not because it's a masterpiece (because it isn't), but because it embodies what a film should be. It's not superficial or preachy. It's just a good old-fashioned story delivered to us in a beautiful package.

		<shortDescription>A clich that's not...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get one thing straight. Gladiator is a clichd movie. From its battle-scene beginnings to its battle-scene endings, Gladiator is predictable. Ish. And that's where the excitement comes in. Each time a new part of the plot, which is largely transparent, is introduced, you find yourself altering your perceptions of the characters, the situation they're in, and the possible pathways for the movie to travel along. And Ridley Scott does a great job, feeding tidbits to the viewers as they go, so they learn a little more about Maximus and friends as the movie goes on. At 2? hours, you'd want to be able to say the movie was engrossing. And it is. Looking back on it, I don't remember there being a great deal of dialogue. And it's not the Meet Joe Black kind of not much dialogue either. This dialogue is sparse because it can be - the story is *shown* to you, not told you. A very entertaining movie. After the disaster that was G. I. Jane, Ridley Scott is back. And about time too. Eight and a half from ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most enjoyable - Ridley Scott has made a great comeback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After some dissapointments (G.I. Jane wasn't to great, and White Squall was lacking at the end) I'm glad to say Ridley Scott is back in his game. I was looking forward to this film for awhile, it looked to be an impressive piece of cinema and plus, it had Russel Crowe in it. After a few months of waiting for it to come to theaters, I was it opening day with a sold out crowd. Everyone in the theater seemed to have really enjoyed it. Some thought it was to long (drags a lil at the beginning), some thought it was to violent (guess they haven't seen Braveheart), but most of us thought it was excellent.I'm not gonna give anything away in this review like many have already done. I must say Ridley Scott hasn't had beautiful shots like this since Legend. The cinemtography really pulls you into the story - Rome has never looked this stunning. The acting was oustanding on all counts, everyone was very well casted. Above all, what hit me most about this movie wasn't the cinematography, nor the directing, nor the storyline. It was Russel Crowe. This guy proves himself that he is the Marlon Brando of the new generation. He's wonderful as Maximus, some of the weakest lines in the film he makes them sound amazing. I can only hope him and Edward Nortan, another actor who's amazing, will make a movie sometime together.As for my dislikes of the movie - the editing. It's nice to see that a lot of people agree about how similar this is to Braveheart. Mel Gibson and Ridley Scott are very different directors and Scott approached this as an in your face kind of thing. For many scenes it dosen't bother you, but the opening battle and the first gladiator battle are very hard to follow because of this. I wish some of the action scenes lasted longer than they did, although the battles in Rome are oustanding. I wish I could have been able to tell what was going on a lot easier in the opening battle (the start of it as thousands of arrows fly through the air is magnificent) since everything happens very fast.Overall though I expect this to be one of the biggest hits of the summer. Maybe not in profit, but it has already made it on the top 250 so it seems most people love it. This movie will make Russel Crowe standout soon enough as another 20 million dollar actor, and he deserves it more than anyone. If you have the time, and the taste for a good action/drama, see Gladiator. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing...but missing something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I approached Ridley Scott's Gladiator with an enthusiasm for spectacular visual effects and a testosterone-pumped craving for carnage along the lines of Saving Private Ryan meets Ben-hur. However, upon actually viewing the film, I found that there is much more at work here. Of course, Scott is no Joel Schumacher and Russell Crowe isn't a Schwarzeneggar type, so this came with only a minimal amount of surprise. To address my initial hopes, Gladiator does harbor a variety of extraordinary images. The Roman cityscape is worth the price of admission in itself. Although some shots exhibit that "too bright" look that a lot of cgi effects have, the majority of scenes are composed with convincing authenticity. But forget the settings. Let's talk about satisfying the "I want to see brutal murder and dismemberment" desires of most moviegoers. Don't get too excited. As far as the blood and guts go, it seems that all of the battle sequences were cut in extremely short takes thrown together with shaky-cam perspective(I'm guessing they were trying to avoid an NC-17 rating). The bottom line is: in most shots, you really can't tell what is happening except for traces of red derived from spraying blood and the occasional death scream. I understand some things are in bad taste, but when you are depicting the gladiator "sport", the exploitation of death is the center of entertainment. Points off for that one. Also in poor form is the editing of the film in general. Gladiator is either an edge-of-your-seat roller coaster ride or a soap-opera paced drama and never falls anywhere between these two extremes. There is simply no transition. So what you seem to be left with is two films: a Mad-Max-style, kill 'em all hand to hand combat action flick on one hand and an expensive period piece character-study on the other. It's not that the performances are bad. It's just that there is essentially very little plot, so the actors have no means of developing their characters other than in face-to-face emotional monologues. Which brings me to the overly-dramatic-at-points score. There is a scene in the beginning of the film where Commodus and his father discuss the future of Rome. It entails Commodus communicating great frustration to his father through an emotional out-pour. The scene is acted adequately, but the music is laughably out of place and you feel like laughing at Commodus rather than understanding his plight. Aside from that, and a rather weak ending, Gladiator is, by all means, a must see. It runs over older sword and sandal epics with a 4-horse chariot (ok, that was pretty lame...forgive me).</fullReview>

Richard Harris did a good job as Marcus Aurelius though. I wasn't impressed much with the cinematography either, too much gray and blue and strange "jumping" in some of the special effects. The plot was interesting enough to follow for the first 2 hours, but the final showdown was too predictable.

		<shortDescription>Most enjoyable - Ridley Scott has made a great comeback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After some dissapointments (G.I. Jane wasn't to great, and White Squall was lacking at the end) I'm glad to say Ridley Scott is back in his game. I was looking forward to this film for awhile, it looked to be an impressive piece of cinema and plus, it had Russel Crowe in it. After a few months of waiting for it to come to theaters, I was it opening day with a sold out crowd. Everyone in the theater seemed to have really enjoyed it. Some thought it was to long (drags a lil at the beginning), some thought it was to violent (guess they haven't seen Braveheart), but most of us thought it was excellent.I'm not gonna give anything away in this review like many have already done. I must say Ridley Scott hasn't had beautiful shots like this since Legend. The cinemtography really pulls you into the story - Rome has never looked this stunning. The acting was oustanding on all counts, everyone was very well casted. Above all, what hit me most about this movie wasn't the cinematography, nor the directing, nor the storyline. It was Russel Crowe. This guy proves himself that he is the Marlon Brando of the new generation. He's wonderful as Maximus, some of the weakest lines in the film he makes them sound amazing. I can only hope him and Edward Nortan, another actor who's amazing, will make a movie sometime together.As for my dislikes of the movie - the editing. It's nice to see that a lot of people agree about how similar this is to Braveheart. Mel Gibson and Ridley Scott are very different directors and Scott approached this as an in your face kind of thing. For many scenes it dosen't bother you, but the opening battle and the first gladiator battle are very hard to follow because of this. I wish some of the action scenes lasted longer than they did, although the battles in Rome are oustanding. I wish I could have been able to tell what was going on a lot easier in the opening battle (the start of it as thousands of arrows fly through the air is magnificent) since everything happens very fast.Overall though I expect this to be one of the biggest hits of the summer. Maybe not in profit, but it has already made it on the top 250 so it seems most people love it. This movie will make Russel Crowe standout soon enough as another 20 million dollar actor, and he deserves it more than anyone. If you have the time, and the taste for a good action/drama, see Gladiator. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Gladiator last night and I felt that it was one of the best and most interesting epics I have seen in a very long time. The movie has something for everyone. If you liked Braveheart, you'll love Gladiator. I think that this movie has everything....great action and battle scenes. There hasn't been a roman epic like this since Ben Hur and as we all know, Ben Hur is the record holder for most Academy Awards won.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing...but missing something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I approached Ridley Scott's Gladiator with an enthusiasm for spectacular visual effects and a testosterone-pumped craving for carnage along the lines of Saving Private Ryan meets Ben-hur. However, upon actually viewing the film, I found that there is much more at work here. Of course, Scott is no Joel Schumacher and Russell Crowe isn't a Schwarzeneggar type, so this came with only a minimal amount of surprise. To address my initial hopes, Gladiator does harbor a variety of extraordinary images. The Roman cityscape is worth the price of admission in itself. Although some shots exhibit that "too bright" look that a lot of cgi effects have, the majority of scenes are composed with convincing authenticity. But forget the settings. Let's talk about satisfying the "I want to see brutal murder and dismemberment" desires of most moviegoers. Don't get too excited. As far as the blood and guts go, it seems that all of the battle sequences were cut in extremely short takes thrown together with shaky-cam perspective(I'm guessing they were trying to avoid an NC-17 rating). The bottom line is: in most shots, you really can't tell what is happening except for traces of red derived from spraying blood and the occasional death scream. I understand some things are in bad taste, but when you are depicting the gladiator "sport", the exploitation of death is the center of entertainment. Points off for that one. Also in poor form is the editing of the film in general. Gladiator is either an edge-of-your-seat roller coaster ride or a soap-opera paced drama and never falls anywhere between these two extremes. There is simply no transition. So what you seem to be left with is two films: a Mad-Max-style, kill 'em all hand to hand combat action flick on one hand and an expensive period piece character-study on the other. It's not that the performances are bad. It's just that there is essentially very little plot, so the actors have no means of developing their characters other than in face-to-face emotional monologues. Which brings me to the overly-dramatic-at-points score. There is a scene in the beginning of the film where Commodus and his father discuss the future of Rome. It entails Commodus communicating great frustration to his father through an emotional out-pour. The scene is acted adequately, but the music is laughably out of place and you feel like laughing at Commodus rather than understanding his plight. Aside from that, and a rather weak ending, Gladiator is, by all means, a must see. It runs over older sword and sandal epics with a 4-horse chariot (ok, that was pretty lame...forgive me).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uninteresting supporting characters, good Crowe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked Maximus and Crowe's acting job, but the supporting characters were largely uninteresting and woodenly acted. Lucilla spent most of her time looking scared and crying. Richard Harris did a good job as Marcus Aurelius though. I wasn't impressed much with the cinematography either, too much gray and blue and strange "jumping" in some of the special effects. The plot was interesting enough to follow for the first 2 hours, but the final showdown was too predictable. Better than a lot of period movies, but Braveheart is still top of its class by far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is derived from several films yet manages to remain itself and is superb. What I cannot understand is the huge gap in opinion presented by major critics. Some expound on the greatness of the film, likening it to Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan. Others state that it is the "worst movie ever made." How can critics be so diverse?Gladiator is simple and profound, violent yet beautiful. Could it be that passions aroused by this film are similar to those that drove American Beauty to its position of greatness? The terrible beauty of violence is American as it was Roman. Our violence is generally more gentile but for lust and the passions aroused by that lust are parallel. Gladiator is a great film journey. It also touches profound cords in the viewer that are deeper than some would want to acknowledge. We are the beast and the beauty, noble and savage.We are all a breath away from being gladiators, or perhaps its just a draft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a one of a kind piece of film. To watch it is like enjoying an independant movie with a big hollywood budget. Scott pulled out all the stops to make this one spectacular movie. I had not seen such excellent camera work since "Pulp Fiction." The scenes made you feel like you were right there in the stadium watching the spectacle. Scott also brought in many of the themes that have been left out of other roman based projects. Like the incestual tendencies of the latter Ceasars. The fans showering thier favorite gladiators with rose pedals. Slave camps, and the worldliness of ROME. You could walk down the streets of Rome and see people from all over the empire.</fullReview>

It is clear that Ridley Scott's forte is the scene with big sets and hundreds of extras. They were, by far, the most fun moments of the film. By contrast any of the dialogue-driven or one-on-one character scenes felt uncomfortable and forced.The script also falls short because there is no equally brooding and compelling character to challenge Russell Crowe. The most we get is an emperor who we find out is scared to be alone in the dark (Oh Dear!!) This is extremely weak characterization especially with Derek Jacobi whose presence reminds us, from the I Claudius series, how wicked and tyrannical a Roman emperor can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, first off, this movie is NOT a historical account, but rather historical fiction set against the backdrop of historical events (compare with A Tale of Two Cities - the story itself is not historical, but the setting takes place at a specific point in history (the French Revolution)). However, the Emperors Marcus Aurelius, who ruled from 161-80 AD, and Commodus, who ruled from 180-92 AD, are both historical figures.What I liked most about this movie was that it gave a glimpse into what the glory that was Rome must have been like. We see through the character of Commodus how devious and really messed up most of the Emperors of Rome must have been (Caligula, Nero, to name a few), and we get to see that it was a very violent and bloody period in human history. But then, the same can be said for any other period in history when war or conquest played a major factor (Spanish conquest of the Americas, the American Civil War...and so on).All this to say, so what if the movie is full of historical flaws? Who cares if certain characters did not really exist? People will always nitpick at things without taking the time to just sit back and make a paradigm shift and look at a movie like this from another angle. And for me, that means that the essence of that period in human history was captured and portrayed accurately. If you want to get any more accurate, then go to a library and read a book on Roman history. But for the space of time that was given for the movie, it was a job well done.There was another review that questioned the existence of glass in Roman times. The setting of the movie is 180 AD, there have been archaeological finds of glass artifacts which date much farther back than that.I recommend this movie. Even if it may be a cliff note version of history as told through the life of a fictional character.I give this one a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This picture had a lot of buzz, and I went to it with more than a little goodwill. Ridley Scott has directed THE DUELLISTS, ALIEN, and BLADE RUNNER, among other pictures, and he has one of the best camera eyes in the business. The first 45 minutes or so are extraordinary, the snow in the German forest, a bunch of guys in leather skirts and bronze armor chopping each other up, flaming arrows flying into the trees, and the cinematography is to die for. You forgive the weak spots in the characterization, or the laborious way the plot points are laid in. But then it collapses of its own weight. It reminded me a little of John Boorman's EXCALIBUR, which was also way over the top, but in the end XCALIBUR's operatic qualities worked. GLADIATOR just ends up being preposterous. Russell Crowe doesn't embarrass himself, and Oliver Reed is terrific, but THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS it ain't. If you're going to make a costume picture, either pay attention to history and character, or do STAR WARS. GLADIATOR is good for guys between the ages of, say, eight and thirteen (and I'm not putting that audience down, either), but it's basically the same plot as FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. The hero gets mangled, and then he gets revenge. But Sergio Leone didn't put you to sleep between the fight scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First disappointment of 2000(oh wait... that was Scream3)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, at least for the 2000 this is my first thumbs down of the summer.I hate to use a big critic as a reference but Roger Ebert was right on the money with this one. Too much of Rome looked like Naboo in Phantom Menace. Except I'm more forgiving of Lucas filming a place that doesn't exist. I know, I know Rome is pretty much history but don't even get me started on the historical inaccuracies.I'll keep this short. Actions sequences are hard to get into because of all the cheap slo-mo(for great slo-mo see john woo's MI-2) AND they don't make much sense. Case in point: there's a battle with like, five dudes all heavily armed against Maximus. When Maxumus defeated the last one(slicing his head off) the guy behind me was like "YEAHHHHHHHH!!!" I'm like, "Oh yeah...it's real hard to kill them if they attack you ONE AT A TIME!" Bogus. The tiger scene, some cool trap doors but nothing speacial.Most of all, there's really not much of a story. Basically, after a pretty good setup, Maximus is pretty much on this big revenge thing. And that's it. Period.Keeping it simple? Sure but with a running time over 2 1/2 hours I'd like some more story thank you.The bad guy: Commadus(SP?) Who cares? He's a whimp with hints of sexual feeling for his sister. Perverted? Sure, but not in the Caligula over-the-edge way. It's more like, we need something terrible about him. I know he's in love with his sister! stupid.Positives, the opening is nice and dark. Moody to the core. The battle in the opening is decent thought not great. And the first Collesium(SP?) fight is clever. Russell Crowe does what he can with what I've already stated is pretty 2 dimensional.Again, a major disappointment.Overall ** mediocre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This picture had a lot of buzz, and I went to it with more than a little goodwill. Ridley Scott has directed THE DUELLISTS, ALIEN, and BLADE RUNNER, among other pictures, and he has one of the best camera eyes in the business. The first 45 minutes or so are extraordinary, the snow in the German forest, a bunch of guys in leather skirts and bronze armor chopping each other up, flaming arrows flying into the trees, and the cinematography is to die for. You forgive the weak spots in the characterization, or the laborious way the plot points are laid in. But then it collapses of its own weight. It reminded me a little of John Boorman's EXCALIBUR, which was also way over the top, but in the end XCALIBUR's operatic qualities worked. GLADIATOR just ends up being preposterous. Russell Crowe doesn't embarrass himself, and Oliver Reed is terrific, but THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS it ain't. If you're going to make a costume picture, either pay attention to history and character, or do STAR WARS. GLADIATOR is good for guys between the ages of, say, eight and thirteen (and I'm not putting that audience down, either), but it's basically the same plot as FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. The hero gets mangled, and then he gets revenge. But Sergio Leone didn't put you to sleep between the fight scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First disappointment of 2000(oh wait... that was Scream3)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, at least for the 2000 this is my first thumbs down of the summer.I hate to use a big critic as a reference but Roger Ebert was right on the money with this one. Too much of Rome looked like Naboo in Phantom Menace. Except I'm more forgiving of Lucas filming a place that doesn't exist. I know, I know Rome is pretty much history but don't even get me started on the historical inaccuracies.I'll keep this short. Actions sequences are hard to get into because of all the cheap slo-mo(for great slo-mo see john woo's MI-2) AND they don't make much sense. Case in point: there's a battle with like, five dudes all heavily armed against Maximus. When Maxumus defeated the last one(slicing his head off) the guy behind me was like "YEAHHHHHHHH!!!" I'm like, "Oh yeah...it's real hard to kill them if they attack you ONE AT A TIME!" Bogus. The tiger scene, some cool trap doors but nothing speacial.Most of all, there's really not much of a story. Basically, after a pretty good setup, Maximus is pretty much on this big revenge thing. And that's it. Period.Keeping it simple? Sure but with a running time over 2 1/2 hours I'd like some more story thank you.The bad guy: Commadus(SP?) Who cares? He's a whimp with hints of sexual feeling for his sister. Perverted? Sure, but not in the Caligula over-the-edge way. It's more like, we need something terrible about him. I know he's in love with his sister! stupid.Positives, the opening is nice and dark. Moody to the core. The battle in the opening is decent thought not great. And the first Collesium(SP?) fight is clever. Russell Crowe does what he can with what I've already stated is pretty 2 dimensional.Again, a major disappointment.Overall ** mediocre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading some of the other reviews found here, it appears that you either get this movie, or you don't. Well, I did in a big way, and I feel sorry for those who didn't.The details have been explained in detail in other reviews, so I won't bother with that. Suffice it to say that I was completely absorbed in this movie, primarily due to Russell Crowe's performance. Crowe is rapidly becoming my favorite actor, and he plays this role perfectly. Others have commented negatively about the historical accuracy, and long running time, but I never noticed, and really did not want this movie to end.Do yourself a big favor and GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! Unless you're dead set on being critical, or determined not to get it, then stay away so I can have a better seat to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent - what can i say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew this movie was incredibly hyped, and I knew it was going to live up to its initial buzz. It definitely did, but I would have to say I am biased to this historical period. However, in comparison to Spartacus and Ben-Hur I think this is a better movie - that's just my opinion. I came in expecting a lot more Gladiator action, but was a tad disappointed by how much I got. However the action scenes that were present were spectacular and brutally violent. The plot drags a bit, but it can be overlooked because of Russell Crowe - he holds it all together. Definitely a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen Glad twice in 24 hours. After the second viewing, I think I put my finger on the why the film falls short. It is clear that Ridley Scott's forte is the scene with big sets and hundreds of extras. They were, by far, the most fun moments of the film. By contrast any of the dialogue-driven or one-on-one character scenes felt uncomfortable and forced.The script also falls short because there is no equally brooding and compelling character to challenge Russell Crowe. The most we get is an emperor who we find out is scared to be alone in the dark (Oh Dear!!) This is extremely weak characterization especially with Derek Jacobi whose presence reminds us, from the I Claudius series, how wicked and tyrannical a Roman emperor can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator may be the best looking movie I've ever seen. The visual effects are simply amazing. Granted, some of the dialogue is overdone in parts, but if you allow yourself to get lost in the moment, it just doesn't matter. The fight scenes were very well done, having the sense of being while still being able to know what was going on. All the actors give fine performances, but it is the visual appeal that really makes this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really liked this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, first off, this movie is NOT a historical account, but rather historical fiction set against the backdrop of historical events (compare with A Tale of Two Cities - the story itself is not historical, but the setting takes place at a specific point in history (the French Revolution)). However, the Emperors Marcus Aurelius, who ruled from 161-80 AD, and Commodus, who ruled from 180-92 AD, are both historical figures.What I liked most about this movie was that it gave a glimpse into what the glory that was Rome must have been like. We see through the character of Commodus how devious and really messed up most of the Emperors of Rome must have been (Caligula, Nero, to name a few), and we get to see that it was a very violent and bloody period in human history. But then, the same can be said for any other period in history when war or conquest played a major factor (Spanish conquest of the Americas, the American Civil War...and so on).All this to say, so what if the movie is full of historical flaws? Who cares if certain characters did not really exist? People will always nitpick at things without taking the time to just sit back and make a paradigm shift and look at a movie like this from another angle. And for me, that means that the essence of that period in human history was captured and portrayed accurately. If you want to get any more accurate, then go to a library and read a book on Roman history. But for the space of time that was given for the movie, it was a job well done.There was another review that questioned the existence of glass in Roman times. The setting of the movie is 180 AD, there have been archaeological finds of glass artifacts which date much farther back than that.I recommend this movie. Even if it may be a cliff note version of history as told through the life of a fictional character.I give this one a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

So, I went to see and well, to say the least, it was pitiful. The plot was okay but there was far too much of it. Not to say that I was hoping for all bloody battles but it would have been nice to have seen more considering that the movie is about fighting. The acting was okay, Crowe pulls in a fairly good performance but Phoenix as some character whose name I can't remember is the real star of the movie putting in a brilliant performance as Rome's new emperor. (Saying anything else would ruin plot). But, I think that this movie did have promise. Perhaps I should have waited for it to come out on tape...</fullReview>

At the start of the movie, you really get an amazing sense of the power of Roman artillery when they attack a barbarian tribe with catapults and flaming arrows. The film also unveils the Colosseum with attention to detail and Roman architecture. Besides the special effects, Gladiator has dialogue that resounds Shakespeare; a heart-wrenching lost-love story; lots of fight scenes; and a well packed moral dealing with wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, there was mostly nothing unlikeable about this movie. The fighting sequences were great. I do not doubt that battle at that time was just as it was depicted. Admittedly, I was into it although I would not applaud as many of my fellow moviegoers did over every death. The story was a really good one, too. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. I thought it was a little ridiculous that Commodus would take Maximus on. But, for where the story had gone up to that point, if I were the writer I could not have seen any other way for the story to end, either. Gladiator, also strengthened one point in my mind. I couldn't help but feel a little sympathy for Commodus, whose father would have taken anyone for a son, but his own. He probably hadn't seen his father much in those 20 years he was off fighting barbarians and all. Not that it's an excuse for his behavior, but it's kind of tragic because that is easily how a lot of people lose their way in the world. Having been denied love and approval from parents and peers, they're easy prey for negative influences, people who shape their unloved, weakened spirits into evil and hatred. Or, in this case, their own idle minds think up evil things. It's really sad. I saw this movie twice this weekend and this idea stayed with me the last time. Movies are only partly make-believe. There's still some truth to each one, some humanity that we all recognize. Anyhow, back to that last fight scene...though I realize this is a movie, I can't believe Commodus went out like that. After the first few times, he should have realized Maximus was not affected by his weak punches. See, he was used to those chroeographed fights he had with his Praetorian buddies in the woods and didn't know how to improvise when caught without his sword. With life at stake you'd think he would've bit the guy's nose or kicked him in the nuts or somethin'. Oh well. I really like this movie on the whole. Each of the performances was great ! I for one, was paying too much attention to the action that I could care less whether or not I could see every person in the upper tier of the audience. Though I usually don't compare movies, I did think the opening music sounded a bit "Last of the Mohicans." [And it's bothering me that I can't figure out where I've seen Max's son before.] And, I've already told my Mom that we're seeing this again this weekend. If I didn't have to work, I'd see it tomorrow! Dammit, I'll be thinking about it all week long. :(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening scene of a hand trailing through the tips of soft wheat as it blows and the ferocious battle that occurred after sucked me right into Ridley Scott's new picture starring Russel Crowe (L.A. Confidential) and Joaquin Phoenix (8mm). The story line is so heartbreaking and triumphant at the same time it leaves you breathless afterwords. Spectacular acting by Crowe and especially Phoenix who intimidated me in the audience. The cinematography was beyond amazing and Scott's eccentric style of filming battle scenes is intriguing. I was anticipating this movie very much so because I grew up watching Ridley movies like Legend and Blade Runner. Those were standard must have movies and must see in my family. Take it from me, see this movie...don't be stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first and most important thing I need to say about this movie was that it was too freakin' long!! This movie could have been made within the typical hour and forty-five minutes to two hour range, but two and a half hours is just unreal. Honestly I found this movie to be a little on the dry side. Not all the scenes connected and I found myself trying to concentrate more on what was going on rather then enjoying the film. Russell Crowe offered an excellent preformance as did Connie Neilsen and Joaquin Pheniox. The cinemotography was wonderful and the costumes were outstanding. These are really the film's only redeeming points. The plat was dull and somewhat tedious. It took two hours to finally get to the point of the movie. There were many extra scenes that could have been eliminated because they really had no point. The fighting scenes were well done, and there was a few scenes that had the emotion in it, the emotion that I am sure was supposed to placed throughout the entire film, yet was not. I would have to say that this was not one of my favourite films, but if you are planning to see it, then definitly go to the theatre, because with the specatuclar scenery and fast paced action sequences, this one needs to be seen on a big screen. However, if you are looking for a movie with a more gripping plot, more emotional acting and something worth your money, then you may want to look elsewhere, because "Gladiator" just doesn't cut it. I give it a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Russell hits the big time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is a majestic delight. After two viewings I find it improves with repetition. The gore is less distressing (as with Pvt Ryan) and Russell Crowe becomes stronger - I like him better than Kirk Douglas in this kind of role, and Kirk is an immortal. But to me, Crowe seems less contrived and self-conscious and just as powerful. "Spartacus Lite" a la Ebert suggests to me that the older movie (filmed near my town) has more human faces and sentiment with no computer scenes (though some obvious painted horizons) while Gladiator can seem too perfect (and location-authentic in appearance as a result). I found the Blade Runner quotes by the director heavy-handed (the crushing of the creator's head with unseeing eyes looking on, among others) but my family didn't notice it, despite many Blade Runner viewings. I loved Oliver Reed in this (after delighting in his role in 3-4 Musketeers) as well as several other actors in the supporting cast. The simulated environments were hard to fault and very beautiful. The battle scenes rank with the best ever - Cross of Iron, 'Ryan, Hamburger Hill, Platoon, Braveheart and others. It is long and uneven with occasional clinker dialogue and a slow middle, but I and my family will see it yet again. With its obvious integrity and great production values I say it will stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie started out with one terrific battle scene that really gets you into the movie, and from there the story just keeps getting more interesting. It felt like they actually had cameras back in the day of Romian empire. The scenery was too real looking. I didn't for once think I was looking at a digital city.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was prepared to be enthralled by "Gladiator", but I ended up being bored. It was about a half hour too long. My wife found it tedious enough that she went out for candy in the middle of it, and didn't feel she missed anything while she was gone.I know that I was supposed to be viscerally excited by the graphic violence, but I ended up being turned off. There was just too much of it. And as Maximus's improbable victory piled on improbable victory, I became more removed from the movie. My willing suspension of disbelief was stretched to the limit.The real story of this movie belonged to Commodus, and I applaud Phoenix's performance. His character was the most interesting and complex, from his profound disappointment at his father's disapproval to his befuddlement as to why the people of Rome didn't love or respect him. An epic hero traditionally has a fatal flaw, and Commodus' was his ambition. In this story, Commodus isn't likeable, but he is certainly the most human.Maximus was driven solely by his revenge and his sadness. There wasn't much more to his character, except his prowess in battle. I was supposed to root for him, but I felt little connection to him. Except for the opening battle scene (which IS intense and riveting), his victories seemed as believable as watching a bare-chested Sly Stallone scale a vertical cliff in the middle of a snow storm.At the start of the 21st century, I had hoped that a movie of this magnitude would transcend the sandal epics of the mid-20th century. I was sorry to be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first truly grand movie this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the first five monthes of 2000, I sat through loads of dreck, waiting for some film to live up to the annus mirabilis that was 1999. I went to Erin Brockovich, and was repulsed by the manipulation of the audience in that film, not to mention the deification of Julia Roberts and passed through the film. I decided not to look for a good movie, just an entertaining one, and I went to U-571. Instead of giving solid action, it tried to build characters into a story that couldn't handle characters. They piled cliches on an unsturdy frame, and the all film colapsed. I really wanted Gladiator to be the film that I would love, and I truly did love it. The opening has echoes of Saving Private RYan in style, but goes beyond that film because it truly ties us in to Russell Crowe's character, instantly. We know who he is, we identify with him, and we are instantly willing to follow him through to the end of the film. All of the fight scenes are on a grand scale, perfectly mounted and expertly executed. But there is more to this film than action. Russell Crowe had better become a movie star with this movie, because after The Insider, he truyly deserves it. He is a romantic, heroic, nobleman in the grandest sense of the word. Joaquin Phoenix is suitably over the top at times, yet there is depth to his characters. He is a human villain, and yet a hissable one none the less. That is great movie making. The political aspects of the film are also magnificent, adding a sociological dimension to the film that at no time feels like the film is teaching the audience. It is worked into the story organically. It also manages to work this massive scope into the context of a conventional, though thoroughly compelling and engrossing, revenge story. All in all, this is extraordinary, majestic, wonderful work. Now that I've listed everything I can think of that is great about this movie, allow me to take this opportunity to curse the name of Hans Zimmer. His score is, until the last twenty or thirty minutes of the movie, horrible, and should be excised from the film and replaced with something else in later incarnations of this film. Hopefully this is less than 1,000 words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fight scenes and such were spectacular. It was a visually lush movie. The acting, especially on Russell Crowe's part, was excellent but if they are going to spend 100M on a movie couldn't they have channelled some of those funds into a decent script with believable characters.And I am always willing to suspend my disbelief but when it comes to historical movies I appreciate a little more accuracy. For instance: Marcus Aurelius DID with the last of his strength (supposedly) declare Commodus to be his heir in front of the army. And Commodus did quite often enter the arena as a gladiator but, it wasn't until about 10 or 11 years after he became Emperor that he was poisoned by his mistress and died. Though perhaps not as truly depraved as Caligula, Commodus' true history seems to have been interesting enough to have fledged a much more well rounded script, with a greater depth of plot.I went to the theatre expecting the kind of feeling experienced from viewing BraveHeart I was definitely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>See this one in the theatre. I haven't seen an audience react so collectively to a movie in a I don't know how long. Gladiator is the stirring story of Maximus and his fight against the Roman emperor. The previews hardly give justice to the bone crushing, decapitating, roaring battle scenes. The cinematography is almost perfect, transporting one to the wilds of Germania and bowels of the coliseum equally well. I know it's early but I wouldn't be surprised to see an Oscar or two come out of this movieRussel Crowe's carries this movie well. If were to compare this to Braveheart I would say Gladiator has Braveheart beat hands down. If you like a good old-fashioned action flick, definitely see Gladiator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is in the top 3 best "Roman" movies I have seen--and I have seen them all--along with Ben Hur and Spartacus. Many people talk about the opening battle in Germania, but to me the highlight was the Carthage gladiator battle in the middle. Russell Crowe is going to be hotter than those flaming balls of oil. The production values were superb, and I just cannot conceive of any film coming up this year beating Gladiator in all the technical aspects--Art Direction, Cinematography, Costumes, Score (I HAVE to get that CD!!), Film Editing, Visual Effects, and Sound. Anyone who doesn't see it in the theatre is nuts (and I have a vested interest in hoping this does well so we get some more blood and sand epics like this one!). Long live Gladiator!</fullReview>

This may not be a family film, but you will be suprised, it is not one of those Dirty Harry kind of characters who kills anyone who gets in his way and never gets hurt, its completely different, I have to say it is as realistic as it can get, so you might not want to bring the youngest kids to see this movie because there are some bloody scenes, but you will be suprised at its drama, action sequences, and its authenticity</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Russel Crowe delivered probably the best work of his career beating out his performance as Bud White in L.A. Confidential in an epic movie worthing of being in the same category as Braveheart. GLADIATOR captures so much in its plot and the special effects used to create the Colloseum and ancient Rome in the prime of the Roman Empire and kept my attention until credits rolled.Although the film contains a somewhat sad ending, good still triumphs over evil which only one aspect of what makes GLADIATOR a must see. The brutality of the film, although hard to watch at times, accurately captured what the society of ancient Rome was like.GLADIATOR puts all of the science-fiction movies with special effects and huge budgets that just seem to eliminate a story line to shame with its simpleness and the power to keep the watcher deeply interested throughout the whole two and a half hours. As the movie opens with a battle scene in Germania, the watcher knows that they are in for something special as the sky just seems to be on fire with arrows and balls of fire.Russel Crowe should definitely be nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor as being "the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, and the the gladiator who defied an emperor." His quiet and modest demeanor in the movie causes him to be a great leader on the battlefield and in the Colloseum. He uses his leadership skills to help he and his fellow gladiators survive in what is almost certain death.With an all-star cast in which every actor plays their part fantastically and a story that can't miss, GLADIATOR should be a best picture candidate. GLADIATOR shows how important loyalty is and presents the question "Is blood thicker that water." Trust me, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well this movie does have a few problems with it but its a great epic. Scott captures that sense of awe with Gladiator. The locations, sets, effects, extras, costumes, and action all leads to a huge epic.The plot is fairly standard stuff. The ruler is killed by his son who wants to rule Rome.The ruler he wanted to follow him is imprisoned by the son. Son kills the rulers picks loved ones and man get angry...and what not. Its the good old revenge tale but told as an epic. The acting is good especially Crowe as Maximus.The film is visually very cool. From Rome to the fight scenes all well done. The worst scene is the begining battle. Its ruined because it was filmed in the dark, its edited to fast so you cant see whats happening, and the camera doesnt keep still. Also the ending is rather anti climatic. It leads you to believe that there is going to be a huge battle in Rome but alsa all we get is the hero and the villain dueling it out in the Colussem.Another problem that is too long. It could have a used another brawl or two its seems much longer then 2 hours and 30 mins. I never was really interested in epics of battle but i really enjoyed this one.Its got well done action and good acting thats leads to a well worth trip to the theater7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Man's Braveheart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billed as the biggest onscreen epic produced in years, Gladiator shines in the action department but, ultimately, its cliched and shallow storyline makes the film fall flat. On paper, Gladiator looks phenomenal, directed by a master of 'smart' action film (Ridley Scott) and starring some uniquely talented tough-guy actors (Crowe and Oliver Reed). And the action is intense, from the opening scenes of large-scale warfare to the battles in the arena. Yet peel away the impressive battle scenes, and you will find that the remaining scenes tell a tired story that has been done over and over again. Gladiator is basically a reworked version of Braveheart without the detail, depth of the characters, and emotional response. You really won't love Crowe's Maximus all that much, and you really won't ever be scared by Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus. You won't really get upset when the bad things happen, and you won't really feel inspired at the end. In Braveheart, you feel terrible when Wallace's first wife is killed; how can you be expected to feel terrible when the same happens in Gladiator, when Maximus' wife doesn't even speak or appear for more than 2 seconds in the film? Gladiator shares a million parallels with Braveheart (I'd be surprised if the mimicry wasn't intentional), and falls short in every category.</fullReview>

The acting, especially on Russell Crowe's part, was excellent but if they are going to spend 100M on a movie couldn't they have channelled some of those funds into a decent script with believable characters.And I am always willing to suspend my disbelief but when it comes to historical movies I appreciate a little more accuracy. For instance: Marcus Aurelius DID with the last of his strength (supposedly) declare Commodus to be his heir in front of the army. And Commodus did quite often enter the arena as a gladiator but, it wasn't until about 10 or 11 years after he became Emperor that he was poisoned by his mistress and died. Though perhaps not as truly depraved as Caligula, Commodus' true history seems to have been interesting enough to have fledged a much more well rounded script, with a greater depth of plot.I went to the theatre expecting the kind of feeling experienced from viewing BraveHeart I was definitely disappointed.</fullReview>

Gladiator is the stirring story of Maximus and his fight against the Roman emperor. The previews hardly give justice to the bone crushing, decapitating, roaring battle scenes. The cinematography is almost perfect, transporting one to the wilds of Germania and bowels of the coliseum equally well. I know it's early but I wouldn't be surprised to see an Oscar or two come out of this movieRussel Crowe's carries this movie well.

		<fullReview>Russel Crowe delivered probably the best work of his career beating out his performance as Bud White in L.A. Confidential in an epic movie worthing of being in the same category as Braveheart. GLADIATOR captures so much in its plot and the special effects used to create the Colloseum and ancient Rome in the prime of the Roman Empire and kept my attention until credits rolled.Although the film contains a somewhat sad ending, good still triumphs over evil which only one aspect of what makes GLADIATOR a must see. The brutality of the film, although hard to watch at times, accurately captured what the society of ancient Rome was like.GLADIATOR puts all of the science-fiction movies with special effects and huge budgets that just seem to eliminate a story line to shame with its simpleness and the power to keep the watcher deeply interested throughout the whole two and a half hours. As the movie opens with a battle scene in Germania, the watcher knows that they are in for something special as the sky just seems to be on fire with arrows and balls of fire.Russel Crowe should definitely be nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor as being "the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, and the the gladiator who defied an emperor." His quiet and modest demeanor in the movie causes him to be a great leader on the battlefield and in the Colloseum. He uses his leadership skills to help he and his fellow gladiators survive in what is almost certain death.With an all-star cast in which every actor plays their part fantastically and a story that can't miss, GLADIATOR should be a best picture candidate. GLADIATOR shows how important loyalty is and presents the question "Is blood thicker that water." Trust me, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well this movie does have a few problems with it but its a great epic. Scott captures that sense of awe with Gladiator. The locations, sets, effects, extras, costumes, and action all leads to a huge epic.The plot is fairly standard stuff. The ruler is killed by his son who wants to rule Rome.The ruler he wanted to follow him is imprisoned by the son. Son kills the rulers picks loved ones and man get angry...and what not. Its the good old revenge tale but told as an epic. The acting is good especially Crowe as Maximus.The film is visually very cool. From Rome to the fight scenes all well done. The worst scene is the begining battle. Its ruined because it was filmed in the dark, its edited to fast so you cant see whats happening, and the camera doesnt keep still. Also the ending is rather anti climatic. It leads you to believe that there is going to be a huge battle in Rome but alsa all we get is the hero and the villain dueling it out in the Colussem.Another problem that is too long. It could have a used another brawl or two its seems much longer then 2 hours and 30 mins. I never was really interested in epics of battle but i really enjoyed this one.Its got well done action and good acting thats leads to a well worth trip to the theater7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Man's Braveheart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billed as the biggest onscreen epic produced in years, Gladiator shines in the action department but, ultimately, its cliched and shallow storyline makes the film fall flat. On paper, Gladiator looks phenomenal, directed by a master of 'smart' action film (Ridley Scott) and starring some uniquely talented tough-guy actors (Crowe and Oliver Reed). And the action is intense, from the opening scenes of large-scale warfare to the battles in the arena. Yet peel away the impressive battle scenes, and you will find that the remaining scenes tell a tired story that has been done over and over again. Gladiator is basically a reworked version of Braveheart without the detail, depth of the characters, and emotional response. You really won't love Crowe's Maximus all that much, and you really won't ever be scared by Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus. You won't really get upset when the bad things happen, and you won't really feel inspired at the end. In Braveheart, you feel terrible when Wallace's first wife is killed; how can you be expected to feel terrible when the same happens in Gladiator, when Maximus' wife doesn't even speak or appear for more than 2 seconds in the film? Gladiator shares a million parallels with Braveheart (I'd be surprised if the mimicry wasn't intentional), and falls short in every category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was prepared to be enthralled by "Gladiator", but I ended up being bored. It was about a half hour too long. My wife found it tedious enough that she went out for candy in the middle of it, and didn't feel she missed anything while she was gone.I know that I was supposed to be viscerally excited by the graphic violence, but I ended up being turned off. There was just too much of it. And as Maximus's improbable victory piled on improbable victory, I became more removed from the movie. My willing suspension of disbelief was stretched to the limit.The real story of this movie belonged to Commodus, and I applaud Phoenix's performance. His character was the most interesting and complex, from his profound disappointment at his father's disapproval to his befuddlement as to why the people of Rome didn't love or respect him. An epic hero traditionally has a fatal flaw, and Commodus' was his ambition. In this story, Commodus isn't likeable, but he is certainly the most human.Maximus was driven solely by his revenge and his sadness. There wasn't much more to his character, except his prowess in battle. I was supposed to root for him, but I felt little connection to him. Except for the opening battle scene (which IS intense and riveting), his victories seemed as believable as watching a bare-chested Sly Stallone scale a vertical cliff in the middle of a snow storm.At the start of the 21st century, I had hoped that a movie of this magnitude would transcend the sandal epics of the mid-20th century. I was sorry to be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first truly grand movie this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the first five monthes of 2000, I sat through loads of dreck, waiting for some film to live up to the annus mirabilis that was 1999. I went to Erin Brockovich, and was repulsed by the manipulation of the audience in that film, not to mention the deification of Julia Roberts and passed through the film. I decided not to look for a good movie, just an entertaining one, and I went to U-571. Instead of giving solid action, it tried to build characters into a story that couldn't handle characters. They piled cliches on an unsturdy frame, and the all film colapsed. I really wanted Gladiator to be the film that I would love, and I truly did love it. The opening has echoes of Saving Private RYan in style, but goes beyond that film because it truly ties us in to Russell Crowe's character, instantly. We know who he is, we identify with him, and we are instantly willing to follow him through to the end of the film. All of the fight scenes are on a grand scale, perfectly mounted and expertly executed. But there is more to this film than action. Russell Crowe had better become a movie star with this movie, because after The Insider, he truyly deserves it. He is a romantic, heroic, nobleman in the grandest sense of the word. Joaquin Phoenix is suitably over the top at times, yet there is depth to his characters. He is a human villain, and yet a hissable one none the less. That is great movie making. The political aspects of the film are also magnificent, adding a sociological dimension to the film that at no time feels like the film is teaching the audience. It is worked into the story organically. It also manages to work this massive scope into the context of a conventional, though thoroughly compelling and engrossing, revenge story. All in all, this is extraordinary, majestic, wonderful work. Now that I've listed everything I can think of that is great about this movie, allow me to take this opportunity to curse the name of Hans Zimmer. His score is, until the last twenty or thirty minutes of the movie, horrible, and should be excised from the film and replaced with something else in later incarnations of this film.

		<fullReview>Ok, I saw Gladiator last night, and on the whole I was impressed. The acting was good and there were some interesting in-jokes. However, historically it left much to be desired.First, the good parts: Marcus Aurelius' Meditations reveal that he did not much care for the public life, and longed to return to his quiet life on the farm back in the country. Sound familiar? Also, there had been a revolt by a senator named Cassius shortly before Aurelius' death, and he shows up in the movie, yay! I also liked the fight scenes, yes that makes me no better than the mob, but I thought it was interesting how the actual killings tended to be displayed either sped up or slowed down, in either case making them seem unreal. In regard to the mish-mash of accents, I thought it added charm to the movie, after all, Rome was a mish-mash of people, no?** There are some spoilers in the following section. You have been warned **As far as the history goes, I have heard some complaints from friends about Aurelius actually being in Germania (he did go out on the road with his armies) and Commodus entering the gladiatorial ring (which he also did). My major issue is the fact that Commodus enjoyed(?) a 12 year reign! He was not, repeat not, killed in the Coliseum by anyone, he was drugged and murdered the night before he was to accept a consulship. (Dressed as a gladiator, no less) For me, that brought this movie down a couple notches. Historical license is one thing, but killing emporers less than 6 months into their reign is too much for me.Final analysis: 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cinematography and some kind of digital film enhancement of action scenes also add to this impressive story. Not since 'Ben Hur' and 'Sparticus' has the movie screen seen a really successful film of early Roman Empire history.If this starts a trend, I hope that producers look into such historical figures like that of Constantine I (273?-337C.E.) who have enough of both impressive facts and mystery surrounding their life that would make for entertaining story telling on the big screen.I agree with others about how entertaining this movie was. I would not even go to the restroom while this film was going on. Every scene was impressively done with fine supporting cast. The energy and flavor of what it must have been like in the time of the Roman Empire was very well captivated: particularly with its demand of political obedience to power, how people of an era were entertained by real violence, barbarian invasions at the Empire's borders, different personalities and thought among a Roman Senate, an excellent portrayal of Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, all fine supporting acting, and of course Russell Crowe. I will be interested in seeing if the Academy of Motion Pictures chose 'Gladiator' for any of its Oscar categories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film to start the summer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first of the summer blockbusters finally arrives, and if it is any indication of what the summer will be like, this will be a great year for movies.Gladiator tracks the career of a Roman general named Maximus (Russell Crowe), who falls from grace after Emperor Marcus Aurelius dies and is succeeded by his son, Commodus. Maximus finds himself in the arena fighting as a gladiator, trying to gain revenge for the murder of his family.Ridley Scott's direction is simply inspired, and he is able to bring stellar performances out of his actors. Further, the art direction and computer imaging brings the ancient Roman world to life more vividly than any film before it.Perhaps one truly great trick that Ridley Scott pulls out of his book is to turn the theatre audience into Romans. I personally found myself excited as the blood spilled onto the floor in the arena, much to my horror (I have always considered myself peaceful and civilized). One comes out of the theatre with a sense that perhaps one isn't quite as far from the brutality of the past as we all would hope.If I have any complaint, it is that some of the combat scenes move too fast and have too much going on. The end result is that the viewer doesn't quite know what is happening. Perhaps the clarity of the battles in Braveheart would have been more helpful here.So, the final score: 4.5/5. Definitely worth going to see.</fullReview>

Are we not individuals in a different kind of coliseum watching a spectacle of violence in a time of relative external peace?

		<fullReview>I don't know why there are many comments complaining about the violence in this film, first of all if you are about to see a movie titled "Gladiator" I am ready for battles and violence, I mean just from the title you can imply that there is going to be gore so my point is if you are going to watch this movie be ready for violence and don't complain later. The battle scenes are the best I have ever sceen they beat Braveheart.What Ben-hur, and Spartacus were in the 50s and 60s, Gladiator is in 2000.The visuals created in this movie are amazing, the re-creation of Rome, specially the Coloseum, something one would expect from the director of Bladerunner and Alien.I tend to divide movies into two categories, films that are really artistic, with a deep philosophical meaning and entertaining movies, Gladiator fits in this category and it earns a 10. Gladiator doesnt intend to tell a historical tale accurately, it just intends on delivering a good story involving glory, love, treason and triumph.Overall this movie has great performances specially by Russell Crowe, great visuals, great battles, an excellent score by Hans Zimmer, a must see, recommended for anyone who loves films with great action, where good defeats evil, and for anyone who intends to have a good time at the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Historical movies based in ancient Rome are few these years and fewer still are those worth watching. Fortunately, the latest Gladiator came as a pleasant surprise. A good, although not perfect way to spend a weekend afternoon.Throughout the movie I was astonished by the epic scale of the sceneries. From the epic battle in Germania to the computer recreation of the city of Rome, to the great battle arena, each scene are magnificent and beautiful. The actions are fast and furious; they are somehow bloody for a PG13 movie so parents please be warned.The story is ordinary but functional enough to keep me interested for ~3 hours. No major logical flaws in the plot although the ending is a little cheesy. In many parts of the movie I was emotionally tugged by the powerful applications of music and imagery. The themes of loyalty, love, jealousy, and despair are very well conveyed to the audience.The characters are well developed with many memorable and interesting casts, although I think it is somehow of an overkill to portray wickedness of Caesar. Overall the acting is good and small details like Maximus padding a fellow soldier on the shoulder really add depth to their personalities.If you are a fan of movies like Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan, you should enjoy this one. I give this movie only 7/10, because there could be a better story, a more logical ending, and more believable villain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been waiting for this movie for some time and was not disappointed. I thought that Phoenix played a great part as Commodus giving the role a certain amount of believability compared to some of the derranged depictions of Roman Emporers that have gone before. Russell Crowe also makes his character come to life holding the whole movie together. On the accuracy side the film gives a very accurate depiction of the colliseum but the other shots of Rome in the background are fanciful to say the least.The first gladiatorial sequence gives a real feel for the total lack of value placed on human life by the Romans however I don't think the true horror of the collisseum comes through in this picture. The typical day at the colliseum was split in three with the first part of the day belonging to the beast hunts. Where up to a hundred lions, bears, bulls elephants etc would be made to fight each other and teams of besterai(beast fighters) also convicted criminals and slaves would be lead into the ring in chains, the chains would be removed and the person striped naked and forced to meet the lions etc by poding with red hot branding irons often the people would be hung from different types of contraptions to make it more difficult for the animals to get a clean kill. Death by a lion was considered a clean kill as the animal would kill its victim in short order, smaller carnivores where often used and the victim would be hardly recognisable as a human before the death blow was finally administered by the staff to enable the later shows to continue. Midday brought out the slightly more favoured criminals who where made to fight each other to the death the winner staying on until he meet his death. Once again the application of branding irons to reluctant victims ensure entertainment for the masses. The afternoon brought the Gladiatorial fights as depicted in the movie. The bodies of the victims where branded to ensure death. If any life was left a blow was applied to the cranium to finish the job, a hook was then stuck in the carcasses gut and a horse was used to drag out the body and was thrown into large pits near the colliseum kept for such purposes.I am not sure that this sort of horror could be depicted in a modern movie as not only would it be censored but it is so outrageous that a modern audience would think it lacked credulity. Commodus also as depicted in the movie was a more loveable character than the one described in the histories of the times but yet again his depravities would not suit the censors.All in all great entertainment though.</fullReview>

One of the two problems I had with this movie, is that it seemed to attract a large audience of professional wrestling fans. I happen to think that anyone who comprehensively watches wrestling has the attention span of a 6 year old. So it felt like there were a bunch of 6 year olds staying up later than they should be to watch this movie, when I was there. Screaming "Can you smell what the rock is cooking" when the fight scenes are happening and "BORING" when they stop and talk. The other problem, is that it for some reason doesn't feel like a masterpiece. At the end, Phoenix didn't seem to be sooooo evil as he was hyped to be throughout the movie. He was just a misunderstood problem child who got mad at daddie for embracing someone better then him. He could have been more powerful, and evil, there are ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Russell Crowe is fantastic as Maximus in both physique and temperament. As a man of honor who valued the simple things but who could back them up with his sword, Maximus is a character worth sitting nearly three hours in a theatre for, and Crowe brings Maximus to life in ways that makes me wonder if Russell is "acting" at all. Connie Nielson is also well cast as Lucilla. A real beauty, (think Sharon Stone), her scenes with Maximus are first rate. The other cast members did a good job as well. I would point out the boy who played Lucius only to say that he is a far better child actor than the one who played Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace. As for Joaquin Phoenix, I wanted him to be more "psycho," in that while he succeeded in making Commodus disturbing, I found myself laughing at him more than I was scared of him. There were times when I simply wanted to tell Commodus to go to his room, and I would've done it without fear of reprisals, but I'm not sure if that's Phoenix's fault so much as it's the script's.The costumes are wonderful!!! Especially Lucilla's outfits, and her jewelry and makeup are perfect as well. The battle gear and gore make-up are also well done.Visual effects-wise, the inside of the Colosseum is great, but the rest of Rome seems so fake. While breathtaking, it is obviously computer generated. As for the battle/action scenes, they seem rushed and choppy. The opening scene for example, both visually and audially (esp. the arrows) reminds me of Star Wars for some reason, but I digress. The first half of the battle is well done, showing the sheer numbers on both sides and the strategic planning involved. However, the second half is annoying in the way in which it's shot. It doesn't live up to any of the Braveheart battle scenes that people seem to want to compare them to at all. The rest of the action scenes seem to follow the same pattern--great general set-up, horrible follow through. The lighting however was well done in terms of when and how it was used to fit the theme of the movie.While obviously leaning on the action scenes with its epic proportions and gory grandeur to draw in and "entertain" the movie-going audience, the movie would have been better off focusing on the more intimate and human interest side of the story. The best scenes in the movie were the ones that took place out of the sight of "glorious" Rome with its architectural wonders, its mob-like masses, and its moral corruption. Those shot in dark, dank corners between two or three people, esp. those between Maximus and Lucilla, were fantastic and did more to draw me into the lives of the characters, where the real story should take place, than any that dealt with the fate of Rome.The Gladiator is still a movie that I would recommend to others however, if only to make sure that Russell Crowe and Connie Nielson get the recognition that they deserve. But don't take my word for it, go see it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why there are many comments complaining about the violence in this film, first of all if you are about to see a movie titled "Gladiator" I am ready for battles and violence, I mean just from the title you can imply that there is going to be gore so my point is if you are going to watch this movie be ready for violence and don't complain later. The battle scenes are the best I have ever sceen they beat Braveheart.What Ben-hur, and Spartacus were in the 50s and 60s, Gladiator is in 2000.The visuals created in this movie are amazing, the re-creation of Rome, specially the Coloseum, something one would expect from the director of Bladerunner and Alien.I tend to divide movies into two categories, films that are really artistic, with a deep philosophical meaning and entertaining movies, Gladiator fits in this category and it earns a 10. Gladiator doesnt intend to tell a historical tale accurately, it just intends on delivering a good story involving glory, love, treason and triumph.Overall this movie has great performances specially by Russell Crowe, great visuals, great battles, an excellent score by Hans Zimmer, a must see, recommended for anyone who loves films with great action, where good defeats evil, and for anyone who intends to have a good time at the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Historical movies based in ancient Rome are few these years and fewer still are those worth watching. Fortunately, the latest Gladiator came as a pleasant surprise. A good, although not perfect way to spend a weekend afternoon.Throughout the movie I was astonished by the epic scale of the sceneries. From the epic battle in Germania to the computer recreation of the city of Rome, to the great battle arena, each scene are magnificent and beautiful. The actions are fast and furious; they are somehow bloody for a PG13 movie so parents please be warned.The story is ordinary but functional enough to keep me interested for ~3 hours. No major logical flaws in the plot although the ending is a little cheesy. In many parts of the movie I was emotionally tugged by the powerful applications of music and imagery. The themes of loyalty, love, jealousy, and despair are very well conveyed to the audience.The characters are well developed with many memorable and interesting casts, although I think it is somehow of an overkill to portray wickedness of Caesar. Overall the acting is good and small details like Maximus padding a fellow soldier on the shoulder really add depth to their personalities.If you are a fan of movies like Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan, you should enjoy this one. I give this movie only 7/10, because there could be a better story, a more logical ending, and more believable villain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adrenaline pumping action but not ancient Rome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting for this movie for some time and was not disappointed. I thought that Phoenix played a great part as Commodus giving the role a certain amount of believability compared to some of the derranged depictions of Roman Emporers that have gone before. Russell Crowe also makes his character come to life holding the whole movie together. On the accuracy side the film gives a very accurate depiction of the colliseum but the other shots of Rome in the background are fanciful to say the least.The first gladiatorial sequence gives a real feel for the total lack of value placed on human life by the Romans however I don't think the true horror of the collisseum comes through in this picture. The typical day at the colliseum was split in three with the first part of the day belonging to the beast hunts. Where up to a hundred lions, bears, bulls elephants etc would be made to fight each other and teams of besterai(beast fighters) also convicted criminals and slaves would be lead into the ring in chains, the chains would be removed and the person striped naked and forced to meet the lions etc by poding with red hot branding irons often the people would be hung from different types of contraptions to make it more difficult for the animals to get a clean kill. Death by a lion was considered a clean kill as the animal would kill its victim in short order, smaller carnivores where often used and the victim would be hardly recognisable as a human before the death blow was finally administered by the staff to enable the later shows to continue. Midday brought out the slightly more favoured criminals who where made to fight each other to the death the winner staying on until he meet his death. Once again the application of branding irons to reluctant victims ensure entertainment for the masses. The afternoon brought the Gladiatorial fights as depicted in the movie. The bodies of the victims where branded to ensure death. If any life was left a blow was applied to the cranium to finish the job, a hook was then stuck in the carcasses gut and a horse was used to drag out the body and was thrown into large pits near the colliseum kept for such purposes.I am not sure that this sort of horror could be depicted in a modern movie as not only would it be censored but it is so outrageous that a modern audience would think it lacked credulity. Commodus also as depicted in the movie was a more loveable character than the one described in the histories of the times but yet again his depravities would not suit the censors.All in all great entertainment though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Braveheart-like action to a great story line, Gladiator owns.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The classic action movie, Gladiator starts with Maximus, a valiant general of the Roman Army of Marcus Aurelius the Wise, leading an army to a bloody victory. Right from the start, the action scenes get your full attention. But don't let Gladiator's rough exterior fool you, there is a soft, lovable interior to this classic masterpiece. Maximus is driven by the love for his wife and his son. Action scenes are dispersed throughout the movie to keep the action fanatic busy, while Maximus' constant longing to meet his wife and child will move the more sensitive viewer. Maximus influences the masses, from a quite large Germanic man (Ralph Moeller), who I call Tiny, to an African slave (Djimon Hounsou), to the attendants at the Colliseum. The stories of these individuals, and the turmoil of Roman politics also play central roles. See Gladiator. Enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, but the rest?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Russell Crowe is fantastic as Maximus in both physique and temperament. As a man of honor who valued the simple things but who could back them up with his sword, Maximus is a character worth sitting nearly three hours in a theatre for, and Crowe brings Maximus to life in ways that makes me wonder if Russell is "acting" at all. Connie Nielson is also well cast as Lucilla. A real beauty, (think Sharon Stone), her scenes with Maximus are first rate. The other cast members did a good job as well. I would point out the boy who played Lucius only to say that he is a far better child actor than the one who played Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace. As for Joaquin Phoenix, I wanted him to be more "psycho," in that while he succeeded in making Commodus disturbing, I found myself laughing at him more than I was scared of him. There were times when I simply wanted to tell Commodus to go to his room, and I would've done it without fear of reprisals, but I'm not sure if that's Phoenix's fault so much as it's the script's.The costumes are wonderful!!! Especially Lucilla's outfits, and her jewelry and makeup are perfect as well. The battle gear and gore make-up are also well done.Visual effects-wise, the inside of the Colosseum is great, but the rest of Rome seems so fake. While breathtaking, it is obviously computer generated. As for the battle/action scenes, they seem rushed and choppy. The opening scene for example, both visually and audially (esp. the arrows) reminds me of Star Wars for some reason, but I digress. The first half of the battle is well done, showing the sheer numbers on both sides and the strategic planning involved. However, the second half is annoying in the way in which it's shot. It doesn't live up to any of the Braveheart battle scenes that people seem to want to compare them to at all. The rest of the action scenes seem to follow the same pattern--great general set-up, horrible follow through. The lighting however was well done in terms of when and how it was used to fit the theme of the movie.While obviously leaning on the action scenes with its epic proportions and gory grandeur to draw in and "entertain" the movie-going audience, the movie would have been better off focusing on the more intimate and human interest side of the story.

On the accuracy side the film gives a very accurate depiction of the colliseum but the other shots of Rome in the background are fanciful to say the least.The first gladiatorial sequence gives a real feel for the total lack of value placed on human life by the Romans however I don't think the true horror of the collisseum comes through in this picture. The typical day at the colliseum was split in three with the first part of the day belonging to the beast hunts. Where up to a hundred lions, bears, bulls elephants etc would be made to fight each other and teams of besterai(beast fighters) also convicted criminals and slaves would be lead into the ring in chains, the chains would be removed and the person striped naked and forced to meet the lions etc by poding with red hot branding irons often the people would be hung from different types of contraptions to make it more difficult for the animals to get a clean kill. Death by a lion was considered a clean kill as the animal would kill its victim in short order, smaller carnivores where often used and the victim would be hardly recognisable as a human before the death blow was finally administered by the staff to enable the later shows to continue. Midday brought out the slightly more favoured criminals who where made to fight each other to the death the winner staying on until he meet his death. Once again the application of branding irons to reluctant victims ensure entertainment for the masses. The afternoon brought the Gladiatorial fights as depicted in the movie. The bodies of the victims where branded to ensure death. If any life was left a blow was applied to the cranium to finish the job, a hook was then stuck in the carcasses gut and a horse was used to drag out the body and was thrown into large pits near the colliseum kept for such purposes.I am not sure that this sort of horror could be depicted in a modern movie as not only would it be censored but it is so outrageous that a modern audience would think it lacked credulity. Commodus also as depicted in the movie was a more loveable character than the one described in the histories of the times but yet again his depravities would not suit the censors.All in all great entertainment though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The history of the Roman Empire is rich territory for storytellers. Shakespeare mined it for four of his tragedies, one of which, TITUS ANDRONICUS, was recently filmed by Julie Taymore. I, CLAUDIUS was filmed two decades ago, and became a modern television classic. After seeing GLADIATOR, however, you won't be left with a sense that you've seen a great tale told well ? You will sense a fraud: screenwriters who borrow wholesale from Shakespeare and Graves and the BBC in an effort to transform their popcorn tale into something more authentic and gripping. But sadly, nothing can make this sow's ear into a silk purse.Russell Crowe plays Maximus, an honest, brave Roman general. Having led the Romans to victory over Germanic tribes, he is informed by Marcus Aurelius, the dying emperor, that he is tapped for succession over Aurelius's devious and cowardly son, Commodus. Long story short ? Maximus is betrayed and ends up a slave to Proximo, a self-proclaimed "entertainer" who serves up his slaves as meat for gladiators to slaughter before eager audiences. Maximus winds his way to Rome for the inevitable confrontation with Commodus.There is much pontificating in GLADIATOR. We are berated with speeches condemning mob mentalities, the appetite for violent entertainments, corruption. At the same time, however, GLADIATOR's appeal lies not in its characters (they're two dimensional) or their moral quandaries (there are none) ? GLADIATOR's appeal lies in violence. As a result, GLADIATOR is another of Hollywood's cynical entertainments. Like TERMINATOR 2, it lets us know that violence-as-entertainment is repulsive and evidence that we, as a race, haven't escaped our animal natures ? and then immediately dishes up lots of violence-as-entertainment.Frankly, you sense the suits at DreamWorks and Universal eager to collect the box office from a well-made bloodbath movie, but also need to layer on some PC rhetoric to make it more pallatable to the audience. Cynical.Russell Crowe is excellent. Derek Jacobi is excellent as well, although you have to wonder what the hell he's doing in this movie ? he's already given us an indelible portrayal of Claudius, and appearing in this little blockbuster simply seems sad. Joaquin Phoenix is fine as Commodus. Connie Nielsen cries well as Lucilla. The late Oliver Reed is excellent as the slave owner/entertainer, Proximo.If Hollywood wants to make a good film about a Roman general, it should take a look at Shakespeare's CORIOLANUS ? even if it's not the stuff of summer blockbusters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've seen any of the old Roman Empire movies, then you won't see anything too original here. At times you can almost predict what's going to happen next. The battle scenes were exciting, but I guess it's now a cinema law that you have to incorporate the sped up Saving Private Ryan style. Good acting. Nice touches here and there. But the end is a little bit of a let down. (SPOILER ALERT) Here this guy is up against incredible odds. You figure he'll have to have a huge war with the Roman army. But oh no. This movie takes the easy way out by saying "O.K. To win, all you have to do is beat this guy in battle". This kind of easy out is the only problem I had with "Rob Roy". Side note: Gladiator's T.V. spots were incredibly lame. I almost didn't want to go see it after watching the spots. Comparing football and hockey players to the Gladiators, all to a rock song. It was really weak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>EPIC for the New Millinium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a new millinium homage to the classic ancient roman epics of the 50'&amp; 60's.It mostly resembles "The Fall of the Roman Empire" ,with Stephen Boyd, Sophia Loren,Sir Alec Guiness, and Christopher Plummer,in plot and period.It also recalls theme elements of "Ben Hur" and battle scenes akin to "Spartacus". Ridley Scott's production gives a "What Dreams May Come/Bladerunner" visual monumentality to the sets that surpass classic italian films of this genre. The romantic soundtrack has echos of Wagner's "Ring" and Prokofiev's "Lt.Kije"and underscore the intense drama.This film will stand more than one viewing and will entertain visually and emotionally from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A MOVIE'S MOVIE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And that's not a comment I throw around lightly. This ain't no stinkin' summer action flick folks. On the surface, it may seem all action action action, but really, thanks to the furious pace of the cinematography, the action (and gore) isn't centered upon at all. That's not the point. If you find yourself wanting to see it all more, you're no better than the mob in the Colliseum. THAT'S THE POINT OF GLADIATOR.Having followed Russell Crowe's career for some time, having seen him in interviews, and now, having seen him in Gladiator, I realize no one else could play Maximus because Russell Crowe IS Maximus. It's that simple. Gladiator in its early stages very much resembles his career up until this point, and in his dialogues (some of which Russell is said to have written himself) Russell is letting himself exist up on the screen under the pseudonym of "Maximus". Ridley Scott is known for taking massive images and then telling intimate portraits. While Russell's is a piece of the intimate portrait, the massive image of Gladiator is the Roman world paralleled as our own entertainment (not just sport)-centered way of life. The world Scott shows is dark, Rome a shadow of what it once was. His use of light is reserved for places where the ideal and metaphorical are able to peek through the canopy of the real: home, Elysium, forelighting, etc.. And indeed, light is rare, just as in the world Scott creates. But mind you, watch the characters for this as well: Lucilla and Lucius, what's the Latin root of these names? ;)In all, this is my ideal movie, going beyond what I could have ever expected coming in, knowing Russell Crowe, Ridley Scott, Hans Zimmer, and DreamWorks were all attached. The subtle commentary Gladiator offers on the experience of viewing the movie itself is on the same level as that of L.A. Confidential. That is the qualification that makes a well-executed movie go from a 10 to an 11 in my books.Light and Dark. Life and Death. Strength and Honor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action movie, yet very disconcerting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is good and bad at the same time. I came out of the movie with very mixed feelings. To start off with the good points and not repeat what others have said, the battle/arena sequences were very exciting. The script is not original, but there were enough twists and turns to make an otherwise formulaic movie interesting. The acting was also very good. Connie Nielson was just excellent. Joaquine Phoenix was perfect for the part. And Russel Crowe shined through out the film. In short, this is a great action movie. Some might not like the ending, but to me, it was very unexpected and very out of the conventional Hollywood way.However, if you look at the film in terms of its appeal and content, the movie is very disconcerting. I would imagine that most people are attracted to this film by its Roman glory. But imagine 2000 years after the Romans, we still want to be entertained by the spill of blood and excessive violence. We thought of Romans as barbaric and ourselves as enlightened, yet many will flood to this movie to watch people's heads get chopped off. This movie is simply a new trend of Hollywood movies (such as Legend of the Fall, Saving Private Ryan, the Thin Red Line, Braveheart, and the upcoming the Patriot)that is designed to feed off the audience's hunger for violence. This film will do great at the box office, but what does that reflect about our society?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>yes! This movie lives up to it`s name!! You almost feel like your a Roman spectator at the coliseum watching the games!! The costumes and scenery seem very realistic to that time in history. And the battle scene at the beginning of the movie is one of the best battle scenes i`ve ever seen, in fact it might be better than the battle scenes in braveheart, it`s very very close!! the acting is good, and this movie should win atleast one award. The only thing that might keep this movie from winning best picture is all the gore. So if you have a weak stomach don`t watch this movie, but if your into this type of action i highly recommend it. rating (best of 5 stars).....4.....</fullReview>

The kind of film that gets you caught up in the story, and has you rooting, cheering and clapping at the climax of the movie. This wasn't it. The story never drew me in, or gave me a reason to care what happened. I think Russell Crowe is a talented actor, but not in this... His acting consisted of variations on looking stern or solemn, with maybe three smiles thrown in to show his range. As for this moviegoer, I'd rather watch an old Steve Reeves movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film to start the summer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first of the summer blockbusters finally arrives, and if it is any indication of what the summer will be like, this will be a great year for movies.Gladiator tracks the career of a Roman general named Maximus (Russell Crowe), who falls from grace after Emperor Marcus Aurelius dies and is succeeded by his son, Commodus. Maximus finds himself in the arena fighting as a gladiator, trying to gain revenge for the murder of his family.Ridley Scott's direction is simply inspired, and he is able to bring stellar performances out of his actors. Further, the art direction and computer imaging brings the ancient Roman world to life more vividly than any film before it.Perhaps one truly great trick that Ridley Scott pulls out of his book is to turn the theatre audience into Romans. I personally found myself excited as the blood spilled onto the floor in the arena, much to my horror (I have always considered myself peaceful and civilized). One comes out of the theatre with a sense that perhaps one isn't quite as far from the brutality of the past as we all would hope.If I have any complaint, it is that some of the combat scenes move too fast and have too much going on. The end result is that the viewer doesn't quite know what is happening. Perhaps the clarity of the battles in Braveheart would have been more helpful here.So, the final score: 4.5/5. Definitely worth going to see.</fullReview>

I made a great choice. I read the review in the paper that only gave it two stars...two stars? It said that the movie lacked character development and dialogue....rubbish! That was all it was...Russel Crowe put so much character into his role Maximus, that you knew him by the end like a friend. The scenes are eye candy to watch and the action scenes of course are dazzling and well choreographed. It has been a long time since I have seen a movie that has had this much of an impact on me.

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this film! This film was filled with pleasant surprises: from the grand cinematography, action, gore, special effects, to the plot itself, and the great support cast, including Derek Jacobi and Richard Harris. As a historian, there were a few minor things I could quibble about, such as some of the armour used was clearly from a later period, such as that used in the Crusades, and even spied a Viking Helmet from the era of Canute. That and the prescence of a Sinaloan Milksnake(indigenous to the western hemisphere), crawling in bed with someone.....a presumed victim of a harmless snake...The only other criticism was that to make the evil Commodus even more despicable, they had to throw in an implied incest scene to villify him more. But still, Commodus was never as vile and clearly insane as Gaius Caligula.I also liked it when the emperor was telling stories about Claudius...who was played so effectively in the series "I Claudius" by Derek Jacobi....who did a nice job playing a senator in this film.Otherwise, I thought it was a fantastic film, and I plan to go back and see it again!</fullReview>

The opening combat sequence is glorious for it's use of speeded up photography, perfectly capturing the mind numbing intensity such a battle experience must have been! And the implements of war you see on the screen are worth the price of admission alone. By it's end I felt I'd fought in the battle personally.Russell Crowe is superb as Maximus, and to my estimation played a better epic hero than Charlton Heston ever did. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the Emperor Commodus is somewhat lacking in range, but, I am not sure whether it is his fault, or the fault of the script. I tend to suspect the script, because I enjoyed his performance overall.Connie Nielsen ruled the screen as Lucilla, a part demanding incredible moments of subtlety, which the lady accomplished with aplomb. Oliver Reed, to our enormous good fortune, left us one last character, leaving out no detail with his wide range of skills.There are drawbacks, but talking about those reveals the heart of the movie. Suffice it to say that Gladiator will give you as good as you expect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to see Gladiator on opening day, I new it would be action packed, but I was a little aprehensive about the story. After just and hour of the movie, I was blown away. This movie has an excellent story backed by a superb cast, and the fights are breathtaking. My advice is to see the movie as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tears welled up in my eyes. I don't want to give away the ending, for those who haven't seen it yet, but this was a great movie in so many ways. Action, camaraderie, bravery, love for family and friends, treachery and everything you can think of in one sprawling adventure movie that should catapult Russell Crowe into a career that will span decades to come.Star-studded with Richard Harris, Derek Jacoby, the late Oliver Reed in a very good final performance, David Hemmings and many familiar faces such as Sven Ole Thorson, Rolf Moeller, and Connie Nielsen who has starred in Soldier and the recent hit Mission to Mars.The movie is around 2.5 hours long but I could not bear to leave my seat for any reason and I am so glad I didn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not the worlds best film, but a great movie, if you follow me.Gladiator is pretty to look at, exciting to watch, and manipulates the viewer in a way that is entertaining and not offensive, generating the appropriate emotional responses at the appropriate times.The characters have little depth, but the characters in a movie such as this aren't supposed to have depth. They are supposed to be good, or bad, and while some can change sides, it really doesn't have to be all that explicable. I expected a grand, bloody soap opera, and Gladiator delivered admirably. I'll see it again on the big screen just to soak up more, I think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stunning and Amazing Film That Will Move Your Soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this movie and having only the preview to rely on, I honestly believed that although it looked entertaining and full of action, Gladiator would be mediocre - another over-hyped, blood-and-guts film that would be way too long.After just watching it however, I am completely humbled. This film is amazing. Everything about it, from the cinematography, to the costumes, the special effects, the score (I am in love with the score!), and even the acting, was outstanding. You know a movie is really good when it is three hours long and you hardly even notice it from all the mind-blowing action and gorgeous scenery on screen. The story itself is also well-done, but I will save all the details for your own visit to the theatre, which I definitely recommend (and find the one with the biggest screen and best sound system possible!). It does contain a lot of violence and "gore", but if you can handle it you will appreciate everything else the movie has to offer.Not only does Gladiator instill an awe-inspiring sense of wonder and appreciation for history by capturing all the splendour, grandeur, and political complexity of Ancient Rome near the end of its empirical might, but it also has embedded within its story that eternal theme of peace and serenity for which every soul searches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been waiting a long time to see Gladiator, having first seen the trailer for the film way back in December when I went to see Galaxy Quest. I must say that the wait was worth it. Comparisons have been made between this film and the earlier Roman Epics such as Spartacus and The Fall of the Roman Empire, but I think, all in all, this film holds it own. From the opening sequence with Russell Crowe remembering what it is like to walk in the wheat fields of his home to the final shots of the Collesium right before the final credits roll, this film was breathtaking. I have always liked movies like Ben Hur, and seeing a modern version of one of these fine films goes to show that sometimes a return to the old days of timeless epics would be good for Hollywood. Special effects pay a big part in the movie, and they have taken the place of elaborate sets that Hollywood once created. In fairness, the cost of making a film like Ben Hur or Cleopatra by today's standards would be astronomical. It would make the reported budgets of Titanic or Waterworld pale by comparison. If you need a computer to do what craftsmen once did, so be it. It is about the film, after all, more so than the sets. As long as they look believable. On a sad note, this was Oliver Reed's last film. I think he did a splendid job and only wish he could have been around to see the finished project. I am sure he would have been proud. I highly recommend this film to one and all, both as a glimpse into what life was like back then and as a return to a grand style of film-making.Hail, Caesar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The work of mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was disappointed. I did not have high expectation, but I was taken in by the word of mouth that alleges Gladiator is a great epic akin to Ben-Hur. Sorry, but Gladiator fails to beat Ben-Hur by the distance. In fact, Ben-Hur is marginally better than Gladiator. There are problems with this film. The cinematography, however beautiful and majestic in some scenes, is murky and at times irritating -- especially the sped-up method used for chaotic effect that left me cold even in the midst of carnage (hasn't this been done already in Saving Private Ryan?). There's a lack of focused direction by Ridley Scott -- the result is too many scenes that droll on and on. I felt no empathy for the cast's stilted performance of the characters throughout the film. The editing is confounding in the heat of the major war battle and gladiator duels. Even a good performance by Russell Crowe can't save this film from being doomed to failure.I despise the flashbacks. It's the cliche that has been done to death. That's the most irritating part of the film besides that annoying and insipid young actress girl. Right in the beginning of the film after the prologue, with the main character's hand weaving through the wheat field, I knew Chuck Rudolph was right when he murmured: "Malick be damned". (For those who don't get the quote -- it's a sarcastic reference to Terrence Malick's 1978 Mid-Western classic "Days of Heaven")Although technically impressive, the movie fails to engage me in the story I find meandering and tedious. Though I wasn't bothered by gore, I find the audience's positive response to blood and carnage cynical and despicable, especially after the fact Dreamworks/Universal showed the TV spot comparing Gladiator-esque violence favorably to football and hockey.It's not a terrible movie, but it's certainly not great as the majority of the moviegoers seem to believe. Gladiator is as mediocre as Braveheart, and that's the only compliment I have for this film. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Discontented</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd been looking forward to seeing Gladiator, since reviewers have hailed it as a revival of the Roman epic. Frankly, I don't see what the fuss is about. The story failed to engage me and was altogether silly with its blend of historical figures and obviously fictional events. What's more, the screenwriters seemed intent on having the characters attempt to solve their problems and dilemmas through the most convoluted means imaginable. Russell Crowe's character was distant and broody for much of the film, but suddenly and inexplicably developed a sense of humor midway. Nevertheless, the movie could have been enjoyable as pure spectacle, but I found it disappointing even in this regard. Unlike other viewers, I felt that much of the scenery had an obvious computer-generated quality (crowds out of focus, blurry backgrounds). When I imagine gladiators in combat, I picture them in the coliseum under a blistering sun. Most of the photography however, had a dull, murky quality to it. My biggest complaint concerns the hyper-editing &amp; camera style used for most of the fight sequences. Indeed, it was so hyper that half the time I couldn't tell who was killing who (perhaps it didn't matter?). The Gladiator isn't awful, but it's not particularly memorable either. You may want to see it to satisfy your curiosity, but not if you're concerned with getting value for your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott has become my favorite movie maker. Once again he has taken me to another time and another place. Although this movie does not have the soul of Blade Runner or the suspense of Alien, it is a visual masterpiece. For over two hours I was transported into the ancient world. What makes this movie great is the acting and the world according to Scott. The acting of the film veterans is just great and it holds this whole movie together. Then you have Russell Crowe who is again a presence that grabs you every time you see him. I would have followed him into battle and died for him. Bottom line is, really really great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lots of very exciting action. Generally good story line until the total collapse at the end. And I thought only the French did not know how to finish a movie! Forget about the end and you're on. General is victorious ... betrayed by jealous heir to Caesar ... escapes death ... somehow winds up a gladiator (super gladiator) ... goes to Rome... drives his betrayer (new Caesar) crazy ... wins big at killing and becomes a superstar ... new Caesar's sister betrays Caesar for gladiator (sounds real to me!) ... from here the story line goes south. Basically this is a revenge story with terrific action and some stars that make the movie fun. Russell Crowe, as Maximus the gladiator, is a terrific presence on screen. His only weak lines were with Caesar Senior (Richard Harris who looks like he has just about recovered from the beating in "The Unforgiven") when he is describing his home. Crowe just could not do those lines. No one could do those lines! Elsewhere, Crowe is the gladiator! What a killer! Crowe looks perfect in this rugged, physical role and he has a very good voice. Joaquin Phoenix as Caesar Junior is fantastic as a disgusting figure. He was nervously sexual around his sister, played by Connie Nielsen. He definitely convinced me that he was unstable. Nielsen is a real beauty and gave a strong performance - where has she been? Oliver Reed was pretty good as the master of the gladiators. This part lacked consistent definition. I think that Reed needed to be cruel and money driven from start to finish. What other kind of person could run a gladiator slave operation?The scenery, clothing, and hardware are outstanding.Flaws and all, I liked the movie because the good parts and good scenes carry the imagination along quite well. Most of the acting worked and Russell Crowe is truly powerful on the screen. He moves so well and just looks believable. See it!</fullReview>

I mean, did anyone really care at the end whether the Republic was restored or not? Also, why is it that Maximus can brutally kill anyone he meets - until they take their masks off?I'm sure that most folks also won't miss the irony of us *watching* folks watching the combat in the Colosseum. In seeing this movie, attendees are just as voracious and vicious voyeurs as the mob in the stadium. After all, why go attend the beheading in the public square when you can get a better seat at the movie theater? If you see it, listen to the chuckles and cheers from your fellow movie-goers -- it's in the theater, not the soundtrack.Ultimately, this is a "summer blockbuster." That is, a formulaic bread &amp; circus for a violence-starved, thrill-seeking hoi polloi. You won't have to think, at least not about anything that matters. Just check your brain at the door. It's still an absorbing film for its acting performances, pace and beautiful art direction. But at least in Braveheart, Wallace died for something truly larger than himself ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...But who cares!!! In my opinion this film is far better than the hyper-realistic Titanic, which seemed rather sterile. Here we have a fictitious scenario based on real characters. Marcus Aurelius, philosopher-emperor, who is remembered as a _philosopher_ (something he was concerned about in the film!!). Commodus, the insane megalomaniac, who in *real life* fought in the Colosseum against lions and also other gladiators, thought he was a reincarnation of Hercules, and tried to rename Rome "Commodiana"! .... Maximus is not a real character, neither are the events depicted in the film. But it is a great story.Highlights:-Seeing a CGI Rome in all its glory was awe-inspiring!-Battle against Germanic tribes: exciting *and* quite realistic!!-Commodus, the insecure madman (not mad enough, though) was my favourite character. Nice white armour!-The "Middle Period" of Roman history is so little-seen on the big screen - nice to see Hollywood get away from the usual Early Roman Empire/Caesar period.-Proximo was also cool.Bad points:-As a student of history, I can't help but notice things were a *leetle* bit off reality. Saxon and Islamic helmets in a Roman amphitheatre??! Who is Maximus??? (But as I said, I don't mind).-Combat was bloody and exciting, but Ridley's cinematics were a little choppy.-Script was lame in parts. How about cool dialogue like Spartacus and I, Claudius?? Also, not enough swearing for *real* Romans...But overall, a grand experience. For once a big budget film has good acting, good storyline, and the most realistic ancient battle seen on celluloid! Up the Marcomanni!!!PS. An earlier reviewer claimed the Romans had no glass. Well, in short, they _did_. It's just that Hollywood doesn't normally depict it.</fullReview>

Oliver Reed was fantastic - better than what I thought he would be. This film is very gory. Lots of blood and guts, heads rolling and sides splitting. Not for the faint hearted. Probably the same goriness as 'Braveheart'. Crowe has clearly shown he can play a broad range of roles, this film, clearly his best. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott has certainly banished the demons of White Squall and GI Jane with this fantastic offering. Crowe is superb as the determined Maximus, but he is matched by fight choreography and the rich CG visuals of Rome at its height. The opening battle sequence betters anything in Braveheart, although the slow motion was overused. The standout feature of the film was the depiction of Rome; from the streets, to the emperial palace to the Colloseum. It equalls anything presented in Bladerunner or one of Lucas' offerings (with the use of CG birds being on a par with the Ewoks)This is the film of the year. It does not deserve the tag "event film" as it is not a shody piece of work held together by some shiny computer code but a heart-pumping, sword-swinging, sweat and blood soaked masterpiece with superb visuals, intellegent script and flawless performances from the leads.see it, then put aside another 3 hours to see it again</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw the preview for Gladiator I thought that it would be nothing more than an excellent summer action film in the vein of Men In Black or Die Hard or something like that. But after seeing this movie I realized I was completely wrong. This movie is near-epic. It's actually smart. The directing is nearly flawless and the dialogue is amazing too. I just can't believe this is the same guy who did "1492". That is amazing. Scott uses some excellent time-lapse photography and surreal dream shots that seem out of place for a time but in the end fit right into place. The action sequences just add to the film. Scott puts you right into the battle at the beginning as well as in the Roman Coliseum for the gladiator fights. The characters are rich and colorful and the ending is incredible. I would compare it to Braveheart and also add that it is almost as perfect. See this movie. It will be the best of the summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised opening night at my local cinemas only attracted 50 or so people to the 9pm screening, but I never use that to guage anything.Visually the film is awe inspiring, with a visual feast that never lets up. In some earlier scenes gore was cut down (to receive its M15 rating here in Australia no doubt) with fast film cuts and close down action. Still, it managed to put the action scenes in Braveheart to shame.

		<shortDescription>Incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw the preview for Gladiator I thought that it would be nothing more than an excellent summer action film in the vein of Men In Black or Die Hard or something like that. But after seeing this movie I realized I was completely wrong. This movie is near-epic. It's actually smart. The directing is nearly flawless and the dialogue is amazing too. I just can't believe this is the same guy who did "1492". That is amazing. Scott uses some excellent time-lapse photography and surreal dream shots that seem out of place for a time but in the end fit right into place. The action sequences just add to the film. Scott puts you right into the battle at the beginning as well as in the Roman Coliseum for the gladiator fights. The characters are rich and colorful and the ending is incredible. I would compare it to Braveheart and also add that it is almost as perfect. See this movie. It will be the best of the summer.</fullReview>

In some earlier scenes gore was cut down (to receive its M15 rating here in Australia no doubt) with fast film cuts and close down action. Still, it managed to put the action scenes in Braveheart to shame.

		<fullReview>Gladiator is an entertaining enough way to spend almost three hours, but it never manages to achieve the level of greatness that it so desperately aspires to. Russell Crowe as always adds a sure hand with his fine acting, but I felt the action scenes were a bit stagy.Joaquin Phoenix never convinced me he was a man corrupted by ambition. It WAS nice though to see veteran actors Richard Harris and the late Oliver Reed on the screen again.All in all, a movie worth seeing, but don't expect greatness.</fullReview>

He just seemed too content with being a Gladiator, and he never experiences any fear.The ending for me seemed like a bit of an anti-climax.Gladiator is definitrly very entertaining,but just don't get your hopes up too much.</fullReview>

Everything is depicted accurately, and seeing the Colosseum in its full visual splendor will knock your eyes out.

		<fullReview>Gladiator is one of those films that grabs you from the first moment until the last. There are no real points that seem to drag on, as many movies of this length (2:45) seem to contain. Russell Crowe is superb in his portrayal of a Roman fighter and gladiator. The film using nice camera work and interesting imagery for transitions from scene to scene. And the set of Rome itself was nice. I didn't like how dark (not evil-dark, just plain dark) it was many times, making it hard to see. And the theater I saw it in had a bad sound system, so it didn't sound very good. But it was a free advanced screening, so hey, who's complaining =)SPOILERThe only thing I really didn't care for was the handling of the ending. The way Maximus finished off Caesar was not very exciting. Final confrontations in action movies should be more...actiony.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Russell Crowe's day has come and Gladiator is his vehicle. The world got a glimpse of the bad-a** he can be in LA Confidential, but it really takes this heady epic from Ridley Scott to wipe away any dog-eared sentiment left over from the Insider. You can just imagine Mel Gibson sitting at home and wondering "why didn't my agent send me this script?" Well the new boy is in town, and despite the fact a sword still looks like a darn heavy piece of metal in his hands, Crowe shines in this great new film from Scott. The recreation of ancient Rome is astonishingly beautiful and realistic. And although the film indulges a bit too much in stylistic editing (hey fellas just stick the camera on a tripod so we can watch this amazing action), I must say the gladiator scenes are wonderfully paced, exciting and thrilling. After seeing Ben Hur a number of times on television, it's easy to walk into this picture with a few misconceptions. Namely, a bunch of men in armor in chariot battles is about as lively as a tennis match. Well, after seeing this picture, I wouldn't be surprised if someone had the audacity to revive Gladiator sports - chain mail, chariots and all. The battle scenes in this film, simply rock. And to top it off, the film has a great story, an identifiable hero and guess what - a female lead that isn't just scenery in a major pump-up-the-testosterone movie. This is a must see. Thanks for bringing me back to Rome. This ain't your latte sipping Italy here. Hold on to your seats, this is one HELL of a ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Russel Crowe is such an amazing actor! I have seen Russel Crowe in several movies, from Romper Stomper to LA Confidential and the Insider, and he has been great in all of them. I still believe he deserved an oscar for his performance in the Insider. He carries this film, Gladiator, from beginning to end. Staring into Russel Crowe's eyes, you can see true emotions and sufferings of a tragic hero. His presence is tremendous. Without him this film could not have worked. In fact, when he is not on the screen, the film seems to drag a bit. The plot is very thin and some parts are not very believable, especially the ending. Overall a well-made film, but could have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first blockbuster of the summer will most likely be the best (not highest grossing, just best in overall quality). I have been anticipating this movie since last fall when I found out about it. Ridley Scott brings back this era/genre with a great story, score, actors, and scenery. Russell Crowe has shown he can be an A-list actor. I wasn't sure what to expect, I just knew it would be a great movie. And it was! The only thing I was unhappy about was some of the camera angles used during the fight scenes. They seemed choppy. Scott did a great job of dealing with Oliver Reed's death before the film was finished. You can not tell what is dubbed or another actor. Go see this film! The bar is set high for all other "summer" movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ancient Rome lives again, supercool Crowe in this summer's certain Smash-hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" certainly is one of the very few movies this year everybody's been waiting for. And the waiting was sure worth it. In short, "Gladiator" gives you everything you might expect from it. It does not deliver less, neither does it deliver more: Half-hearted attempts to put more weight on the political issues of the Roman Empire don't work very well, and comments on the decadence that led the Empire into its destruction seem too much put on. These things only speed down a plot that is so action-packed, it would have satisfied the audience without that much thought-provoking stuff.In fact, it will make the audience cheer and yell for more, just like a long time ago in the Colosseum. Ridley Scott delivers visual images that are so intense and powerful, so detailled and simply HUGE, you feel like they were made for battlefield paintings the size of the Empire State Building (horizontal, that is). But the most unforgettable thing about "Gladiator" is Russell Crowe. His performance is simply beyond human. When Crowe stands in the dusty arena of Rome's Colosseum, making his already legendary revenge oath, you are simply blown away by his tremendous charisma. A look into his eyes, and you think that the concept of honor was not invented for him, but by him. After you have seen "Gladiator" you will certainly know what ancient Rome looked like (especially when it was Partytime in the Colosseum). You will not understand Rome's political situation, for the movie gives wrong facts (intendedly) and just doesn't work in this direction. But hey, nobody wants politics in this movie, anyway. It rocks, you will enjoy it, and you will yell for more. A Gladiator's work: Give the audience what it wants to see. They will love you for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Roman Empire Strikes Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films like Titanic, The Mask of Zorro, Saving Private Ryan have re-introduced classic genres to new (young) audiences. Gladiator breaths new life into genre we know as 'Roman epic'.Like other great Roman-history films, Ben-Hur (1959), Spartacus (1960) and the Fall of the Roman Empire (1964) is Gladiator a feast for the eyes of moviegoers. Who better could direct this film than Ridley Scot; a former commercial-director. He had made a number of epic, visually mind-blowing films before; Alien (1979), Blade Runner (1982), Legend (1985), Thelma &amp; Louise (1991) and 1492:Conquest of Paradise (1992) I have to say that in some of his films the actual story gets pushed to the background at times. Blade Runner's storyline was totally inferior to the visual aspects. Scott isn't the only director who tends to 'visualize' his films in that way. Michael Mann is also known as a maker of great visual epics like Last of the Mohicans, The Keep and Heat.Gladiator offers a variation of entertainment; a love story, costume drama and "R" rated violence. Body halvings, decapitations, unhandings and impalements are the types of gore you can expect Gladiator. The cast is outstanding, except Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. Phoenix has been miscast. The talented Russel Crowe is a strong impressive lead. Like his other good roles, in the Insider and Romper Stomper, he gives a superb performance. The same goes the late Oliver Reed. He died during the final shootings last year. A body double, with Reed's digital simulated face, completed the film.OK, enough already; Stop reading this stuff and just go see this movie for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely stunning; an instant classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is a film that will be remembered for a long time. A four-star masterpiece and an instant classic, the film will not only solidify Russell Crowe as one of the best actors of his generation, it should also reacquaint the world with the sometimes unfortunately forgotten genius of Ridley Scott.The film follows Crowe as a Roman general named Maximus; a man feared by his enemies and revered by his men. Gladiator opens with a crawl reminding the audience of the might of ancient Rome, and the breadth of its power -- at one time, "one quarter of the world lived and died" under the rule of the Caesars. The picture begins with the last battle between Rome and the "barbarians" in then-Germania -- a stunning sequence which not only sets the tone for the dazzling spectacle the movie becomes, but also shows the viewer how exactly skilled the Romans were in the art of war. Without revealing too much of the plot, a new emperor (an amazing Joaquin Phoenix) takes power, and Maximus is sent into slavery. As a slave he soon becomes a gladiator -- as was the practice under some of the Caesars, and his skill on the battlefield translates well to the arena. Soon thousands flock to the Coliseum -- flawlessly created with the help of computer-generated shots -- to see Maximus fight. By winning the crowd, Maxiumus hopes to get a chance to seek his revenge on Commodus, the unjust ruler who ruined his life. The film is stunning in every respect -- from acting, to action, to direction, to set design, and should become an instant classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible Roman gladiator epic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and the best film of 2000 thus far. Ridley Scott brings us the story of Maximus, fallen General of Rome and unwilling slave and gladiator. He fights because he must and for vengeance on those who betrayed him. I am so glad Hollywood is giving us these epic tales this summer (can't wait for THE PATRIOT in June) instead of the usual FX bonanzas. Here, the FX are used to bring ancient Rome to life with astounding quality and scope, great job by Mill Film. The cast is great (most likely Crowe's star-making turn) with Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou, and Richard Harris. R.I.P. Oliver Reed, you were great in this one. An awe-inspiring score by Hans Zimmer with the help of Lisa Gerrard. If you know the score from THE INSIDER, you'll recognize her great work here. A great theme for the Battle of Germania early on. That in itself is a sight to behold. See this film and love it for it's grand scale, it's superior performances, it's action, bravado and intensity, and the sheer joy of seeing one of the best films you'll view this year. Hopefully, Oscar will recognize GLADIATOR's brilliance come next March. A hero has indeed risen. My grade: a 95 on The BiggieScale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bold and Brutal: Gladiator shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's new film Gladiator is an excellent film, featuring excellent acting (especially from Crowe), great direction, awesome visuals, and gruesome battle sequences. The story is that of General Maximus (Crowe) and his fall from general to slave to gladiator. The story is solid, with only a few mistakes that can be overlooked. However, Gladiator really shines with its visuals and action sequences - which are fast and furious. Ridley Scott returns to top form here - I believe this film is on par with his best effort Blade Runner. There's something here for everyone - visuals, action, politics, great score. Go see this movie on the big screen please. Don't wait for video with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it's safe to say that "Gladiator" is far from a disappointment. It'll also satisfy many, particularly fans of the sandle-epics of the '50's and '60s. Be forewarned, however, despite the innately cheesy dialogue and innane plot diversions, "Gladiator" is anything but an old-fashioned technicolor epic. If anything, "Gladiator" moves too far the other way, employing an MTV-generation editing style and visual aesthetic that is dizzying and, moreover, overstated. As well, Scott makes the dreadful mistake of beginning his film with a battle scene that is shot and edited in a fashion identical to the opening scene of "Saving Private Ryan," complete with washed-out colours, varied speeds of motion and muffled sound. If you can look over this, however, you're in for some truly spectacular Gladiator fight scenes in a cinematic mock-up of the Roman Coliseum and 2nd century A.D. Rome. Here, Scott's style shines, in much the same way it did with Blade Runner almost 2 decades previous. Rome's ancient architecture is rendered believably real, with the employment of special effect techniques that seemed frivolous and tiresome in last year's "Star Wars: Episode 1, The Phantom Menace." Strangely enough, the future of the historical epic looks bright. And so does Russell Crowe's career, mind you. He manages to ground the film with his character, even when it seems as if the plot is about to drift off into a cheesy abyss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything an epic battle flick needs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator was constantly brilliant, stunning and never boring. The battle scenes were amazing, Russell Crowe was great as usual, so was Joaquin Phoenix. This was one of the most awesome films ever. And I'm not saying this just because the last battle flick I saw was the anemic 13th Warrior.It was a real epic movie filled with great battle and fast paced storytelling. This is, along with Alien, Ridley Scott's best film.I urge you to go see this film, even if you aren't a fan of the swords and sheilds epics. You'll walk out of it with your jaw dragging on the floor. Easily the best film this year so far, and judging from the quality of films this year, I don't think Gladiator will be surpassed.PLOT: 8 DIRECTION: 10 ACTING: 8 SCRIPT: 8 ART DIRECTION: 10OVERALL: 9</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grand movie that can only be considered as a "must see".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the grand battle at the beginning to the final fight at the end, there are 2 1/2 hours of glamorous screenplay and some of the best acting to be seen this year. Russell Crowe as Maximus, Connie Nielson as Lucilla, Oliver Reed as Proximo, Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, and a host of other supporting actors.And the top actors are needed as this is a screenplay written by a team, and it lacks a unified vision. Small production errors, like Lucilla wearing a bra, detract from the authenticity. Will the audience care? When character arcs reverse without cause, will anyone notice? There is so much action, and even a weepy scene at the end, perhaps they will not care.Well worth seeing for what is good, but not for people with faint hearts. This is an action movie, and the violence is sometimes overwhelming, and the cinematic style taken too far. But worthy of a viewing all the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is worth seeing more than once just to take in the historical detail, the awesome use of CGI to portray a world long gone, and for good performances by Russell Crowe, Richard Harris, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen and the late Oliver Reed. Fans of battle scenes and history should flock to see the nice illusion of authenticity that director Ridley Scott weaves here, which promises to bring back the golden days of the historical epic. It lacks, however, an essential passion that drives each character. On the surface, Russell Crowe seems to have many motivations, revenge for one. He glowers through this entire movie. Yet I did not feel much rage between he and his nemesis, Commodus, as the story dwelled more on the politics between the Senate and the Republic, important historically, but not developed here in terms of a human story that had meaning to the common person or to the characters involved. This is a typical Ridley Scott movie. An impeccable production without a centre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing cinematography and brilliant battles...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott has finally returned to his post as a visually conscious director with his new film, Gladiator. Almost every shot of this film, and some of his other films, such as Blade Runner and Legend, can be cut out and be printed as a postcard. Russell Crowe is well cast as Maximus, a General for the Roman Empire, who is later forced to be a gladiator. Not only does he fight in the ring, but he does his best to oust the Emperor from power to avenge his family's death. The audience is treated to a well written script placed in some of our planet's most beautiful areas. With amazing cinematography, brilliant special effects, blasting DTS sound and suspenseful action, Gladiator is one of Ridley Scott's best films in years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a preview screening of "Gladiator" on April 27, 2000. The costuming, and the various period visuals are outstanding. The computer enhancements to scenes don't detract significantly. All in all they build the appropriate atmosphere, but it is the story that left me wanting for more.You'd be forgiven for thinking that the film is one long battle sequence, as that is what's featured in the commercials and trailers. The battle scenes, however, might be the most successful part of this film.The few intrigues and betrayals are a bit thin for a three hour film, though you would think that the luxury of that much time would offer us the chance to get to know these characters better. It doesn't. The various characters are a bit more than functional of the already mentioned thin plot, betraying what could actually be enthralling personalities to watch. We know that Russell Crowe and the rest of the company are capable of much more.The violence in "Gladiator" is shot with a special shutter to give the action a strobed and washed out look- the same as in "Private Ryan". The first violent scene was highly disorienting, but not in an unpleasant way. After a breathtaking display of ancient weaponry deploying flaming volley after volley into a forest (the catapults are really cool), we see a melee explode from the woods. We are caught in the middle, and it's hard to know whom is doing the fighting and whom is doing the winning. This effectively brings the audience into the battle's confusion and terror. Well done.Further incidents of violence in the film serve only to confuse. The action looked strobed, and while the disturbing clarity let us more clearly see the weaponry &amp; slick moves in action, I found it distracting. While some might complain that the fighting was too glamorized (martial arts moves in a "Sword &amp; Sandal" flick?), I really didn't mind. To the contrary, I found the choreography of the fights somewhat exhilarating.I have doubts about the historical accuracy of the film. While the film is under no obligation to be historically accurate, I don't think that I would've chosen the overwhelmingly Shakespearean style of presentation that this film did.Perhaps more authentic details would have helped make the three hours seem a little more worth it. All in all "Gladiator" is a good mainstream film. It's been a long time since America has seen a historical film of this magnitude, and it won't too much longer before Hollywood gets it right... after all, Rome wasn't built in a day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie! I would see it again if only for the well realized environments. Ridley Scott has done for Rome what he had done for the L.A. of the future in Blade Runner. The battles are intense and sweeping. The arena contests are brutal and well staged. Many nice little cinematic touches.Russell Crowe is again exceptional and believable in this role. He conveys his feelings with a subtlety where there could have been much scenery chewing and gnashing of teeth. He allowed me to care about Maximus. A lesser actor would have been lost in this production, there is so much going on. To be honest there is some heavy melodrama but that would seem to be inherent within this genre. And in spite of some slow and indulgent stretches there is actually some injection of sly humor. Joaquin Phoenix actually humanizes his evil character who is nonetheless in the end, evil.Gladiator is a spectacle, larger than life and this is why we go to movies. Isn't it? See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic tale with great acting, a good script, and superb direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening battle scenes you get a feeling that this is not your average Hollywood blockbuster. This looks and feels like an epic in the true tradition of classics like Spartacus or Ben Hur.This is the story of Maximus (Russell Crowe) a well-respected Roman general who leads from the front, and has a wicked way with a sword.Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) wants Maximus to look after Rome instead of his power-hungry young son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) after his death.But Commodus has other ideas....This film may have cost around $100 million to make but it will undoubtedly double that at the box office.The cast ooze charisma and ability, the sets will take your breath away, and the quick, and often chaotic, direction rarely lets up long enough for you to lose concentration for a second.Perhaps the plot is a little on the unbelievable side, but this is Ancient Rome, a time of legends and heroes, it really does not detract from the film's enjoyment, especially as the script is not at all cliched.The gladiator scenes are spectacular, and Russell Crowe's performance is incredible. He has so much presence that you can almost feel his energy emanating from the screen. This will surely rank him up there with the best actors in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations for this film. In the end, I was somewhat disappointed because the film lacked the action, which it was marketed for. The film is more of a dramatic story than action. Unfortunately, the story is somewhat lacking especially when compared to Braveheart. Another disappointment was the choreography during many of the action sequences. It was very hard to follow and could cause some to have a seizure. The acting performances were there with Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix but in the end the movie was a let-down. However, some of the gladiator battles were outstanding. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crowe is outstanding in this bloody Roman epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the centre of the pic is a solid performance by Russell Crowe, which should finally cement his reputation as one of Hollywood's brightest new stars. He's as tough and mean as he was in LA Confidential with a likeable heroic edge.Director Ridley Scott manages a near return to form. The action scenes are visually impressive, but somewhat messy, but I suppose he'd say he was capturing the chaos of battle.There are numerous panoramic Roman vistas but they're obviously, for the most part, CGI (and are strangely always accompanied by poorly executed flocks of CGI birds). Also, to my eye, it was clear which of Oliver Reed's scenes were re-edited with doubles and/or digital composites.These are minor grumbles though -- for the most part Gladiator is a mean, bloody, sprawling epic. The supporting cast are all great: Connie Nielsen is as alluring as ever, Joaquim Phoenix is a fine baddie (despite being slightly miscast; occasionally struggling with a british accent) and Richard Harris is great in a small role.On the whole the script is strong but, as is often the case with blockbusters, it's unfortunately drowned out by sound effects and, in this case, by a heavy-handed score.My main grumble is the film begins with a Saving Private Ryan style battle sequence, contains numerous large scale action sequences in the interim, but the finale is just a plain-old run-of-the-mill two man swordfight. Yes, it's very exciting but it felt like it needed a grander end fight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I put off watching Gladiator for a long time, because I believed it to be similar to movies like Troy and 300(movies didn't like that much). However, I'm so glad to have finally taken the time to watch this movie.Director Ridley Scott's recreation of ancient Rome is astonishing. The movie makes you feel like you are really in ancient Rome and the Coliseum. The fight scenes are very well choreographed and there is plenty of sword slashing greatness. What makes this movie great though, is it's emotional and intense revenge story. Maximus's fall from great general to slave, and then becoming a gladiator is a great story and the acting from Russell Crowe is top notch.Apart from the excellent story the other things that make this movie fantastic are a masterful soundtrack from Hans Zimmer, as well as a brilliant performance as the evil emperor Commodus by Joaquin Phoenix. Never in a movie have I ever wanted to see the demise of a villain so badly.This is a masterpiece of a movie. I would recommend to everyone. 10/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solidly executed with a good story and the mark of a classic action film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that can be enjoyed in a variety of ways. It can be appreciated for its story, lived intensely through its action scenes, emotionally experienced through the deeply established main characters, or soaked in. It is not a movie that leaves you smiling, but the action scenes can make it kind of fun if you don't care for any kind of stories. The story is very solid with good characters, but you don't need to follow the story to enjoy the fight scenes. The inverse can also be said in that the story can still be enjoyed by those who don't like the action. All three of the main elements of the movie, the execution, action, and story, are spiced up with diversity. The story has politics, emotional conflicts, character personalities, and practical issues introduced to it. This is exemplified by the political issues that arise from Commodus taking the place of his father instead of Maximus: Lucilla being torn between her husband/brother, Maximus, and her son: Maximus keeping his dignity when becoming a slave; and his simple wish to return to his family and farm. The action visits multiple regions with epic battles, guerrilla style raids, one on one combat, and of course gladiator fighting. It is intense, but the shots are fairly quick so the gore does not have an overly painful effect on the audience (think high-speed sword fights over extended torture scenes). The execution has classic feels to it, but is rather ahead of its time for the most part. The cinematography is very good when it displays the battles, Maximus' fantasies of home, and the snake-like workings of Commodus. Plus, the visual quality and lighting is sharp throughout. The delivery of speech has a dramatic tone to it, but is also realistic at most points. The film score is kind of caught in the transition period from Hans Zimmer's current style and the John Williams style that it has in Crimson Tide. As to the characters, the main roles are well played and well developed. Maximus is not what you would call a round character. His main quality is that he is able to gain people's respect in his various roles. Whether he is leading a trained army or the scum of the kingdom, he is able to get people to obey, respect, and treat him with an almost child-like love, looking up to him as a role model. Russel Crowe's acting is good enough to not be criticized, but not good enough to be remarkable (though his delivery of the "My name is Gladiator . . . and I will have my vengeance . . ." quote is very striking). Commodus makes an excellent villain because at heart he is just a whiny little kid that has to have his way. His "am I not merciful" rant is a great summary of his personality. By the time he reaches his demise, he has acted so villainously that it is an indisputable fact that he had it coming to him. Joaquin Phoenix embodies his character quite convincingly, especially in the scene where he is forced to spare Maximus' life despite his own desires. Lucilla plays a strong female character who advocates justice despite its consequences. She kind of gets caught in the middle of everything that happens without a political escape route, but manages to sort of come out on top at the end. The other supporting roles like Juba and Marcus Aurelius add to the story without adding to the confusion of who is who and why did he or she do that. I think Juba's last line of "Now we are free," is a great way to end the movie, because it kind of gives a tangible positive outcome of Maximus' death. The song by Lisa Gerrard that goes with the quote is an excellent piece of music to close out the movie. On a slight side note, I feel that the death of the main character at the end is sort of a sign that a movie is striving to become a classic. The same scenario comes up in Dead Poet's Society, and neither death is implausible or poorly portrayed, but it kind of forces you to take the movie up to that point more seriously. I'm not saying it is bad to include that element, but there are other ways to make a movie a classic and this movie will be one and would be even if Maximus' death had not been included. If you are considering whether Gladiator is worth a watch, I would say that is should satisfy as long as you're a fan of general action. There is more to the movie than the fight scenes, but there are enough of them that anyone who doesn't like action won't enjoy it. As for humorous elements, you'll get more laughs out of a blank sheet of paper (though if you've seen Nacho Libre, there are several moments where you can't resist pulling out a few quotes from the Jack Black wrestling comedy). As stated before the execution and story should satisfy most and is subject to very little criticism. So if you like action and a high-quality watch, set aside an evening or two for this movie. Overall Rating: 8.6/10</fullReview>

Gladiator brings in the factor of being entrain with also giving the audience a stunning look at ancient Rome, as they follow Roman general Maximus played by Russell Crowe, as he gets beaten down and made into a gladiator, then rises up and takes his revenge. Whether it's the moment Maximus dies or when he is talking to Marcus Aurelius each scene brings in an aspect of suspense or grittiness. As each scene unfolds, Ridley Scott is able to capture the emotions of the characters and, the tension each of them are facing. Each fight Maximus has the audience knows it could be his last one and wanting him to fight on. Ridley Scott is able to craft a beautiful motion picture, using the actors' performance, and a stunning sound track to make the movie come alive. The moment Maximus arrives to his villa after almost being exuded, he knew there was something amiss, the music of this scene, brought in the heartbreak and hopelessness to this situation when Maximus discover his entire family was brutally murdered. Then the shear agony Russell Crowe showed really brought me in on how Maximus had lost everything and everyone who he ever loved. This scene shows how the movie is much more than a man fighting in the area as a gladiator but as a man fighting for revenge for his loved ones that can't call out to him anymore. Also Russell Crowe's performance gives the character Maximus a sense of justice with is body statue to compliment it. "Crowe's performance comes from an instinctive mastery of look and gesture and a powerful physical presence." (Desmond Ryan). His battle harden look and motion of how he will restore Rome to its former glory, makes the audience believe in the character as a whole.Alongside Russell Crow's performance, Joaquin Phoenix performance as Commodus, the son of Marcus Aurelius and Empire of Rome, gave a crazy, ruthless, power hungry dictator a new look. Straight from the start of the movie, the audience could see how foolish he was as a person, when he stepped on the battle field. But scene when Commodus kills his father to become empire, Phoenix molded the character as paranoid and driven man who would stop at nothing to achieve his goals. As the film went on Joaquin Phoenix fulfillment of the character, make onlookers how far he is willing to go to stay in power and not have Maximus over throw him. "As played by Mr. Phoenix, Commodus is like a serious version of Dr. Evil, coming on to his sister (Connie Nielsen) while she pines for Maximus in this brazen mix of blood sport." (Elvis Mitchell). The scene when he does not know what to about the senate not approving in the actions he put forth, Phoenix's body language, set of dialog shows the despite and paranoid out looked on this cruel world. The role of a supporting actor or actress is to help push the plot forward, and Joaquin Phoenix does it quite swimmingly.Being able to build a scene up is one of the most important thing a movie needs to do, along with great actors to drive the plot forward, part of building that scene up is the use of an original film score to create a tone. Each time Maximus steps in the coliseum to fight, the music brings in his hopes, desires, of how he is felling. Then when the fighting beginnings the music speeds up allowing the audience feel the same way as the character. "Music is a big factor in helping the illusion of the film come to life. The same way music brings back different periods of our lives." (Francis Ford Coppola) This quote from Coopola tells why music is so important in movies. At the end of the movie when Maximus kills Commodus but then dies from the wound Commodus inflicted him before fight, Maximus starts to lose consciousness he sees the gate to the other world, the world where his wife and child are waiting for him to return. The music sets in bring in the realization to Maximus that he is finally home with his family. The music of this scene drives the emotions of Maximus when finally arrives home to his family after helping to save Rome from a tyrant. Gladiator to me is one of this generations best movies, pulling off some amazing cinematography that can only be compared to some of the best movies. I believe Gladiator should be watch by all to see spectacular acting and subnational music. Though this movie came out 14 years ago it still a wonderful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Favorite Sword and Sandals film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first movie I saw in what I call the "Sword and Sandals" genre. Other movies in this category are Troy, Immortals, 300, to give everyone a basis for my classification. This movie is absolutely outstanding from the acting, storyline, characters, and action, all the way down to the costumes.For me, it has stood the test of time over the last 14 years and is one of those movies I could watch no matter what. If my wife and I have a long weekend, or a rainy day we either go to one of the extended edition LOTR movies or Gladiator. It draws us in every time and has never failed to disappoint.Though Russell Crowe is the main character and I absolutely love his performance in this, my favorite performance has to go to Joaquin Phoenix. He makes the movie what it is as the villain and I don't believe it would have been as good without him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most interesting and exciting story of maxi mus the gladiator...The scenery used for "Gladiator" is brilliant ? and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie.The visual effects were amazing. It actually had me wanting to believe that's the way Rome actually looked in all it's glory. The battle of Carthage reenactment was really great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is such a good movie. The action and drama involved make it the best gladiatorial movie of all time. This is a must see and you have to watch it. Quite funny sometimes and at others very sad. That dog is awesome. Maximus winning the tournament and just dying after wards is quite sad. It makes up for it when he goes to heaven and sees his wife and his child. When the slaves do the formation of the roman army in the battle against seasoned gladiators, they just kick their butts. The movie should be seen if you are a fan of history, Rome, gladiators and action. Their is just a little bit of rude language but it is generally incredibly good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maximus is a powerful Roman general, loved by the people and the aging Emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Before his death, the Emperor chooses Maximus to be his heir over his own son, Commodus, and a power struggle leaves Maximus and his family condemned to death. The powerful general is unable to save his family, and his loss of will allows him to get captured and put into the Gladiator games until he dies. The only desire that fuels him now is the chance to rise to the top so that he will be able to look into the eyes of the man who will feel his revenge. Written by Chris "Morphy" Terry:)</fullReview>

You might end up fulfilling the task set by his belief in holy company and will field his son and his wife. The film was a landmark film and I saw it almost 15 years later. Despite the time the piece does not miss a minimum of intensity and quality. Both scenarios portraying ancient Rome as the main cast of the film (in which I highlight above all to Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix) are splendid. Wonderful is the soundtrack to the film complete and that 'Now we are free' as a climax to the 155 minutes of footage, now we are free</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the Roman Empire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator was a great historical film that took place in Italy, Rome from 161 A.D. to 181 A.D. Maximus, the over all hero, is forced to become a gladiator and compete in the games after being falsely accused of killing the emperor of Rome. As a general, he is very skilled with a sword, that helps his odds of surviving. Caesar is the over all bad guy trying to kill Maximus because his father wanted him to be emperor of Rome. The emperor tries everything to kill Maximus. He even tries to put a legendary fighter to kill him. This is somewhat historically correct due to Rome wanting to be a Republic again, the Coliseum, the gladiators, and the Caesar. I would highly suggest seeing this awe-inspiring, breath-taking, and phenomenal film about what Rome was like in the old times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator is packed full of action and suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is a film that portrays a notorious general, Maximus Decimus Meridius (played by Russell Crowe), from ancient Rome that is betrayed by a jealous Prince, Commodus (played by Joaquin Phoenix). The Emperor, Marcus Aurelius (played by Richard Harris), of Rome is on his last leg of life and has decided to announce Maximus as his successor. When Commodus finds out that the new Emperor isn't going to be him Commodus decides to kill his father so he is named Emperor by default. On the day of Marcus's death, Maximus is ambushed and ordered to be executed from the orders of Commodus. Maximus finds a way to escape execution and immediately goes home to try and protect his family. He finds his family dead by being burnt alive and hung to display. Maximus now is set to revenge Marcus's and his family deaths.Throughout the movie, Maximus finds himself closer and closer to getting that revenge. He has to battle in the arenas and survive using his top of the line combat skills. Multiple scenes bring you up and close and personal to the combat. You see swift sward fighting and gruesome deaths. These scenes remind me of the movie "Braveheart" in terms of the actual battling. You see swords, bow and arrows, and spears being used to attach and defend individuals. All battle scenes give you a good feel on how good Maximus really is in terms of being a fighter.Once Maximus reaches the Coliseum, he has support from fans and his fellow colleagues. So in the first battle in the Coliseum, he creates a mini army in the ring and defeats the ones who were suppose to win. Once the battle is over, Maximus now has the support of the so- called mob. During this time whoever has the mob on their side has the power. Commodus finds out that Maximus is still alive and is the one winning all the support from the viewers. This irritates Commodus and becomes even more jealous of him. Commodus jealously and Maximus victorious battles are good for the film because it reassures the personal battles have for one another and strengthens the theme of the film. The colors and lighting of the film give you a sense of darkness up until the final battle. You have Maximus and Commodus in the middle of a white sand ring and Commodus is wearing white. This brightens the mood of the film because finally Maximus has his chance to kill Commodus. During a 3-minute battle between Commodus and Maximus, Maximus prevails and kills off Commodus. This part of film you are relieved because the Maximus finally accomplishes what was right. Maximus's wood prior to battle is just enough to have him die at the end but not before Commodus. So Maximus accomplishes not only revenge the death of Marcus but then being reunited with his family in the after life. The film makes you become a fan of Maximus and a hater of Commodus throughout. Its full of suspense and action and I would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rome, Gladiators, War and the battle of a warrior longing for freedom to one day return to his wife and son.This is probably by far my favorite Russell Crowe movie, and has one of the greatest liners ever "are you not entertained!" What we have here is an instant classic. One I'll be showing my kids one day. They will know the story of Maximus. His struggle, and later, his victory.Not only is it wonderfully acted, but it is so engrossing that you don't even realize that two hours of you life just went out the door. I say two and a half hours well spent.I have to applaud Ridley Scott on this one. You made a good one, keep it up. Because there aren't other movies out there like Gladiator. It's one of a kind!Moving, tragic, and over all one hell of a show!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ouch. This was the first DVD I ever purchased, and the first I gave to the local thrift store.First of all, I was subjected to Richard Harris all too much at the beginning, and what was that all about? How did that contribute to the film? Film is all about compression of characters and more-or-less smooth progression through the story. I'd have left the Richard Harris part on the cutting room floor. To present "the wrong person is on the throne" can be done very effectively in many other (shorter) ways.Second of all, Joaquin Phoenix's character was wholly one-dimensional, the result of which was a uniformly downward-feeling mood. Think of Stephen Boyd in Wyler's Ben Hur. Of course, Gladiator was a kind of remake of that one, which was a remake of a really good one. I now better appreciate Francis X Bushman.And what was the dog all about? I get all that Roman Valhalla stuff, but the execution was pretty corny, all dreamy and, can I say it, cheap. And let me digress - Richard Harris's part in Caviezel's Count of Monte Cristo might better have been left 60% on the cutting room floor. It gave the same problem, taking time and focus from the meat of the story.Gladiator was a one-and-done for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death smiles on us all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...all a man can do is smile back.In a way that line sums up this movie.On the surface it comes across as a simple action thriller... and it is, in many ways. The dialog is stilted,the story unoriginal,the character's archetypes, the political commentary unsubtle and the ending predictable.But what transcends this film is the undercurrent themes of hope, despair and loneliness.For example, the film's villain Commodus at first seems like your typical villain but Phoenix shows us a lonely,scared,love-starved boy capable of kindness and worthy of our empathy.In his scenes with his sister Lucilla the two actors lift it away from just being about incest to a study of a relationship of poignant dependency.Lucilla half hates her brother -and deep down he knows this- but he overlooks this because he desperately needs her.Lucilla too is a lost soul, revealed in a line to Maximus:''I have felt alone all my life,except with you.'' The film says one crucial thing about human nature-our capacity for enjoying the pain of others. We are watching people watching people die. And we enjoy the death and violence as much as the Romans did. But the film's ending offer's some-perhaps unattainable-hope and is, in a odd way an affirmation of life.What Gladiator doe's best is bring to life a world now lost. If I ever go to the Colosseum in Rome, I will not now see the rows of empty seats but hope,terror,hatred,cruelty, small kindness,desperate courage,and even heroism..in short.. all Humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Force Rising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Father, I would have butchered the whole world...if you would only love me." - Commodus Ridley Scott directs "Gladiator". The film's influenced by Cecil B. DeMille's epics ("The Crusades", "The Sign of the Cross"), and Italian/Hollywood sword-and-sandal movies ("Spartacus", "Ben Hur", "The Fall of the Roman Empire", "El Cid", "Barabbas", "Demetrius and the Gladiators" etc), all films Scott adored as a child. As with Scott's other historical epics ("Conquest of Paradise", "Robin Hood" and "Kingdom of Heaven"), artwork and paintings the director came across as an art student seem to be a big influence, in this case the works of Jean-Leon Gerome (Scott's acknowledged Gerome's "Pollice Verso" as the reason he decided to direct "Gladiator"), 19th century Orientalists, Charles Gleyre, Caravaggio and Delaroche.Of course the chief pleasure of any Scott movie is his emulation of famous painters and/or print artists. Think "Blade Runner's" nods to Edward Hopper, Enki Bilal and Jean Giraud (Moebius), "Alien's" reliance on Giger's "Necronomicon", and "The Duellist's" nods to Caspar David Friedrich and Stanley Kubrick's "Barry Lyndon's", another painterly film, though Kubrick subverts the idyllic charms of Gainsborough and Watteau, whereas Scott goes for straight Romanticism (his final shot's a direct copy of Friedrich's "Wanderer above the Sea of Fog"). The problem, though, is that Scott's images can never touch any of these other artists. Worse still, they're always aligned to silly screenplays."Gladiator" stars Russell Crowe as Maximus, the Roman general asked by the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius to take over as ruler of Rome. Before he is granted power, however, the emperor's tyrannical son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix, playing Commodus with severe daddy issues), orders the execution of Maximus and his family. Maximus survives, and embarks on a quest for vengeance. The film watches as Maximus falls from general to slave, rises from slave to gladiator and finally from gladiator to brave warrior who dares defy an emperor. The film ends with Maximus given a messianic, "Braveheart"/"Spartacus" inspired slow death.Great visuals and sequences are scattered about, but Scott's CGI lacks the gravity of even the FX work DeMille did a century earlier, the film is surprisingly stiff for an "action epic", "Gladiator's" adherence to old Hollywood storytelling, spectacle and violence makes it an immediately dated affair and Scott's dialogue reads like a bad stage-play ("Sometimes I do what I want to do, the rest of the time I do what I have to"), devoid of depth, nuance or wit. The film's overall tone is a cross between a WWF wrestling match and a perfume commercial, Scott dressing things up in a New Age score, gauzy filters, long focal lenses, ubiquitous smoke, flares and mist. It's "Braveheart" with less camp value. Like DeMille, what you mostly marvel at is the sheer scale of the production, though in our era of excess, such logistics have lost much of their weight.Hollywood isn't known for treating history seriously, but "Gladiator" is funny in the way it bulldozes yesteryear. The film ends with the fictional Maximus killing the real Emperor Commodus in gladiatorial combat, a mano-a-mano scenario that's the equivalent of Indiana Jones killing Hitler in a game of ping pong. Lucilla, the sister of Commodus (who had actually been executed at the beginning of Commodus' reign), then announces that Rome will "honor Maximus" by "reversing Commodus' despotism" and "restoring the greatness of the Republic". What the hell? The film somehow manages to turn Maximus' death (lots of Christian and crucification iconography) into a "hero dying for the sins of Rome" narrative, Maximus' death steering a resurrected Rome away from corruption and toward its supposedly saintly, Republican origins (historically, it was when Rome became a Republic that it turned into a psycho-expanding Empire, and it was as a Republic, and not while under dictatorial rule, that she was at her most bloody). You saw the same thing years ago with British Imperial nostalgia, Britain romanticising its colonial achievements and declaring them a proper source of pride, and today in the US with desires for "strict constitutionalists" and a return to those "good old days". You know, when you could own a slave and scalp Injuns. So by the film's end, "Gladiator" has turned the historical fall of the Roman Empire into Rome's "purification" and "rebirth" via the "true warrior son" of a "departed Emperor" "nobly returning" and replacing a "bad, fake, fascist Emperor". Cue psycho-expansionist George Bush Jr's coincidental ascension to the throne the same year Scott's film was released. It's what daddy wanted.End result: a violent Hollywood spectacle about the violent spectacle of gladiatorial combat, which makes fun of art which panders to the mob, whilst nevertheless glorifying violence, "glory", "honor" and the prosperity of Roman Imperialism. Note the way the simple, bare-bones existence of Maximus (the guy literally rallies his troops by stressing his love for simple, subsidence farming) is contrasted with Commodus' extravagance. Commodus may prove that the dumb masses only enjoy bread and circus antics, but Maximus trumps this by gaining support through the universal love for the simple, martial virtues that supposedly made Rome great. These virtues were more heroically illustrated by the Germanic fighters and Celtic tribes (ironic: "Gladiator" catapulted Celtic singer Enya to super-stardom), quickly slaughtered by Scott, who were defending themselves against Rome at the beginning of the film. 7.5/10 - Worth two viewings. See 1964's "Becket" and 1968's "The Lion In Winter".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Breathtaking Sword and Sandals plenty of swordplay , perfect cast ,lively pacing , massed action ,dastardly plots and many other things . The late second century : the Roman army is fighting Germania where takes place a bloody carnage . Troops are commanded by general Maximus (Russell Crowe). Ailing Marcus Aurelius ( Richard Harris) would like his confident and favorite to take over empire , but the events go wrong . Mean heir Comodus's (Joaquin Phoenix) vices arise from poor parental care as he takes power. When the Roman general is betrayed and his family murdered by an emperor's corrupt son , the insecure Commodus feels powerful . Having ensured father dies in his arms , the new emperor exerts his killer fury . Maximus , then comes to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge .He won't swear loyalty and gets a chance to redeem himself .Father of a murdered son , husband to a murdered wife and I shall have my revenge in this life or the next .This bloody good movie has great action sequences well staged with stylish and vitality , thrills ,fundamental emotions , fortright spectacle ,fierce combats including scud catapults , and is pretty entertaining . The film results to be a special remake to Fall of Roman Empire directed by Antony Mann with Stephen Boyd , Sofia Loren and Christopher Plummer as Commodus , though is a little revisionist about characters , history and time when is developed the action . Before directing Robin Hood , Kingdom of heaven films , director Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe teamed but with much bigger budget . The final product looked as although the actors learn the screenplay and decided the best issue was to take a good time and amuse themselves and both managed to stage some excellent action scenes . Great performances abound , as stalwart Russell Crowe playing an enslaved ex-general who bent on vengeance , he is very fine ; in addition , vacilating empress Connie Nielsen is memorable and attractive , she comes up the film as a valiant and obstinate woman . Special mention to gladiator owner magnetically performed by Oliver Reed and Joaquin Phoenix as evil and crazed emperor in a sensationalistic interpretation . Marvelous relationship between Maximus-Russel Crowe and an African slave-Dijimon Honsou , the deep bond lends a P.C. historicity. Ample support cast formed by notorious British secondaries as David Hemmings David Schofield , John Schrapnel and endearing Derek Jacobi . There are great action sequences including the battle against Barbarians and the final confrontation in arena at the climax of the film. Impeccable but sometimes dark cinematography by John Mathieson . Movie is shot on natural sets and interior scenarios with impressive production design by Arthur Max , but also excessive use of computer generator images . Magnificent and sensible musical score by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard , including wonderful songs .I found it fun , well-acted , in Peplum tradition and fast-paced.The motion picture packed with pomp and pageantry is lavishly produced by the prestigious Douglas Wick and David Franzoni , also screenwriter ; being glamorously directed by Ridley Scott , at his best and as stylish as ever , similarly his previous film Someone to watch over me and others as Blade runner, Black rain , Legend in which his visual style is impressive . The picture belongs to his speciality ,the historical genre , as Robin Hood , Kingdom of heaven , Duelists and Black Hawk down . Rating : Above average . Essential and indispensable watching for Ridley Scott followers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thousands things have been already said about Gladiator. is there anything else left to say about this movie? definitely yes. there are three kinds of movies in this world, first one is copy work from other movies or novels or history, second one is a complete fresh idea or a fictional work and third one is a combination of both. well gladiator falls under the third category.The pace of the movie is decent but very apt for this kind of story. A journey of the man, how he see his world changing, collapsing, betraying and at times helping. We get more involved and impulse when the movie rolls on just because we are more informed of so many things which the man (gladiator)in the screen doesn't seem to know. We feel more painful than him, more nerve cracking than him and more betrayed than him.Few people love violence, few love sentiments, few love fictions or history and some more people love romance. put all this people together to watch this movie and they will say that they had their part in it. some times i keep wondering what happens now to the Rome when the end credits role, making me to question my IQ and convincing my heart saying its just a movie. well its not so!we always say the best is yet to come. gosh we are wrong , this is the best and better. If you haven't watched this movie then stop reading this and start watching it and then come back and read it once again.waiting for another master piece from this team..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suffering through "Gladiator," director Ridley Scott's long-winded and sloppily staged Roman soldier epic, whetted my appetite for those glorious sword and sandal sagas that Hollywood produced in the 1950s and the 1960s. Guts, gusto, and grandeur distinguished spectacles such as Melvyn Leroy's "Quo Vadis" (1951), Delmar Daves' "Demetrius and the Gladiators" (1954), William Wyler's "Ben-Hur" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus" (1960), and Anthony Mann's "The Fall of the Roman Empire" (1964). Although it borrows bits and pieces from those cinematic classics, "Gladiator" lacks the passion and charisma which made those movies memorable. Meticulously crafted with stunning, state-of-the-art, digital special effects that recreate ancient Rome, "Gladiator" chronicles the tragic fate of a valiant general betrayed and enslaved, who returns as a gladiator to wreak vengeance on a wicked emperorWhile brawny Russell Crowe gives a thumbs-up performance, he is defeated by a thumbs-down script that resembles an uninspired rehash of the Clint Eastwood classic "The Outlaw Josey Wales" in a toga with a chicken-hearted villain and a humdrum finale. The action unfolds in Germania in 180 A.D. General Maximus (Russell Crowe of "The Insider") wins a brutal battle for his dying emperor, Caesar Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris of "Unforgiven"), against a Danubian horde. Caesar despises his depraved son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix of "Clay Pigeons") and makes Maximus the protector of Rome. Marcus wants Rome returned to the people and he trust Maximus and Maximus only to make this happen. When Commodus learns the bad news, he suffocates his dear old dad in his tent. At Marcus Aurelius' death bed, Maximus defies Commodus and vows to carry out his late emperor's wishes. Swiftly, Commodus has Maximus arrested and taken out to be executed at dawn. Predictably, Maximus outsmarts his moronic captors and escapes. Riding hard for his sprawling farm in faraway Spain, Maximus arrives too late to save his crucified wife and son. Grief-stricken, he falls prey to a band of slave traders who eventually sell him to Proximo (Oliver Reed of "Hannibal Brooks"). Not only does Proximo teach Maximus how to survive in the arena, but also how to win the kudos of the crowd.Meanwhile, honoring his father whom he murdered, Commodus revives the gladiator battles in the Coliseum. Proximo shows up with his invincible champion and Commodus gets the shock of his life when he discovers that Maximus is alive. The cheering crowds adore Maximus in the area so the corrupt Commodus plots to kill him outside it.Director Ridley Scott of "Alien" gums up "Gladiator" with a soap opera subplot about the incest between Commodus and his sister. The "Braveheart" style battle that opens the movie is so murky that you can barely see the combatants. The actors in the sun-drenched fights are better, but Scott dwells more on clashing swords rather than hair-raising choreography. Sadly, Commodus makes such a weak, sniveling villain that you feel no relief when Maximus squares accounts with him. Ultimately, as colorless as the statues of the Roman rules, who adorn the palaces in this bloody bore of a blockbuster, "Gladiator" qualifies as a bust.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched Gladiator again.On my first watching I was pulled along by the exciting story, thrilling action sequences and fabulous visuals.This time I was able to appreciate the performances, particularly Joaquin Phoenix and Oliver Reed.Commodus is not a sympathetic character, but he is a complex one. Phoenix brings great depth to him. You never like him, but you understand him. Phoenix' work is remarkable.And Oliver Reed's performance reminds you of just how powerful he could be in the right part, how unfortunate it was that he was in so much rubbish, and what a loss his death was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's "Gladiator" tells the story of a betrayed Roman general (Russell Crowe) who is thrust into the life of a gladiator. He lives for the day that he can exact revenge on the man responsible for the murder of his wife and child, the emperor himself (Joaquin Phoenix).The film harks back to the sort of big-budget historical epics that died out in the mid-sixties. Therefore, it isn't surprising that the script's strength isn't originality. The plot borrows elements of "Ben-Hur" &amp; "Spartacus" and supposedly also draws heavily from "The Fall of the Roman Empire", which I haven't seen.Regardless of this lack of originality, the film does manage to present us with a compelling story of a type that had been absent from movie screens for too long. Also, with the advances in CGI, the filmmakers were able to fully realize the epic scope that such a story deserves. While the script may misstep a few times it nevertheless presents an intelligent story effectively balancing action and political intrigue.The cast is solid. Russell Crowe won an Oscar for his work here, which is a bit surprising to me. It's a good performance as far as action-oriented drama goes, but I don't think that it's outstanding by any means. I think that Joaquin Phoenix fared better as the conniving emperor but he only managed an Oscar nomination among some tough competition. The rest of the cast is generally above-average, featuring a number of talented individuals like Djimon Hounsou &amp; Richard Harris.Ridley Scott's direction is skillfully handled and resulted in a well-deserved Oscar nomination. The attractive cinematography &amp; crisp editing were also recognized with Oscar nominations. The visual effects deservedly won an Oscar, as did the costume design, while the art direction scored another Oscar nomination. These plaudits should make it clear that this is a film showing considerable care in all areas of visual presentation.A further Oscar nomination resulted from Hans Zimmer's score while the sound design scored another Oscar win. Very rarely do I notice sound design in a film but in this case I did.I'd say that, more than anything, the high quality of every technical aspect of the film went a long way in securing the film's Best Picture Oscar win. As for my own opinion, I think that the film represents a rare commodity: A crowd-pleasing film that also shows considerable technical prowess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How history SHOULD have gone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a history buff and fan of the Roman Republic and Empire. However, I have been disheartened on my Trip to Italy by its later leaders, such as Commodus, and so forth. Historical Films rarely break from the overall path History actually took, and when they do, it is normally a bad thing.Here, however, I am happy. Commodus, who was actually a real emperor, was a meglomaniac whose rule marked the beginning of the decline of Rome. And in reality, his death was followed by chaos. However, to see not only that emperor die in such a way, but also for the film to depict the restoration of the Senatus Populusque Romanus (or SPQR) to power was touching. Normally, I scorn historical films for not being like what really happened. Now, it is the actual history which I wish was more like the movie.Did this make any sense?</fullReview>

When often I recommended or quoted Gladiator- most middle aged women would laugh commenting 'I don't think thats the sort of film for me'- and yet every one of them were brought in and left in a state of awe by the end.This is not a movie driving from the budget- this is a beautifully filmed, acted and written story that the budget helps to bring across and give that epic feel. The music is without doubt the nearest thing I have ever heard to how I felt watching this- If movies such as The Dark Knight can get top 10- this should be n.2-5 however, I believe definitely top 20- as neither batman not any epic i have seen in the last 10 years has given the same feeling by the end of the film.I watched it in the cinema- ther was a short 10second silence at the end- and then everyone got up to applaud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly GLADIATOR is the stuff of great fiction; a story so well-orchestrated and superbly told, there might well have been in Roman history a general who became a slave, a slave who became a gladiator, a gladiator who defied an emperor.But - as they used to say in ancient Rome - "only in Hollywood..."Russell Crowe is Ancient Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of a fierce and loyal army that has conquered the known world under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (regal, world-weary Richard Harris). Maximus plans to retire to his olive gardens with wife and son, but the sickly Emperor has other ideas, bequeathing Maximus the stewardship of Rome over that of his natural-born son and rightful heir, the fey Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). When Commodus discovers this slight, he cries a little, promptly kills his father, arrests Maximus, and gets progressively feyer.Commodus then invents the James-Bond-Batman-Death, that is, don't kill your nemesis quickly and efficiently in full view, order your incompetent men to take him somewhere and probably kill him if he doesn't use his dangerous ingenuity and superior combat skills to escape. This also guarantees you are completely in the dark as to whether your enemy is dead, until he appears unexpectedly somewhere and vexes you.This Maximus does, defying Commodus and leaving him terribly vexed.Thereby arriving at Part Three of the slogan. In the interim, Maximus discovered his family was crucified by Commodus, which caused Maximus untold Academy Award-Winning Acting, subsequently collapsing in the desert and taken into slavery. The Gladiator merchant, Proximo (Oliver Reed, gravel-throated, rheumy-eyed - his last performance before going to that great arena in the sky) handpicks the indifferent yet lethal Maximus to join his stable of gladiators (which includes neighborly Numidian, Djimon Hounsou and man-mountain Ralf Moeller). Proximo scores a gig at The Coliseum, for the pleasure of now-Emperor Commodus.As Darth Vader thoomed, "The circle is now complete." There were arena skirmishes before this one, but the Coliseum "Carthage reenactment" is the grandest rock star battle for Proximo's now-renowned gladiator troop, inspired and led by Maximus, as stirring and blood-pounding as BEN-HUR's chariot race. GLADIATOR's raucous, blood-glutted battle scenes are fitting successors to the "realistic" warfare of BRAVEHEART and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN."Are you not entertained?" His helmet disguising his identity, Maximus rallies "his" gladiators to defeat the lethal Imperial chariot-riders in the arena, to the surprise of Commodus, who wishes to meet the upstart who would not even salute the throne, let alone die conveniently for the public's pleasure. Maximus reveals himself to Commodus, who is driven to remarkable heights of feyness.Discovering Maximus is alive makes not only Commodus weak in the knees - so too his sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), who pined for him back when her father the Emperor owned Maximus's taut butt. Her betrayal of Commodus sets in motion the third act, steeped in politics of reclaiming Rome as a republic, and therefore losing some of its verve.Beautifully filmed, in ocher tones and burnt umber (by director Ridley Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson), GLADIATOR nabbed Russell Crowe a Best Actor Oscar - even though Joaquin Phoenix did all the actual acting! Crowe pulls the Bruce Willis for most of the film, while Phoenix's sway-tilt emotions are a disturbing rainbow of subtlety.Phoenix's performance is absolutely stunning - that of a weak man, filled with disillusionment, contempt, envy, indecision; conflicting emotions constantly dancing across his face, flickers of smiles when we know he wants to cry humiliation, edging tears when we know he would rather lash out like the simple animal he is. It is Acting of a caliber few writers or directors could even describe, let alone trust an actor to convey."What we do in life echoes in eternity." Well. maybe, depending on what eternity you're talking about. For all its awe-inspiring action and chest-beating man-sweatiness, GLADIATOR has its faults: writers David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson can't figure what ancient civilization they're writing for. These are ROMANS, boys. So when Maximus pep talks his men at the very first battle "...if you find yourself alone, riding in green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled, for you are in Elysium - and you are already dead!," his troops should have replied, "Excuse sir, but isn't that where GREEKS go?" In his prayers, Maximus appeals to a "Blessed Father" - Jupiter? Janus? GLADIATOR pulls no punches when depicting the slaughter of countless of god's creations, yet is too gutless to depict polytheism. Especially in the Lead Actor with the Oscar push.When Maximus prays to the effigies of his wife and son and the Numidian asks, "What do you say to them?" he answers, "To my son - I tell him I will see him again soon. To keep his heels down while riding his horse. To my wife... that is not your business." Big bonding laugh. Let me get this straight: he's joking about sticking it to his raped and crucified wife in the afterlife? Is that not inappropriate? Are you not entertained? "It vexes me. I'm terribly vexed." Phoenix all in white, Gladiator stumbling from a stab wound and seeing his predestination Christian homecoming, Jumilla giving a eulogy that makes our flesh crawl, the Numidian (who had his own religious beliefs) succumbing to the Christian myths (after all, they are the right ones, of course! Not like those other stupid religions, which Christians are still trying to wipe off the face of the Earth) and sotto voce, "We will see each other again - but not yet!"...Apparently, Gladiator is "going home." Believe in a myth hard enough and it will come true.Hail Caesar and all that. Romani Ite Domum.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>R.Scott is the most underrated director EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films know not to take themselves too seriously. Gladiator is one of the few films that know it must take itself seriously. It sweeping story, epic action, unflinching villain, determined ensemble, involving story, and larger than life hero make this a classic film by more than one standard. Director Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Alien, American Gangster, Black Hawk Down, Thelma &amp; Louise) has made many a great film but his ability to let his incredible visual technique tell his stories is by far an aspect that has made him a legend. The narrative itself is not lacking in anyway. In fact it might be the best one Scott has presided over. Maximus's rise from noble general, to broken man, to finally a valiant, defiant, righteous hero is beautiful, triumphant and heart-braking. Russell Crowe can embody any hero and here he take on a true superhero like persona. Senators, queen, and Roman citizens rally around him to bring down a suspicious emperor. To us though Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is much more than suspicious we see him as disturbed, perhaps perverted, certainly sadistic, evil, murdering, disillusioned son of Marcus Aurelius (whom he murdered when he found that Maximus was to be emperor). The battle scene at the beginning when Maximus's troops rout the Germanic tribes is hauntingly beautiful and glorious. Also worth noting is the solid display of the supporting performances. Connie Nielsen is stellar as Lucilla, a woman who is caught between trying to best her diabolical brother (whom she still loves because he is family) and trying to keep her son safe. The implied past relationship between her and Maximus adds to the stakes of the story. Derek Jacobi is well cast as a seasoned determined senator on the side of Maximus. Djimon Hounson and the later Oliver Reed are likable and identifiable as Maximus's gladiator allies. On the whole Gladiator is unforgettable, involving story whose characters move us. The action is thrilling, the stakes are many, and our hero personifies righteousness and strength. This film won the Academy Award for 2000's Best Picture. I highly doubt it that close of a vote.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yesterday I saw this masterpiece for the third time, but I was tremendously impressed again like I have ever been when I have watched it.Maximus, a highly decorated commander of the Roman Legions and friend of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, wins the most important battle against the Teutons and is now looking forward to spend his evening of live with his wife and son in his homeland Spain, but Marcus Aurelius wants him to be his successor.Commodus, Marcus' son, who recognized his father's plans, kills his father and appoints himself as the new Ceasar. Maximus, who is able to escape from the execution, ordered by Commodus, manages to come home, but his family is already killed by Roman troops.Maximus now becomes a gladiator and after several wins he cut's his way to the Colosseum, where he meets his archenemy Commodus. He reveals his identity to Commodus and is now the idol of the people in contrast to Commodus who is hated by them.Commodus knows he cannot murder Maximus, because that would make Maximus a martyr no more than to let him alive. The only possibility is a hand-to-hand fight against Maximus in the Colosseum. And of course Maximus wins, but is terribly hurt. In the last moments of his life he gives the power back to the Senate and dies in the arena so he is now reunited with his family.The movie contains everything which a good monumental film needs, action scenes, intrigues and a heroic epic.Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, two of the best Hollywood actors, have done an excellent job. Crowe has played the role of his life.What makes this movie special is Maximus' live journey which is characterized of ups and downs. Everybody can identify himself with Maximus. Everyone shares the thrill with him that he kill the hated Commodus (excellentely played by Phoenix) and that he cares for justice. I think at the moment when he dies and meets his family in paradise everybody is moved to tears.Also a great compliment to the director Ridley Scott.It is simply a masterpiece at all points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has anyone reading this comment seen the movie "Epic Movie"? Do you think that "Epic Movie" is the best "epic" out there? No, it's not even an epic at all. Gladiator is a true definition of what an epic movie is about. There is action, romance, and surprises. They all add up to the word "epic." This film is about a general of the Roman Empire who was wrongfully arrested over the murder of the emperor, taken as a slave, and turned into on the best Roman gladiators ever. While he is out there in the Coliseum, he has to deal with the evil son of the murdered emperor. The acting is very good. Russell Crowe did a great job and I was impressed on Joaquin Phoenix's acting. Ridley Scott always had the ability, as a director, to make Oscar-worthy movies. I also give thumbs-ups to Hans Zimmer. He composed many great movies with Gladiator being amongst them. This movie was nominated for a grand total of a whopping 12 Oscars and won 5 of them including Best Picture. On a minus side, this movie has slow parts basically involving Commodus. Other than that, this movie is close to perfect. I rate this movie 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is one of those films for the ages, a film that defies expectations and becomes something legendary. Russell Crowe won an Oscar for Best Actor as a Roman general seeking revenge on the corrupt prince (Joaquin Phoenix) who murdered his family. While a simple revenge dominates the plot, it really gives director Ridley Scott a chance to re-imagine ancient Rome as it was before its historical downfall. His vision is astounding, with plenty of graphic battle sequences (many of which are enhanced by CGI), great acting, and all-around epic greatness. "Gladiator" is really sweeping entertainment of the first order. While I feel I can no longer pay to see Russell Crowe in a movie anymore, this was his greatest performance ever, with an Oscar win that was surely well-deserved.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*****Classic ****Excellant ***Good **Fair *TragicReview: Galdiator is considered by many to be one of th best films to have ever been put to screen and i couldn't disagree a slight bit. The dialogue is poetic and captivating. Crowe gives audiences a taste of his power that is both thrilling and emotional.The opening battle scene, visceral, blood-filled and rough, set the tone for the rest of the movie. Hand to hand combat, a deluge of catapults firing huge fire-filled rocks at surrounding trees and chaos screeching rapidly whilst men are slaughtered brutally to the ground. Scott puts us right in the thick of battle. He doesn't want the audience to feel left out or downed by not seeing enough, so he shows us everything, from Arms to legs and even heads being mutilated right in front of your eyes.This sequence is one of the many gruelling epic battle sets to follow that punctuate the story of the main character.The plot is fast and thickened to maximum quality. Scott layers the plot so thick that it will be hard not to like. The genius of the editing makes the story and action fast and flowing without leaving anything out.The ensemble cast includes Oliver Reed, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris and Djimon Hounsou who all provide as much granger and stability as Crowe in the lead role.Verdict: Gladiator is a must-see classic that swells up bold moves by recreating the lost sword and sandal epics that had previously been failing for the past 30 years. But Gladiator hit's not only a revisionary insight into the power of a sword and sandal epic but delivers an emotional impact with it's story and character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Authorities in Italy have announced the discovery of the tomb of the Ancient Roman General who inspired Gladiator (reported in the The Times online website and elsewhere). Marcus Nonius Macrinus was a favourite of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, leading the Emperor's army to victory in Germania and across the Danube. However he did not end up a gladiator. Although the Emperor's son and successor, Commodus was indeed killed by a gladiator named Narcissius. After all, story-telling often involves the right o "Poetic License", so I do not get upset over minor matters in a wonderful film like Gladiator.

A true movie hero, and Russel Crowe's renown range of expressions and emotions make it a solid performance. Also, Joaquin Pheonix's role as the delusional and insane emperor is a perfect foil to Crowe's good-natured Maximus. As for the action, brutal and smooth throughout the movie, it never overstays its welcome. This is not a movie, its cinema.

The main mistakes are concerned with the representation of the fights of the Gladiators in the Arenas. The seats chosen for the spectators in the Colosseum and generally speaking in Roman Arenas were precisely assigned. Lower levels, i.e. first "gradins" were exclusively reserved to Senators and important citizens of Rome, such as magistrateships. In the movie such rule is completely ignored. The intermediate levels, above, were for other citizens and the main part of male spectators. Finally women were segregated in the highest and separated levels of the Anphitheater. No mixed men/women audience were allowed! Moreover no mixed fight with beasts and other fighters ever took place. At noon the show was concerned with fights with or against wild beasts. Then, late afternoon, one man against another single man. Never, ever a group of men or against a group of men.</fullReview>

Their loyalty is admirable, and to be friends with them would be priceless.Gladiator was the first of many epic films that premiered between 2000 and 2005. And, I think, it is the best of them.

		<fullReview>This film is a very ingenious screenplay of a man's loyalty, suffering, courage and emotions. Gladiator is a 2000 historical action/drama film directed by Ridley Scott, starring Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Crowe portrays the loyal General Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when the Emperor's ambitious son Commodus (Phoenix) murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murder of his family and his Emperor. While Gladiator was criticized by historians for its historical inaccuracies, its epic scope and intense battle scenes won praise. The film's success may have helped to revive the historical epic genre, with subsequent films such as Troy, Alexander, and Kingdom of Heaven, the last of which was also directed by Scott.</fullReview>

Sure, the coliseum scenes are something special - possibly some of the great action scenes ever shot, but they are let down by a mess of a film, full of bad dialogue, gaping plot holes and bad acting.Russell 'I can only do one expression' Crowe, is perhaps one of the films biggest let downs, he can't decided whether he is a emotionless bad ass, not giving a damn whether he dies or not, or whether he is an emotionally fragile man. I've never been a big fan of Crowe, but especially in the role of Maximus, I feel it is one of the film's hindrances.The dialogue is camp and cartoony, with one of the first lines "Why can't people just admit when they've been conquered?!" appearing completely inappropriate for a savage battle scene. Throughout the film the dialogue is one of the recurring problems, which makes itself apparent when it appears self-aware or over-sincere ("You must live or I shall die").Also, we're meant to believe that Maximus can escape the Roman army and travel undetected from Germania back to Spain, but wait he can't escape from a shoddy little slave ring. Its plot holes like this that mean that Gladiator can't be the classic it badly wants to be.However, it does have quite a few redeeming factors, such as the fact that it is really well directed by Ridley Scott (his choice of panning camera shots and brilliant intimate feel to the battle scenes have to be seen to be believed). And Joaquin Phoenix is spot on as Commodus, never choosing to portray him as a straight bad guy, but the most multi-dimensional character in the film.Oh yeah, and the soundtrack is great too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word...Spectacular!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard plenty reviews of excellence about this film, and I wanted to see it for myself. When I saw it, i couldn't keep my eyes off of it, for I was so captivated by it! The key that makes this film so great is how the story flows:A general who becomes a slave. A slave who becomes a Gladiator. A Gladiator who defied an emperor. The General: The film is based off of the time when the Romans were conquering the known world, and it follows the life of a loyal Roman general named Maximus (Russel Crowe). After winning a victory over the Germanians, he is asked for an unusual duty by the dying Caesar Marcus Aurellius (Richard Harris). Maximus learns from Caesar that the politics have been corrupt, as well as his son, Commidus, heir to his throne (Joaquin Phoenix), a coward, more or less.Caesar begs Maximus to be 'the protector of Rome' and to return the power to the senate for democracry versus dictatorship that has ruled Rome since the late Julius Caesar. Maximus refuses, and thus leads to his punishment. Caeasr's jealousy son murders Caesar out of jealousy, and has Maximus executed, who escapes, but suffers a deeper punishment when his only son and wife are brutally killed by Commidus, his so-called brother. (The film carries a strong father atonement with Maximus, who is no richer than farmer, with Caesar who loves him over his own son, who has no virtues.) The Slave: The film changes when Maximus is swept into slavery, and is forced to fight for his life in the entertainment games of gladiators, including the Battle in Chains. He then develops strong relationships with fellow fighters for the vulgar crowd, and his master Proximo (Oliver Reed). Proximo sees Maximus' greatness in being a Gladiator, and beings him, with the other worthy gladiators, to Rome.The Gladiator: Maximus then must fight against impossible odds including the tiger fight and the Battle of Carthage. Each battle he fights for the people brings him closer to vengeance against the ruthless Commidus, and forces him to follow the dream of the late Marcus Aurellius...a free Rome.Gladiator has the strongest storytelling since Ben-hur! Each event is a cause-to-affect that leads to one final conclusion of a war of brothers. One noble, the other a coward. Flat down, i have to say Russel Crowe's performance was excellent and Oscar worthy. The costumes and set-decorations were phenomenal, and gave an authentic and artistic view of an unforgotten Rome, especially with the Colosseum. The cinematography by John Mathieson was beautiful, especially with the usage of blended colors and vivid photography of the scenery of the lands that are traveled in the films' story. Joaquin Phoenix was also excellent as his role as Commidus; critics hate his role for pouting all the time, but he was just fabulous in his role of a jealousy son who wanted to be loved by a father who didn't love him, but at the same time a vicious villain. The rest of the acting was simply great as well.The visual effects were awesome, the battle sequences were very action oriented and contains the bloodshed needed to be realistic, and the other strong element was the powerful score of Hans Zimmer that was deeply cut from the Oscars. The music did not follow one theme like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dargon (which won), but many themes that are uplifting, sad, and very moving. Overall, Gladiator is an epic on a grand scale, that most filmmakers can't follow, because they focus on visual effects versus the story and acting. It is an all time favorite of mine! An easy 5/5 This is no doubt Ridley Scott's (who deserved the Oscar for director) best feat since Blade Runner!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie like Gladiator is extremely rare and the concept involved does raise some question marks. However, the movie is so well made and so brilliant that it makes this one of the greatest movies ever made in history. Joaquin Phoenix's acting is absolutely amazing and brilliant and I'm surprised that he gets little mention and is often overshadowed by Russel Crowe. Joaquin Phoenix is certainly one of the most underrated actors of all time. The special effects are brilliant and the gore depicted so realistically that the violent is impactful yet not disturbing. The only minor nitpick about this epic is how Commodus is so easily hated by all and maximus gets so much support and backing so easily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Man against One Empire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing about this movie is... i can say it's without a doubt the best movie i ever seen.Now to my reasoning. The movie points out how one name can bring down an entire empire. It's been said that there are 2 things you cant kill: 1. an idea and 2. one's Name. Throughout the movie Maximus shows so much integrity it's overwhelming towards the end of the movie. It makes you heart grow as you see how people that barely know you are ready to die for you because you stand for a symbol not because you did them a favor or saved their life.It's a man's movie in my own opinion because it punctuates some valors that women don't need. Valour, Honor, strength, loyalty.If you have the chance to see it more than once pay attention to the faces of key actors during key moments and you will actually re-discover the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This review contains spoilers... it is a close analysis of the opening sequence of the first scene.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The general who became a slave; the slave who became a gladiator; the gladiator who defied an emperor. Striking story! "But now, the people want to know how the story ends. Only a famous death will do. And what could be more glorious than to challenge the emperor himself in the great arena?" When a Roman general is betrayed and his family murdered by a corrupt prince, he comes to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge. Director Ridley Scott uses the contrast of light and dark; peace and war; good and evil to make a unique opening such as the one in Gladiator.Unusual, dramatic, historic. How many films open with historical facts? Not everyone was happy; not everyone likes politics; not everyone is in favour of the Caesars. Gladiator opens dramatically with the appearance of four small paragraphs written in Roman Calligrapher of gold indicating that "over one quarter of the world's population lived and died under the rule of the Caesars." It gives the audience an idea of the past; what it was like to live under the reign of the Caesars! According to the word 'died', it was very unpleasant. This is definitely not a fairy tale story. Set "in the winter of 180 A.D.," one obstacle "stands in the way" of Emperor Marcus, who wants nothing but "victory and the promise of peace through the Empire" fulfilled.The use of close-up of the hand hides the identity to which the hand belongs to. Touching the wheat of the harvest, a part of the body is feeling the pride of an unknown person, satisfied with its field. The sunlight in the background suggest the time of the year: spring or summer. Light is associated with good and the golden tinge makes it seem like a memory or something heavenly, making the surroundings look golden. Or perhaps, the gold was shone because of the fully grown wheat which symbolises there's hope for the world and the young generations. The growth could suggest life and fertility. A wrinkle hand touches the life of the wheat; the wrinkle itself could suggest the age of the unknown identity and by touching the soft wheat, he establishes a memory. The ring on the finger of the wrinkle hand signifies the marriage or engagement of the unknown identity, and the silver suggests his wealth and status in the society of the Roman Empire. It is a sentimental value. Lastly, the black of the sleeves is very symbolic as people believe it relates to death and when there's death, there's a funeral. This person may have returned from a funeral or perhaps it his favourite colour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start with an amazing battle scene at the beginning rocks! Gladiator is one of the best movies I've ever seen! The movie is undoubtedly graphic, but is awesome to watch! The moves and sword play is enticing, especially at the end where Commodus fights Maximus! To have this movie a year before the Lord of the Rings trilogy makes it a sweet prelude! The storyline rocks and the visual swordplay and all rules the screen to the point where you can't turn away from the movie for even a little bit! Great soundtrack, great gladiator fights and the violence that occurs is enticing, but it is just a little much at some points, but that did not persuade me to give it a lower score than 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was by far the greatest movie I've seen in a long time. I'm not saying that any one part of the film was phenomenal in itself, but I'm saying that rounding all the details and considering all aspects, this is a great movie for anyone. The movie involved the trails and tribulations of a tried man, and his journey throughout the film led to great screenplay and exiting action at points. I don't think it was perfect, and the most room for improvement lies in the acting of minor characters, lighting, and sometimes the balance of sound. Other than that though, screen-play was good enough to cover a lot of possible errors in acting, but some it just didn't. I recommend this movie to anyone, and will probably watch several more times.</fullReview>

I saw this movie i guess at least five times and i will see it again, and again, and again... because i just love it. The Roman Empire was in my opinion the greatest and gladiators' games were just an accomplishment for this. That's why nowadays we have only to appreciate everything Romans left. And about the movie, the cast is very well chosen, i think everybody fits its role, the plot is great and also has it mark of reality, and the director - Ridley Scott has made a great job.

		<shortDescription>A fascinating picture of ancient Rome.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is Ridley Scott's attempt at a sword-and-sandal epic, with Russell Crowe at the helm as Maximus. And it doesn't disappoint. The picture is beautiful, Scott pulls out all the stops with scenery, costumes, weapons, and (the most important) faces. This is a country who is recovering from brutal wars against the Germanic tribes who are, at this time, trying to take down this vast kingdom.Maximus (Russell Crowe) is an instant fan-favorite. There is no growing up for this strapping military genius, he already knows his stuff. All we have to do is sit back and watch him do business. He outwits the antagonist to the point where he is in control (to understand this feet is to understand a Gladiator's position in the Roman caste). The villain, Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) plays a pathetic and sadistic young man who, much in the fashion of Macbeth, descends into darkness and uses violent means to achieve a position that was supposedly taken from him."Gladiator" is worth seeing. The only complaint I give is the watering down of the characters who are devoid of any complexity, Ridley Scott tries too hard to distinguish who's who. He doesn't let the viewer decide. He might as well have his characters yell out, "Hate me! I just killed a good guy!" It would have been nice to see Maximus show a little of his darker side to the audience. A man who is a victim of a tyrannical dictator, a man who suffered the hanging and burning of his son and wife is not made of complete honor and integrity. At least not in reality.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOTE: REVIEW PERTAINS TO EXTENDED EDITION**WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**I'm going to apologize ahead of time to everyone reading this, as it may be a little biased. Why? Because I believe Gladiator is one of the greatest films ever made. As far as favorite films go, this is one of my top five. In fact, as I think about it, it rests only behind "Evil Dead" and "American Beauty" for me.Of course, who now isn't familiar with this story? The Roman Legion General Maximus, Russel Crowe, is the main figure. The film follows his journey from General to slave to gladiator. It is also the story of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and his usurping of the throne of Emperor, as well as his knowledge of the people of Rome (the mob), and his lack of knowledge of politics. It follows the side-story of the planning to de-throne Commodus and restore the Republic that once was Rome. All with staggering sets and scenes, a rousing musical score, and a cast of believable, and realistically portrayed characters.Here's the breakdown:What's New: --17 minutes of added material, according to the DVD case.--Countless scenes have extra shots here and there basically adding to the detail of Rome, the environment and atmosphere. --Proximo (Oliver Reed), the man who first purchases Maximus to be a gladiator, is seen being enticed to bet against Maximus and Juba (Djimon Hounsou) in their first gladitorial bout when they are chained together. --Prior toanother early bout--where Maximus alone is the fighter in the arena against several other men--we see Proximo telling him to entertain the crowd. --A new conversation during the time when Maximus is scarring himself in an attempt to remove the mark of the Legion from his shoulder. --Several new scenes of a subplot concerning the poor job Commodus is doing as Emperor and what needs to be done to rid Rome of his influence. --Commodus rages against a statue of his father after finding out Maximus still lives. --An execution of those Commodus believes lied to him about the execution of Maximus. --The revelation that the extremely large gladiator, Hagen (Ralf Moeller), under Proximo is a German barbarian (which adds some depth and insight into a brief exchange between the barbarian and Maximus later on). --Little more depth added to Quintus (Tomas Arana), a member of the Pretorian Guard.The Good: --The acting is superb and believable--Russel Crowe's performance is powerful and often heart-breaking. --The sets and costumes are perfect--you believe you actually are in Rome. The colors, images, and scale are vibrant, breathtaking, and immense. --Brilliant atmosphere and cinematography. --Some of the best fight/battle sequences I've personally ever seen in a film of this nature. Sure, "Braveheart" chopped more limbs, but these bouts were more personal and more face-to-face. No running-through-a-field-swinging-a-blade-randomly here. --Added footage fills in many gaps. --Among the best music of any motion picture, in my very humble opinion. I can't count the times when the music and themes from this film have wandered randomly into my mind. --Some of the best dialogue and lines of any film of this nature. A far cry above the Neanderthal ramblings of Brad Pitt in "Troy."Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help: --The added scenes may or may not be to the flavor of some people. Personally, I really liked them and the added depth to the story and characters in the film. For me, several small gaps and conversations now make more sense. No new battle footage--that was all kept in the theatrical (also Director's) cut.--At 2 hours and 51 minutes, it may be too much for some people now--but those people don't matter.The Bad: --Not one damn thing. Although, some may be disappointed by the lack of any new battle footage.The Ugly: --Many people complained about the quality of the backgrounds behind the massive sets. Frankly, they don't bother me one bit. You know why? Because a tiny imperfection in the background image in an otherwise perfect film doesn't detract from the film's power or quality in any way.Memorable Scene: --There are far too many. But for the sake of filling this in: The first time Maximus reveals himself as still living to Commodus as well as the climactic final battle between the two. Also, Proximo's Gladiators' first great event in the Colisseum--where they won when they were supposed to lose. You see? Too many to pick just one...Acting: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Character Development: 10/10 (more than the R-rated version) Special Effects/Make-up: 9/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 2/10 (quantity--based around Commodus's infatuation with his sister, some dialogue) Violence/Gore: 8/10 (quantity--all high quality) Sets/Backgrounds: 9/10 Dialogue: 10/10 Music: 10/10 Writing: 10/10 Direction: 10/10Cheesiness: 0/10 Crappiness: 0/10Overall: 10/10Frankly, if you're a fan of Gladiator or even Russel Crowe, you need to get this version of the film. If you're a war/epic/battle-film fan, you'll also greatly enjoy it. Standard film buffs--see it. Standard movie goers... well if you've seen the original, and only "liked" it or thought it was just "okay" or even "not your cup of tea," may find nothing new here to hold any interest. Personally, I highly recommend it, but then again, it is one of my personal favorite films.www.ResidentHazard.com</fullReview>

The thing I like this film is that everything make sense,everything is believable!And I'm not talking about the historical exactness,I'm talking about the reasons that follows the characters through the movie. I can truly understand them,why they are doing this or that. Nobody is the perfect one,the best,the infallible. That makes the characters vivid and memorable. It gave you the opportunity to feel sad or happy about them. Besides Ridley Scott knows how to make a hero of a man,who's not a saint,who has flaws.And somehow it appears to be better this way...! Another thing I really like in "Gladiator" is the script. Powerful,wise,ironical(but only at the right places);not cocky,not exaggerating! These are the components for a good movie,I think! So,directors,make us believe in everything you present in your movies!"We believed it once,make us believe it again!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie - in spite of its grand spectacle style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is 2 1/2 hours long and I watched it in two parts. I agree completely with "gregatory" (another reviewer - see that review) in most respects.Russel Crowe is clearly one of the greatest actors alive today. His role here is nothing short of that. Also the description of the almost impossibly gory battle scene in the beginning (as well as the gladiator scenes later), could be trivial blood and gore performances. But they are not. It is clear how brutal these things were, but the craft the the producers use to portray them makes them sensible and tolerable. What we see is the horror of war - even before anybody had a gun or cannon or bomb.Frankly, I was put off by the performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. He played a despicable and weak, palsied man so well it seemed his acting was equally bad. It annoyed me and I almost panned the movie for that. But I believe that was a personal bias. Apparently the role was just that - awful, the man was awful, that is.The second part (for me) fit together with the plot and was quite credible. Still the movie lacked something to make it absolutely great. It was also somewhat predictable - not an ingenious plot.So I rate it as very very good (8 points) but not great. As I mentioned though, Russel Crowe is great. I think, like Clint Eastwood, he is typecasting himself. His role and performance does remind me of Capt. Jack Aubrey in Master and Commander.He is definitely the Commander.</fullReview>

It is more drama than action but has more action than most action movies. The mix of the two are splendiferous at worst! One of the best movies EVER made. It says I need ten lines of text to submit my review but I feel I need no more words to review. A Recap may be in order then, Magnificent movie. Up there on the scale of Ben Hur and others.

		<shortDescription>Gladiator rocks my socks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For fear of somehow being misunderstood, I wanted to make something quite clear before I get started: this movie is awesome.Yes this movie has spectacular special effects, yes this movie has amazing battle sequences, and yes this movie has a riveting soundtrack. But that's only the beginning of how incredible this movie is. The problem is that most historical epics would be happy to stop at that and be like "oh, well at least he's wearing sandals and we have cool fight scenes." Nuh uh not here.Gladiator features an amazing cast. Joaquin Phoenix is incredible as Commodus, and makes a fairly obscure historical figure very 3 dimensional: Commodus is one of the greatest baddies in recent memory. Richard Harris is outstanding as Marcus Aurelius, and everybody else does a great job as well. Last but not least, is Russell Crowe. This guy can act. And what is amazing is that he's awesome in this movie but he's even better in other movies. He's not just a one note guy. He's such a good actor that he can say scarcely anything for about 20 minutes in a movie and still get people to understand what he's doing/thinking (as there is a point in this movie which is similar).The script is also excellent. As far as sword and sandals epics go, most are content with articulate set pieces and large scale battle scenes (huzzah!) but lack sorely in a decent screenplay soaked with character development (hissss...) Gladiator is not this way. Instead of merely trying to work around battle scenes and try to uncover a plot, it works the other way around, and the battle sequences must work around the story line. So not only is Gladiator an able action flick, but it is also an ancient political thriller.Now that I've got that out of the way, let me go back to the battle scenes, because they are just amazing. A combined effort of superb editing, heart-pounding musical cues, and great cinematography create several amazing sequences. Especially the scenes in the Colossium. I still sit there and think "holy crap, how did they do that?" Any movie lover should watch Gladiator. There is a reason it won 5 academy awards. It's not just a testosterone-pumped action flick, but a quite intelligent story and does not insult your mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is my favorite movie of all time. (MAJOR SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't get over this epic. Amazing acting with Russel Crowe as Maximus, he was perfect for the part, and I don't think i could envision anyone else playing this part. Phoenix had that intensity that was very quiet, perfect for an antagonist like Commodus. He kills Maximus' family, which consists of his wife and kids. Maximus' realizes that he needs to get his revenge. Five gladiator contests in all. First the slave fight, which was not my favorite but still pretty good. Then came the Maximus solo. That's when he started to show everyone that he was simply not going to die, even though the emperor (Commodus) thinks that he is dead after he sent assassins after him. But Maximus fought them off and lived. Then come the chariots. The third best fight. Very intense scene with all off the fighting. Following that, Maximus has to fight a tiger and an undefeated champion. Maximus lives on and beats the champion. Commodus had no choice, but to fight Maximus himself. Of course, Maximus is stronger, but after bing stabbed by Commodus, he weakens. After slicing Commodus, and then driving a knife into his throat, Commodus died. Then following that, Maximus died from the wounds, but not before he had gotten his revenge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A action/drama based in Rome around the time of 180 a.d. about a man named Maximus(Russell Crowe,L.A.Confidential)Who is betrayed by the emperor Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix,The Yards)the emperor of Rome.Maximus and his wife and son are to be put to death but Maximus escapes his death yet his wife and son did not so the emperor Commodus assumes Maximus is dead but that is far from the truth.The truth is that he has been captured by a slave trader who sells him to a man named Proximo(Oliver Reed)who makes him a gladiator "The Gladiator that defied a emperor".Russell Crowe(Maximus)Gives a electrifying performance as does Joaquin Phoenix(Commodus).Yet i found the young boy Spencer Treat Clark(Lucius)very very Annoying i cant quite say if it was his acting or the character that i found annoying maybe it was both.Ridley Scott as always flies pass the directing medium at the speed of sound.There are some extremely exciting battle sequences the gore was not out of control i really appreciate when a director can keep the gore under control now i am not saying there was no blood because there was but the way he showed the blood was quite classy.The music is extremely powerful making the movie very exciting.I really enjoyed the screenplay the actors worked very well off of each other.The storyline was very good i was only bored for a total of about 10 minutes out of the 2 hours and 35 minutes which is quite good.Best actor/actress-Russell CroweA powerful experience-Jake HydenI gave this movie a 9 out of 10Rated-(R) for intense, graphic combat9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly, I had seen enough blood guts and gore, after that ridiculous portrayal of Joan of Arc. I think if I had of watched it when released I would've not been in a frame of mind to comment with any intelligence.Maximus, as portrayed by Russ, is somewhat of a complex character. Deeply loyal to his Emperor,( Richard Harris) Stirling performance.. with a sense of true dignity, and leadership. He is, the complete opposite of Joaquin Phoenix, and that is what makes this movie so very compelling. One is a total Monster, ( brilliant performance by Phoenix) and the other by contrast A Genteel Warrior. I could care less about the rest of the props, support cast etc, except those gorgeous cats, Maximus ( Crowie) just draws you in, IMHO and that's the thing that makes movies watchable, enjoyable and plausible, whether based on fact or fiction. I gave it a NINE vote, only because...I was annoyed that he died. :):)</fullReview>

If you ever heard of The Cell With J-Lo, Vince Vaughn,Vincent D'onofrio. He say's it's Visionary, Brilliant and suspenseful. That movie was OK. But Gladiator Was Delivered to you by Great Actors. Russell Crowe. And Joaquin Phoenix. Russell Crowe Plays Maximus Decimus Meridius. Joaquin Phoenix plays Commodus Who needs to have power be the emperor of great Rome.

He sentenced Maximus to death Maximus Escapes And Goes home to find his family dead. slave traders caught him. He became a slave then Became a Gladiator. He vowed To Kill The one who murdered his family. He enters the great Arena known as the Colosseum. He fought greatly Commodus wanted to meet the great fighter.

Russel Crowe does an amazing job of playing that gladiator. he defiantly deserved that academy award. he brings his character, Maximus, to life in front of our eyes. this is Ridley Scott's best work to date i believe. his new movie a kingdom of heaven has the same feel but cant quite pull it off like he did with this one. what Maximus does in this movie is extraordinary, its like he says "what we do in life, echoes in eternity". it is a troubling movie with a sad but at the same time, happy ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What We Do In Life Echoes In Eternity; don't you just love that?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, where to begin? I must say that I've always been an ancient history buff and I was into war-gaming when I was a teenager and into my early twenties. So, I had to do some reading about ancient warfare tactics and what have you. Now, the opening battle scene was a delight. It really gave me perspective on why the Roman army was so superior to most other armies of the time. Historically, the Romans relied on heavy artillery as a first hit and continued until the armies clashed. By then, their foes where already exhausted scared to death. This opening scene really made me see it happen.That said, now let's talk about the movie. It was so entertaining. I was genuinely pleased throughout the whole movie. It was visually dazzling, well acted and all in all just plain lovely.So why didn't I give it a ten? The story was just not 100% convincing however entertaining the movie was. But although I found the young Caesar's story slightly unbelievable, it did in a way reflect the lunacy that the rulers of the era where famous for.A word about the actors: they all played their parts exceedingly well and all the parts suited them perfectly. Russel Crowe was truly great, Richard Harris was indeed Caesar and Connie Nielsen was edible (wink, wink... what can I do, I absolutely love her?!) I can't really go on about everyone in that movie, but I can say that every single one was just great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Padded out to make it feel more 'epic'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is a long film. Epic films are supposed to be long. But somehow Gladiator doesn't feel like an epic film. Sure, it deals with the rise and fall of a Roman Emperor, has spectacular battle scenes, a nearly spectacular CGI Colosseum, and everyone speaks in the clipped 'BBC English' accent that we all know they used in Roman times, but somehow the story doesn't carry enough weight.We feel bad for Maximus when he's betrayed, and we hate the villain and want him to get his comeuppance. But we don't give a toss about the Roman people, who are portrayed as a bloodthirsty mob, so why should we want them to be freed from their tyrannical emperor? It works better as a personal revenge tale than as a chapter in the history of the Roman Empire.The script is weighed down with pretentious and meaningless pronouncements ("Rome is an idea"?) and the plot is too full of coincidences. The action sequences are well executed (if you'll excuse the pun) and none of the actors embarrass themselves, but overall this is an above average film that has ideas above its station.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The General Who became A Slave - The Slave Who Became A Gladiator - The Gladiator Who Challenged An Empire...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the first time I watched this movie on TV, at my friend's place. He was all like "Aw man! You gotta see the action scenes!". So I went over to his place and watched it. We watched the battle in the start, and then he was all over the fast forward-button until we came to the scenes in the arenas. So I didn't quite know what this movie was all about, and at that time I hadn't heard of Russel Crowe before (Hey, I was only 14!).But now I know much more. The movie is directed by one of the worlds most respected directors; Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Alien, Hannibal). The cast list is also great, containing the names of such great actors as Russel Crowe, Connie Nielsen, Joaquin Phoenix and Richard Harris. The movie's soundtrack is also lovely! Mighty orchestral music composed by Hans Zimmer (Black Hawk Down, King Arthur), with a great supporting voice by Lisa Gerrard, which will make your tears fly.The movie is about a great Roman general, named Maximus (Crowe), who is betrayed by the Emperor's son, Commodus, (Phoenix) when he finds out that the emperor (Harris) doesn't want to make Commodus emperor after him, but rather make Maximus emperor. Maximus is being captured and is sent far into the wild with some Roman soldiers. Maximus is to be executed there, but he manages to kill the Roman soldiers and escape. Unfortunately, one of the Roman soldiers manages to wound him before he dies himself. When he comes home to his wife and son on a farm in Spain, he finds them both crucified. Filled with sorrow and hatred, tired from the ride and badly injured by the Roman, Maximus drops to the ground and faints.He is being picked up, and made a slave by a caravan of slavers. When the caravan reaches Zucchabar, most of the slaves, including Maximus, is bought by a Gladiator-trainer. After many gladiator-battles in different arenas, the remaining slaves travel to Rome, to fight in Colosseum. Maximus now realizes that this is his chance to get his vengeance on Commodus, who now is the emperor of Rome.Rildey Scott takes Hollywood pictures to the next level, with his brilliant fighting scenes, as well as the sad scenes. This movie is quite violent, but at the same quite sad, which is great! Because then the movie is perfect for both girls and boys.One of my favorite quotes is from this movie: "My name is Maximus Desmus Maridius. Commander of the armies of the north. General of the Felix legions. Loyal servant of the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife - And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next."This quote is from the scene when Maximus meets Commodus for the first time in the arena, and Commodus finds out that Maximus is alive.Just watch this movie, and buy the soundtrack while you're at it!As I said to my friends; There is a reason that such a great movie as Spartacus got 4 Academy Awards, while Gladiator got 5...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Gladiator' is one hell of a film to behold. This is one demonstration of the powers and wonders of film making. The original that defined the modern sandals and swords. Some how its hard to imagine anyone else other than Russel Crow as Maximus. Even by the likes of Lord of the Rings, the visuals; the story; and the characters hold together. Yeah, it's not perfect (loads of goofs to find if you like ruining films) but what we are still given is a movie that is nothing else than pure drama. To hell with the anachronisms. By the time the movie is over, you'll have forgotten all about the fact you could see the gas cylinder in the back of the chariot. For 2 1/2 hours, believe you are in Rome. Believe you are sat in the ampitheatres watching blood games. I think 'Gladiator' is well worth its experiences. And i will admit. 'Gladiator' is the only film where the ending brings a tear to the eye every time. Troy might be a wooden horse and that other Roman movie, King Arthur might be stuck on the wall. In my opinion, Gladiator will always have the heart where it counts and thats what matters most. Alright, 'Contenders ready. Gladiators ready. 3,2,1...fight'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historically inaccurate but entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Roman extravaganza is fun to watch but bowderlized in typical "Hollywood" fashion. The final scene in the Roman Coliseum is ridiculous and descends to the level of a Cecil B. De Mille circus. Aside from that the story is entertaining and the acting, generally, very good. Russell Crowe began his international film career with this movie and has gone from strength to strength in subsequent roles. An amazingly versatile actor, he holds the film together. The other strong performance is from the stunning looking Connie Nielsen's Lucilla, she is pure eye-candy. The two of them just about manage to blot out the miscast Joaquin Phoenix.Bit parts are cast from the usual suspects; Derek Jacobi's predictable performance as the ersatz I Claudius senator and Oliver Reed's slovenly and decadent Proximo. Worth a look-see but I got rid of the VHS I bought. The distortions of the truth about Emperor Comodus are just too much for this film to be taken seriously as an historical drama. It's blood and guts fantasy, nothing more.The technical aspects are excellent.</fullReview>

Therefore it so nice to hear a group of people discuss a process they obviously enjoy and confirm my thoughts. I agree that the film has a strong cast, not just the leads; Joaquin Phoenix's ability to combine evil but provoke our pity is of particular note.However, it always strikes me as an ensemble piece.

		<shortDescription>A Perfect 10, a fabulous epic, off the charts...**POSS SPOILERS**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie countless times (I've owned two DVD copies, lost the first, bought another) I've finally gotten around to comment on it. This is one of the best epic movies I've seen to date. You'll see the "glamour" of the Roman empire, one mans quest for revenge, and fantastic filmaking at it's best, with an awesome score to accompany it all (Hanz Zimmer). Even the soundtrack is great. When I first sat down to watch this film, I was taken aback by the brutality of the opening sequence, but I hung in there and I am so glad I did. If it was Ridley Scott who cast Russell Crowe in this, he should have won best director...(well he should have won anyway). First, the bloody scenes were fearfully realistic, the costumes elaborate and detailed, and the special effects astounding. The Colosseum crowd CGI created yet unknowing to the naked eye. This movie has all the elements of a great epic, war, battles, love stories, tragedy, "strength and honor", integrity, beauty, and it deserved every Oscar it received. Russell Crowe's acting was and remains some of the best I've seen on the screen so far. His response to his loss was heartbreaking, and his quest for vengeance, intense and heart pounding. With his change in status, he never changed his "character" and his performance shows it. Russell Crowe deserved that Oscar, and I applaud him. Connie Nielson was an unusual choice, but she got it and deserves honorable mention. This was also one of Richard Harris' greatest choices, he was made for the role of an emperor, we lost a great actor with his death, as we did with Oliver Reed as Proximo, the slave owner and former Gladiator. Another "newcomer" Djimon Hounsou as Maximus' friend and fellow slave/gladiator was a wonderful surprise, he was enjoyable to watch and likable...it would be nice to see him again on the silver screen. Joaquin Phoenix was another wise pick for the young emperor, we see what a fine actor he is in this film and his great potential. We know that because we hate him in it...and kudos to him for eliciting that emotion from the viewer. If you watch this film, you'd be hard pressed to find fault with it. It's so spectacular, emotionally charged, and full of talent. I still find myself listening to and loving the song "Now we are free" by Enya (played during the final scene in the Colosseum with the sad yet triumphant ending) When asked or discussing movies, I usually mention this one as my all time favorites, as "new" as it is. My only regret is that with the ending as it was, there is no room for a sequel (however although a sequel would unlikely be as great, it would have been interesting at least) This is a movie you've got to see, people will be talking about it and viewing it for years to come...don't miss it..10/10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing Epic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott demonstrated his excellent directorial skills in this epic movie. Opening with a wonderfully choreographed battle scene, Scott manages to integrate the personal strife of Maximus with the exciting action sequences, all set with the political backdrop of late-Empire Rome.Of course, when talking about Gladiator, one cannot ignore the powerful performance of Russell Crowe as General Maximus - 'Gladiator'. His icy stare, bold delivery, and convincing stunts and fight sequences made him a deserving winner of the Oscar in 2000. Crowe is well-contrasted in the movie by Joaquin Phoenix as the ruthless Emperor, longing to expand his own glory, while ignoring the needs of Rome, and the wishes of his father.One aspect of the movie that is less publicized is the musical score. Hans Zimmer did an excellent job putting together a score that captures the emotions of the movie and fitting with the historical background.My problems with the movie? Really only one: Maximus is too perfect. Is that a reason to dislike the movie? Not at all. Just being nitpicky really. To me, Gladiator had all the right tools and made the most of them, and that is why I think it is one of the top movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At its barest bones, Gladiator is the tale of a wronged man seeking revenge. That plot framework will be familiar to most, but Gladiator combats its cliched roots well, offering dizzying action, political intrigue, and powerful visuals.Perhaps the most stunning thing on display in this film is its all-around superb acting. Russell Crowe's turn here as Maximus earned him an Academy Award that solidified his stardom. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a remarkable performance as the complex and disturbed Commodus. And the late Richard Harris is notable as the great, aging, philosophical Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed (here is his last performance) and just about everyone else are also outstanding.The title, `Gladiator,' brings to mind bloody arena contests, and the battle scenes don't disappoint - they are well-choreographed and filmed with creativity and intensity. (The graphic portrayals may be disturbing to some. If you don't like films that show blood and gore, don't see this one).The Academy Award-winning special effects that resurrect ancient Rome and restore the Coliseum to its former greatness are triumphs, and the Academy Award-nominated score, courtesy of Hans Zimmer, is riveting.Some of the film is historically accurate, but most of it isn't - expect to be entertained, not informed. Plus, there are a few distracting goofs - such as the clearly breathing corpse in the foreground of several scenes, and another presumably dead man who blinks when a woman lowers her hand to close his eyes.But these few blunders pale in comparison with Gladiator's many strengths. Definitely worth watching if you enjoy a good dramatic/action film that is also worthy of being called an epic. Gladiator is an astounding experience.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*****SPOILER ALERT*****I have to say, I love this film. It is without doubt one of my top ten favorite films ever made. This is without doubt one of the most stunning Hollywood blockbuster made in the modern era, ironic considering that it is throwback to the glory days when big budget Hollywood blockbusters were all about great story and and the onslaught of an emotional context. Gladiator does everything right. The script is superb, mixing the personal story of revenge with the political angle of ancient Rome, the performances from all are fantastic and not one actor feels out of place, be it Crowe, Reed, Harris, Phoenix, Jacobi or Nielson, all have their moment and all rise to the occasion. And of course, Ridley Scott. Not giving Ridley Scott the Oscar for Best Direction was the most blatant example of day light robbery at an award session I have ever seen. As a director who has been accused of putting style over substance, here he gets the balance right. He awes us with a fantastic overhead shot of the Coliseum, and then moves us during the final moments when Maximus enters heaven and returns to his wife and child. (Special kudos must also go to Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerard for their fantastic music, haunting and beautifully emotional, it is one of the best music scores that has ever accompanied a film).The real star here is Russell Crowe. He may be a hell raiser and famous for getting into fights, but he shows us what a versatile talent he is here with a performance that is one of modern Hollywood's true greats. How can one not fail to be moved at Maximus' discovery of his dead family. The scene is superb, with Crowe giving the scene his all, while his chemistry with Oliver Reed is second to none. Having these two trouble makers on screen is superb, and Reed, had he not have sadly died during production, would undoubtedly have seen a renaissance after this film, and possibly an Oscar. The delivery of his speeches to his gladiators are without doubt some of the stand out moments of the film.Overall this is a superb film, one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in a very long time. Undeniably this is a classic in the making.Gladiator, I salute you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott's Best Film To Date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. Although Gladiator is not my favorite Ridley scott film (that title belongs to Alien), I do believe it to be his best achievement. Gladiator features things Scott has improved upon from his past movies. Gladiator features some great acting, impressive direction, and very satisfying visuals.The acting is a major strength. Russell Crowe applys himself in this role and does a very good job, he is a perfect gladiator. Connie Nielsen does an admirable job. The standout is Joaquin Phoenix, who is brilliant as Commodus, he makes the villain so deliciously evil that hes impossible to like. The supporting cast all do strong jobs too.There is a dark tone in Gladiator. Its especially evident with the scenes between Commodus and his father. Also, between him and his sister.The film also has stunning visuals. Great Sets, Good Cinematography, and Stunning Costumes. The Visual Effects are also top notch. The fight scenes are also expertly filmed. A Film with all these stunning visuals may lack a good script, but this film does not. Its script may not be its biggest strength, but it is well written. The film also features a rousing score. Gladiator pretty much remains entertaining throughout, it is a violent film but I wouldnt say its gratuitous. Gladiator is definitely worth your while to see. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best epic movie in our times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best movie in the year 2000 was the Gladiator, which was directed by R. Scott and written by D. Franzoni. The main actor is Russell Crowe.The film was set in Ancient Rome . One of the characters is Maximus Decimus Meridius, loyal servant of the Emperor of Rome Marco Aurelius, who is betrayed by the Emperor's corrupted son the prince. When his family is murdered and he escaped death,he returned to Rome to seek revenge as a gladiator.I enjoyed the film because, in my opinion, all the parts of the movie were wonderfully performed and directed. The costunes are according to when and where the story takes place. Another important aspect is the scenery that is surprising, for example when the Gladiator has to fight against the Prince in the majestic Colleseum.I don't recommend this movie, I simply tell you: "You MUST see this film!" I you don't, you will miss the best epic story of the last years.</fullReview>

After the risible and derivative `Hannibal' Ridley Scott swiftly redeems himself with his stylish and impeccable direction in `Gladiator'. I've never been a big fan of his work (I think `Blade Runner' and `Alien' are among the most overrated movies of all time) but this proves to me that he is a good director. The cinematography is sheer brilliance and the recreation of the Colosseum is magnificent. The rest of the settings are indeed superb and the play of dark shade on Rome adds to the atmosphere. The score by Hans Zimmer is equally impressive and accurately timed. The acting standard is also very good and there are great performances all round. Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar he received. Jaoquin Phoenix is dark and moody, as the evil Emperor Commodus (seems a bit like a take-off of Nero). Connie Nielson gives a much needed, international break-through role.The good thing is that `Gladiator' balances out drama with gruesome battles. There is enough blood here to please all `bloodsporting actioners' yet plenty of drama to enlighten the `cinematic elite'. So overall, Gladiator was well deserving of its Best Picture Academy Award and goes for enjoyable fiction instead boring facts and figures. 7.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GOOD MOVIE BUT BAD CHOICE WITH RUSSELL CROWE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be a an outstanding epic but the choice of Russel Crowe for the lead roll was a pathetic choice. Russell Crowe is only capable of his two usual arrogant and stupid expressions and how this constitutes acting beats me.Readers may be interested to know that Mr Crowe is a rich kid not from the down side of priviledge, as he claimed in his Oscar speech.A gladiator would be expected to be rather muscular in stature and Russel crowe is an unfit and flabby old boy.Anyone who considers him to be an actor of more than pathetic ability is a conned hollywood stardom desperate. It is obvious that the film industry is capable of marketing any crap to iconic status.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must be the most overrated film of the last 30 years. I have sat through the idolisation of David Finscher, the rise of Michael Bay, and "The Matrix" becoming the philosopher-film of my generation, but I draw the line in the blood-soaked sand at the attention given to this movie. Three hours long when it should have been 90 minutes, the film has little to go for it apart from Russell Crowe's glower and a wash of grainy CGI effects. I will never understand how Joaquin Phoenix, who is a descent actor (Just watch "To Die For") managed to get an Oscar nomination for aping Malcom McDowell's performance in "Caligula." Am I really supposed to feel touched when Maximus returns to see his family dead; a scene from countless better films? If that is enough to move the hearts of people these days, than for God's sake send me back to the silent era.Rent Spartacus instead</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have people forgotten what a GOOD movie IS??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am as amazed as confused at how anyone could find this movie anything less that a masterpiece. A triumph in acting, special effects, directing, setting design, costume design, plot, dialogue, and anything else associated with movie-making. Long ago, when movies were time-spent productions, when only one movie would come out in theatres a month, when a movie earning 4 stars wasn't a rarity.. this was the time when audiences knew how good some movies could be. (Hence all the classics.) It's frightening to see today what movies have become. With 3 movies coming out each week, sometimes many more, it's hard to determine the quality from the "merely entertaining". Some movies have their moments. Almost every one does. A funny one-liner, a cool death scene, or a wicked plot twist. But this doesn't make up a good movie. That isn't what it's all about.What also needs to be realized, is that when someone thinks of a movie as their "favorite movie" or a movie that they "hated", they are merely saying their opinion about it, which has nothing to do with the movie itself. Obviously what one person thinks of as a great movie is not the universal definition for cinematic greatness. (I remember my brother feeling betrayed when Corky Romano wasn't nominated for an Oscar). For example: what one person may hate about a movie, another person may love about it for the exact opposite reason (An overprotective parent may hate this movie for it's violence, while if it had been cuddles a bunnies, some "macho man" may have hated it too.) Truly these are not grounds to be judging movies. However, there are universal traits for movies which one can rate a movie on. (Acting, story, etc.) Perhaps this is why we have award ceremonies. Because some people can't decide for themselves what good acting really is.As a serious movie lover, these are my strong opinions. I am merely trying to make sense of all the negative comments about this movie.(God I wrote a lot!) My opinion about it anyways:: In my opinion Joaquin Phoenix MADE the movie. (My FAVORITE actor!) Russell Crow was great in this type of role, but Joaquin did an AMAZING job. He was able to portray the bad guy but with soul (Something VERY difficult to do.) This was obviously overlooked however at the Oscars. The Academy must have forgotten how much easier it is to be the guy everyone loves, the "good guy". The story itself seems to be the reason we loved Maximus. We felt sorry for him. We wanted him to win. Whereas Joaquin was just so damn GOOD at it, you HATED Commodus within the first 5 minutes. He was so damn good at being bad. You must judge good acting NOT only by how well they preformed, but how into character, and how believable, and how 3-D their character was(not always in the actor's control), and how hard their role was to bring to life. I know this is becoming a Joaquin praise rather than a review, but I think this was the BEST I have ever seen him. BESIDES Joaquin, the MOVIE is nothing short of spectacular. A true movie is inspiring, it's good at what it does. (In this case it can make you cry for an hour after the movie's over, feel suspense, and realize that this is more than fiction which little people do.) We need to remember that this stuff really happened. Obviously being 2000 years from the time it took place, it isn't entirely accurate. But than again, when was the last time a documentary won Best Picture? Would any of YOU see a documentary with such enthusiasm? Would it have made enough money to pay for the lavish settings and costumes the crew would have to create? NO!! Which is why it is a MOVIE. Besides, for NOT being a doc, it actually IS pretty damn accurate. Almost all the characters were real -except Maximus- and the fact that Rome was/is real at all is amazing enough. The recreations of everything to the gravel is breathtaking. The sets are so beautiful and real, you feel immediately as though you are in ancient Rome. Also the corruption and insanity that was going on with the politics back then is also there. They were murdering each other left and right! (Due to the lead poisoning.)So the themes fit as well.It is also a very simple yet powerful story which any decent human being can sympathize and relate to. So in short, it really IS a good movie, not worthy of the ignorant, inane comments by some who probably couldn't tell a Shakespeare masterpiece from the Nutrition Facts on a Snickers Bar.~Rhea</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is just a cross between Ben-Hur (who is made a slave while his family is imprisoned by a naughty Roman bureaucrat) and Spartacus, the slave-turned-gladiator-turned-revolutionary. Fine, I can deal with that. But shouldn't a film about Roman times at least attempt to make viewers feel like they're in ancient Rome? Instead, we've got what almost appears to be a video game about colliseum fighting, with rapid moving, computer-generated adversaries slashing about and losing their heads almost out of theatregoers' sights. CGI has its place in the cinema I'm sure (though I have yet to see a film that utilizes it effectively), but not here. Watch it to pass time and for a very mild thrill, but expect no more.</fullReview>

Please hollywood, give me something more like Die Hard where he comes out of the experience bruised and bloodied rather than just kick everyone's butts on his own in a matter of seconds and is pretty much unscathed.

		<fullReview>Its too bad this film has such a loyal fanbase right now, because it is a complete waste of time and film. This film was made to appeal to the Academy, but actually had nothing special in it except for maybe its budget. Russell Crowe is terrible, and I don't know when everyone will realize it. He can play one character and one character only, that being the smart-alec dead-pan monotone type. I liked him in The Insider because that was the first movie I saw him in. His acting style suited the part very well. Then I saw Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind and realized how bad he actually is. His characters are all the same and never allow the audience to see any emotion, and don't allow us to buy into his characters' motivations. Russell Crowe wasn't the only terrible one however. I don't think a single character was likable or even remotely interesting. This film is just another example of a good plot that was ruined by the actors and director. Its too bad the Academy only focuses on domestic gross and a movie's ability to look "cool". Only redeeming factor in this movie was that it could hold the viewer's attention, thus I give it a 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me this is an action movie with good special effects and nothing more. There are some good views of imperial Rome which were particularly nice. The acting was average, but the story mediocre. The charcters of this story are all black and white - extremely pious or very bad.spoilers********** Marcus Aurelius Roman emperor, the father of Commodus (the villain of this movie) was a nice guy who wants to transfer power back to the Roman senate, nicely suiting our 21st century values. Russell plays a General, with liberal politically correct views and a nuclear family living somewhere near the suburbs of Rome. Commodus kills his father, and then turns against Maximus and kills his family and he is forced to flee and take employment as a gladiator. Maximus finally comes to Rome and fights in the Colosseum, Commodus recognizes him, foolishly challenges him to a fight and gets killed. Much of this doesnt make any sense, and the acting is pretty wooden. I do like the fighting scenes; but it is no better than Arnies "Predator" which seems better off than the fake scenes here.rating 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly enjoyable hokum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is hokum. Let's begin there. It's highly cheesy - but it's quality cheese. It's nice cheese. I like to eat this cheese.The premise is absurdly simple - Maximus Meridus (Russell Crowe) loses his family and his command after refusing to pledge alliegance to the psychotic new Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix) because Commodus is a loony and killed his own father to gain power, fearing (rightly) his dad was about to dissolve the role of Emperor. So he ends up being a gladiator and uses his skills to rise up and get a chance to wreak vengeance. So no points for plot and there a few historical inaccuracies but hey, it's Hollywood! We expect it..It's the acting and conviction placed into the characters that helps move this movie upwards. Crowe is great - and hey he won an Oscar for his role here. Real sense of the gritty determination he has and check out his "And I will have my vengeance - in this life or the next" speech- fantastic fun. Joaquin Pheonix camps it up a little as Commodus and is devilishly enjoyable as the slimy, lecherous, cowardly ruler. Fun fun fun. All the other plays similarly play well here.Ridley Scott puts enough energy into this movie to draw you in. Sure you can argue the battles are done with flashy fast moving camera work in a bid to distract you - there's some truth to that. So what? It looks nice. "Gladiator" doesn't have pretensions on being a highly morale and deep tale - it's a fun blockbuster! It's slick and well done. Maybe you can detract points for Zimmer's overly present musical score or the overly heavy imagery of wheat-fields etc. but in the end it doesn't matter. "Gladiator" doesn't have enough to make it one of my favourite movies but it does have more than enough to lift it above the general dross. A well deserved 7.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that will not be remembered 20 years from now as a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love good action films, the kind that entertain and enthrall, and every once in a while leave a viewer in awe. I love gladiator movies. Since childhood, I have been a fan of swordfighting and swashbuckling melodramas, as most young boys are. There is nothing wrong with the fun in them, because every once in while a great one like "Spartacus" and "Braveheart" comes along, a truly epic film that not only pierces the eye, but the imagination as well. Those films were not just spectacle, but had real heart in them. They contained stories that worked with enough good writing and direction to move beyond just a popcorn flick. The film "Gladiator" did not. I know people love this film, that even many critics called it a wonderful success. In that light, I tried hard to like it. I sat down twice in the theater and once at home to give it an honest look, but sadly, a new revelation never came. At best, it is just an action flick, and since I love these types of movies so much, that label saddens me all the more.Here is my argument. Many claim that the action scenes were the best they had seen. I thought those claims were simply caught up in the flashy technique that was used, but not the resulting experience. Director Ridley Scott used quick cuts and blurry hand-held camera work to film the fighting scenes, copying much of the same style that Spielberg introduced in "Saving Private Ryan"'s opening sequence. It places the viewer almost inside the battle with the same kind of confusion that a soldier might feel. All fine and dandy in a modern battle that uses guns and explosives, weapons that require little skill to use or watch on screen, but in mid-evil warfare, I would like to actually see and understand the fighting with swords that takes a focused camera to capture. It can be done. "Braveheart" gave scenes just as strong in action, and much more understandable. those scenes were enthralling, and are still the standard in my opinion. Sadly, every action scene in this movie was much the same: blurry, quick cutting, not easy to understand, and therefore not easy to enjoy. I wanted to scream at the screen "Just let me watch the fighting!!!" This movie was not trying to make some great statement about war or its time, like the Spielberg film, and therefore did not need to go all artistic for not reason at the moment the crowd is supposed to sit back and enjoy the ride. Since the action let me down so much, it was now the job of the plot to pull me along.There were many things that worked in this film concerning the plot. The actors were very good, particularly Richard Harris in the beginning as Caesar. Many scenes worked by themselves, but did not really add up to a complete picture. Often I felt like the characters were acting a particular way not because the story had given them any real motivation to, but because the plot required it for the moment. When Maximus was needed to be mad, or noble, or depressed, or vengeful, or hopeful, or hopeless, he simply was. The man was a rollercoaster of emotion in this film, but his reason for being such was not consistantly shown. A plot cannot drive the characters, it must be driven by them and what they would actually do if they existed. While it was all handled well by Russel Crowe, a fine actor, it made me feel manipulated as the viewer.Overall, it was a popcorn flick, a movie to entertain, but to challenge, and certainly not to win an Academy Award, the worst presented in years. The special effects were very noticable, made so to appear "wowing", but they detracted from the reality instead of enhancing it. I do not understand why people think "Gladiator" is greater than it is, a movie that will not be remembered 20 years from now as a great film, unlike other films that were nominated right along side of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must See.... but Braveheart was better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one that must be seen. Full of action, great acting, screenplay, everything. I have seen the movie "Braveheart" and I find that this movie tends to copy too much of "Braveheart" and this is the only thing I dissaproved of in the movie. The Gladiator tries to act like Mel Gibson, look like Mel and talk like Mel (probably because they are from the same birthplace). But if you must have an actor that portrays too much of another actor, you might as well have that actor that is being portrayed in the movie instead of somebody else. The plot and theme of "Gladiator" is also like "Braveheart". let's face it, if you've seen "Braveheart" because that one came out before "Gladiator" then you know what "Gladiator" is all about. Even almost the ending of both movies are close to the same. I enjoyed "Gladiator" very much, I give it an 8 but too much of the same thing in two different movies is hard for me to get into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator is a slightly flawed, but never the less entertaining, blockbuster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator provided one of the very few enjoyable movie-going experiences of 2000.David H. Franzoni's screenplay is adequate. It's clichd and doesn't introduce any new ideas or concepts to the genre but it is still entertaining. The cast does a fairly nice job at giving life to their roles. Russell Crowe does a great at putting the human back in the hero in his role as Maximus. He does a good job at bringing ferocity and nobility to the character of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is pretty good as the disturbed villain, Commodus. Some of Joaquin's more emotional scenes are a little over the top and hammy, though. Oliver Reed is wonderful at bringing a hardness and edge to the character of Proximo. Connie Nielsen and Richard Harris also give commendable performances.Hans Zimmer's score is fantastic. During the battle scenes it is effectively powerful and energetic and during the more dramatic scenes it is very sorrowful and mournful.The set and costume designs in Gladiator are very good; they bring out the splendor and glory that was ancient Rome. The CGI effects are acceptable but sometimes it is evident that the images seen on the screen were generated from a computer. Ridley Scott is in top form as usual; the film carries his wonderful stylistic flare.Pietro Scalia's editing, and Scott's direction brings the grisly battle scenes to life. Scalia utilizes quick cuts for the battle scenes, which prove to be very effective. His editing does falter however; at times the film tends to drag on a bit too long. John Mathieson's cinematography is one of the films poorer qualities. The camera movement is occasionally too bumpy and some of the images appear to be too murky and dirty. Overall, Gladiator is a good film; one of the few enjoyable films of 2000.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragedy of symbolism over storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The expectations of this film are enormous,, given the hype and popularity surrounding it since release. The acclamation accorded it is , no doubt, explained in part by cinema audiences having been starved of Roman epics for so long. The same phenomena influenced the hype of many early 90s westerns, few of which merited serious attention (Tombstone and Unforgiven)Anyway, to return to Gladiator the viewer must always be wondering where is the plot, the story?. This is not a movie for the impatient, however, neither is it a movie for a patient viewer seeking true immersion in the story. The story is simply too ponderous. I always felt that I was watching a film and perhaps this is the worst crime any film can commit; the failure to let the viewer escape into its world and pretend for a period that this (the story)is actually happening - now and that he/she is a privileged witness to the events. None of the actors provide their characters with more than one dimension. Russell Crowe looks superb in the stills but in motion he delivers no more variety of emotion than Dirty Harry (or worse Chuck Bronson in the Death Wish series!) Oliver Reed provides the few positive moments of feeling and passion. Mr Phoenix has 2 superb scenes as he murders his father and later when he threatens his nephew's life. Both are powerful, although the former is derived from Bladerunner - when Roy Batty crushes the skull of Tyrell.In the end we have a film which tries hard; delivering top stars; strong cinematography; an action charged setting but ultimately lets itself down by spinning a boring yarn. For a more entertaining version of similar events see The fall of the Roman Empire (1964).</fullReview>

At first i thought it was just going to be a one of those blood thirsty over the top films , how wrong could i be . It had me gripped all the way through ,i could not take my eyes of the screen once. It has everything i like in a film it has action so it doesnt get you bored it has a hearty element so that you can walk away from watching the film and feel like you were somehow part of it and it is one of those film that makes you want to see it twice because you dont quite beleive what you have just seen.What really compliments this film is the colliseum scenes which were to me so enjoyable it is a action packed thrill ride all the way . Russell Crowe does a fabulous job as Maximus , i am glad he was given the role instead of mel gibson because i dont thing gibson could of done the part right. As always his acting was of high quality and was worthy of the praise it was given.He definitely looked the part and has never made a roman warrior look quite so handsome. Joaquin Phoenix is also a fabulous actor and handled the role as comedos really well putting alot of feeling into his performance , he deserved to have gotten a best supporting actor oscar for the performance. Connie Neilson looked the part and was another great element to the film , i feel her acting was underated as she was the only women i think who could have carried of that role as superbly as she did and she was another one of the films great attributes that should have done better at award ceremonies. Most of the praise for this film should go to ridley scott who as always made an incredible film that hollywood should be proud of. Along with some other fantastic films he has made surley this puts him among the best directors in hollywood history. It is obvious alot of work has gone into this film and to be it has paid off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen many of the films that came out last year, but there's no way the AMPAS is telling me that GLADIATOR is the best one of all of them. Anyway, I thought the movie was okay. I don't think I'll ever forget it, but it wasn't that good. What I like was the sense of masculinity I felt while watching it. The costume design was awesome, the score was good, and the set decoration was also good. But the cast was sort of boring, the characters didn't have a sense of humor and all of them were always bitter and they all act the same. Russell Crowe did a good job though. I thought Joaquin Phoenix's character weeps and wines too much; how could a great cesar raise someone who's the exact opposite of him? And how come he is always kissing everyone? And the battle scenes could've been better. I didn't enjoy them too much because they're built on messy close-ups of blood rather than strategy. No one in the audience could tell what's going on during the fight scenes because the camera was always pointing in the wrong direction and when it was pointing in the right direction, the scene would change chaotically. For example, when the horses on the chariots kept crashing, I was too busy trying to figure out why they're crashing instead of enjoying it. And the sound kept skipping too! I thought HOLLOW MAN should have won best visual fx instead. But who cares!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is a corny shoot-em-up movie with a plot about as simplistic as Star Wars.....hence the Oscar for Best Picture. The special effects were good (not as good as those in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), but the story was just plain lacking; a man with some fighting skills has his family killed, is imprisoned, forced to fight, and eventually kills the source of it all in a thoughtlessly and simplisticly set-up battle in the end of the movie. I mean, what the hell was the emperor of Rome doing fighting a gladiator in a colosseum in the first place? Did the writers not know how to end the movie in a more clever manner? Stabbing Russel Crowe in the back with a knife didn't "cut it" for me, no pun intended. Gladiator was entertaining, and was certainly worth some form of an Oscar, but it was definitely not "Best Picture" material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie redefines "overrated." It is nothing more than a paint-by-numbers revenge tale in which Russell Crowe does his best impersonation of a wooden board for a couple of hours. A more boring experience at the movies I cannot recall. And, to me, the worst part was the subpar special effects. This is something that you would expect a movie with this director and budget to really excel at, but in reality the fight scenes are just terrible. The animals in the Colosseum are clearly computer-generated, and their presence in these scenes provides nothing more than a chuckle. Unless you are a masochist of the highest degree, I would advise you to steer clear of Gladiator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another over-rated classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever a new Ridley Scott movie appears, I can hardly contain my indifference. He's way too variable in terms of quality for me to get excited about a new release: Alien is a great movie, Thelma and Louise is nothing special, White Squall is pants, and G.I. Jane was surprisingly good, but I'm the only person who seems to think so. With this track record, as I walked into Gladiator I was less expectant than Adam Sandler on Oscar night. It turned out to be worse than I thought.Gladiator is an epic-by-numbers. Sweeping shots over cities, a couple of thousand extras wearing togas, a few seconds in a battle scene where the music turns to silence and the direct-o-matic uses a different shutter speed... Seen it all before. While everyone else was dropping their jaws, my thumbs got busy with the twiddling.If you're going to make a movie where the audience can root for the underdog, you should at least blur the lines a little. Gladiator's heroic goodies and hissable baddies are so obvious even Spielberg would have complained. For the Autobots, we have Russell Crowe. He gets fired from his job, sentenced to death, manages to escape only to find his wife raped and his children murdered, is sold into slavery, forced to perform in front of bloodthirsty crowds as a gladiator, loses his car keys and steps on a dog poo. For the Decepticons, we have Joaquim Phoenix, who killed his own dad, ordered the deaths of Crowe and his family, forces people to fight and die for his entertainment, wants to do his sister, and kicks puppies in the teeth. It's as balanced as a see-saw with Jabba the Hutt on one end and Calista Flockhart on the other.It has pretensions above the action movie it knows it really is, and it's at those points that the film moves from boring to laughable. We're told, over and over again, that gladiator fights are brutal, that the crowds are disgusting for watching, and that the men are unwilling to take part. It was at this point I phoned Amnesty International to see what we could do to stop this barbaric sport. Are we really learning anything by this? It's in these moments, too, that the film's hypocrisy becomes obvious. While the viewers are weeping at the injustice of it all, they're also excited by Crowe's muscular heroics, and the slo-mo, pop-promo style used for the bloody fight scenes. We can condemn the audience in the colosseum for enjoying it, while happily stuffing popcorn down our faces and cheering when Crowe stabs another gladiator. Is he the only one fighting against his will, or are the people he kills innocent victims too? Who cares? We've moved past the pathos now, we're on to the fight scenes. Carry on Cleo had more emotional impact.The ending is as predictable as possible. Did anyone really think it would end with Phoenix still in power? The only good thing about the ending was that it actually had one. Three weeks into the movie I was starting to have my doubts. Overlong, over-rated, add it to the list of undeserving modern classics.</fullReview>

And can anyone want to defeat the bad guys without killing off the family? Hollywood, AGAIN, fed us another movie, filled with special effects, and a used up story. Damn computer animation, and the abiltiy to come up with a simple story that moves you without hitting you in every sense but the brain. I did shed a tear at the last scene. Kudos for that one.

		<shortDescription>The most strong feelings: disbelief and frustration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to talk about the historical truth - one should not expect this from epic movies anyway. The problem is - I cannot understand where is this meaningful 'plot' in this movie. A Roman prince cannot dispose of a slave? (recipe: kill him silently, then kill at the Arena someone who looks similar). One cannot kill a sleeping man (s)he wants to be dead? (this man IS reachable and how about a poison instead of sleeping pills?). A new emperor suffers from a lack of female attention?(does word 'hetaera' ring a bell?).But the above is not the worst. The worst is the characters. They are flat and lifeless. Chess pieces have more personality. In the real life if a homo sapiens does something, this means he has some reason to do it (this reason may be an emotional one but it does exist). Not so in this movie. If Commodus does something, it serves only one of the purposes: to show how evil he is, or to advance the 'plot'. Don't try to find a reason or to understand why he does something - the story-writer wants him to do it and that's enough here. Maximus - see above but replace 'evil' with 'good or suffering'. Lucilla exists to build schemes , to be the weakest point of these schemes and to be a woman (almost the only one in the movie). That's all. Behind almost every scene I see a shadow of the story-writer who wants this scene to be that way - no matter does it make any sense or not, no matter if such scene is even slightly possible. Frustrating.Don't get me wrong - the movie is beautiful and visually detailed. But I expect of a movie significantly more than to be a set of beautiful pictures.2 for the story and 10 for everything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is a movie which is definitely worth watching! It has stunning action sequences (such as the initial battle scene), incredible visual effects, and a gripping, interesting story. Crowe does an excellent job, but Phoenix, as Commodus, is the one who probably deserves the biggest applause. And the computer-generated reconstruction of the city of Rome at the peak of the Roman Empire's grandeur is simply breathtaking!I would say this is one of the best movies ever... if it wasn't for the ending. The little speech that Lucilla gives after the final fight between Commodus and Maximus was the downpoint of the movie - it is so typical of big Hollywood studios to insert a final "message" by a character as a learning point of the movie. This movie does not need any messages or learning points: they are very evident. The final speech takes away all of the excitement from the recently-finished fight, and all grandeur from Crowe's character, since Lucilla steals the end. It was disappointing, and reminded me it's just another Hollywood movie, even though the rest is very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was without doubt one of the worst messes of a film I have seen for a long, long time. I hated all but the first 5 minutes - it took the film that long to alienate itself from me.Here are the charges I level against it: 1, boring 2, pathetically unbelievable plot 3, deeply homophobic - the villain was "anti-man" and to make the point stronger he was presented effeminately. In one scene we see him pouring lustfully over his sleeping 8-year-old nephew. The fact that he also sought sex with his sister does not remove this charge, this was simply to add to his unnaturalness. 4, appalling computer graphics 5, needlessly gruesome violence that managed to glamorise violence and reduced us to the level of the crowd watching the gladiators in the colloseum. 6, too long 7, the actor playing the villain was entirely unintelligible.One good point was Russell Crowe, but he should have known better than to get embroiled in this disgrace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top 250? Not even top 1000, sorry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How has Ridley Scott pulled the veil over everyone's eyes? The camera-work in the first battle scene is disorienting and intentionally blurry to avoid showing anything in detail. The dialogue, from start to finish, is unrealistic- both on a human level and a Roman level. If you want to incorporate historical figures into a fictionalized account, treat them as historical figures, not perversions of historical figures with the same names. Marcus Aurelius was not a 2000 year-too-early Thomas Jefferson. Whatever Hellenistic notions of democracy the Greeks held to, the Romans repudiated until the disintegration of their empire. I laughed awkwardly (to mask my offense and disbelief) when Aurelius lets his daughter know what an impressive "Caesar she would have made had she been born a man." What utter nonsense! Furthermore, the character of Commodus is not so much miscast as it is botched in the person of Joaquin Phoenix. Russell Crowe acquits himself nicely in his performance as Maximus, but is his story of revenge really that sympathetic? The computer generated Rome is impressive, but not even on a par with the Rome of Julie Taymor's recent "Titus." And what is this odd, recurring cornball shot of Maximus parallel to the ground as the grass moves under him? The production value of Gladiator is high (at times), but someone should've hired a proofreader and BS detector.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! and again I say WOW!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every so often, a film comes along that seems to have just about everything : a compelling story, incredible acting, fine sets and costumes and music. And -Gladiator- is such a film. Russell Crowe gives an extraordinarily textured performance as the central character Maximus, a warrior-poet who chooses private life over public ambition and then finds his world turned upside down. (IMHO, Mr. Crowe should have been the winner of this year's Best Actor Oscar for his work in -The Insider- ; the performance he gives here merely serves to reinforce that conviction.) Connie Nielsen is radiant as Lucilla, daughter to the late emperor Marcus Aurelius (finely played by Richard Harris). Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, and the late Oliver Reed also deserve kudos for their performances. But it is Joaquin Phoenix whom I found the most intriguing. His Commodus is that film rarity : a "round" villain...if indeed that word even applies in this case. The character's motivations can be understood, and, even if the choices Commodus makes cannot be approved, at least one can sympathize with the twistedness foisted upon him that leads to such choices. Nine stars out of 10. (Be forewarned: The violence is a bit heavy-going at times...but the Romans didn't build and maintain a worldwide empire by inviting folks to a tea-party!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A traditional matrix + the highest level of performance = An excellent motion picture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I entered my local multiplex with an endless dose of scepsis about `Gladiator' convinced that it's going to be just another popcorn entertainment project of modern Hollywood postoriginality, and it is in some way, except it's, in my opinion and my experience, a lot more. And that makes him more than just worth seeing.The creators took a traditional matrix of old Hollywood spectacles and then did one of the hardest screenwriting jobs today and that's to lay a modern superstructure on top of it, balance the pieces well, measure the chill, the drama and the romance correctly and finally construct the visual performance in a manner which stories of this magnitude deserve. The creators did all that amazingly powerful, convincing and emotinally hammering bringing todays artistic conscience and computer techinque abilities to the borders of possible never going over the line or overdoing the performance to make it in discrepancy with the given plot. HOWEVER ...... They did a crucial job to the film's final quality by rewriting the original draft which, among other differences, had a happy end, and that's something that proves that they knew what they were doing. I was very afraid, to say at least, that it will be a conventional happy-end-movie, and was prepared for that conclusion already seeing Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen kissing in front of the sundown in the closing shot of the film, and if the original draft wa kept in the final version of the movie I would be even more disappointed than I was preparing to be, because the film was constantly promising a lot more than that kind of conclusion. I can't express how relieved, satisfied, moved and touched I was when that didn't happen.I have to say that the intro battle in Germania and the fight between Maximus and Tiger are two of five most spectacular action sequences I've ever seen in movies, the `big fight' at the end one of the strongest finales in history, and the end altogather delivers one of the most moving conclusions in recent times, and one of the most important in history of the world, too.All actors give strong performances, I myself was especially impressed by young Joaquin Phoenix and his magnificent portrayal of Commodus - one of the most repulsive, and yet believable bad guys I have ever seen - and also by his unique ease in snapping from character in one style of performance and film to another completely different, diametrically opposite one. The performance by young actor who playes Lucius will be the unsung one, although I hold that the kid was so good and convincing in his behaviour for the period his character's in, that he deserved a lot more screen time.I was sincerely moved by the film in a lot of ways a film can get to you, and think it's a proof, more than welcome one, that Hollywood can still make great, full-blooded movies which get under your skin even without much originality or genuine artistic idealism that always heads for the development of new approaches to storytelling. Or maybe `A traditional matrix + the highest level of performance' is a way to go if a lot of new Hollywood products will have the final quality of this one. In another words: Be excellent motion pictures. Because this one certainly is.</fullReview>

All this movie was missing was Russell Crowe on his knees in the middle of his destroyed home shouting at the sky: "NOOooooooooooooooo!" a la Charlton Heston in "Planet of The Apes." It's kind of a Roman-period-piece-meets-Braveheart-meets-Lion King-meets-any-Van-Damme movie.Ya got yer costumes-- ya got yer battles -- ya got yer PC circle-of-life thing (complete with circle-of-life soundtrack) -- ya got yer "ya-killed-my-family!" revenge thing going on. There's even a bad guy that's only a few thumb-suckles away from being Prince John in Disney's "Robin Hood." Oh, and fer the "adults" yah got some complicated politics a personal redemption story and unrequited love and stuff. If this explication sounds like a mishmash, it's because that's what this movie is.Some of the more laughable instances:1) Germany, Spain, Rome &amp; Morrocco? all less than 1-1.5 days horse-ride from each other.2) Killer tigers that like to give juicy hero-types a big hug while the hero has time to feel for a good space between their ribs for a death-strike.3) A bad guy who's about as dumb as a box of rocks. I was lauging out loud with my friend while he was giving his "busy-busy bee" speech. This guy gave me a new appreciation for Sting as Fayd Haarkonen in "Dune."4) People who like to put dangerous poisonous cobras on a table for funsies. The snake did a *lot* of hissing, and I knew the foley artists where just *itchin'* to dub a rattle-snake-rattling sound into that scene.5) Dead-meat slaves who get to massacre the rock group "Gwar" not once, but twice in a coliseum.6) and many more too numerous to mention...Constant happenstance and hokum punctuated with blood and barbarism do not a good movie make. Substitute the words "chaos" and "catastrophe" for "blood" and "barbarism" in the last sentence and you have a statement true of "Titanic." In fact, this film was far closer to "Titanic" than anything else I can remember. There's even a dead-person's-delight scene at the end -- just like in Titanic.In fact, I could go so far as to say that "Titanic" was the "chick-flick" version of what this is, and "Gladiator" is a "guy-flick" version of "Titanic." Maybe the scripts were spit out of the same computer-program with the "Testosterone Mode" radio-button selected in the Preferences dialog-box.Movies like "Ben Hur" and "Sparticus" shouldn't even be mentioned in the same paragraph as the film I've been writing about for the past 20 minutes... ;c)10 possible-1 for hokey Lion-King spiritualism.-1 for doing the nearly all the standard action cliches.-1 for the absolutely horrible villain.-2 for variation on "Titanic" themes/feel.--------Rating: 5 "Yet Another Shlocky 'Blockbuster'"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never written a review before but thought that it would be nice since I saw a sneak preview of this movie last Tuesday... This movie was spectacular. I thought it would be very boring and I only went because we got free tickets to it. The story is about Maximus (Russell Crowe), a general with the Roman forces. He knows the Caesar, Marcus Aurellius, and Marcus Aurellius wants him to take over when he dies. When Marcus Aurellius tells his son Commodus about this, he gets really mad and kills his father. No one knows that Marcus Aurellius wanted Maximus to take over, so Commodus does and proceeds to try to execute Maximus. He sent out men to kill him, but didn't realize he wasn't slain. He also killed Maximus's family. Maximus is found and becomes a slave. All he can think of, though, is how to get revenge on Commodus. This movie is brilliantly acted and gets 9 stars by me. The beginning of this movie is a war against barbarians and is not too graphic. I would have rated it PG-13 if it wasn't for the small amounts of gore. All in all, see this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a huge fan of Braveheart, I must admit my skepticism before I saw the sneak preview of Gladiator tonight. I was expecting a derivative action/adventure flick; decent, but not spectacular. What I got was an amazing film...an epic of Braveheart proportions, not a cheap rip-off as I had expected. Needless to say, my feelings going into the movie were dead wrong...it was terrific. Russel Crowe was a strong and believable hero, and he has certainly become one of today's premier leading men. The casting and costumes were superb, and the story was simple yet powerful. I don't want to give anything away, as the movie has not yet been released in theaters, but I will say that this is a must see for any movie fan. Though it was a bit long (2 and a half hours), the story kept moving, and there was plenty of action and laughs to keep the audience interested. The theater was packed for the sneak preview, and everyone left talking about how great the movie was. My vote is a 10 out of 10.....this one is extremely entertaining...GO SEE IT!!!</fullReview>

As well written as the film was, Crowe delivers an excellent performance as Maximus, making it nearly impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a great performance himself playing Aurelius' son Commodus who assumes the role of emperor after his father's death in an underhanded manner. Phoenix's portrayal punctuates Commodus' despicable demeanor. This film transports you to the era in the theater. It's totally engaging and shot beautifully.

		<fullReview>First of all, the CGI is terrible and mostly gratuitous. I don't see why the director couldn't shoot some REAL natural landscapes for Crowe's psychedelic flashbacks. As for Rome, it was all obviously fake, computer generated crap. Not a single sparkle of authenticity. I won't deny the utility of special effects, but I can't be alone on this one. CGI has cheapened the epic by inserting flat digital figures where beautifully three-dimensional human extras once stood, and by creating green-screen worlds that never have the depth of real locations. Watch ?Lawrence of Arabia" for example and you'll feel the difference. What a sad irony that a film made 40 years prior to ?Gadiator" gives class to contemporary cinema...Secondly, the action was excessively violent. I won't even discuss the historical accuracy. The only bright spots are Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, both over-the-top in a pretty entertaining way. Russell's presence is overwhelming thanks to a spectacular physique and charisma... but not even his amazing acting skills can't save this movie. The music by Lisa Gerrard wasn't necessarily bad, but redundant when applied to (over)emotional scenes. That's the way to manipulate crowds: play the violins and let the blood/tears flood the screens. By the way, Gerrard's music was infinitely better and more properly used in "The Insider".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott at His Most Laughably Serious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely ridiculous bit of sword and sandal nonsense that wouldn't have been so objectionable had not director Ridley Scott and his cast taken the damn thing so seriously. It didn't help matters any that it went on to win the Best Picture Oscar, the dumbest pick since perhaps "The Greatest Show on Earth" back in 1952 (though that film is far more entertaining).I guess the Academy felt they had shafted Russell Crowe the year before when he didn't win for "The Insider." That's the only reasonable explanation I can offer for how he managed to take the Best Actor prize for this. If you're dying to see Crowe in a loin cloth, run don't walk to your Netflix queue to add this one. But if not, just rent "Spartacus" and be done with it.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable but rather nonsensical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit I'm somewhat puzzled by the highly-marked reviews and Oscars dished out to this movie. I watched this on Blue-Ray for the first time yesterday, and my partner really enjoyed it - she'd give it two marks higher. Me, I found it occasionally good, overlong, treacle-paced, with a lot of one dimensional characters and stock situations. And a horrible, stupid ending.Gladiator follows the exploits of General Maximus (Russell Crowe), successful military commander, being betrayed by Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix), who usurps his Roman Emperor father Marcus Arelius (Richard Harris). Finding his family brutally murdered, Maximus is captured by slavers who sell him to a Gladiator school run by former Gladiator Proximo (Oliver Reed) And from here Maximus sees a chance to avenge the murder of his family.In truth the movie is rather far-fetched but with some stirring combat sequences. The opening battle in Germania is not particularly well-staged (Cavalry charge through a forest?) I have to admit I found the chief merit in the film to be the performances of some of the actors. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed are excellent, as is Joaquin Pheonix, who unfortunately appears to be acting in a different movie from everyone else. He gives a sensitive portrayal of a descent into madness (never once does he go over the top) but the film is really crying out for a black-hat villain, and is weakened overall by the character of Commodus. You feel the senate would usurp him easily, and the Roman political scenes are hopelessly inadequate in capturing the spirit of Rome.Russell Crowe is extremely dull and wooden in the part of Maximus, and I can only assume that Oscars are awarded largely on the strength of studio campaigns. Crowe himself has given much better performances. The music is also a very clichd variation on Mars The Bringer Of War.So, if you don't expect too much you might like it. To me it's far from a great movie. Ridley Scott has made many better films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott rarely disappoints with his films. All of them, including the unjustly-maligned Legend, are visually stunning and just show the director's artistic genius. Gladiator should be up there as one of the best films he's done, if not the best. Almost everything on screen is very graphic, making some scenes upsetting to watch, but the visuals are just outstanding. The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant, especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role, and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent. The costumes are brilliant, as well as the sets. In conclusion, Gladiator is a near masterpiece, only marred by some upsetting scenes. 9/10 Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't go on describing what this movie is about but only my impressions of it. The battle scenes were enjoyable enough especially the ones where Crowe was joined by his fellow gladiators, yet it's the acting that's the problem with this film, it's very wooden, nor is it very intelligent. The emperor has the courage and brain of a little child and this was in contrast to the "courageous" and "honourable" Maximus. It's way too predictable and clichd. The dialogue is dull and boring and the way it was delivered is just laughable, there is no expression whatsoever just wild declarations. Oliver Reed's performance as Proximo was the one shining light in this otherwise mediocre film.</fullReview>

More than that.. more than a tale, a movie, a fiction writing video.. this movie is about hope, faith, love and yes revenge..

		<fullReview>How did this movie ever win best picture, and why do people like it so much? It has some of the worst dialog in the movie I have ever heard, and Connie Nielsen's "acting" just made me want to throw up. Not to mention the abysmal plot where there are several problems: 1) We're made to think that Commodus is a bad emperor mainly because he killed his dad and wanted to sleep with his sister. 1st thing wrong about this is that wanting to get laid with his sister doesn't have anything to do with being a bad emperor. 2nd thing is if I was in Commodus's situation, I would have killed him too for not letting me be emperor for some stupid general played by Russell Crowe.2) The general won a couple fights and suddenly he's everyone's favorite action hero.3) It's the same tired old revenge plot we've been seeing in movies for years with nothing added to make it interesting (see Kill Bill for that). Also so what that he killed his wife and son too; it's better to get them out of the way then to have them coming for revenge after killing dear old dad (although they probably wouldn't have done much), and they were not even in the movie, so I really didn't care (see Star Wars for caring that family members die).4) Problem 3 led me here about how in movies they always leave the main character alone in an easy situation he can get out of instead of just killing the loser while he's being held. (see Austin Powers for making fun of this Hollywood trend)5) The emperor would never get in a ring to fight a slave, especially when he knows he's gonna lose. How stupid! (see Spartacus for gladiator fights with purpose) Well I'm sure there's more, but these are the ones that anger me the most.Anyway there were some things I did like about the movie which are some of the action scenes were intense and exciting, and the music by James Horner was pretty darned good and enjoyable to listen to. Too bad that it wasn't part of a better movie.If the Academy wanted to pick an action movie as best picture, they should have went to the far superior Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.</fullReview>

One day I gave it away without regret.

There aren't too many screen actors that can be on the screen and you can imagine them leading an army or hoard of men with their strong wills, courage, and personality, Crowe has this screen charisma. Errol Flynn had this and the list is very short, no, not even Mel Gibson did it in Braveheart. Anyway, Ridley Scott and the screenwriters, special effects people and a list of actors that could not be improved upon to give us almost three hours of grand entertainment.

		<shortDescription>A massive epic, Ridley Scott's work of art - Simply a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is, to me, one of the best films ever made, probably even in my personal Top 10 Movies of All Time -list. It's a massive epic motion picture that pleases your eyes and ears with effective visuality, drama, romance and more. The story tells about a Roman general Maximus who gets betrayed by an evil prince. By the acts of the prince, Maximus's family gets murdered and he wanders into sorrow where tears won't be spared. He then finds himself captured to become a gladiator among other slaves, but he still seeks for revenge. Maximus tries to keep himself alive in battles which he is forced into, only that he might someday take his revenge against the evil prince. The story has so much more in it, but I'll just leave the rest of it for the viewers, as I certainly do not want to give away any spoilers.Like I already said, the story is simply fantastic. It's so deep and touching, being very original at the same time. Despite of the movie being a massive epic one it still isn't clich at all, it just maintains the level of drama in a level that doesn't go over the top. It has a nice flow too and there is no boring scene in any part of the movie, every scene matters and every scene is significant in its own way, that's just how incredible the storytelling is. The building of the main character, the whole theme from victorious to sad, from sad to anger and from anger to a satisfying ending, everything goes like it's supposed to. The creation of the world has been achieved terrificly well; The sets, the dressing, all the details, basically everything. Although there was a lot of CGI used in the creation of the world, the CGI department deserves a big plus on making everything so believable and realistic. Everything looks smooth and soothing, just the way you want it to look like. You can't complain, really.What comes to role performances, well, in my opinion Russell Crowe does an absolutely phenomenal role performance as Maximus. The anger, the sorrow, all the expressions and body language, just great. I don't care if Crowe is an asshole in real life, because whatever they say in the press he still is an amazing actor. He has actually become one of my favourite actors because of his past role performances, he is just everything a director wants from an actor, performing every role flawlessly. He does have that sort of a rough appearance, but he can play a nice guy too. What comes to other role performances there is one more to mention; Joaquin Phoenix. To be honest, I've never liked Phoenix that much, don't know why, but I have to admit that he is too an amazing actor. As the evil prince Commodus he is that brilliant fierce himself again, a perfect actor for an evil role.This is by far Ridley Scott's best film yet to date and when Hans Zimmer's music is put on top of the cake you just can't go wrong with that. The directing is superb and the music is magnificent. Like mentioned above the directing consists of mixtures of genres; Drama, romance, adventure and action. Every department is handled in superior way, in a way that leaves your notebook blank on the side of the faults the movie would suffer from. The music has this main theme in it, which is beautifully composed, including that beauty and also thrill and intensity. "Gladiator" is all in all a tremendous motion picture which everyone should see, a born legend some could say. Fantastic story, phenomenal role performance by the lead actor, superb directing and beautiful music; All this compile a film that I can't imagine to be a disappointment to anyone, a definite 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

Phenomenal camera work, passionate motions, colourful landscapes, lifelike wounds and a wonderful casting. Hans Zimmer composed amazing music from the beginning to the end of the film. Furthermore, that Enya song, Now We Are Free, is one of the most expressing soundtrack for me in film history. All the fights were perfect and dynamic, and the costumes and helmets...everything just at its potential! Russell Crowe deserved his Oscar, his performance and his victory are such an incomparable ones I have not seen on the screen before. He represents all in his actions that I want to become. Through his moral, he gives an unforgettable memory to me that I am very grateful for, indeed. Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus was a great choice but he still has to wait for his Oscar, though he did an amazing job as well.11 OUT OF 10 or 6* OUT OF 5* is my final judgement.Thank you Russell Crowe, well done!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) is murdered by his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Aurelius's designated successor, General Maximus (Russel Crowe) is betrayed, becomes a slave, a gladiator, finally a the most popular gladiator in Rome, and kills Commodus before he himself drops dead of an unfair wound. Rome is turned over to Senator Grachus and is saved. Commodus's sister (Connie Nielson) has a son who will become the next emperor. Actually, that happy return to a Republic is tacked on, isn't it? Dictatorships continued till the end.I kept trying to figure out just what elements distinguished "Gladiator" from the earlier sun and sandal epics of the 1950s, like "Herculus," usually starring some beefed-up parody of a male figure like Steve Reeves, or "Ben Hur" for that matter.Obviously "Gladiator" is more expensive and the special effects more especially effective. And, thank God, unlike Steve Reeves' epics the movie isn't dubbed, so nobody sounds like Orson Welles gargling."Gladiator" is darker all around than almost all earlier movies of the period. Cinecitta was always so sunny and its weather so balmy. There's a moment near the beginning of "Ben Hur" when Judah and Massala meet and Massala removes his decorative metal cuirass and reveals the soft scarlet cloth beneath it. It's a neat splash of color. There's nothing like that in "Gladiator." The Romans all wear dark clothing, usually black. And their armor is spiky-looking and abrasive, as if influenced by some video game or by Dungeons and Dragons. I guess the Senate wears white but even their robes are drained of brightness, so that they resemble the sheets that my laundry dryer produces. And sometimes it's cold too. Snow falls and the Romans wear fur robes. Pretty ugly stuff.The dialog isn't dubbed but the Foley artists have been hard at work generating the expectable clichs. No sword can be drawn without the slick sound of sharp metal against metal. And God forbid that a sword be thrown through the air without going whoo-whoo-whoo. If one of these behemoths swings his weapon it's invariably accompanied by a swoosh or a wheeesh. I don't know why. It doesn't make the motion more compelling in any way. It's a distraction because somewhere in the viewer's mind there must be the realization that if you swing a piece of metal through the air, it simply does not swoosh. The sounds of battle aren't the only clichs. The "thumbs down/ thumbs up" business for death and life was, I think, borrowed from an improvisation in a Cecil B. DeMille movie, not from the historical record.Award for best performance: Richard Harris (his last movie) as Marcus Aurelius, the emperor who is at least as well known for his philosophy -- he was a stoic -- as for his martial exploits. Imagine -- a head of state who can have an original thought? "Death smiles at all of us and all we can do is smile back." Award for best-looking and most succulent actress: Connie Nielson. She couldn't be better. I don't know about her performance but she looks absolutely right for the part of the bitter widow, abused by her own brother, hopelessly in love with a man she'll never have. She's beautiful, sensuous, elegant, and as cold as polished steel.Best imitation of Steve Reeves: Russel Crowe, he of the enormous trapezii. I wouldn't want to get in the arena with that guy. His performance? Well -- he tries to laugh at one point.Best bad guy: Joaquin Phoenix isn't bad as the evil, cowardly, deceitful Commodus. It wouldn't surprise me to find that he had an amphora stuffed with ladies' lingerie. I'll give him a pass on insisting on incest, inasmuch as Connie Nielson is the victimized party. But, man, what a creep; no longer the teen age beauty, slightly more plump, and with a thicker voice.Is it worth seeing? Well, of course! Could anything on which so much expense had been lavished NOT be worth seeing? And it's thought provoking too. The thought it provokes is: what is it in human nature that prompts us to watch innocent others suffer and die violently? No? You don't have to look long on the internet to find video clips with titles like "Iraqi gets blown up," or "Marine has arm shot off!" We can smugly dismiss "the mob" of Romans for their barbaric tastes but we can't pass a highway accident without looking for some mangled limbs. Hell, we revel in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Price "Truth"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is an entertaining movie. It is NOT historically accurate, or even plausible for that matter. Here are a few facts: -There was a Roman Emperor named Commodus who reigned from 180 to 193 AD (not as one reviewer mentions, "around 100-50 BC").-Commodus loved the "bread and circuses" of the arena and even engaged in gladitoral combat. Commodus was a skilled swordsman, but his fights were almost always rigged so he had a distinct advantage over his opponents. For example, a fully armoured Commodus, with helmet, sword and spear, would fight a naked opponent armed only with a net and a trident. He recorded 753 victories in as many fights.-Commodus was NOT killed in the arena. He was poisoned by his servants and then strangled by a wrestler they had hired, just in case the poison didn't work fast enough.-No Roman general named Maximus ever challenged Commodus in the coliseum.Now, I have no problem with a certain amount of dramatic license, but "Gladiator" goes beyond plausibility. If the real life Commodus had faced a challenge like the one poised by fictional General/Gladiator Maximus, surely there would have been a tragic "accident" in the combatant's quarters and Maximus would have been easily eliminated shortly after his arrival in Rome. Given the absolute power and infinite resources wielded by an Emperor of Rome, it's highly unlikely that such a challenger would have gotten as far as Maximus did in the film. But hey, that's what makes movies fun: the "what if" factor. Still, to blatantly lie about how an actual historical figure meets his death is, well, it's dishonest, and a little dangerous, too.Will future generations applaud a film in which Adolph Hitler is gunned down by heroic Allied troops instead of committing suicide in his bunker? Is that acceptable? Does it matter? I think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A second-rate sword-and-sandal movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could have been an excellent movie if it had set its sights higher. Unfortunately, the director settled for Hollywood mediocrity.Joaquin Phoenix is impressive as Commodus, but Russell Crowe's Oscar seems to have been a belated reward for earlier work. He is a talented actor, but nothing much is asked of him in this movie apart from going through the motions. And the motions themselves are often laughable. The movie opens with the general using siege engines against German infantry, firing heavy flaming arrows that are designed to set wooden buildings alight.Even worse, he leads a cavalry detachment into the rear of the opposing force while the missile are still raining down. We have all heard about casualties from "friendly fire", but no competent general deliberately invites such a disaster. Richard Harris, as Marcus Aurelius, was clearly relieved that such an idiot had managed to win the battle.The later action scenes were ludicrous, with lots of quick cuts to obscure the fact that the stunt work was nonsense. Where else but in a Hollywood movie could a group of gladiators overturn a heavy chariot by holding their shields down like a ramp? The real result would have been smashed arms. Russell Crowe then unhitches a chariot horse, catches a thrown sword, and rides between two other chariots, slicing the drivers as he passes. What ever happened to the knives on the axle shafts? His horse would have lost its legs.Near the end of the film, the climactic duel scene in the arena was farcical. In real life, the mad Emperor Commodus announced his intention to lead a group of gladiators, widely regarded as scum, in a procession, and his mistress had him murdered the night before in order to avoid a riot by the outraged populace. In the film, Commodus does something just as outrageous, apparently without offending anybody. He elects to put his life on the line to fight Crowe in the arena (despite being overdressed for the occasion), and predictably comes to a sticky end ? just like the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And Ridley Scott ain't Stanley Kubrick! Scott's sort-of remake of the modestly brilliant and richly emotional Spartacus and the horrendously bad Fall of the Roman Empire is a visually breathtaking epic that has almost no soul. I can't think of a reason to watch this movie other than to be entertained by three hours of close up violence, dazzling computer graphics, Russell Crowe's manliness, Connie Nielsen's loveliness, and Joaquim Phoenix's pree-versions.Done with the movie? You've got nothing to show for it.I don't worry too much about the myriad historical inaccuracies, such as the Roman Republic being reestablished at the end of Gladiator or Marcus Aurelius being murdered (if you have a clue about Roman history, you've just got to grin and bear it), but it's the reliance on the razzle-dazzle of the computer over the emotional depth of the characters that wears Gladiator down and leaves it bleeding in the center of the arena. The opening battle in Germany is eye-popping (and stomach-turning) in its recreation of a fight between Crowe's legion and a pack of Teutonic mouth-breathers. You're supposed to be impressed and hooked, but then the internecine backstabbing, betraying, and incestuous hanky-pankying start and you're left waiting for the next trip into some North African arena where you can watch people get disemboweled in the same grainy fashion as in Saving Private Ryan.It's all very appealing at a lizard-at-the-bottom-of-the-brain pan level (When I saw Gladiator in a theater in Ontario, Oregon, I heard a kid complaining, "When are we gonna see her (Nielsen) naked?"). Front-load the gore and the kink, dazzle the viewer with recreations of the Roman world, and you don't need to get past Russell Crowe's growling and Phoenix's fussy sickness.Gladiator is emotionally empty. Stick with Kubrick's slave revolt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the movie in the theater for the first time I said it was OK. Not a great movie but worth seeing. Of course this is mainly for the battles that are amazing. And the score to the movie is fair enough. But I had a feeling that there is something wrong with this movie. It seemed that this is a replica of Braveheart. Only in Braveheart I got emotional without wanting it and in Gladiator I wanted to but I couldn't, It just wasn't so. The next time I saw it on DVD I noticed that each time I waited for the fights, because everything else is dumb. The plot unveils in turtle pace, the dialogs are over dramatic, it just like all the characters will burst with tears in minute after they say something. The most annoying thing is the plot itself. The characters look very unrealistic and unconvincing, a lot of time is wasted on unnecessary talk and the end can be predicted from the beginning.Well, a little bit of history for the end. There was an Emperor Marcus Aurelius that was considered as a "good" emperor, that ended the era of "the five good emperors". His son that succeeded him was Commodus ( just like in the movie ), but he's not killed his father. Marcus Aurelius died from a disease. Commodus himself was an excellent fighter. He fought with his father in the north, and after he became an emperor he tested himself each time in the coliseum arena with the gladiators and the beasts, and won each and every battle. Commodus killed by an athlete called Narcissus in his bath. Commodus considered himself a god and wanted people to think of him the same which can be viewed as insanity but for sure he wasn't weak and Coward as he was portrayed in the movie. He also ruled for 12 years, something that the movie doesn't count for.One commercial movie for Ridley Scott, but definitely one of the dumbest he made ( there is always G.I.Jane for this title ). Go see Alexander. Much closer to history, much better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The photo is excellent. The acting is great. The score is superb.In the end, though, it seems that this movie is more inspired by Fall of the Roman Empire (the Alec Guiness film) than real history. It even seems to take pride in being historically incorrect, making the horrible King Arthur (the Clive Owen film) look like a fully correct historic textbook.Some issues:#1: The emperor Commodus was quite a lunatic character in real life too, but he would never try to face the best gladiator in single combat, even if he got to wound him first. #2: No legions were ever allowed to enter Italy (unless there was civil war) during the era in question. To have a field legion from Germania wintered in Ostia is incredibly stupid and incorrect. If the field legion is in Ostia (which is very close to Rome, being Rome's port), who ever is guarding the germanian border? #3: Even if Maximus could have returned to his legion in Ostia, what difference would it have made? There were 10.000 praetorian guard and 20.000 "police"-like troops in Rome at any time. I admit that those soldiers were much worse than hardened legionnaires, but how would the legionnaires get through the very impressive walls of Rome? All Commodus would have had to do was to lock the gate. #4: How could Maximus be captured as a slave? That was not the way slave traders got their goods. To make a roman citizen a slave is unheard of. To make a legionnaire a slave is even worse. A deserter? If he was a deserter, he would have been slain, not made a slave. #5: No, the republic would not be reinstated. Not even the senate wanted that at most times, especially in 180 AD when there had been 84 years of very good emperors that the senate loved. Even when there were bad emperors (such as Commodus, Caligula, Caracalla and Nero) who were murdered with the senate's approval, the senates first goal was to get a senate-friendly emperor on the throne, not reinstate the republic. Interestingly, that was exactly what happened when some senators actually had Commodus murdered in AD 193 (yes, thirteen years after the death of Marcus Aurelius). The senate remembered the Roman Revolution, 100 years of crisis in the late republic, saved only by the emergence of the emperor. Only nutcases wanted the republic system back, because it had proved unfit to govern an empire of that size. #6: You should definitely not mention the reinstatement of the republic in front of the next emperor in line. That would have been high treason and, as I said above, a sign of your own stupidity and non-understanding of politics. #7: There were 600 senators. There were no secret police worth the name yet in 180 AD. You could not "have every senator followed" #8: People would have been offended if someone threw bread on them in the Colosseum. Bread was free in Rome, available at your local bakery.I realize that a movie is allowed to change history if needed for its plot, but here I do not feel that those changes are needed.I could go on with unhistorical stuff. How could Tigres expect to face the leading gladiator and win if he had been retired for five years? He obviously did not have much time to train. Compare a MMA fighter of today returning after five years retirement facing a champion. That would never work. Tigres never stood a chance.The parallels with Fall of the Roman Empire (which is a better movie) are interesting. If you liked Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius (and he was good!), wait till you see Obi-wan Kenobi do it. I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Gladiator. It's moving and makes you really feel absorbed by the Roman world, as director Scott aims. It doesn't matter if many historical details are not right. Scott depicts the period as an excellent painter and the screenplay is full of beautiful sentences that remain impressed in your memory. Russell Crowe is absolutely gorgeous in the virile role of Maximus, the general/peasant/family-man who becomes a hero not only because he is an excellent soldier and leader, but mainly because of his humanity and his solidity (strength and honor! ), his principles and his moral values. Leader/manager roles suite Russell Crowe best. His voice impresses: he can roar like the tigers he fights against in the arena, but he is also able to whisper love words in the sweetest way. He definitely deserved the Oscar for this movie, certainly also for other movies like A Beautiful Mind, but especially for playing Maximus. The plot may be simple, but the study of the characters' minds and the historical period are what really matters in this movie. The actors' performance is splendid. The unrelenting, massive fight scenes can be appreciated also by a woman when they are breathtaking and are depicted like that. Gladiator made me think of certain characters in Shakespeare's plays, who live as if they were caught in the "wheel of history".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's really nothing spectacular about "Gladiator". The acting is stiff because of the boring and sometimes non-sensible script. Ridley Scott's direction is choppy and forced. It reminded me more of one of his brother's movies. I love Russell Crowe but the fact that he won Best Actor for this and not for "The Insider" or "A Beautiful Mind" just doesn't make sense. To me he just seems bored in some scenes. I wonder if the Oscar voters watched any of the other films from that year because this sure wasn't better than "Traffic". Of the 2 and a half hours running time, there are really only 30-40 minutes of excitement. The rest is average at best and the ending is just ridiculous. THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC. "Gladiator" is a good film but does not deserve the praise that it is given by most on this site. I give it a 6 now but my opinion for this film drops every time I watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i don't understand how a movie so crappy like this one ever got this high rating. first i must say that ridley scott is considered by me an awfull director. alien was the only good movie he ever directed. blade runner is totally overrated, black rain shouldn't be considered a movie, 1492 is completely ridiculous, black hawk down is one of the worse war movies i have ever seen and hannibal is only an ok film.the plot is ludicrous. a gladiator, former army man, that begins a personal vendetta against the emperor and finally gets away with it? i don't think so. there is also this kind of love story between him and lucilla that is totally out of place.cast is awful. russel crowe is dull as maximus and he certainly doesn't look as a gladiator. he had better performances in "a beautiful mind" and in "l. a confidential". joaquin pheonix is absurd as usual, let's face it, this man can't act, a few tears doesn't prove him a good actor, pitty river phoenix is dead (that was trully a good actor). richard harris is poor as marcus aurelius and oliver reed is surprisingly bad as some sort of gladiator manager.still, the movie has some good points: drek jacobi is very good as a senator and the first battle scene is a real joy. but this two things doesn't save the rest of the movie.i almost forgot: it's very overlong, seems like it will never finish. 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A combination of all the best parts of Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart, and The Lion King, Gladiator opens, carrying itself like the great Roman war machine portrayed, then grabs the viewer and drags them through the story of Maximus. His adoption into the gladiator lifestyle is almost as intense and emotional off the battle field as it is on. Where Braveheart called for the audience to laugh or be shocked by the images on screen, Gladiator carries a much more personal feeling to their battles (mainly due to the size), allowing them to rile up much more emotional steam that has ever been seen in a war epic. A veiwer must wonder as they watch, is it right that I support the brutality, is it right that I am rooting for a man to kill another? It's quite an emotional movie, wait until you see it.Despite the moral conflict, the movie is still amazing. Russell Crowe is, as always, amazing, and Joaquin Phoenix has turned what is probably his best performance of his career. Ridley Scott's directing is excellent, keeping true to the worn, hot, aged feel of a gladiator movie, while at the same time, incorporating many techniques to heighten the experience, going inside the minds of the characters.It runs around two and a half hours, not too long for a Gladiator pic, and is naughtily entertaining. Lots of blood. Lots of gory battles. Lots of extremely exciting battles, everything a gladiator movie should have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roman empire, 180 a.c. Maximus is a popular general. In fact, he is so popular in the empire that Marcus Aurelius wants him to take over the throne after his death. Aurelius' son Commidus doesn't like that idea so he wounds and exiles Maximus and kills his family. Maximus swears revenge and after becoming a gladiator he gets his chance..."Gladiator" is one of the reasons why the Oscars are loosing their reputation. By giving this stiff and pompous movie 5 awards, including the ones for best picture, while in the same year ignoring much better films like "Memento", "Crouching tiger, hidden dragon" and "Almost famous" proves the academy jury is still deluded by long, 3 hour epics, even if they are not that good. I could say I liked this film too, but that would be a lie - quite frankly, it was too long, unexciting and only marginally emotional.------- After the brilliant "Blade Runner" Ridley Scott has started disappointing me big time. The only thing we learn about this film is that a gladiator shouldn't turn his back to an emperor. The rest is a lame revenge story which copies too much from other epics ( e. g. Maximus is stroking the peaks of grass, just like Costner did in "Dances with wolves" ). The surprising thing is that I found Stone's "Alexander" to be equally good as the "Gladiator", but for some reason while one film is being called trash, the other one is being hailed. So why is everyone in love with this film? I guess the thing is just like with Mr. Chance in the movie "Being there"; people see only what they want to see.Grade: 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you not entertained?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films deserve the title 'Masterpiece'. Being able to capture the emotional impact, dramatic force and all around power of what we would consider a masterpiece is simply beyond most films that make their ways to the cinema these days. I think it's fair to say the Gladiator is one of the very few films that does not fall short of expectations. Instead, it easily surmounts them, drawing the viewer in, and forcing out of them every possible emotion by it's sheer power. We can't help but cheer when Maximus strikes down yet another foe in the arena, we can't help but boo and groan with malcontent as the purely evil Commodus (there's no other way to put it) plans his next scheme. Gladiator manipulates our emotions in a way that is fantastic to behold - Hans Zimmer's beautiful and majestic score keeps the mood flowing, and the simple story is brought up by the sheer scope of the production and the incredible performances driving the film.It's been said so many times by now, but Russell Crowe is nothing less than magnificent, easily deserving his Academy Award for his performance. His stunning performance drives the film, and keeps the audience engaged throughout - never once can we take our eyes off him, or be drawn out of the incredible story he draws us into. Joaquin Phoenix, playing Maximus' nemesis, the scheming Commodus, is stunning. The sheer evil he exudes must be applauded, as his paranoid, arrogant, power-hungry dictator is slowly but steadily forced out of the favor of the people by Maximus is breathtaking. We develop a genuine hatred for Commodus, and openly cheer whenever Maximus wins public favor over him. Few villains have matched Phoenix's ability to be genuinely vile to the core. Connie Nielson is also terrific as Commodus' strong-willed but fearful sister, living in a web of apprehension once her brother takes power over Rome. Oliver Reed, sadly in his last performance, is great as Proximo, the slave dealer, who as Maximus puts it, is "in danger of becoming a good man". Djimon Hounsou is wonderful as Maximus' loyal fellow slave and gladiator, and Richard Harris is a strong presence as Marcus Aurelius, the previous emperor of Rome, slain by Commodus' murderous ambition.I am hard pressed to find any flaw with Gladiator. It excels in every possible area - wonderful set and costume design, a superb musical score, top notch performances, and an overall sense of power which cannot help but draw you in, and let the viewer witness the majesty firsthand. Are you not entertained? At the very least, you should be.-10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rambo of Rome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of Peplum films (or Sword &amp; Sandal) and having enjoyed previous films from Ridley Scott, I was surprised by how disappointing GLADIATOR was.The first thing that stood out is how badly shot it was. The DP (and Scott) missed the boat on this one. The film's constant greyish tone was off putting and uninspired. It tries to give the film a realistic look but comes across as forced and in the end more fake than anything else. Because the look of the film wasn't believable, the film's other weaknesses stood out even more, like the acting. Except for Joaquin and the veteran cast, the acting was sub-par. Crowe is monotonous, almost sleepwalking through the entire epic. He can't really be blamed as his character is as one dimensional as possible. He acts like a robot, an unstoppable robot who kills everyone in sight. In one scene, Maximus enters the stadium grounds and proceeds to kill a dozen other gladiators, one after the other, in a single run. The scene is so ludicrous that the reality of the film flew out the window and couldn't get into the predictable story with Maximus reduced to a Roman version of Rambo.The monotonous look of the film also can't camouflage the obvious CGI which today looks even more cardboady than it did 9 years ago. To make things even more tedious, the entire film is a direct rip-off of Anthony Mann's THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, which, albeit wasn't great but at least it respected the intelligence of its audience, unlike GLADIATOR which is the fast food version of history. All of this could have been overlooked had the film been entertaining on some level but the slow pace, ponderous tone and predictable story killed all possibilities for it being entertaining. It's not a fun film at all.In the end, GLADIATOR, which won the Oscar for best picture (it must have been a really bad year), is not even remotely memorable in any way shape or form. Give me a vintage Italian Sword &amp; Sandal flick, like THE REBEL GLADIATORS, before this inert Hollywood production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OVERRATED TRIPE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, what a piece of overrated tripe.I must admit. Entering "Gladiator", I had high hopes. Russell Crowe is one of the best actors working today. Ridley Scott, who directed, is one of the best action specialists in cinema. It was an entry in that old, venerable genre: the Roman swords and sandals epic. I must report that all my good will went down the proverbial toilet.Ever heard of the experiment that if you take a worm that has solved a maze, grind it up and feed it to other worms, those other worms will be able to solve the maze? Well, screenwriters William Nicholson, David Franzoni and John Logan must have taken the scripts to "Ben-Hur" (1959), "Spartacus", "The Fall of the Roman Empire", "Quo Vadis" and countless other Roman epics, ground them up in their Osterizer and handed over the gloppy result to DreamWorks.The film had Oscar-winning special effects. Brother, don't let the Oscar fool you. These are some of the worst effects I've ever seen. The nauseating sight of the shoddy masses make the black fingernails of "The Children" look great by comparison.The acting is so...dull. Tip to all budding filmmakers out there: when you put such powerhouses as Crowe, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed in your movie, let them do what they do best. A real shame that this will be Reed's last credit; he was capable of so much better. Crowe loses for "The Insider" and "A Beautiful Mind", yet he wins for THIS?Ridley Scott's direction is devoid of the energy and skill he usually puts into his work. Scott's credits are a rollcall of greatness: "Alien", "Blade Runner", "Legend", "Thelma and Louise", "1492", "Someone to Watch Over Me". This is the first mediocre film he has made. It makes me wonder if studio interference hampered his work on "Gladiator". It's just so out of place with his other films.The Academy awarded "Gladiator" with the Best Picture Oscar. They always say "History repeats itself". We are now back in the era of mediocre Best Picture winners. I think those people who champion "Gladiator" are unfamiliar with the great Roman epics. I suggest a little experiment: watch "Ben-Hur", "Spartacus", "Fall of the Roman Empire", "Quo Vadis", "The Robe" and "Demetrius and the Gladiators", then watch "Gladiator". Then see if "Gladiator" is so great then.** out of 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overhyped movie, entertaining but mostly fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many critics blasted this film yet Hollywood fell in love it. Because of the critics I did not watch it until it was shown on HBO. I was appalled with its historical inaccuracy.Basically, Russell Crowe plays the role of a General in the Roman Army under the Roman Emperor Ceaser Marcus Aurelius, who many historians consider as one of the greatest Roman emperors. Marcus died while in Germany in 180 AD. His son, Commodus became the full emperor and made peace with the Germans.It is at this point that the movie departs from history. In the movie, just befor Marcus Aurelius died he was going to appoint his successor. The fact is that he appointed Commodus co-emperor in 177 AD, three years before he died.The movie makes the point that Marcus Aurelius had no confidence that his son was suitable to be emperor. That much is true and the movie asserts that he tried to appoint someone else to succeed him. That is untrue. If he considered Commodus unfit to rule, why did he make him co-ruler? Because if he hadn't, under Roman custom, his son had to die if he was not made the successor.The story gets more bizarre as it goes on. Russell Crowe escapes execution by Commodus and his family is slain by Commodus, who does not know that Crowe is not dead. As cruel as Commodus is, it is unlikely he would have killed the family of Crowe. It would have served no purpose. In the process Crowe becomes a slave gladiator and winds up in Rome fighting as a gladiator before Commodus. So highly unlikely.I won't give you the ending but it is pure fiction. However, I will tell you what really happened. In 182 Commodus' sister Lucilla conspired with a group of senators to assassinate him. The plot failed, and Commodus retaliated by executing a number of leading senators. Thereafter, his rule became increasingly arbitrary and vicious. In 186 he had his chief minister executed in order to appease the army; three years later he allowed the minister's successor to be killed by a rioting crowd. Political influence then passed to the emperor's mistress and two advisers.Meanwhile, Commodus was lapsing into insanity. He gave Rome a new name, Colonia Commodiana (Colony of Commodus), and imagined that he was the god Hercules, entering the arena to fight as a gladiator or to kill lions with bow and arrow. Finally, when Commodus announced that he would assume the consulship on Jan. 1, 193, dressed as a gladiator, the public became incensed. On Dec. 31, 192, his advisers had him strangled by a champion wrestler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott's artificial epic isn't very impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's Oscar-winning ersatz epic is one of the least spectacular big-screen spectacles ever sold to an undemanding public: a sand-and-sandal throwback stripped of the genre's all too necessary guilty pleasures. The idea was to recreate for today's digital generation a wide-screen Roman Empire costume drama from Hollywood's pre-video adolescence, but all the fancy computer imagery (and state-of-the-art budget) only makes the new film look and sound more solemn and pompous than its beefcake role models. Worse yet, the occasional token nod toward old-fashioned visual grandeur isn't enough to camouflage the claustrophobic TV screen compositions and typically frantic Madison Avenue editing job (designed, perhaps, to hide the digital wrinkles).Russell Crowe is the title character: a Roman general fallen from imperial favor, battling for his life and honor on the floor of the Coliseum, where the prize for victory is another day of slavery and the cost of defeat is a mercifully quick death. Crowe's protagonist is a man of few words, most of them delivered in a flat monotone, matching the equally colorless photography, shaded in picturesque hues of misty gray and mud brown sepia.Don't expect any surprises from the strictly formula riches-to-rags-to-rebel hero scenario, which doesn't even allow the villains (degenerate emperor Joaquin Phoenix and his sister/lover Connie Nielson) a chance to have any fun. Audiences (and too many critics, who should have known better) conditioned by habit to reject anything original made the film a worldwide hit, but even in our current age of diminished expectations it should have been clear that they don't make 'em like they used to anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poignant and evocative as this movie is, no way should it have been best picture. The story is too thin, the script lacks sufficient sophistication. Marcus Aurelius to Maximus'give Rome back to the people it belongs'. Way too vague and general a statement the like of which is repeated too often.Mind you this is a good film, powered by Crowe and the fabulous music of Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer. Gerrard's voice in the dream sequences is fantastic. Crowe has great presence. His Maximus is tired of fighting even before the fighting begins at the beginning of the film. The look on his face at the beginning says it all - a man duty bound to his orders, yet tired and sad at the nature of his duty, yet confident in his own ability and that of his soldiers to carry them out. Crowe retains his tortured tough guy look right the way through.As impressive as the action sequences are at the beginning in the German forest and later in the colosseum, the film looks way too grainy. It's alright for the early sequences where the forest is supposed to be dark and gloomy anyway, but Rome should have been more light and clarity. Special effects and art direction in this sense are a let down.The supporting cast is not given much to work with by the weak script. Derek Jacobi has almost nothing to do, Joaquin Phoenix's villain is just way too one dimensional (not really the actor's fault). Connie Nielsen easily stands out as Maximus' ex-love.I think it's the powerful emotions aroused by the Gerrard-Zimmer music and Crowe's screen presence which propelled this to best picture status. The story and script are just too weak to merit it. Ridley Scott doesn't make bad films, but the visual weaknesses of the film in parts prevent him being praised too much for this effort. He has enough good films under his belt anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film doesn't truly 'take off' until exactly 50 minutes in. The 'big battle' scene which kicks off the film should have got my pulse racing. Instead, it left me wondering why I bothered to watch.The magnificent Colosseum doesn't get a look in until 1 hour and 20 Minutes and even then the graphics are very fake looking (even for the year 2000) and there is not enough shots to showcase the size of the historic amphitheatre. The first battle scene in the Colosseum takes place shortly after this 1 hour and 20 mark, and at last - it's good viewing. Joaquin Phoenix plays the stereotypical spoilt brat Emperor with Daddy issues and having seen him in countless other films, it's fair to say his acting at it's height in this film.It's now 16 years old, so I will forgive the cheap looking Colosseum shots, but with 1997's Titanic being 20 years old next year - it still stands a lot stronger than 'Gladiator'.What annoys me is how highly rated this film is, as well as the hype and numerous accolades. I can only put it down to the fact that this film re-ignited interest in the Roman Empire and it was most certainly a good-looking film to kick off the Millennium. Sadly, it's not for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator (2000): Dir: Ridley Scott / Cast: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, Oliver Reed: Visually stunning depiction starring Russell Crowe as a gladiator whose life is marked by violence in an ugly fashion of sport. He is framed for murder and sentenced to death but he survives only to discover that his wife and son were crucified and burned. Central plot thrusts him in gladiator games where he spends wasted time hacking up soldiers. Triumphant art direction cannot save repetitious story. Director Ridley Scott successfully creates the era but this is hardly a match for his superior films such as Alien and Blade Runner. Crowe carries the film going from honoured soldier to a fighter placed within a bloody game of survival where only his revenge drives him. Joaquin Phoenix overacts tremendously as Caesar who is basically a cardboard villain destine for death and when it happens, it lacks the intended satisfaction. Wasted appearances by Connie Nielsen and Richard Harris. Oliver Reed even appears as an old gladiator who likely wiped his ass with toilet paper that contained more than what this screenplay does. The art direction and visual elements are in top form. The film reflects the Roman Empire and violent sport to entertain the lust for violence. Unfortunately the repetition and violent exploits of the screenplay render this perhaps the most overrated film of the year. Score: 4 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Colossal Performance by Crowe makes this an Epic Thrill-Packer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You will swoon with woozy delight over Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic 'Gladiator' - a sweaty, stylish hunk-fest that takes you back to the Roman era. It is so insanely enjoyable and carried off with such dash and chutzpah, that it makes you wonder where this genre has been all your life. Worried about the judgment of history as he ends his days with Rome in a swirl of political instability, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) charges his favorite general, Maximus (Russell Crowe), over his petulant son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) to whip Rome back into shape and return power to the people. Maximus wants no part of the offer and yearns to return to his family. But before this wish can become reality, Commodus intervenes, triggering a series of events that changes the future of the Roman Empire. An attack on Maximus and his family relegates the once-great hero to a shattered, anonymous slave. Purchased by a crafty spectacle promoter, he's trained as a gladiator. The man who once fought for his nation and its ideals now fights to provide thrills to a bloodthirsty mob, constantly enduring Commodus' envy and the ignominy of being a slave. But it is as a slave- gladiator that Maximus finds the way to serve Rome once again, and help deliver on his promise to the late Emperor. Gladiator is film-making at its finest (Ridley Scott in top form), painted on the grandest of canvases, and yet, one which maintains the finest eye for detail. Right from its opening frames of hand-to- hand butchery, Gladiator simply grabs you by the balls and never lets go. On the surface, it's a terrific yarn with rounded characters, agonizing suspense and visceral thrills. Look closer and you'll find rich historical themes, and a harrowing critique of violence as amusement. The depiction of the random savagery amid which the issue has to be confronted is astonishing lending the action sequences an elegiac quality. The atmospherics are so robust that you can almost smell the sweat pouring from the Colosseum as Maximus battles both man and beast for the amusement of the masses. The mob's cheers make a chilling counterpoint to our close-up views of carnage.True, Gladiator is full of arresting splendor and technical virtuosity. But the camera only has eyes for Maximus as Crowe puts a stranglehold on stardom with his performance. The man exudes a physicality comparable to the beasts he has to combat in the arena and holds the screen with such conviction and force you simply can't rip your eyes away from him. Gladiator does indeed deliver the glory that was Rome: a sprawling, enthralling orgy of blood, passion, betrayal and revenge. A gloriously entertaining thrill-packer of truly epic proportions!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rare Profoundly impactive movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since Steven Speilburg (sp?), it has been rare to find a movie that achieves what "Hollywood" stood for back in Charlie Chaplin's day, then Jimmy Stewart, Bogie and Becall, etc.Gladiator isn't a gently-tugging-at-your-soul's attention kind of movie. It GRABS you from the very first, less than 5 minutes into the opening, and doesn't end until the movie is over. Even then, I recall wandering out of the theater, almost in a "fugue" state of mind. THAT'S how powerful was the movie's moral is, not to mention plot, character development, protagonist vs antagonist, all the way from the gripping start to the ending. Evil vs. Honor, the "parable" of the consequences of choosing to live the thrill of Exhilaration, achieved ONLY via the absorption of selfish greed and power, compared to the everlasting courage of a principled, moral, ethical, self-effacing life.Actually, Ridley Scott DID do another classic - Alien (the original.) But with Gladiator, Russell Crowe, and Joaquin Phoenix could not have been better chosen for the roles played.This was a movie on a scale beyond epic...hence, no chance of a sequel. You cannot exceed 1000% in movie calibers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie when I was studying in a middle school. I think around fourteen or fifteen years ago. It was one of the first movie that I have seen in a cinema. I was very impressed and excited of this movie. This movie shows us maybe not a realistic period in the Roman Empire but very close to it. The plot of this story and main characters does not confined or limited by historical books and myths. I think Ridley Scott has a unique and distinctive ability of creation movies that touches historical period. All characters interesting, have nuance and charm. I think it is one of the best movies with Russell Crowe. I liked this movie and I can watch this movie again and again, and I will not be bored. This movie does not have an expiration date and defiantly I could not classify this movie as "One time to watch, in enough"... I think the "Gladiator" is one of the best movie that I have seen. I defiantly recommend to watch this movie for people who does not seen it yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film Review on IMDb: GladiatorRussell Crowe stars as Maximus in the Academy Award winning Gladiator. The story takes place during the height of the Roman Empire. Maximus is the general of Rome's northern army and faithful servant of Cesar Marcus Aurelius played by Richard Harris. The film begins with a final battle in Germania, a battle that Maximus leads his army to victory and peace throughout the empire. Once victory has been achieved Marcus Aurelius asks Maximus to serve as the protector of Rome after his death and to make Rome a republic once again. Marcus Aurelius informs his son, Commodus, of his plans to make Rome a republic. Commodus murders his father and Maximus will not pledge his support to Commodus. Commodus orders Maximus to be killed and for his family to meet him in the afterlife. The theme of Gladiator is how one man's action can have an impact on everyone else but it can come at great personal sacrifice. Throughout the film the audience is shown more about the character of Maximus. In the beginning of the film he is shown as a great General who only desires to be home with his family. Even after great triumph in battle he is possibly going to delay his journey home at the request of the Cesar. The request brings no wealth to Maximus but only extends his time away from home but it would be for the good of the people of the Roman Empire. Even though we do not get to hear his decision, the audience has a feeling that he will say yes and carryout Marcus Aurelius' wishes. After the death of his wife and son, Maximus is seen in a depressed state. He shows no desire to live but seems to rekindle his honor in a fight that he is chained hand in hand with a fellow slave. Maximus once again puts his desires aside and fights thus preserving the fellow slaves' life. Finally, Maximus is able to kill Commodus, but in doing so he gives up his own life for the good of the empire. As he takes his final breaths Maximus reveals the wishes of Marcus Aurelius, which Rome is to be a republic and to end the corruption that has poisoned it.Gladiator uses many different filming techniques but the two that standout the most our lighting and angle. Maximus is portrayed as a strong and moral individual, it is this reason that Marcus Aurelius loves him more than his own son and chooses to put his faith in him. The camera angle really helps to show Maximus as strong individual. Russell Crowe is of average height, he is in shape for the movie but he is not physically intimidating. However, during the movie the camera angle shot for him is often in an upward angle. The gives the audience a sense of him being larger and someone you are looking up towards. Also, in the film the lighting around Maximus is always light. Once again, this technique is showing Maximus as a good character. All of these techniques and details that go into this character provide someone for the audience to feel and cheer for. On the other hand, Commodus, always has dark lighting. He is rarely shown in light lighting. This goes well for his character who is a menacing and evil individual who cares little for those around him. Gladiator's universal theme of a moral individual doing what is right even though it comes with great personal sacrifice speaks to audiences around the world. This story inspires you to want to do what is right and to be a strong individual. It is not surprising that this film and others that are similar in theme such as Braveheart have done so well. These films provide the audience with a little different mindset as they exit the theatre or turn off their television set. In one of the final moments of the movie the audience receives chills down their spine as Lucilla says "he was a solider of Rome honor him".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very solid movie all-round</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is cool about Gladiator (besides a whole lot of things) is that it should not offend pro- or anti-Romans. There have been a number of big movies, almost since the beginning of movies, that put Rome into the evil category. This choice echoes from the popular anti-Imperial culture of the 20th and 21st century that favors freedom over unity and order. Sorry, I will stop if that sounds preachy, but the point is: Gladiator gives both sides of the argument and also shows that it is not about the bad and the good sides but rather the bad and the good in the individuals.Gladiator is not the most historically accurate film. After all, they put a whole lot of story conveniently into the events for which there are very few sources for reference. And of course the armor is not going to be perfectly accurate, and of course everything is pumped up. But it actually does a great deal right and looks genuine. The politics get smart toward the middle of the film. This film has depth, though it is not hard to understand.Disguised under all the pomp and depth there is hidden a fairly typical formula for an action movie with a good and a bad guy, a family member in danger, a personal loss, a cheesy honor speech, and of course a mano-a-mano fight, but it is hidden and packaged very well.Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus is not the protagonist but is arguably the main character of the film. The "evil" in his character is so refined, deep, believable and even relatable. The cowardice is palpable. He feels like a complex character that creates a good contrast to Russel Crowe's Gladiator, the simpleton soldier with his honor, love and anger issues. Oliver Reed as the gladiator owner was also really good and expressive.The camera work is excellent. The busy sets are filled with good lighting and shots are properly populated, with good atmosphere from all the various fires, mist and snow. Computer generated effects are unfortunately used quite a bit, as the makers would have had a hard time showing the Roman scale without it and yes, some of these effects look dated, but those shots are not shown for long and overall it works.The soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer is actually not the best if you listen to it on its own but works really well in this movie, especially in battles. It brings the necessary gravity to everything. Speaking of listening to the soundtrack on its own, do try "The Might of Rome" when visiting a large city - awesome. Lisa Gerrard brought her voice which is a great recognizable emotional deep contralto, though her main presence in this movie is saved for the credits.The movie is totally rewatchable, and in fact, the second time may reveal many new nuances in the dialogue you may have missed the first time, especially if you are watching the extended addition (which you should). As time passed after its release, this movie was increasingly becoming a hype. Internet memes were being made from it. People kept asking me to make Maximus' armor for a game. This plebeian hype made me increasingly dislike this film by extension, but the fact is that this is a very well-made enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This title does a good job in combining slight story complexity, historical background and action scope. It's been a while since release and time hasn't been tough on quality. The battle at the beginning continues one of the best ever crafted. Sometimes people tend to underestimate the value of drama a film occasionally has to receive not to be deemed shallow. This isn't simply about blood- thirst of the Colosseum crowd, it focus on the relationship between a general and it sking, how this king seems to favor the general instead of his own son to be next Caesar of the great empire of Rome.When the son kills his father and takes on the throne the general is cast out and his family brutally murdered. After a series of events he ends up a gladiator and seeks revenge against the king. Sure the scope is taken to a hole new level for stuff like battle between the two, a king and a gladiator.The general expertise in battle grants him a considerable high status upon so many victories as he climbs his way through. All in all the movie seems accurate in whatever history is left to back it and as entertaining as an action movie that thrives to go beyond simple carnage.</fullReview>

A most watch for everyone no matter what genre you prefer this movie will mesmerize you anyhow.Gladiator tells the tale of the Roman General and his fight for revenge against the death of his son and wife. He is beaten to death, betrayed and thrown into slavery all the way to North Africa but he works his way back to the Gladiator Royal Arena of Rome. Gladiator is worth a watch, it will influence you to the core, the sets, the locations, the acting, direction, cinematography in fact each and every aspect of the movie is perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Movie with a Horrible Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I want to say this movie makes my top 3 favorites list! It's a great movie with an amazing story line. The cast does an amazing job the setting, everything is on point. It's the end though.... The end of the movie was quite a let down. I am one for happen endings so when I saw this without any hint to a horribly sad ending, it hit me hard and crushed me. I will never watch this movie again because I know what's coming and that's all I can think about. If you are OK with a sad ending then by all means I 100% recommend this movie to you! But if you are like me and like to end a movie on a positive note, I warn you to not watch it, or stop the movie about 10 minutes before it ends and just make up your own ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Title: GladiatorCondensed Storyline: A Roman general is betrayed by the emperor's son who kills his family, so he must come back to Rome to exact revenge Notable Acting: Russell Crowe plays Maximus and gives a good believable performance and suits the part. Joaquin Phoenix plays Commodus and is a great villain, but he's also that type of villain you would know will get killed. You wait through the entire movie just to see that scene where he does get killed. That is a great villain. Costume: Maximus' costume is historically accurate an looks the part, along with the outfits of many other in this movie. Incorrect History: The locks shown in the movie had not bee invented at that time. Some of the helmets shown in the gladiator room are from countries north of Rome, such has French, German and Nordic. A horse pulling a chariot wouldn't also have a saddle on. Thumbs up or down for life or death is incorrect, it is actually thumb to the side for death and a fist for death. The opening battle is incorrect as a Roman legion's formation wouldn't break down on contact with the enemy, they would force them back. Medieval knights invented the flail, 1000 years or so after this movie is set.Overall Feel: This movie isn't without its historical errors, and it does have a few. But that doesn't stop it from being a down right great movie to watch, the scale of the movie is perfect. The casting is good. The camera work is meh, but this is made up to us through the great story that we watch</fullReview>

I've never felt like being involved in such an atmosphere like this before ! every thing is real and original . very powerful screenplay , story , acting , music and fighting , and Russel Crow is extremely terrific !! I was so taken by the way they mixed battles with honor , blood , loyalty and love ! Although I saw many films coming from these historic backgrounds , this is the greatest one ever ! the film is full of blood like it was in the barbaric Rome at that age , but among all that bloodshed in the movie , you still can find a man that still looks to turn back home to his wife and his child and to live as a farmer ! .. bit unfortunately , destiny stands in front of him just to make him a legendary hero ! what the film might say is : a civilization must die once it does not respect human , treats him like an animal , and once morals and goodness are left behind its back , then the afterlife might be better ! I wish I could give this movie 10/10 !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Brothers, what we do in life echoes in eternity."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Russell Crowe not too long ago in 2012's "The Man With the Iron Fists" where he looked about a hundred pounds heavier than he did here; his character was a mercenary named Jack Knife. It was quite a contrast then to see him once again in this film made a dozen years earlier. In fact, considering that Crowe was playing a Roman warrior, he actually looked like he might have been too small for the part. Well, so much for that."Gladiator" has an epic sweep not often seen in modern films, the opening battle scene makes you wonder if wars were actually fought that way in ancient times. The political intrigue involved in the plot to murder Maximus (Crowe) and it's failure sets up a dynamic story in which Maximus battles to regain respect and notoriety with the Roman citizenry. Personal relationships are put to the test as Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) proves to be a too cunning adversary to be defeated by normal means.You know, I had to replay the Commdodus/Maximus dungeon scene when Commodus stabbed his enemy, and it didn't make sense to me. When the blade struck Maximus, it appeared to go through his tunic which became blood stained, but in the pull away shot, Crowe wasn't wearing a garment of the same dimensions and he didn't appear to be injured or bleeding. I went back and forth with that one until I decided it had to be an error in filming or editing, but it certainly was a head scratcher.Anyway, this is an intriguing movie as long as you don't let historical accuracy guide you. Or get distracted by the use of elevators to raise soldiers up to ground level of the Coliseum to do battle. What's inspirational is the way Maximus earned the loyalty of his fellow warrior prisoners and their dedication to fight in strength and honor under impossible circumstances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is defiantly in my top 10 favorite of all time. It's the only I've ever paid twice to go see in theaters. Russell Crowe won an Oscar for his role as Maximus general of the northern Armies. Looking at the movie we see Russell Crowe portray the life of a Roman General who conquered and fought in Britania. There was no other greater honor than to win victories for your emperor who you served. The story goes from a General who had one of the most powerful armies on earth, to a slave turned gladiator who fights in a ring worth no more than the beasts in cages next to him. The betrayal of Maximus by Commodus leads us into a journey filled with danger, revenge, and love, the love of Maximus's family. Through a turn of events Maximus learns the trade of being a gladiator and wins the hearts of the crowd. Through vicious play and versatility in the ring he eventually goes to Rome where he plots his move on killing the emperor Commodus. The movie is filled with action, death, The theme of the movie is revenge and power. Straight out of the gate there is a huge power struggle between the Romans and barbarians of Britania. Power that at that point was slowly slipping away from the indigenous tribes. Commodus learned from his father that Maximus would become the new leader of Rome and give back the power to the Senate. After Maximus was betrayed and his family murdered he was found and sold by slavers to a man who was once a gladiator himself. Finding fame in the arena he eventually found himself to Rome. He plotted his revenge against Commodus and eventually faced him in the ring one on one. The final scene shows Maximus kill the Emperor with cut scenes of him going into the afterlife to meet his wife and son. This eventually leads to his death. To me sounds contributed the most to the theme of the movie. Most of the revenge scenes were in the arena where the clanging of swords and slicing of flesh showed well. During the first scenes with the barbarians chanting and sounds of war added a different element to the movie. This movie was a smash hit. It won 5 Oscars and was nominated for 7 more. With a budget being around 100 million to film and produce the movie would gross around 450 million worldwide. This would be Russell Crowes only Oscar win in a very illustrious career as a movie star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After a Roman soldier is betrayed by his emperor's son he is sold into slavery and forced to fight as a gladiator.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" comes out of the gate swinging, immediately opening on the battlefield. Caesar Marcus Aurelius stands off to the side of the battle watching General Maximus Meridius (Crowe) lead his troops to yet another victory. After the battle Maximus longs to return to his family, but Marcus Aurelius wishes to have Maximus succeed him as a regent, in a step towards eventually turning Rome back into a republic. Aurelis feels that his son Commodus is too unjust to rule and that Maximus will unselfishly give Rome back to the people. Commodus learns of his father's plan and before anyone else is informed of the Caesar's wishes he is killed by his son. Commodus then takes control of Rome and condemns Maximus and his family to death when Maximus refuses to pledge his loyalty to the new Caesar.This film is the first large scale movie set in ancient Rome since the 1960&#x2032;s; it basically combines the plots of "Ben-Hur" and "Sparticus" then adds a dash of "Braveheart" for good measure. "Gladiator" is the first movie I've reviewed that had me torn between two numbers to the point that I had to incorporate a half option in my stats section. This movie is director Ridley Scott's first since his box office bomb "G.I. Jane," which lost over 40 million dollars. Luckily for Scott this movie was well received by critics in addition to being a commercial success. "Gladiator" won five academy awards including best picture, and grossed over 180 million dollars, but I feel it still had flaws. In my review I will focus mainly on the problems that I had with the movie rather than its merit. 'Gladiator' is fourteen years old and it is still considered a notable success, and anything positive I have to say on top of that would simply be redundant.To begin, Ridley Scott hired historians to ensure that this would be the most accurate movie ever made about Rome, but the story is still full of historical inaccuracies. It is true, that sometimes history must be changed when making a movie to keep the audience interested or to keep the story progressing smoothly, but the inaccuracies to which I refer were sever enough to lead to one historian quitting Scott's team and another asking for their name to be removed from the credits. While I am not going to sit here and list every single deviation from historical fact, I do find the need to raise one query. Why does a Spanish born Roman general have an accent from Australia, a country that during the time period would not existed for over a thousand years? If I only had to review the first forty minutes of this movie, up until Maximus becomes a gladiator, I would consider it perfect. At this point the movie noticeably loses pace, and even the incorporation of the gladiator fight scenes do not help. Luckily, 'Glatiator' still has one ace up its sleeve, Commodus does not know that Maimus is the famous Spaniard. Oh wait, never mind, he finds out immediately following the first battle in the Colosseum! When Maximus removes his helmet to reveal his identity to Commodus he also removes the remaining tension. I wanted Maximus to thrust forward with the fury that only a man who has had his wife and child brutally slain could posses, and nothing.The audience is left to trudge through another hour in a half of hollow fight scenes and Commodus' scheming. Another hour in a half of a second rate villain lusting after his own sister, listening to himself talk, and emitting seriously creepy vibes towards his nephew. Another hour in a half of plot and sub plot with its merit being outweighed by the urge to hit the fast forward button on the remote, just for a little bit. As the movie comes to a close the viewer is rewarded with one last mediocre fight scene pitting two completely unmatched opponents against each other, then poof, it ends. We are left wondering what could have been if everything went right, like the star quarterback that blew out his knee right before going pro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The power of vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here the interesting thing worth commenting is vision. It's otherwise a typical film of its sort if several years more later it appears to have not been particularly prescient of the wonderful advances we've had since in the way of telling a story.Its' a reworking of Fall of the Roman Empire, an amazingly clunky epic from the 60s around the same story that signaled the end of its type; in its narrative trajectory this is as stale now. The hero and villain, the conflict, the rising above circumstances and poetic redemption. The stage is of course far more dynamic, it's overall closer to the eye but frames the same one dimension.Kingdom of Heaven was more evocative for me; there we started by following an ordinary man swept to a far and mysterious historic horizon, the journey was to a place where destiny threatened to reveal itself, though the film otherwise partook of many of the same faults as this, the blacksmith became the hero, the tentative horizon became the painting of brave exploits.The nested story here is about the power of vision. It's the vision Commodus creates to manipulate a mob addicted to empty spectacle, the gladiator-movie that we came to see, enough to forego our mundane worries about what's wrong with the state of things. We see the emperor place miniatures of gladiators in a replica of the arena and this is followed by a majestic aerial shot of tiny particles of people flushing towards the Colosseum for the movie.Then it's the hero's vision of what he can achieve by agreeing to play his part in that spectacle, redemption. He does this by not entertaining, by showing mercy and challenging our demand for bloodshed, though only after this has been sated by protracted killing.But does any of this does what it says? The answer for me is no. If it did along the lines it sets up, we'd leave this disgusted by the hollow spectacle and not secretly titillated, informed by the possibility of mercy for redemption and not glorying in the revenge.No the only powerful thing here for me is the further nested vision of Maximus that gives him strength to keep going; the vision of loved ones.Scott wisely discerned that this had to be bound to a tangible place, the lovely home in the Roman countryside, that it would be our visual tether as we strayed to the accidental world of organized cruelties. It's all anchored on this spot. The shot of his hand caressing the rippling wheat is on his way to meet them, imagined, at first as a much anticipated return from years of war, later as a reunion in the next world. Scott could have done so much more to visually caress the place in mind but the fact that he places it at the center tells me he was wise to the power of vision and mind. Isn't the shot of the dirt road leading up to the house lined with cypress trees rippling in the wind one of the most memorable images here? Maximus description of the house to the emperor conjures the imagery the camera omits, earthy smells and textures.Several magnitudes more powerful than any vindication in the arena, the power of this vision would be that of not losing sight of what makes us human, not letting the darkness of dungeons and arenas of life pull this anchor.</fullReview>

Here is a little summary as i see it: Before Maximus (Crowe), the heroic Roman General, can honor the wishes of his dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Harris) by assuming the emperor's role, the emperor's cruel and corrupt son Commodus (Phoenix) orders the execution of Maximus and his family. Escaping death, Maximus assumes the life of an anonymous gladiator, fighting his way back to the Roman Colosseum where he seeks revenge and a return to justice for Rome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well, you should see for yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this film has many great actors it was Crowe and Connie Nielsen who give it heart. Crowe's presence fills the auditorium and convinces the audience important events are taking place. Crowe pulls you to his side and you root for him almost from the start of the film.This work is his finest from his appearance as the fierce but reluctant general who was a farmer at heart to his work as the brilliant, unstoppable gladiator warrior to the final scenes when he finally faces the man he has cursed and vowed to kill. He defies an emperor. The Emperor is a yellow-livered, depraved poor excuse for a human being but he is no pushover. He is a determined worm of a man who knows what he wants and how to get it. He is ruthless in attaining his goals, always wrong-headed but unrelenting in his pursuit of satisfying his twisted desires.The movie culminates in a life and death contest between the Crowe and the emperor and at times the outcome seems in doubt.The film was lush and stunning representation of Imperial Rome and the action, both on the battlefield and in the Colosseum, is both beautiful and compelling. This movie contains almost no historical truths but this quickly becomes a matter of who cares? "Gladiator" is story telling at its best and whether the naysayers, and there are many, like it or not, "Gladiator" is destined be a classic.Connie Nielsen brings a strong and pure feminine energy to the film and her final scene, while is almost melodramatic, will remain firmly established in my mind as one of my favorite movie memories.Could anyone have played the emperor better than Joaquin Phoenix? Possibly but could anyone else have given us greater insight into the twisted soul of the emperor? Could anyone else have allowed us to actually feel compassion for the tortured psyche of the emperor? I don't know but Phoenix did all that and gave us a portrayal of the complex and human side of a bad man.</fullReview>

Russell Crowe captures the intense loyalty and inner turmoil that must have permeated every Roman soldier of stature during the heyday of the civilization. And certainly all of the supporting cast were "in the mood" during the filming. While it is not a semi-documentary story, it never the less grabs you with the somber way the love story progresses. Yes, it is a love story too, not just between two people but of an entire empire as well.

		<fullReview>For me this is one of the best movies ever! I love history, and to me, Gladiator is a masterpiece. Great Story! Great Writing! Great Acting! Great Directing! Great Score! This movie has it all.Crowe got the respect he deserves for this movie.Gladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours, marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. The ending is just hypnotic. Intentionally or unintentionally it was simply emotional. The music is wonderfully beautiful as if Maximus' family are telling him...you have arrived.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best action film of the decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a must-see, even 13 years later. Gripping plot, deep characters, and impressive visuals. Definitely check this one out. It is no wonder that Russell Crowe stole awards for this one. When I saw this, I walked out saying, "Oh my God, Russell Crowe was so good in this." I've seen it multiple times since it came out, and enjoyed it anew each time. I'm a big fan of historical dramas, so my predisposition likely colors this review, but I stand by my sentiments. The plot takes a number of twists and turns, leaving viewers in shock. I just bought it as a gift for my cousin, and am hoping he likes it just as much. The music is also very well-done, very appropriate for the context and setting of this film. I don't quite agree with the film being rated R, but it likely shouldn't be seen by anyone under 13. There is some violence, and the themes are a bit adult.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator Proves to be Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world that Director Ridley Scott depicts for us in the film "Gladiator" is like no other fictional Rome before it. It is a grim, dark, world, but beautiful, in the most gory of ways. We follow Maximus (Russell Crowe) as he crashes to the cusp of death, only to slowly slash his way back up to honor and glory. It's these battle scenes that possess the perfect balance of awesome action and gripping suspense, only multiplying as the combat becomes increasingly important to the story. The next fight is always better than the last, because the stakes raise every time Maximus meets blades with another character.It's these violent and graphic scenes that personify the Rome that must be shown for "Gladiator" to work. We must accept Maximus' murdering and bloodshed because it seems to be the only way things are truly settled in the life of a gladiator. The violence that permeates the 155 minute picture from start to finish is necessary. It never feels overdone or boring. It is the foundation of this film, along with brilliant performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Pheonix, a great supporting cast, and a concise dialogue. The violent Rome is brought to us by great special effects, intense fight choreography, and the gritty camera angles that we longed for as soon as we saw Maximus in his magnificent Roman officer armor. "Gladiator" is a tale of honor and courage, in a world built on the foundations of blood and deceit, and Ridley Scott tells us the story masterfully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is a classic contemporary piece of Hollywood Production. It sees Russell Crowe as Maximus a general within the Roman Army betrayed and framed by the Emperor's corrupt son and exiled as a result. However, he becomes a gladiator to seek his revenge, and to ensure justice will prevail.It captures every emotion possible in only the way an expert director can achieve. Ridley Scott direction allows for more believable characters. You will be truly moved by Maximus' resilience and determination. Russell Crowe's portrayal as Maximus was Oscar worthy and truly rousing. The sets are very impressive too taking into detail a feudalistic and ancient Rome; with breath-taking scenery, magnificent structure of buildings and arenas. Ridley Scott also makes his directorial impact known by embracing both beautiful acted scenes and glorious bloody battles. The epic battles touch on both violence and emotion to keep the viewer engrossed by the action. The screenplay is also excellent which captures the true emotions of the film. Although some view the film as being historically inaccurate I feel the film captures the time period superbly and with only the odd historical inaccuracy.Gladiator is a true master piece and gives the likes of epic films such as Spartacus and Ben Hur a run for their money. In both cinematic effects, epic plot and excellent acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is an amazing movie with a lot to messages in it .... it is said to be the way people in Rome had to suffer just for their freedom .The thing about this movie is that the empire had killed his own father, just because he wanted the whole Rome to see how people need to live life not by luxury but by pain , sadness , regrets that are to come later in life . But there is still love between the slaves especially the ones who had a family left behind and never going to come for the rescue at all .... But still one gladiator changed all the rules in Rome right from the moment he won the fight till death he knew the world he had grown in .... needed a great change and he did it well and made his point to his wife and children that had been taken from him .I would want to change the world if I could in their time .... but the modern world is much better ... a lot better .... Thank you to all the leaders and warriors , who did their best to change it for us ; just the way he changed it for Rome and the world .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is simply the best historical epic film ever made (after Ben-Hur, Spartacus, and BraveHeart) The direction of Ridley Scott is wonderful, along with the stunning cinematography over each scene. The opening scene is a great example of cinematography and direction of Scott can make a real spectacle, as the story itself. When Emperor Marcus Aurelius' son Commodus murders his father, he must also do away with Maximus Decimus Meridius, the finest general. Maximus escapes his execution, but finds his wife and child murdered. Wandering and wounded near death, he is picked up and put into slavery, and selected to fight for sport as a gladiator. From there, he seeks revenge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story telling at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film has many great actors it was Crowe and Connie Nielsen who give it heart. Crowe's presence fills the auditorium and convinces the audience important events are taking place. Crowe pulls you to his side and you root for him almost from the start of the film.This work is his finest from his appearance as the fierce but reluctant general who was a farmer at heart to his work as the brilliant, unstoppable gladiator warrior to the final scenes when he finally faces the man he has cursed and vowed to kill. He defies an emperor. The Emperor is a yellow-livered, depraved poor excuse for a human being but he is no pushover. He is a weak but determined worm of a man who knows what he wants and how to get it. He is ruthless and selfish in attaining his goals, always wrong-headed but unrelenting in his pursuit of satisfying his twisted desires. What he wants he takes with no respect for others.The movie culminates in a life and death contest between Crowe and the emperor and at times the outcome seems in doubt.The film was lush and stunning representation of Imperial Rome and the action, both on the battlefield and in the colosseum, is both beautiful and compelling. This movie contains almost no historical truths but this quickly becomes a matter of "who cares?" "Gladiator" is story telling at its best and whether the naysayers, and there are many, like it or not, "Gladiator" is destined be a classic.Connie Nielsen brings a strong and pure feminine energy to the film and her final scene, while melodramatic, will remain firmly established in my mind as one of my favorite movie memories.Could anyone have played the emperor better than Joaquin Phoenix? Possibly but could anyone else have given us greater insight into the twisted soul of the emperor? Could anyone else have allowed us to actually feel compassion for the tortured psyche of the emperor? I don't know but Phoenix did all that and gave us a portrayal of a man driven mad by his obsessions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while, you watch a film so good, you can't help but tell everyone you know, that's how I felt after watching this. From beginning to end, it provided delightful acting, a great storyline and perfect editing. Location wise, spot on. Props looked like they were genuinely from the era, and the story was not too unrealistic, which made it a great film to understand and watch. It doesn't quite have the feistiness of 300 but it's storyline far exceeds 300's which in comparison is a little mediocre, but then again 300 also uses slow-mo which Gladiator does not. Joaquin Phoenix executes his villainous role spectacularly, and really gets us to hate the guy he is portraying. The loss of Maximus' family also makes you want to sympathise with the character more which delves you deeper into the actions he makes, and makes you far happier when he overcomes Commodus. A great film, highly recommendable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a powerful and popular Roman general. Emperor Marcus Aurelius is an aging ruler who prefers Maximus than his own conniving son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). After Commodus kills his own father, Maximus refuses to acknowledge the new emperor and his family is slaughtered. He falls into slavery and the gladiator arenas.The scale is a grand. The use of CG is top notch. It really expanded the visual experience to the required spectacle. Russell Crowe takes on the big Hollywood leading man role with ease. Joaquin Phoenix is well conceived as the evil foil to Crowe. The movie has the big battles, and the fun gladiator fights. It is grand in the best traditions of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oliver Reed as Generational Actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was wondering how to arrange my train of thoughts about actor Oliver Reed."Gladiator" (2000) was his last film and though sacrifice should be made not to speak for the movie itself, I still insist of paying tribute to the Actor with this shot which sent him to grave just like many other times he was binging and filming. I read his authorized biography from Virgin Books and was amazed at his extraordinary practices to absorb industrial amounts of alcohol at no costs to his health. I myself can not afford this habit any more though sometime we used to drink and party a lot. I also brood on the fact how people change with age and their zeal for life also.By calling Oliver Reed generational actor I mean the following. These actors appear on the big screen as stars once in a decade, usually in tuples, brought as product by great nations or at least big enough to form a pool. Thus France gave to the cinema in the 60s and 70s Alain Delon and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Unscathingly, here in this movie Reed is paired with Richard Harris - in the role of Emperor Marcus Aurelius - who also happens to be manifesto actor that together with the titular and couple of more fellows created the image of British adventure cinema for 20 years. At least thus appears to me as compared British to American born film stars. So we are talking here about weightlifters to be more precise.Now I want to link the persona of Oliver Reed to a former Bulgarian buff called Kliment Denchev (d. 2009) - an immigrant to Canada from the 1980s. I remember that corpulent man for several reasons not the least that he had physical resemblance to Oliver which I put two-and-two together recently. That Kliment Denchev left Bulgaria for political reasons few people in that former communist country would remember or are willing to. What I recently read about his case was that he deliberately got shunned by the State Security organs and forced to live abroad with his wife as fugitive. I remember this giant of a man from his performances in the 1970s when he was leading in the children's nightly at 19.45 PM two times a week. He also participated in many Bulgarian cult films before he left for overseas.Returning back to Oliver Reed. I shouldn't indulge anyone reading my preferences for him; he had enough fame and many critics. Women also loved him and I want to give a separate estimate for three of his films where he treated the opposite sex in his particular way:1. Trap (1966) - Rita Tushingham, whom I took mistakenly for Geraldine Chaplin, plays a mute that is bought by fur trapper to attend. But they are stalked by Indians in the remote cabin and Oliver loses his leg in a wolf-trap by accident. The young girl finally understands what hard life means and returns to his lame master;2. Hunting Party (1971) - Candice Bergen, a rancher's wife and schoolteacher, makes threesome with Oliver when he and his gang kidnap her for ransom. At first she is very resistant to the abductors but afterwards Oliver feeds her with peaches and she agrees to teach him lessons in gramercy. Subsequently they fall in love but unfortunately the rancher (Gene Hackman) organize a posse that exterminate the whole gang with long range rifle. At the end the three of them die in the desert;3. Castaway (1986) - Amanda Donohoe, who actually became a celebrity with this movie, plays an unemployed secretary that agrees to become female companion for one year on uninhabited island in the Pacific. The film contains limited amount of nudity for which received complaints from the critics. However, Oliver takes care of business and they survive amidst the wilderness until end of time. Sort of "Blue Lagoon" film for grown-ups. So long and Thank You!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A milestone historical epic which has been overlooked in time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite, I've been affected negatively by comments like it is overrated or it was not that great in the past, after thinking about it once more, I conclude that Gladiator is a great film. The opening sequence of the movie was remarkable, the bird, Russell Crowe's hands over wheat and the action as a preparation for us. The movie is a first rate historical epic with the help of Ridley Scott the master's craftsmanship in technical aspects such as editing, art direction and the spectacular action scenes. Also great entertainment. The musics are of course fiery and enthusing. The movie is may be too showy at times, but isn't this natural for a movie about gladiator games? It is an effective and impressive film. Russell Crowe is the star of the movie, literally too! He steals the show, but Phoenix is great, a great villain, too. He is unforgettable like the movie itself. Also, you can see the actor who played Conan in the TV series (at that time, I was almost a child) In terms of everything, but especially story telling, Gladiator is much much better than his latter film Kingdom of Heaven. The forest scene at the beginnings requires a little too much suspension of disbelief, but in the end, it was necessary, because there was no other way to do that. The story might be clich for some, but I think, it was powerful and solid to keep the film throughout. The story editing is a real epic! It is one of the main reasons that make the film a masterpiece in the genre. When I watched the movie for the first time at theater, I was seriously disappointed when I saw the combat area, but then realized that it wasn't The Colosseum when the real movie starts! The CGI was perfect at that time, as I know, it was one of the movies that an improved technology was used for the first time. "Are you not entertained?" scene is thought- provoking. The first battle in The Colosseum is worthy of cinema anthology. An unforgettable, iconic, spectacular sequence by Scott! I have no idea how many times I have seen this sequence! As action, may be it is the one of the movie. The craft in this sequence is breathtaking. The tiger sequence is another iconic, unforgettable and well executed part of the movie. In the year, 2000, at theater, I found that masked guy very interesting. The climax of the film was not as climactic as I'd expected, what can I say, I found it a little bit low key, but still a "deserving" final. Gladiator is one of the greatest historical epics so far.</fullReview>

I would have given it a 10 but I didn't for two reasons: A) nothing's perfect B) if you know much about history you will notice a few anachronisms. If you ignore the historical mistakes it is a very enjoyable and thought provoking film.

		<fullReview>Gladiator has it all. A great story that, even with the old revenge idea, will pick you up and plunge you right in. Gloriously grandiose shots that will fill your eyes and your imagination. Acting that will never take you for granted and just give you real emotions. Dialogs that are well thought, and will only be simple if it fits the scene or the character. Smooth editing and excellent score to be bettered only by the best. And, finally, action with grimy characters that gives this movie the heartbeat of a titan.The opening scene is particularly exceptional. The intrigue gets going pretty quickly putting our unwilling hero in a real and fatal mess. Each piece of the drama is put in place carefully, until everything comes together and the clash happens. It's one of Ridley Scott's great movies.Russel Crowe is the perfect hero, Joaquin Phoenix is truly mad, and both are irresistibly aimed at each other. Connie Nielsen play a very frightened sister that's at the same time courageous, yet worried about her son.This time, I tried listening to it with a very critical eye and I found only the last moment of clarity of Maximus, when he gives his last order, to be a weak and somewhat artificial moment. Beyond that, unlike him, I would have bent my neck right away, and plotted after, but that's a personal decision. It would have killed the whole paradigm right away and made me less of righteous a hero than him.Anyway you dice it or slice it, it's a must see, unless you have difficulty with violence.</fullReview>

We see Maximus's journey from general to slave to gladiator to rebel against the emperor. Ridley Scott's Gladiator was a great portrayal of what was acceptable in the Roman's time. from the way the set was displayed to the actors that were casted just added to the movie. Joaquin Phoenix's acting was incredible in his role of Commodus. Russel Crowe as Maximus was able to give a look into a gladiator's struggle, and yet Crowe did in a way so elegantly. The plot made viewers able to relate to the story through the themes of love, family, and revenge. The character's dialogue was written in away that it was modern, but still held the romance language it once was. I would definitely recommend this movie to any mature audience; overall, it is a must-see!</fullReview>

This film is very well written, the well-ensemble casts, the A-class acting (especially Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix), the stunning cinematography and definitely a strong character of Maximus (magnificently portrayed by Russell Crowe) whose life, struggle, disappointment and anger really move the audience, as if the world attention centers on him. Gladiator is not a historical film, because it only used the history of the ancient Roman Empire merely as the time setting. All other aspects namely those gorgeous shots, the great storyline/plot, the fantastic cinematography, the vividly lavish colors, detailed production design and digital imaging (that successfully rebuilt the stunning beauty of the ancient Roman Empire) and all sell really well, making the 170 minute-long running time definitely worthwhile. The visual of great battle in the first 15 minutes really stole my heart. The gruesome pictures, the blood and violence just to beautiful to abandon. Everything in this movie seems perfectly balanced, Ridley Scott as the film director really did his homework well in redefining and revitalizing the big battle sequence once considered masterpiece from Spartacus and Ben Hur. In the end, once again, I would say that Gladiator perfectly combines some crucial elements such as good, moving story, dazzling visual, beautiful scenery, filming techniques, direction and touching music score into one harmonious, action-packed film about heroism and its true meaning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie! The writers accomplished something truly amazing- they caused watchers to root for the hero. We felt his pain, we endured everything right along with him.I would recommend this movie to any fans of the Thriller, action adventure genre. The quality of this one is especially high. I guarantee you wont be disappointed.The music was great as well. I suppose the only failing the movie has is that there is no sequel. I find that Russel is always great in these roles and I would like to see more of him.If I had to give this film an exact rating, I would rate it 8.47, or due to the awesomeness of this film, 847 out of 1000!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit that "Gladiator" is a very good movie, but I'm amazed at how many people gave it ten out of ten stars. I know standards fall as time goes on, but that's a rating that should be reserved for a movie that will stay with you for years to come. All About Eve is such a movie; so is the Godfather. This isn't going to be one.Don't get me wrong, it's great to see old pros (Reed and Harris) and relatively new pros (Crowe, Phoenix, Nielsen, and Hounsou) go through their paces; Crowe in particular is better than I've ever seen him before. However, the plot is well worn, the dialogue occasionally lapses into silliness, and the CGIs bother me. I can remember a time (was it really only two decades ago?) when filmmakers who wanted a mindbogglingly spectacular set built one--they did the work, they spent the bucks, they expended the sweat. The CGI Colosseum seems like cheating, somehow, and several other shots are so obviously faked, they detract from the action.Speaking of the action, it is quite good. Scott has definitely lost none of his knack for tense pacing; I was surprised to see that two hours had gone by and I hadn't even felt them. The fight scenes are not only believable, which isn't even remotely a given in action movies, they're so entertaining they inspire not only excitement but a vague sense of guilt. And after being weaned on the mega-buff steroid stallions of the 80s and early 90s, it's very nice to see the athletic but not Conanesque Maximus in action.All in all, a good flick, but I'm pulling for Traffic or Crouching Tiger to take home the gold statues. This just isn't the kind of movie that deserves them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There was a dream that was Rome"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Historical epics set in the classical antiquity were a cinematic staple for a long period in the post war era. The genre died a death in the mid-60s, and even though big historical pictures did crop up from time to time, the Sword-and-Sandal format of Ben Hur and Spartacus seemed vanished. That is, until Gladiator. All at once, the vast ancient-world movie was back. Hollywood and the cinema-going public welcomed it with open arms.Of course, movies don't quite look the same now as they once did. One of the biggest changes in cinema since then is not one of style but one of logistics. Back in the 1950s you could put out a call for a few thousand men, give them all a free meal and a tin hat, and hey presto, you had an army. Now, every extra must be paid properly and you just can't afford masses of them. That extras are getting their due is a good thing, but it has changed the way we make movies. It's one of the reasons why CGI became so widespread ? it's essentially a cheap option. However with Gladiator, Ridley Scott has done something Cecil B. DeMille used to do during The Great Depression, back when he was the only person mad enough to make epics in that cash-strapped era. He employs a mix of rapid editing and obscure cinematography to make it look like there's a lot more in the frame than there really is*. It's a neat trick and it works fairly well in battle and crowd scenes. The only trouble is the style is used for much of the picture, and it is somewhat tiresome to see a simple dialogue scene chopped up into a bewildering mess of shaky close-ups.Back in the Sword-and-Sandal heyday there were certain actors who were associated with the genre. Now that the format was being revived, it would be a gamble finding their modern equivalents. Luckily, I can't think of any contemporary player better than Russell Crowe for this job. He has that rugged tough-guy look, but with a quiet dignity that is absolutely in tune with the notion of Romans as civilized warriors. While his performance does not have any exceptional moments, its strength is in his overall embodiment of the character of Maximus, convincing us that he is every inch a general who leads from the front. Also very good is Oliver Reed, bringing a bit of old-style presence to the proceedings, and a slightly pervy Joaquin Phoenix.There is one final big difference between Gladiator and its predecessors. The older epics were almost always religious movies, with stories taken from the bible or the days of the early Christians. However, where those '50s pictures were religious, Gladiator is spiritual. There are no miracles or grandiose sermons here, just one man's very fervent belief in an afterlife. And while this is still just a piece of mythology, its context here ? the hope of reunion with his murdered family ? is incredibly touching, and is effectively what binds the whole movie together. In fact, Gladiator is arguably the first epic to achieve what so many of the earlier examples strove so hard to be ? an epic that is also intimate.*Note that there is some CGI in Gladiator, but it's relatively minimal and is even comparable to the use of matt paintings in those '50s epics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great Story! Great Writing! Great Acting! Great Directing! Great Score! This movie has it all. I especially enjoyed the mood of the film. Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style. The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations. Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the "general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor." Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine. It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla. However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers. Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators. The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the "thrill of the Coliseum" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate. The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene. But the whole movie is a rush! Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie. Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing. I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages. Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The olde style before substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a film that is acted and directed very well, but is an eyesore to look at for two and a half hours. The film's effects are nice, which got the film an Oscar in 2000, and so are the costumes, but they are all captured in a dirty, muddy tone. Most of the film is a dingy colored brown, appearing as if someone imbedded dirty in the camera lens.The film's plot is just a revenge story, soaked within a period piece. It involves General Maximus Decimus Meridius (Crowe), the leader of the Roman Army in AD 180. Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Harris) is very pleased with his latest victory, and grants him leadership, much to the dismay of the Emperor's son, Commodus (Phoenix). It isn't long before Commodus is consumed with rage, and murders his father, claiming the throne as his.Commodus puts out an order to the Praetorian men to kill Maximus's wife and son. Before Maximus can return in time to stop them, they are killed. Being in a functioning state of depression, and after being kidnapped by slaves who teach him how to fight, Maximus finds out he has a knack for fighting and slaying people. So the plot is born. Maximus is a great gladiator, and continues to fight and murder, leading up to his appearance at the Roman Colosseum.I've established that the film is long, which it is, but it is also fairly impotent. It's slow, a bit dreary, yet well written in the sense that decent dialog is always recited. After a while, though, you begin to grow weary of the film's hushed tone, and about five battle scenes later, the material begins to overstay its welcome.The film is slowly paced, but it definitely has a grand appeal. Crowe's performance is fantastic, and he brings life to a new action hero. For the brief time we see him, Richard Harris does a fantastic Emperor, and Joaquin Phoenix does an outstanding job playing a despicable, intolerable villain.I also stated that the film's costumes are nice, which they are, but after two hours they become sort of a chore to stare at. Some nice CGI is used, some scenes made up entirely of it, yet again, everything looks the same. Everything is mostly brown, green, and black, and very monotonous and harmful on the eyes.Not to mention, no characters are really developed at all. The film is two and a half hours, and neglects to give us very many personal traits of the characters. This is the perfect case of style over substance; a movie trait I've run into far too much recently. To value style over substance is to put looks in front of every other concern, rather than efficiency and depth. John Logan, one of the three writers of this film, would give us so many character traits of Howard Hughes in The Aviator, four years later. It's a shame that wasn't put in the foreground rather than a loud score and heavy action sequences with this.Gladiator isn't perfect, but it's a fairly memorable action flick, with some ups and downs. To me, this seems like a long B movie, with marvelous special effects and well known actors. It's just a shame that in two and a half hours we have to listen to decent, yet sometimes, redundant dialog, trait-less characters, and stare into a vast field of brown. At least we get Oscar worthy performances to watch for the most part.Starring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, Ralf Mller, and Richard Harris. Directed by: Ridley Scott.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen Gladiator you've probably still heard of it. It is set in The Roman era and stars Russell Crowe, Joquain Phoenix, Oliver Reed, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, David Schofield, John Shrapnel, Ralf Moller and Richard Harris. The plot is straight forward enough, but it is the depth of the characters that I feel make it far more interesting. Russell Crowe takes the lead as General Maximus, friend and apprentice of Emporer Marcus Auerlius (Richard Harris). When Aurelias names Maximus as his successor, Aurelias's son Commodus (Joqauin Phoenix) kills his father, banishes Maximus and assumes control of the throne. Maximus is bought into a Gladiator troop owned by rich ex-gladiator Proximo (Oliver Reed, in his last acting role). Maximus uses his military skills in the arena to get him all the way back to Commodus until it is agreed he will fight the Emporer one-to-one. Maximus then gains the trust of Commudus's sister (Connie Nielsen), Nephew (Spencer Treat Clark) and First Senator (Derek Jacobi). The stage is set for an almighty show-down between a lowly gladiator and his emperor. I found the film very powerful in terms of emotion and meaning, and Ridley Scott's directing is his best since Bladerunner. The ensemble cast, headed by Russell Crowe, works great, although what I don't understand is how Russell Crowe won the Oscar he was nominated for, but Joquain Phoenix didn't. Oliver Reed and Richard Harris perhaps give the strongest performances, as the film's 2 classic actors. The film is now 12 years old, but because of it's picture quality, and fantastic CGI, it looks like it could have been released yesterday. The final note is that Hans Zimmer's score is one of the best in any film made in recent years.</fullReview>

The story-line was captivating, left you on the edge of your seat, and touched your heart at the same time, and wasn't typical or predictable at all. I especially loved the ending of the movie.

		<fullReview>If you're not, then watch this film. After quite a long time, I have seen a film which is near-perfect. Outstanding story, outstanding acting, direction, music, production design, cinematography, editing and what not.The film is a fictionalized account of life of a Roman General Maximus, whose family is murdered (crucified), he himself is ordered to be hanged, all thanks to evil emperor Commodus. However, the destiny had other plans, he is turned into slave, into gladiator and ultimately he is fated to avenge his family.Probably Ridley Scott's best film, his magnificent vision of ancient Rome and focused direction is something to be applauded. His way of story telling has unique style to it. He got almost all things right - ranging from costumes to acting, sets to cinematography.While film's story sounds like some classical Shakespeare tragedy, David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson manage to give the script a cinematic edge. Although the film suffers some schmaltzy dialogs here and there, but it is engaging enough to keep the viewer on the edge of the seat.The film's sheer USP is the lead actors - Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Viewers feel the vengeance and sorrow of Maximus. Crowe's portrayal of Maximus is very humanly. Crowe manages to show the most complicated complex emotions in a very effortless way. But for me, Joaquin Phoenix took the cake away for his Commodus - he is as evil as a Satan but the same time, we all feel for him. Sometimes he behaves as if he is a sociopath, but again, he behaves as if he is not loved. Phoenix's pure acting talent will leave you spellbound.Apart from above, the film features amazing score by Hans Zimmer. The tracks "Wheat" and "Progeny" are completely haunting and they echo to your ears even after the film is over. The film features beautiful photography by John Mathieson, which is, of course, is highly color graded, but still, gorgeous none-the-less. Production Design by Arthur Max is breath-taking - you are really immersed into the 180 AD Rome.Another thing worth mentioning is the visual effects used in the film - the complete re-creation of the time-period, the digital reconstruction of Colosseum and of course the CGI tigers - are all outstanding, and it is very well justified why the film won Oscar for Visual Effects.In the end, Gladiator is highly entertaining, and at times, tear jerking film which is extremely well-made, fueled with great acting of Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Do not miss it.8.5/10 (rounded off to 9)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing thriller full of love, deception and violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is one of my favorite movies of all time because it has a very rich plot that leaves you on the edge of your seat through the entire movie, curious what is going to happen. The plot of this movie is not the only thing that makes this movie very intense and rich, the acting also contributed to this very realistic feel. I felt that the casting of the parts was done very well because there were very few if any actors who were weaker links. This is a movie of love, death, and deception and a sort of twisted plot in which a Roman general Maximus is betrayed and is enslaved as a gladiator. There are many intense battles throughout this movie that are very gory but still look very real. These battle scenes were very realistic and left me enthralled and it was hard for me to believe that I wasn't really in Rome as this battle was going on. Russell Crow's playing as Maximus was by far my favorite role because it seemed as if he was really feeling the emotions he would be feeling if he were really in the situations. I'm not going to give away anymore of the movie than that because I think that it is a movie that everyone should watch and find out for themselves because it is truly an amazing movie which I would recommend to anyone who doesn't mind a little blood and gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In AD 180, after his family(his son and the mother of said kid) are murdered, Maximus(I guess they didn't want to be completely overt and go with Biggus) seeks revenge over the man who also stole the position of ruler of Rome from him; Commodus, who they try really hard to make a villain out of. The acting is marvelous, with Crowe, Phoenix and Reed(R.I.P.) bringing their roles to life. All characters are credible and well-developed. The fighting, although apparently not consistent with reality of how they were trained, is really cool; they're of varying length with nice choreography. They're covered in close-ups and with hand-held, which really gives them a sense of intensity. The scope is epic, and this is realistic and authentic, giving you a feel of how it was back then. This has well-done FX, you basically can't tell the CGI from the real. The photography is excellent, with really impressive visuals. Dialog is fine. It is a tad Hollywood, as the overall thing is. Honestly, I would rate Spartacus higher than this. Kirk has gravitas far beyond that of Russell, the battles are *unforgettable* and powerful, the interplay between the people is heartfelt and rings true(and pays off), and the story is simply more inspirational(slave rises up against his master, early human rights campaign... this is just "I'm going to get back what I lost or get payback for it", and could have been set any other time or place). Still, a solid 142 minutes sans credits. There is a lot of disturbing content and bloody violence. The DVD comes with an interesting and informational commentary track by the director, the DOP and the editor. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhere in history the purveyors of psychology and psychiatry infected and influenced how media operates and presents stories. The positive is that the stories have weightier impact on the movie going public. But there's an obvious downside;The movies have no morals.They are valueless.So it is with "Gladiator" and the screenplay upon which this film is based. The characters are depicted as having motivations nested deep within their psyche, when in truth no such aspect was present in the real historic figures, notably Commodious. Crowe's Maximus is also similarly one-dimensional, such that the film can be nothing more than a revenge flick set in Imperial Rome.On top of this Ridley Scott, an excellent visual director, struggles to find palpable story material. And for a lack of it, tosses in a surreal or spiritual element that seems wholly out of place. Particularly when depicted with processed shots to show his ultimate goal and desires. Do we really need to see time lapse photography and surreal dream sequences representing the "afterlife"? It's confusing because this film isn't about religious issues. In theory, at least, it's about a man trying to contend with some spoiled tyrants psychological short comings. Which should give the astute viewer pause. Recall your classic sword- and-sandal epics. Oh, say, "Spartacus". How psychologically damaged were any of the characters in "Spartacus"? How about "Ben Hur"? "Cleopatra"? Anybody? How about any film before 1970?Answer; zero.But, we progress through the social "revolutions" of the 1960s, and suddenly there is no right and wrong. Everything is relative, and acts of evil must be caused by some form of child abuse or other emotional trauma.Was there ever a bigger lie foisted on the public?And this is why "Gladiator" fails to be a whole movie, but a palpable one to watch. It's theme and morals are lacking because they were never there to begin with. The honor of a general really has nothing to contend against, because the antagonist is so logically vilified that we know the outcome before the film is over with.That, and "Gladiator" lacked money. The original ending would have had Maximus's army colliding with Rome's Praetorian guard. A visual feast worthy of the cinematic talents of Ridley Scott. But, instead, we get this mano-a-mano crescendo that feels like a low budget alternative, because hey, it is.Gladiator had the promise of being a whole film. It really did. It's a magnificent piece to watch. Brilliantly staged and shot, but it so misses in the thematic department that one might as well watch a baseball game. I'm quite serious about that.Heck, even "The Ten Commandments", the epitome of religious film making, and this comment comes from an atheist, had more heart and soul than "Gladiator". And that's really too bad, because I happen to like elements of "Gladiator", but again, it's a half baked film like so much other mental-health drivel that's been cranked out in the last thirty years.This is why Roger Ebert astutely observed that this film feels like it's about more than it actually is. I would take that bit of profundity further, and apply to every so called modern adult film produced in the last three decades, and let the morons who've taken film making into a direction that sensationalizes emotion, but sucks the life out of hear, mind and soul. It is the reason classics will always remain classics, and why we've seen no classics since the 1960s. Just pretty tabloids disguising themselves as issue driven films, when in reality values are truncated, and the esteem of the emotional health of the individual is placed on the throne.So it is with "Gladiator". Imperial Rome didn't suffer from abused children. It's worst aspects were created by criminals who didn't care about what happened to their fellow man, because they wanted things their way. So it is with history. And so should it have been with "Gladiator".All in all, a watchable film for the fight sequences, but hardly the cinematic experience other reviews would lead you to believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So emotionally strong and captivating that you will not take your eyes off the screen until it is over. Also, a movie for men.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8.6It is no secret that men love Gladiator. The film's protagonist is easily relatable to. He is not a rich man, nor a noble. He has a family and a bit of land. He doesn't ask for more than that. However, he is also a soldier. A very good and respected soldier, in fact. He is a general. However, he is still under the rule of a king. That authority oppresses him and takes away what little he had. He manages to gain his respect and recognition back, but he doesn't do this by performing superheroic acts. In fact, most of the time he has his head down. Yet, he is a strong man, one that is able to survive everything that is thrown at him. It is easy to see why Gladiator appeals to men.It also helps that the film is very engaging. The filmmakers take the approach that puts you in the shoes of the protagonist. The protagonist doesn't say much, and only responds in wholehearted mutterings. The film does a very good job of engaging the audience's emotions. Throughout the narrative, it is easy to be captured by the tale and not be able to break free until satisfaction is found. The conclusion of the film comes as a surprise, but it does so in a way that summons so much emotion from the audience that it doesn't leave them with a foul taste afterward.The cinematography in Gladiator is great. From the cold forest that the intro sequence takes place in, to the hot, golden scenes in the desert, almost every scene in Gladiator does a fine job of inviting the audience. There are some very powerful scenes in the movie, such as the sequences where someone is walking through a wheat field, and passing his hand through the wheat. My favorite part of the entire film is that this was included in the beginning of the movie, and not just at the end. The moments where Maximus, the protagonist is near to death, are done very well. There are some mesmerizing moments where he seems to be floating to the afterlife.Of course, Gladiator is not without its imperfections. The film doesn't focus too much on the whole Gladiation thing. I can see this being pretty disappointing to some audiences. However, the gladiatorial chapters are handled very well. Again, the filmmakers display incredible ability to involve audiences. Some of the characters are a little hard to believe, in terms of their actions. Namely, the king and his sister. Some of the things that they do and say are a little unbelievable. Not in the sense that it wouldn't happen, but in the sense that it feels out of place in the film, and it doesn't translate well to the screen. The film is also paced a bit weird. It feels like too much time is spent in the setup, that the middle of the film ends up suffering. Clocking in at about two and a half hours, it's very surprising to see that such little time was spent in the arena.Gladiator is a very powerful film. It has good performances, and an incredible job by the crew. The only thing that holds it back is ultimately the script. Watching the final product, it feels like the pacing is odd, and the script needed to be refocused on different aspects of the film. Still, the filmmaker's ability to strike up emotion in the audiences is the strongest point of the film. Most likely, the film will capture your attention and not let go until its conclusion. It is also a film that appeals greatly to men. Some people say that film-making is all about the story. I think what is more important than the actual content of the narrative, is the execution of it. Not the story itself, but the storytelling. Apparently, Ridley Scott and crew know very well how to tell a story.</fullReview>

The emotions are so real and strong but are never over done.Maximus Decimus Meridias is a character that I will never forget. He is an honorable man, but put him in the right situation and he becomes a confident bad ass. When he is in the coliseum and is confronted by Caesar, I always get goose bumps. That scene drips with dramatic irony. Caesar has no idea that it is Maximus standing before him. One of my favorite quotes is uttered in this scene. And every time I see it I am totally convinced that Maximus "will get his vengeance, in this life or the next." Juaquin Phoenix as Caesar was a great villain. He was a whiny, conniving, childish, and above all evil man. When he tells Maximus about the murders of his family I was so disgusted with him. I hated him. That is how you know how good the villain is ? by how much you hate them. http://my.ilstu.edu/~mmsmerz/smerta/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Up until a few years ago, the Notting Hill Coronet was my favourite cinema in London. Not because they showed anything particularly special, but because, for a long time (and this sounds amazing now), it was the only cinema in the capital which still let you smoke in it. I even saw Hannibal there, and a couple of dodgy Shyamalans, just so I could savour the sensation of lighting up in an enclosed public space.The best film I ever caught there, fag in grateful gob, was Ridley Scott's sword 'n' sandal smash. Before the turn of the decade, if you'd told someone you were making a movie about gladiators, they'd have laughed in your face, and quoted that line from Airplane! back at you. So to turn such a laughable genre into pure gold, one of the most purely entertaining films ever made, is no mean feat.Neither is what I did on June 10 2008, around lunchtime, when I decided, after 20 years faithful servitude, to smoke my last ever cigarette. Just typing that feels weird. One day at a time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Convincing and invigoration as all suspension of disbelief is snuffed in the opening treacherous battle of Germania 150 AD. Russell Crowe is commanding as heralded Roman war general Maximus whose moral compass is clearly fixated on family, strength and honor. His rescue from the dead is enthralling, if only to be enslaved as a potential Gladiator whipping boy. His story of revenge, catapulting him to the grand arena, seems as inevitable as his determination is contagious. Despite Crowe's Aussie accent and the pubescent and down-right creepy portrayal of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) all performances are come off empirical allowing the plot to develop, boil, and close with an every mans' belief of an afterlife, the soul of his mission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without a shadow of doubt this is one of the best movies ever made and certainly the making of Russell Crowe. Crowe puts in a performance of epic stature as the General Maximus Meridius and its brilliantly directed by the awesome Ridley Scott. Never thought Mr.Scott could surpass 'Blade Runner' or 'Alien' but I think this movie has everything and some!! I just cannot say enough about this film except believe the hype - I've just watched the extended blu-ray version (all but 3 hours) and its as good now as the first time I watched it. Every actor in this film puts in a stellar performance - as well as Crowe there is Joaquin Phoenix as the much reviled Commodus, the amazing Richard Harris as an all but too brief Marcus Aurilius, Dijimon Hounsou as the slave Juba and other great performances from the likes of Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Thomas Arana amongst others. Not for one moment during the entire movie do you find yourself losing interest - it is just totally engrossing to the last minute.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot imagine anyone else playing the role of Maximus or Commodus in this movie. I saw it when it was first released in the UK cinemas and have watched it on DVD several times since.Maximus displays all of the morals the ideal hero, loyal, family devoted, brave, modest and merciful.Whilst Commodus was the exact opposite.It allows you to explore all of the emotions from fear to grief.Films of this class only this come around once a decade.Off topic, I have never seen Russell Crowe in any other film and liked him much as an actor as i did in Gladiator and the same goes for Joaquin Phoenix which speaks more about the production and script than it does about the acting. These actors were chosen very well indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie ranks up there with Ben Hur, Spartacus, The Fall of the Roman Empire (the same story as Gladiator minus the Gladiator and with the second best chariot race on film), Quo Vadis, The Robe and others. The cast is superb from Oscar winner Russell Crowe to Joaquin Phoenix, the late, great Richard Harris, Oliver Reed (in his last role), David Hemming, Derek Jacobi, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Honsou and the rest. Ridley Scott keeps it moving at break-neck pace and has created a masterpiece. I won't go into the plot, but I will say it is nail biting tense, stunningly beautiful, very moving and even heartbreaking. If there's not enough action in this one for you, well then, you'll never be satisfied. I should mention the awesomely magnificent music score by the great Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. If you enjoy a great Epic film, then this is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic worthy of Best Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To my surprise, I've read several negative comments on this film, referring to it both as "fluff" and a "Braveheart-wanna-be." I found "Gladiator" to be a well-made, engaging epic and character study of Maximus (Russell Crowe), a general who becomes a fugitive and comes back to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge on the ones who killed his family. Maximus is a great character that many people can probably somehow relate to. This is Russell Crowe's best film by a long shot. In the same way that "Braveheart" taught us that "Every man dies, not every man really lives," this film teaches us that "What we do in life echoes in eternity," an equally compelling message that resonates both during and long after the movie is over. The film's unique way of depicting the afterlife (which I won't give away here) is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, and the flashbacks between eternity and the battle scenes toward the end are due to Ridley Scott's superb job of directing this film. It's not completely flawless as "Braveheart" was, since I could have done without a particular murder sequence and a few of the battle scenes which are a bit repetitive. Nevertheless, I give this film a high recommendation. "Gladiator" will entertain and engage you, giving you a lot to think about when living your life.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But also humane. And directed with great proficiency by the veteran Ridley Scott. The battle sequences in the beginning are great not only in every detail in close-up plans but also in general view ones. The sound track is fabulous in some scenes. The story is intensely dramatic and well conceived. Of course historic truth is not respected nor it had to be. The artist is not a historian and when he inspires himself in History to make his work he doesn't need to follow truth in every detail providing he doesn't change historical spirit or commits grave falsehood. The artist is a creator not an imitator. His allegiance is to aesthetic values not to historical superficial truth. We know for instance that Commodus was killed by his friends and his concubine Martia and not by a gladiator who was a former general, in the arena, like in the movie but we also know that he was a tyrannical despot and he liked gladiator fights very much, having in fact taken part personally in some of them. The acting is good enough perhaps with the exception of Joaquin Phoenix which is not very convincing in the role of Commodus. A good movie in general terms anyway.</fullReview>

Sure, there is some violent content, but it's nothing compared to some recent movies like 300 and Sin City. There is no sex or language or drug content. Kids are gonna see worse films than this. I bet they already have. Overall this is a fantastic movie. Let 11+ watch it. C'Mon parents. It is not nearly as bad as any new action adventure movie.

		<fullReview>Yesterday evening I learned more about a specific part of the history of the Roman Empire than I ever did on University. 'The devil disappeared from the details' and some angel must have entered. Marcus Aurelius was the only Roman Emperor who is also known as a great philosopher. His murdering by Commodus was a really cruel scene. The role of Russell Crowe was played exceptionally well and the details in the whole movie were so exact that I still could blame some of my University-professors of not knowing what they were talking about.History presented this way would become a new approach for youngsters who prefer all kind of subjects...minus history. Giving more than 10/excellent is not possible but Ridley Scott is in my opinion the best man to re-introduce 'History as a subject' on both High Schools and Universities. I'm afraid that some professors will have to choose for early retirement if that miracle would happen...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My thoughts tend to be similar to the rest. Great directing, scenery, musical score, and cinematography.After watching Gladiator again though, it was the characters that transfixed me. Russell Crowe is simply amazing. His eyes tell the story in every take he's in. So many times he says something that everyone around him takes in a normal context. But the audience can tell through his eyes his every thought and motivation. The only character who could possibly have been even better was Phoenix's Commodus. He is not like that in real life, but to become such whiny, bratty, &amp; jealous character (to the level that Commodus is) and make it believable is incredible.It was so interesting following every character's motivation and perspective. Proximo's speeches are truly amazing, and although he was addressing gladiators, his philosophy is universal.The characters, story, and the culture of Rome is unforgettable and exceptionally well done.</fullReview>

Directed by Ridley Scott, the film's pacing is slow and the story is essentially a revenge drama. Joaquin Phoenix is very effective playing the malevolent but tortured Commodus. Richard Harris adds a touch of class as Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Derek Jacobi is good in a brief role. The opening battle scene is brilliant. The rest of the action is visceral and bloody.

		<shortDescription>entertaining Roman epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from its graphic violence, 'Gladiator' is quite the old-fashioned movie; you may even feel you've seen more or less the same story many times before. The plot certainly seems right out of Roman Film Epics 101 as all the reliable ingredients are there. Credit director Ridley Scott and star Russell Crowe for making the familiar appear so fresh again, crafting an intriguing if not exactly mesmerizing film, winning five Academy Awards including for picture and actor and achieving great popular success at the box office. Perhaps enough time had passed for a really good gladiator flick to click with audiences, or perhaps today's crowd has never seen 'Spartacus' or some of the others. For whatever reason, they turned out in droves to see 'Gladiator,' just as the people of Rome turn out to see Crowe's Maximus defeat foe after foe in the arena. Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the 'last good emperor' of Rome, chooses Maximus to be his successor over his own son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The son discovers this and kills his father before the succession can be announced and proclaims himself emperor. (Already, you can see where this is going.) Commodus of course is a weak figure, full of despicable traits, including having the hots for his sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). All sorts of conflicts and political intrigue ensue before finally, Maximus and Commodus meet in the arena for a death match. Guess who wins, despite having been mortally wounded just prior to the contest. 'Gladiator' may be the most 'mainstream' film Ridley Scott has ever directed, very straightforward in its storytelling and without as many quirky touches as most of his other movies. Crowe, Phoenix, Harris, and Nielsen all deliver good performances, Crowe in particular winning the audience over, again, just as Maximus does in the movie itself. While there is nothing really remarkable about 'Gladiator,' it is solid entertainment and does not seem nearly as long as its running time suggests, which is always a good thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched this movie I had never before seen any of Ridley Scott's or Russell Crowe's work. After having seen it I tried to familiarize myself with all of their work, but none have matched the caliber of this film.One of the greater points of this film is its acting. Crowe brings us this broken man with nothing to live for but revenge, but who comes to understand that he must fight (and fight he shall) for something much more than personal glory. Joaquin Phoenix brings us a tormented emperor who after feeling betrayed by his father, and who trys to find the love he failed to find from his father in the Roman crowds. In his final film role, Oliver Reed plays a former gladiator who tries to catch some of the glory that basks of his trainees, in an effort to reclaim the feeling of winning the crowd.But in my opinion, the films highest point is in its score. Hans Zimmer composes a score for the ages that fits perfectly with every scene, whether it is Maximus riding into battle, Commodus scheming against the senate, or the unforggetable climax.In short: Gladiator is a masterpiece. It is an instant classic, a tearjerker, a thrill, and any other adjective noun that can be thought of, an easily deserving of any award it should receive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If i live to be 100, i'll never forget Gladiator. a film that feels so modern, but takes place in the time of B.C., where Rome reigned over the world and 25% of the population lived and died under the rule of the Caesars.Our hero is Maximus, a General who possesses a superb ability to survive anything. he doesn't die no matter what happens. when he is asked by Marcus Arelius, to become the emperor of Rome, But he declines. this leads to the throne being stolen by Commadus, the Corrupt and immoral Son of Marcus Arelius, and opening the great coliseum for gladiator battles.This movie has a basic level of gore, and it's more fun to watch than an adult film cause of that. with the gore aside, this film has a modern feeling to it. everything about it feels modern. it has a WWE kind of feel as well, with maximus being like stone cold steve austin and Commadus being like Mr. McMahon.

		<fullReview>Some people claim that Braveheart is the best epic movie ever made: they are really wrong, and is one of the worst films ever made. Gladiator one the other hand is a very good movie, showing that Ridley Scott is a master film-making, showing that he can do any genre and helped make Russell Crowe into a true A-lister.Gladiator tells the story of Maximus Meridius (Russell Crowe), a Roman General who fought in the war against Germanian tribes. After a massive victory for the Roman, Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) and his children Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) arrive at the frontline. Marcus Aurelius doubts Commodus abilities to become Emperor and asks Maximus to protect Rome by bringing back the Republic and make the Senate powerful again. However before Maximus could do anything Commodus murders his father and arrests Maximus, planning to kill him. When Maximus he returns to his farm and finds his wife and son were murder and he gets captured by Commodus forces. He is sold into slavery and then a gladiator in a backwater in North Africa. In Rome Commodus decides to reintroduce gladiatorial contests in honour of his father who had banned them. Because of Maximus and his comrades success in North Africa they get a chance to fight in Rome. Maximus becomes so success that the people of Rome love him and becomes a challenge to the Emperor.What Gladiator does well is fight and battle scene. Scott brings in realistic violence which wasn't allowed during the golden age of sword and scandal epics. It's a gore fest, but its a good gore fest. The fights were brilliant. The battle scene at the beginning of film is one of the best ever in cinema, must better then anything in Braveheart. The battle was realistic, showing how the Roman army would have fought against a Barbarian army. Compare it to anything in Braveheart which was a farce in all respects. The acting in the film is top-notch. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix were on the top of their game and this film is an example of why they became a-listers. Oliver Reed offered the audience his swansong and even Omid Djalili offered a little light relief. As well Ridley Scott tries to show Commodus as a more human character, that he did have some redeemable features like his love for his nepthew. The characters are not completely good or completely evil. It doesn't try to moralise the issues. Compare to the God-awful Braveheart where they is no attempt to show the characters as human or realistic, and that all English characters were pure evil and all Scots were goodness and like. The film also had a solid script behind it, which is very quotable and has a good, classical story behind it. It has a old fashion feel to it, and Ridley Scott said that he was influenced by films like Ben-hur and Spartacus. This is one of my brother's favourite films.However, one of the big problems with the film is that one of the best scenes was right at the beginning of the film, similar to Saving Private Ryan, which means that nothing each can in the film can compare to it. As well, whilst most of the film is realist, they are some aspects which are not so realist, like when Tigris of Gaul enters into the Colosseum, but those thinks are minor and doesn't affect the enjoyment.I criticise Braveheart for its historical inaccuracies, but don't do the same with Gladiator. That's because Braveheart was pretending to be a historical film and telling the facts (it doesn't), Gladiator also set itself out to be a fictional story and nothing a rewrite of history.Whether Gladiator deserved to win all the Oscars it got is debatable, but it is a very entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few actors are interesting as persons, by what they have to say individually, in private, off?screen. I would name Rourke, Brando, Clift, Crowe. On the other hand, several first?hand actors are eminently uninteresting as personalities?De Niro, Pacino, Hopkins, Newman, Willis, Bogart,I have found myself missing Crowe's roles that I already knew. He is a typical example of an actor better than the movies he's in?like Pacino, like Gabin and De Niro for the most part of their careers. He is worth more than his movies.I like the ample, colossal battles scenes (and CNN's best -- and worst -- movie battle scenes list ?). The scenes of enormous crowds, of hosts and hoards, of unnumbered armies ?.The battle scenes make the epics (in the conventional sense). There's no true epic without those battle scenes. Sometimes, it's a perspective, an angle; most often, it's slapdash and exploitation. They give the thrills. The tumult, the excitement, the manly fierceness, too often the highly idealized rendering of the battle's thrills (where realism means gore, but not cowardice, physiology, stupidity, irrational things, confusion, fear, chaos, arbitrary moves, etc.).The battle with the Germanic tribes at the beginning of GLADIATOR is good and impressing and a strong visual experience (though not as copious as deemed by some to be?one would have liked more?more of everything in that battle). GLADIATOR is a thriller?i.e., an adventure story, well paced and extremely aware of corporeality, of a happy and athletic one, and of the bodily, manly and physical world. This is the core of a thriller. By its high violence, its large amount of brutality, strikingly featured, it has also a side of decadence. It is suspenseful, inventive, luring.Crowe is not an unsubtle actor; moreover, he's better than Depp, Pitt, and even than Willis, and finer than Spacey. Very endowed, gifted, and very intelligent also. His finest roles have that brio given by the intelligence alone. GLADIATOR is a considerable thriller?extraordinarily scored, acted, filmed. By its inner nature and trend, it is a thriller. I am in a phase when Crowe is (again, but differently) very important to my notions of cinema. I am eager of each Crowe role. The artificiality brought by the CGI suits somehow, if properly used, the cinema's nature?I mean the technical artificialities.As a footnote, I consider GLADIATOR was a notable influence on Gibson's religious masterpiece?for the violence, the cruelty, the military brutality, the harsh barbarianism. Way ago, when directors showed violence and brutality, they were aware of doing something sordid, nasty and dirty; but now, they do it with the conscience of doing something grand, epic, even noble. This is the change: the ennoblement of violence on an epic scale. Larger?than?life violence, shown with a clean conscience and with a sort of clean technical pride. Rehabilitating violence on screen.Crowe, with his bitter, manly, intelligent smile.Crowe was right that most of the lines?his, the others' ?are utter crap. But the performances are unexpectedly good. Of course, Crowe absolutely dominates the movie, and his role might be the best performance ever in this (revisited, reformed, reshaped, reconfigured) genre of movies.It is interesting that once the emperor Marcus was harshly judged for his failure with his son ?this was hold against him, and nowadays one would consider absurd, unfitting to evaluate Sartre or another such modern philosophers for their failure to live up to their standards. This shows how things have changed, and not for the worse?and how the honest quest for wisdom, and for wisdom in each practical aspect, was replaced with the quest for an invalid wisdom masquerading for something else and practically undermining itself.</fullReview>

The story, the acting, the action, it was all good. Russel Crowe just can't go wrong. Can someone tell me a bad movie he was in? Maybe "Virtuosity", but even that wasn't that bad. I have to applaud Joaquin Phoenix as well. He played such a loathsome and detestable coward that it was as if he was born for the role.The story was better than just a traditional tale of vengeance. Initially there were no signs or hints that Maximus (Crowe) had the intention of going after Commodus (Phoenix), but once the opportunity presented itself, he definitely was driven towards that goal. And even though we all wanted Maximus to kill Commodus it was more than just that. Maximus was avenging the death of his family and freeing Rome from the hands of a tyrant as well.I really found the story compelling. I found myself wholly behind Maximus and his efforts, if not because of his admirability, then certainly because of Commodus' lack of it. Gladiator is yet another great battle movie that is strengthened by its story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up in the heyday of the sword-and-sandal spectaculars; I was ten years old when THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE was released. That film bombed at the box office and brought down a studio, and the genre died.It wasn't until GLADIATOR hit the screens that the old-fashioned historical epic was revived. The story is set at the same time as FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE and features some of the same historical characters. The basic plot, however, is quite different, and of course film technology has changed.FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE featured ruinously expensive sets; GLADIATOR was able to recreate ancient Rome with computer generated visuals. There's a certain stiffness to CGI that you don't see in the older films, but it still produces a level of detail that would otherwise be impossible. The Colosseum comes to vivid life, and the production design creates a decadent look reminiscent of FELLINI SATYRICON.The story is fairly simple; one might call it WALKING TALL, Roman style. The wise emperor Marcus Aurelius intends to name the general Maximus as his successor, but his son Commodus has other ideas. Maximus narrowly escapes assassination, but returns home to find his family murdered by Commodus, now Emperor.The film works because Russell Crowe's performance makes you believe in his character. Maximus is a generic hero, but Crowe breathes life into him and brings out dimensions that aren't in the script. A lesser actor could have made this a very dull film indeed.Supporting performances by the priceless Derek Jacobi, Oliver Reed, and Djimon Honsou round out the excellent cast.Where the film falters is in Joaquin Phoenix's characterization of the Emperor Commodus. He is not lethal, threatening, or even interestingly unbalanced. He is a crybaby, a wimp who pouts and sniffles in every scene. FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE suffers from a terrible performance by Stephen Boyd in the lead role; GLADIATOR has the opposite problem: a dull, whiny villain. The problem is more the script than the actor, but Phoenix is unable to find an interesting dimension and ultimately is only annoying. It's easy to believe Maximus can swat him aside like a fly.As a result, the last twenty minutes or so are anticlimactic. The final sequence is effective, however, and again imbues the heroic Maximus with a believably human dimension.It's unfortunate that the success of GLADIATOR didn't lead to a revival of the genre. TROY did not do great box office in 2004, and that may have made the Hollywood execs skittish again. Too bad. GLADIATOR was a welcome respite from endless summer sequels and costumed superhero films, and it's a worthy successor to the classics like EL CID and SPARTACUS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting was excellent. Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar he won. Joaquin Phoenix was very good as the incompetent Commodus. The rest of the cast was excellent as well. The movie was lacking in direction, sets, and continuity. There were some very interesting and original aspects to the film: Crowe's character was not one-dimensional. Neither was Phoenix's character. However, the direction was terrible and there were some implausible action sequences. In the Coliseum, we see a chariot attack upon huddled gladiators. The action seems confused, and rightly so. Play it out in slow-mo and you'll see gaps where people disappear and reappear. This jumbled computer generated mess looks pale in comparison to the live action scenes shot in the 60's. The part where Maximus throws his sword 100 feet to kill a guy was ludicrous; like a cartoon. The shots of the Coliseum were lacking. It was as if Scott couldn't afford to hire extras to be in the crowd. The sets seemed shabby and dark. The sequence at the beginning where the Romans fight the Barbarians was very well done and memorable. Too bad this quality could not last throughout the film. The ending was not satisfying enough. Maximus should have rammed the sword down Commodus' throat. I'll close with repeating that the computer generated action sequences were poorly done. The action was too fast for the eye to see and, if viewed in freeze frame, very deceptive and phony.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott puts epic back on the map</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was at High School everyone was going on about Gladiator and how good it was. Having seen several old movies like Spartus, I knew that these movies would require you to get into the mood for them to really enjoy them. And it seemed that all these years later and several failed attempts later I finally got around to viewing it. All I can say is that it truly was worth the hype when it came out and after all this time it still has not lost its shine as it still has the ability to entertain us. Ridley Scott set out to give us an epic and thats exactly what he had managed to do. I can't think of anybody else who could of done a job to the quality of Russell Crowe although if you pay close attention you can hear his Australian accent a bit. Joaquin Phoneix him-self was marvellous along with Oliver Reed, along with Derek Jacobi and Richard Harris , they were nothing short of mind blowing. The script was sharp and tight not to mention the costumes, make-up and various other things that made the whole experiences breath taking. The music alone is worth a purchase and it adds a certain haunt to the point where one really does want to cry. To conclude Gladiator for me is a bit like a Porshce Carrera GT , if you put the effort into watching this then I promise it is a form of pure escapism rather than entertainment. It must be on your '100 films to watch before I die' list!GLADIATOR - 8.6 OUT OF 10'On my command - unleash hell' , Maxiums (Russsell Crowe)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Emperor Marcus Aurelius' son Commodus murders his father, he must also do away with Maximus Decimus Meridius, the finest general. Maximus escapes his execution, but finds his wife and child murdered. Wandering and wounded near death, he is picked up and put into slavery, and selected to fight for sport as a gladiator. From there, he seeks revenge.While it's all grand opera, and driven by sweeping gestures and pompous, overwritten dialogue, it is prone to plain silliness - especially in granting us the big showdown at the close. But the sheer dynamism of the action, coupled with Hans Zimmer's lavish score and the forcefield of Crowe, still makes this a fierce-some competitor as one of the best historic films in recent memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought this would be just a blood fest, but I was wrong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the last seven years, I heard many people rave about Gladiator. I put off viewing the movie, because I thought it would be just another gore fest. I was wrong. This movie has a great plot and great heart to it. It doesn't sugar coat life in ancient Rome. Rome an assume civilization, but it also was one of great brutality. Life was very hard. Russell Crowe was excellent as a hero who was pure of heart. He could fight and defeat the best of them, but he never did it out of sadism. His character, a Roman general, was a bit naive actually, and believed in "good intentions". Unfortunately, he is up against the amoral son of the Roman Emperor (Richard Harris), who is all into macho-ism, but never has really been on a battle field or in the gladiator ring. That makes the son (Joaquim Phoenix) filled with spite, fear, resentment, jealously and hate for all that the Gladiator-General (Crowe) represents. The hero is all about bravery and valor, but not out about playing politician and hurting people out of spite like the Emperor's son was. I really liked this movie a lot. It was very well acted, very well filmed, very realistic, and also portrayed how hard and brutal life was in the Roman Empire. It was also Oliver Reed's last role. He plays an Arab or African owner-leader of the "Gladiators". He can be brutal and ruthless, but develops a heart when he sees that the hero is really standing up for the "common man", and not just a "coward".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is truly a masterpiece, a classic. My only regret is that I didn't get to see it on the big screen, I have only watched it on DVD. Technically it's as close to perfect as they come. I had never seen Russell Crowe in a leading role before this and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed also put in first class performances. It was also nice to see an all too rare appearance by David Hemmings in his rather comical role as Cassius.The sets were awe inspiring. I find gore distasteful but the speed at which the action sequences take place allows insufficient time for it to become gratuitous. Besides, it's hard to depict the Roman arenas without showing a little blood, right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is a movie about "the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, and the gladiator who defied an emperor". Immediately after watching the opening scene of Gladiator, in which Maximus leads his great army numbering over 1000 to victory over Germania, I was sure the experience would be rewarding. Richard Crowe, who plays Maximus in the movie, is a great Roman general under the rule of Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Harris). However, Aurelius soon leaves the throne to his Maximus, or at least he wished so. Wishing to bestow his title onto Maximus, Commodus, who is the son of Aurelius, murders him and claims his title as emperor. He sends Maximus into exile and sentences him and his family to death. Following this scene, I was advised to hold on to the edge of my seat, and so I pass on the advice.After his sentence, Maximus rushes to Spain in an effort to save his family, but alas. Hung by nooses from the vines of the trees surrounding his home, his wife and son disappear, and so does his will to live. This sudden loss makes him an easy target for slavers roaming the countryside, and so begins his life as a gladiator. Loved by the people and his fellow troops, he plays the image of the hero perfectly in this riveting film. Maximus's true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed, and the actions of Commodus in his cruel efforts to destroy Maximus once and for all are halted in the end, and what an unforgettable ending it is. The music and scene quality contribute immensely to the mood, which is perfectly played by Crowe and allows the movie's tone and general feel to reverberate in your bones long after watching it thanks to the incredible ending. The amazing cinematography further heightens its level on the greater scale when compared to other movies of its kind. I'm only stating a fact when I say that as far as everything from acting and directing to the storyline and special effects go, this movie is SPECTACULAR. It's certainly very moving and emotionally satisfying. I'd recommend it any day to those who haven't seen it. Personally, six times hasn't been enough for me, as this is a movie you can't get tired of seeing. Enjoy :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into the cinema not knowing how this movie was going to turn out. Right from the word go I was gripped till the end. The fight scenes were some of the best I have ever seen. Until this movie I had never seen an historical epic and this movie got me hooked on them. At almost 3 hours it may seem long but you will engrossed in the movie that time will fly by.Russell Crowe was magnificent as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix was superb. This movie is famous for having Oliver Reed's last performance, he died during the filming and some of his scenes are computer generated. Ridley Scott as the director is extremely good.

		<fullReview>Bringing back the epic genre, Gladiator makes the classics Ben-Hur and Spartacus proud by recreating the wonder, grit and feel of being in Ancient Rome. An exceptional effort was done by all involved. The costumes, the cinematography, the choreography, even the music itself, Gladiator is deserving in all of its awards and nominations received. Let us not forget the actors themselves. Truly, Gladiator is one film that will stand the test of time for many years to come.General Maximus helps Marcus Aurelius keep Germania under check, but who will do the same for Rome in the case of the Caesar's death? Marcus doesn't think his son, Commodus will do any good in charge. "No morals," the Caesar claims, but Commodus thinks of himself as merciful, by killing his father, Maximus' family and intimidating the Senate. Maximus survives his own assassination attempt and swears to right wrong and get revenge.Some of the best action sequences are seen in Gladiator. A couple of those are the first fights in the Colosseum. Joaquin Phoenix does an outstanding job himself playing the villain Commodus. The scenes with him and Lucius are some of the more terrifying I've seen, particularly since Ridley Scott does a good job portraying their bond from Lucilla's perspective. Proximo stated to Maximus that he had to win the crowd, and surely by doing that, he won movie-goers as well, as this will remain one of Russell Crowe's finest performances. Epic, blockbuster and critically acclaimed, Gladiator had earned its Academy Award for Best Picture, and then some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite simply the best epic movie ever made !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After my recent re-viewing of the film, I felt obliged to leave a comment. Gladiator is the epic that makes all other epics look bad, it's flawless in almost every way. The music is more than top notch: Hans Zimmer has written his best score in years, the locations are astonishingly beautiful, the colors used are very well chosen and add to the certain atmosphere the movie has, the acting is brilliant: there are three Oscar-worthy performances here (Djimon Hounsou, Joaquin Phoenix, Russell Crowe)...all the elements come together just right and that's really so unique that it's a thrill to watch.There are two things that completely make or break a movie for me: the beginning and the end. A movie can be brilliant up until the end but if that last scene disappoints, I leave the movie theater with a bad aftertaste. Luckily, in Gladiator, the ending is brilliantly haunting, which adds so much to the movie. The music accompanying the scene is one of the best fitting scene-music pieces ever. It's just indescribable.While some may argue that it doesn't deserve all the praise it's getting because it's 'just an action-movie', I feel that it's so much more than that: the dialog is great, the acting likewise, and while the movie may have a large number of action-sequences, that's not what it's really about. It's a tale of a person, a very real person, which is a truly remarkable one.After recently seeing Troy, 300 and Alexander, I'm convinced now more than ever, that Gladiator will be the best epic ever made for years to come ( even despite the growth in technical ability over the last few years). It's always been on my best-of list and that's not likely going to change soon. If I could give more than 10, I would, but since I can't...:-)10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a huge fan of this movie since it came out, but now, after being in the Roman Colisseus and learning more about the history of Gladiators, the historical phases of Rome at the time, and specially, the combats, I can't praise this movie enough.The fighting sequences are accurate according to history so this movie perfectly represents the specularity of the "diversion"/"fun" that Romans at the time enjoyed. Also, the form of government at the time is well represented in the movie as well as the cruelty of the Emperors and his minions.Different Emperors brought new attractions to the spectacle; for example, one of the later Emperors brought hippopotamus from Egypt to combat against Gladiators.But history is not the point in this movie. "Gladiator" is filled with spectacular action, epic battles, a feeling of power, and even has room for tenderness.The cinematography, art direction, and editing are simply great, great. This is one of the best epic movies of all time because of the production values, great plot, and accurate history behind the movie.I can only recommend this movie to EVERYONE because it's one of the most important movies of the new millennium. Just relax and take it seriously.Being on Rome, and Italy overall; I couldn't stop thinking about "Gladiator". That's how important and impressive this movie is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprisingly accurate historically (at least compared to other films) with the exception of the main character (maximus) who is almost unknown to history. He is actually a composite of individuals mentioned in the opening of Marcus Aurelius 'Meditations' - his personal philosophical journal. There is actually a person named Maximus, however his station is unrecorded. "From Maximus I learned self-government, and not to be led aside by anything; and cheerfulness in all circumstances, as well as in illness; and a just admixture in the moral character of sweetness and dignity, and to do what was set before me without complaining. I observed that everybody believed that he thought as he spoke, and that in all that he did he never had any bad intention; and he never showed amazement and surprise, and was never in a hurry, and never put off doing a thing, nor was perplexed nor dejected, nor did he ever laugh to disguise his vexation, nor, on the other hand, was he ever passionate or suspicious. He was accustomed to do acts of beneficence, and was ready to forgive, and was free from all falsehood; and he presented the appearance of a man who could not be diverted from right rather than of a man who had been improved. I observed, too, that no man could ever think that he was despised by Maximus, or ever venture to think himself a better man. He had also the art of being humorous in an agreeable way.

		<shortDescription>The best epic ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having grown up watching historical epics like "Ben-Hur", "Spartacus" and "El Cid" it was wonderful to see this type of film making a comeback. The first film I watched on this scale was Cecil B Demille's "The Ten Commandments" starring Charlton Heston which even now still amazes me how they achieved those effects seeing as the film is now 50 years old.However, where the older films costumes seemed to be a little too clean, there was an element of realism in the look of this film. I cannot flaw any part of it. It has very strong performances from Russell Crowe (a well deserved Oscar winner), Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou as well as veteran actors Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. It was beautifully made and designed, accompanied by an excellent dramatic score which captured the elements perfectly. I thought it was a wonderful story which everyone can relate to about a man (Maximus, played by Russell Crowe) who just wants to go home to his family and his journey to get there "a general who became a slave, a slave who became a gladiator, a gladiator who defied an emperor". Despite the sadness of our hero dying at the end it was also happy as he had freed Rome from the dictatorship of rival Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and returned to his family in the after life. The look of the film was so real it made me believe that they had actually built models of Rome and had all those people in the Colosseum and all those soldiers were on the battlefield of Germania. I loved the fact they did not feel they needed to glamorise it just to put bottoms on seats unlike other epic films like "Titanic" and "Pearl Harbour" which had to put a love triangle in the movie which to me ruined the background events.In short, one of my favourite films and the best epic ever!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly disappointing and somewhat hard to endure for historical educated people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator promised to be the precursor of a new generation of historical movies. Therefore expectations were high. Special effects in the movie business reached a level where the realisation of every story themed possible. Saving Private Ryan gave a good impression of how the new historical movies could look like: gigantic, fast and dirty. Gladiator had all that and it lacked everything else. The movie was a pain to watch for every historian. It featured wrong written Latin and wrong Roman names, weapons and armour from an era of more than one millennium, even some very futuristic items like the praetorian uniforms and Maximus' helmet, and a confused presentation of the Roman behaviour. All this could have been avoided easily by simply consulting the engaged historian who refused to be mentioned in the credits due to all the mentioned mistakes. Historical people appeared but were almost impossible to recognize. The Germanic warriors looked like cavemen, but were in fact entirely Romanised by this time, the mistrust of Marcus Aurelius in his own son was incomprehensible as was his desire to reestablish the republic and Commodus is simplified to the stereotypical Roman tyrant he has never been. The story was more than common. It was a conglomeration of well known Hollywood stories featuring betrayal, violence and an upcoming underdog. And finally the movie avoided profundity. The characters were clichs, Commodus for example was the stereotyped tyrant, who is dastard, cruel and commits incest. Every aspect was divided in black and white extremes - the muddy and dark Germania versus the clean and shiny Rome, the true and honourable legionnaire forces versus the corrupt and hypocritical Roman politicians, the honest and brave Maximus versus the craven and week Commodus. And all the stereotypes of the Roman Empire were reproduced. The film featured a powerless senate, a nasty emperor, a brave gladiator, conquering Roman legionnaires, fierce barbarians, a woman in the background and the end of a regency. By trying to combine all these features in one movie the movie itself looses its plausibility.If you can ignore all that you will find Gladiator a simple but entertaining movie to lighten a boring afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The action scenes in Galdiator are brilliant - and I would consider amongst the most authentic battle scenes etc that I've seen to date. The intrigue is well souped up throughout, but falls down seriously (for me) with an exchange between characters that just wouldn't have happened in Ancient Rome. The particular scenes that caused me problems were more reminiscent of a modern-day barrack-room confrontation, or a Pale Rider showdown, stirring stuff indeed, but it wasn't Rome. Subsequently, I found myself tutting and snickering at some points. I also felt that the film milked heavily on memories of I Claudius, (the BBC serial) but just didn't have the refined character portrayal so well developed by Robert Graves. It's a jolly good yarn, but simply a lavish, modern day cathartic exercise of revenge, dressed up in togas and breast plates.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the time of its release, "Gladiator" promised far more than it delivered; part of the audience still had some hope "G.I. Jane" and "White squall" were the exception to Scott's career (other "exceptions" such as "Thelma &amp; Louise" and "Black rain" were too far behind to be remembered) and Crowe had recently hit the big screen with "L.A. Confidential" and "The insider", making us believe he was indeed a versatile actor.But when the moment of truth came, it all came down to a formulaic, even boring revisiting of "peplum" with a penchant for vengeance and codes of honor, some sort of Spaghetti Western on sandals. Worst of all, it is extremely inaccurate in its depiction of Ancient Rome, and there is something in its inaccuracy that makes me think it was intentional; for instance, the only main character with a Mediterranean phenotype is Joaquin Phoenix, albeit the rest of the main cast (Crowe, Harris, Nielsen, Jacobi, Reed, ...), although apparently Roman patricians and "equites", would be far more adequate playing Celts or Germans. And moreover, the true Germans were shown for a couple of minutes as furtive, dirty, easily disposable barbarian thugs who hid behind the trees making guttural noises and looked anything but Nordic. Furthermore, a grandiloquence is attributed to Roman architecture, urbanism and daily life which is highly unlikely to be even similar to the real Rome of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. Even some of the weapons shown at the beginning of the film are extremely unlikely to have existed. In other words: this is not a reconstruction of Rome, but a projection, a deformed mirror from which a certain country of our days looks at itself. This happens to a certain point in "Alexander", too, and makes me think the current vogue of historical cinema is more directed at redefining the position of the United States as a summit of "enlightened power" in the midst of an uncivilized world than at maintaining accuracy and resemblance to the true facts.The truth is Ridley Scott has only given us two good movies in all his career: "Alien" and "Blade runner". The rest of his work could have been directed by Spielberg, Cameron or even his own brother. Instead of wondering why his filmography is so mediocre nowadays, we should wonder how could he direct those two masterpieces. Maybe the essence of artistic excellence is heavily dependent on having the right collaborators rather than on personal genius, especially since the latter is not so frequent, after all. This would explain, for example, why Schoedsack and Cooper delivered one piece of Art in 1933 and never came even close to doing it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than a sharpshord in the neck-or whatever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Russell Crowe is a pretty fine actor. He has the gift of acting on film: if that is a gift-he has it. He has the capacity to connect with the viewer. This movie is typical Roman schlock/ history =low-brow tastelessness. How do you correctly tell a story about the Roman dirtbags? Crowe portrays the General, Gluteus Maximus, who tries to help the Roman dirtbags protect their dirtbag empire. *** Not that I have anything against Roman dirtbag empires*** At any rate, General Maximus Gluteus (Russell Crowe) gets in a big-ass world of trouble because actor Richard Harris, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, likes Russell/Gluteus the Maximus MORE than he loves Marcus Aurelius's own son: Joaquin Phoenix(Commodus Toiletus). Richard Harris had a big-ass career hit 38 years ago with "MacArthur Park"-A fine and touching pop song which featured Richard Harris singing this masculine song in a powerful way, but an ultimately painful chorus. It was true grandeur in the pop world of AM radio. It was a sexual and sensual coup d'etat for AM radio which cannot be forgotten.I move on. General Gluteus Maximus runs away from Joaquin Phoenix(son of emperor Aurelius), and meets cool people who are slaves 'n' stuff. This is the second-reel...where a hero suffers and becomes a better person and stuff. Russell Crowe-General Maximus- meets tall African beautiful people who are slaves but act noble. Then, breathlessly, the screenwriter draws us back to Rome, where the evil Roman dirtbags live. The People in the gladiator arena in Rome like the gladiator, Crowe/Maximus , because that is what People do, when they have to think about something. Russell Crowe does big things, being noble. I bet the black Africans taught him something about being noble- because they have fine black skin, or something. In truth, tall and fine Africans are fine and beautiful people. This movie exploits them because this is a stupid Hollywood movie. Maximus puts up with repeated nonsense. He finds a way to win. hooray. I think this movie won the Oscar for best gay hairstyle on a leading Australian heterosexual man: Russell Crowe. what an honor. I believe Russell Crowe deserves better than this silly-ass Roman epic. just my opinion. Russell Crowe is just better than this silly trash-but then-really-so am I. Sometimes movies are just commerce. I don't mean to shock y'all. This a beautiful movie-full of great war scenes, and honor and courage. It is also a sleazy Roman history. Roman history is a sleazy Machiavellian thing. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The performances and spectacle of this film make it worth watching, and the opening battle scene offered hope that the film would be outstanding. From several standpoints, the film was disappointing at best. Much of the gore was gratuitous, including an especially bloody scene (the first gladiator combat) in which all physical laws are transcended. The gladiator scene involving tigers was beyond belief. The story content left any viewer completely baffled. Why the writers felt it was necessary to concoct an impossible ending is difficult to understand. The real story was much more interesting, and no contrivances were necessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a place for a well made, entertaining film like this; as far as I am concerned just not, generally, on the Oscar podium, but still.Gladiator has some impressively filmed scenes; the extended battle scene at the beginning is first rate, as is the recreation of the battle of Carthage in the Colessium (Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't we win? - great line). All of the fighting scenes were imaginatively staged.The acting was decent. Russell Crowe - not one of my favorite actors - proves he can be effective when he's not given too much to say, and Juaquin Pheonix is superbly creepy throughout.But I found myself annoyed at stretches of the film, particularly at the end, where Crowe envisions meeting his wife and child on a tree line alley through a field of wheat, or something. It's what I expect from a Mitch Albom book, not a serious movie. Not that it detracts too much from the film, really. The story of Crowe's family is the peg to hang the action on; it adds neither intellectual or emotional depth to what is in reality a well-made, well-shot, entertaining popcorn muncher.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie can best described as Blood and Guts" with super duper computer generated graphics. Displaying ancient Rome as a Beautful cesspool with mobs to be appeased but not a hint of nudity or sex to speak of, is unfair to us, the Romans and filmmakers. ALso this flick makes absolutely no effort to reflect any of the actual history of the period and does not come close to showing the Insanity of Commodus.As a fantasy flick its pretty good and I recommend "Fall of the Roman Empire, The (1964)" which covers the same ground withs it own version of history but with Sophia Loren as Livius and slightly more skin/Just watched this movie, again, in 2009 and 2006 comments still correct.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator, by far, is the most exceptional movie to date that I've seen, and probably Russell Crowe's best performance.The movie, taking place in Rome shortly after the reign of Scipio, and the barbarian Hannibal, instantly captivates you in the intro with an exploding scene that will leave you speechless.Immediately you think that the movie will be just a bloodbath and without a true meaning, but Ripley Scott delivers a much more powerful message! Maximus Decimus Meridius, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, overpowers the emperor of Rome, and sets an inspiring finale. Words cannot describe the impact you'll receive from watching this movie to it's entirety! With an amazing ending, a detailed, yet interesting storyline, Gladiator keeps you moving and excited all the way through, and ultimately can end with viewers in tears. A beautiful ending! My favorite movie by far!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is a obviously about a Gladiator named Maximus the Mighty.He became one after he escaped his execution.Being a Gladitator is a very dangerous job.It's a game of survival and death. If you survive then you receive more credit as a Gladitator, if you die then you get a reservation at the morgue.Maximus hopes to one day be free from being a Gladitator.This movie is OK. Not saying it's bad, just expected better.It's downright violent and graphic. So those who can with stand strong violence can be able to see this. I wouldn't recommend it to younger viewers or people who fear the sight of blood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to hand it to Gladiator: few films make disemboweling look this sexy. Veteran director Ridley Scott takes no prisoners in his epic vision of Imperial Rome, throwing us face first on the Coliseum floor and pounding us until we beg for mercy. So skillfully delivered is this sturm und drang -- and so perfect a lead is actor Russell Crowe -- that the film's shortcomings are all but buried beneath the sheer awesome spectacle.Crowe plays General Maximus, chief legionnaire for the aging Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). A fierce fighter and canny tactician, Maximus wants nothing more than to mop up a few Huns and go back to Spain where his family awaits. But politics intervene and he soon finds himself in the middle of a power play between the emperor and his weasel son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Marcus wants Maximus to rule as a regent until the Senate can take control, making Rome a true republic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh man, Gladiator is the best movie I have ever seen that takes place in the era of the Roman Empire. It's not just because I am a guy and there is lots of fighting and killing and manly stuff. The tension and dynamics between Maximus (Russell Crowe) and Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is so think you can taste it. Phoenix is such an awesome evil character in this movie and Crowe epitomizes the ideals of a military republican, dedicated to his country and leaders, fighting for what is right.The only thing that I could complain about is I'm not sure how gore-laden nor vulgar the non-TV version is, but I'd definitely watch the edited version because who needs all that extra junk that makes the DVD R-rated in the first place?!I could write for days about how many great things are included in this movie, but I'll just keep it short and say that it ROCKS!</fullReview>

When Maximus escapes the execution he flees home to Spain but is too late his wife and his son have been killed and his house and property burnt to the ground by Roman generals ordered by the new emperor (commodus).Maximus is captured and sold as a slave in Carthage to a wealthy man Proximo and is ordered to fight as a gladiator.As his love by the crowd rises he's brought to Rome to fight at the Colleseum.For the entertainment of the new emperor.Maximus comes to Rome and begins to seek revenge for his family's murders.This is an excellent movie with a great soundtrack,excellent acting,magnificent direction by Ridley Scott and amazing special effects.This one of my favourite movies of all time and if Peter Jacksons movies and George Lucas' had not come along i would be saying that this is probably the best of the 21st century so far.Go watch this masterpiece of a movie one of the best of its kind.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the actors, to the settings, to the cinematography, to the score, every step of the way through this amazing epic is a monument to what films should be. Hans Zimmer's emotionally driven score helps drive the story of Maximus (Crowe) through his glory as a General to his decent to a slave to his rise as a much loved Gladiator. The emperor is dying, and instead of giving the glory of Rome to his son (Joaquin Phoenix) he feels that Rome's light would be better carried by Maximus. But when the emperor tells his son, he kills his father, assumes the throne (since no one else had been told of the emperor's plan) and has Maximus' family slaughtered and his home burned, and even attempts to have Maximes killed off. Maximus escapes to his home and finds no reason to live, but is taken in as a slave and sold to be a Gladiator. With nothing to lose, and the vindication of his dead wife and son, Maximus defy's the Emporer and becomes more loved again, which only angers the new Ceaser even more, making him even more jealous.It's epic by all means, and is one of the greatest films in the history of films. Russel Crowe's performance is emotionally breathtaking from the delivery of his lines, to his ability to let emotion pour into his character like so few actors ever have. Gladiator is hardly unmatched in history, and will be hard to even come close to equaling in the future.</fullReview>

Russell Crowe gives a performance which i never thought he would outclass his work in A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man and THe INsider. However Crowe is magnificent in this film. He is a legendary actor for his work in these 4 films alone, thats not counting other significant performances in Proof of Life and LA Confidential. Joaquin Phoenix was also great as the villain, Commodus. Connie NIelsen and Djimon Hounsaou were also great in their roles. This film is a great fictional epic, great direction and atmosphere, brilliant cast and a good screenplay from Franzoni (King Arthur, Amistad), John Logan (Aviator, Last samurai), and William Nicholson (Nell).

This movie is so powerful, you will be hard pressed not to feel as though you are living as a Roman nearly 1900 years ago. The depictions of the empire are glorious and breathtaking. The music counteracts with the storyline superbly. As emotions stir amongst characters, so too does the harmonious script. I feel that if one compares his or her own lives and dreams to the heart of Maximus and the soul of Rome, the real connection can be made. The character Maximus, played by Russell Crowe is inspiring and motivating. Gladiator teaches us all that we must conquer our dreams, but they must first be realized, and in us all is the endangerment of becoming better people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: if you liked 'The Lord Of The Rings: Fellowship Of The Ring', perhaps you shouldn't read on - you wouldn't understand a word of what I'm talking about.Unlike most of the other films of its genre, Gladiator has a well balanced, credible storyline. That means it allows enough time for the characters to develop, so that the viewer can get attached to them and not stay indifferent, thus, making a three hours long film, interesting rather than boring (like LOTR). At the same time, the plot moves quickly enough to stay interesting, original and surprising.The special effects, as are the battle scenes, are SUPERB! By far, the best I have seen, and what makes Gladiator such a great film, is that it doesn't rely on them to make it so good (again, unlike many other films of the genre, or most action films for that matter).You got it right for a change guys - well done!!!

		<fullReview>Gladiator is one of the best films of this decade. Crowe is on top form as the lead, Oliver Reed putting in a handy turn as his mentor. The battle scenes are epic, especially those between Barbarian Germans and Roman troops at the start. The warrior fights are also very well done, plenty of blood being spilt. The storyline is interesting and not too cheesy, unlike so many other Hollywood movies today. The only blot on this film's copybook is Richard Harris who's monologues are just a tad dull. Phoenix is not bad as the villain however. The musical score works nicely too. Gladiator is well worth seeing and for a 15 rating contains plenty of action.</fullReview>

Crowe finally solidified his place in the acting community with this flawless performance and hasn't let up since. I will never forget the look on his face when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor he looked like he had been told he just won the lottery as I am quite sure he was thinking he was gonna get rear ended yet again. From start to finish you are awestruck with how great this masterpiece is. Ancient Rome never looked so good and the beauty and intense savagery is captured like water in a bottle. It also puts every movie that came out that year to absolute shame without doubt or question. It stands toe to toe with the best epic movies of all time, including Braveheart, Spartacus, and of course Ben-Hur which was by mine and many other accounts the best epic movie ever made. They put together the best cast Hollywood could assemble and knocked out audiences all over the world. Phoenix puts on a great show and certainly deserved the acclaim given him for it I was disappointed he didn't win an Oscar but very glad he was nominated. Gladiator was the Academy's Best Picture and is the best movie of 2000.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parallels with the Degeneration of our American Empire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is rife with parallels to our own degenerating society. Will Durant in his "Age of Faith" points out that the republic of Rome segued into an Empire as the leaders became power mad, epitomized by Comitus, who killed his father, Marcus Aurelius (representing the fairer Caesars). These characters were composites of the Caesars who presided over the death of the Roman Empire, so like my country today. 'Comitus' refers to the elite, but weak aristocracy of patrician counts (comites). Notice: NASCAR? The chariot races with the blood lust quotient upped by having them run down the gladiators.Bush? Comitus, the degenerate overseer of the decline of the Roman Empire, who cleverly had the love of the masses by offering them the circuses of the gladiators being torn limb to limb by animals or killed by other gladiators (Boxing, anyone?)Dr. Dean? Maximum, the brave gladiator who alone stands against the wicked Comitus, who loves his country and dies for it in his fight with the cowardly Comitus. But gradually, his fellow gladiators follow his leadership as they recognize his bravery in speaking truth to power. As Bush stole the presidency twice, Comitus had to STAB Maximus before 'fighting' him in what appeared to be a fair match in the Coliseum (ref. also, Bush's receiver that tried to make the playing field even in the debates, and still failed). He, like Bush, could not win in a fair fight.Impotent Congress? "The Senate, at Rome could deliberate, legislate, adjudicate, but always subject to the imperial veto; their legislative functions were largely appropriated by the ruler's advisory council, the sacrum consistorium principes. America, the Empire? In the view of the emperors, democracy had failed; it had carried liberty into license, and license into chaos. The system kept the Byzantine Empire in existence for a millennium, but at the cost of political stagnation, public atrophy, court conspiracies, wars of succession and a score of palace revolutions that gave the throne occasionally to competence, seldom to integrity, too often to an unscrupulous adventurer, an oligarchic cabal, or an IMPERIAL FOOL." DurantHeaven? Elysian Fields, the after-life that encouraged people to risk their lives for glory on the battle field (Iraq), and in the Coliseum (NASCAR circuit, boxing ring)As blood lust feeds upon itself, so also the American masses with this movie.....up close and personal, degenerating into a tolerance of torture. But we MUST be protected from a woman's nipple!!!</fullReview>

Dismemberment and decapitations will also win points. The movie has a great screenplay, good acting, good environments and the first battle scene was great! The chariot scene is pretty cool.It also has the ending that I felt was right. I was actually hoping it was going to happen, and when you think of it, does that make sense? It does for this movie. One of my all time favorite movies, I could watch this movie any night. I might watch it later this week now that I'm thinking of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'A masterpiece of its kind '</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been really interested in Roman Empire movies. Now I finally got around to completing my Russell Crowe DVD collection. So I also ordered the widescreen signature edition of the 'Gladiator', two disks (second disk with bonus material) from Amazon.com. I received the DVD last Tuesday. On Wednesday I watched it for the first time. On Thursday I watched the bonus material and part of the movie again. Now it's been a week and I have already watched it 3 times and I am already thinking about watching it again tonight. It's a masterpiece of its kind with one of the most magnificent photography and brilliant special effects I have ever seen. Russell Crowe as Maximus is absolutely perfect. He is the true hero such a movie needs. Though the rest of the cast is also well chosen and gives a great performance, Russell Crowe is the character this movie needed to become outstanding. With each viewing you will discover another interesting detail, another facial expression that wows. I also recommend watching the bonus material disk after the first viewing. It will give you an astonishing behind the scene look at how the movie was made and how real some scenes actually are. The documentary on Gladiator games provides an interesting insight into the whole subject. And don't miss the deleted scenes. They shouldn't have been cut out. The sound track especially the main theme is also overwhelming. One of my favorite scenes is where Russell Crowe rides the pirouette on the grey horse at the end of a fight. The music perfectly matches the scene. The Gladiator is fun watching even though it is a tough movie. My score is 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People need to know that while this movie is entertaining (and it is) that the portrayal of Rome is not particularly accurate. While Romans did enjoy gladiatorial combat the examples used in this movie are far from normal competitions held in such times. Further more the Roman mob rising up and supporting a non Roman soldier for emperor is an American ideal not a Roman reality.Hope this sparks some curiosity about what Rome was really like, I urge any interested to do a little research, you will be well rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Historical Epic of this Generation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, a lot can be said for older historical epics like Spartacus, 300 Spartans, Ben-Hur, etc., but the fact of the matter remains that these are simply not entertaining for the majority of people under the age of 30, intellectual or not. The production is simply not good by today's standards. That said, I would like to justify my comment that Gladiator is the best historical epic from the 70s to present. The movie has impeccable acting from Russell Crowe, for which he won the Oscar as a lead. In many people's opinions, Joaquin Phoenix deserved the Best Supporting Actor nod for his wonderful performance as Commodus - to this day, whenever I see a picture of him, I see the evil character he portrayed in this great movie. The rest of the supporting actors were just as good, particularly Djimon Hounsou as Juba, Oliver Reed as Proximo, and Spencer Treat Clark as young Lucius. Whether you love or hate Ridley Scott, it is hard to deny that he directed this movie to near perfection. Of course, there were a few mistakes, such as the now-infamous crew member in blue jeans behind the horse after the opening battle, when Maximus and Lucilla are speaking. That said, this movie flows beautifully. I have watched it upwards of 20 times, and it still makes me cry each time, one of only 3 movies to ever do so. The script is above average for a historical epic, and this imperfection can easily be forgiven by the sheer beauty of the movie. The plot, however, is topped by none - the quest for vengeance for the slaughter of one's family. Although it may seem clich, Gladiator reinvents the plot and the result is a movie superior to any with a similar plot before it. The action sequences were both engaging and thought-provoking as to the culture of the time and place. Russell did very well in these sequences. Not to mention the score by Zimmer matched the mood and intensity of every scene perfectly. To conclude, I for one have not seen a better historical epic, and every historical epic that I will ever see will be subconsciously compared to this masterpiece. Troy paled in comparison for many reasons. I expect great things of Alexander, but somehow I just don't think a movie will come along that replaces Scott's "Gladiator" as my favourite historical epic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Battlefield Earth still gets my vote for the worst movie ever (beating out Waterworld hands down). But this has to rate close to it. People, this movie is bad. It has no sensible dialogue, Joaquin Phoenix is miscast (he would've been strangled the next week by the praetorian guard), and Crow is slipping in his choice of trash. We're not even going to ask for historical accuracy (by the way, there isn't any) since that would be either too much or too confusing.No character in this movie had any depth. I am still curious how the whole legion did not notice the absence of their "beloved" general. I am lost at how a man who went to France ended up in a desert on a cart. I am amazed that at first this man doesn't care about anything, then he wants revenge, then he doesn't, then he yells at that queen, then.. you get the point. And after that, a slave owner who sent people to their deaths dies with "honor" on his lips. Then, a woman who stood by and did nothing while her brother was slaughtering people is preaching to the good citizens of Rome the merits of honor and justice (she preached to the crowds that came to see people be decapitated). The contrasts of good and evil were so well defined, that no three year old will be confused.This movie must rate high with audiences, but so does Scooby Doo. If you like the mental twists of Scooby Doo, you'll like this movie as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Revival of the Epic Tradition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the strange aspects of cinematic history is how an entire genre of films can suddenly lose favour and disappear. In the fifties and early sixties big historical epics, with story lines normally drawn either from the Bible or from classical antiquity, were one of the most popular types of film, and their popularity seemed assured after the huge successes of 'Ben-Hur' in 1959 and 'Spartacus' the following year. A few years later, however, they all but disappeared from the screen after the financial failures of 'Cleopatra' and 'The Fall of the Roman Empire'. The genre seemed to be dead and gone; when the film-makers of the late sixties, seventies and eighties made films on a large scale, they generally turned to other subject-matter (often organised crime or science fiction).What is gone, however, is not always gone for ever. The nineties saw, at least on a limited scale, revivals of a number of genres which had seemed to be in decline- the Western ('Dances with Wolves'), the mediaeval history lesson ('Braveheart'), the big-scale disaster movie ('Titanic'), the war film ('Saving Private Ryan') until, finally, it was the turn of the classical epic. Ridley Scott chose to revive the genre by starting where 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' had left off thirty-six years earlier, with the story of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus.The two films have a similar plot. Both start with Marcus Aurelius leading the Roman legions to victory over the German tribes on the Empire's northern frontier. In each case he is assisted by an able second-in-command (called Livius in the earlier film, Maximus in the later). In each case the Emperor has doubts about the fitness of his son, Commodus, to succeed him, but is murdered before he can put into practice a scheme to prevent his son's accession. Commodus proves to be a tyrannical ruler, and the second half of each film deals with the struggle between the evil Emperor and his late father's friend, who represents the forces of good. In 'Gladiator', Maximus also has a personal motive to seek revenge, because Commodus was responsible for the murders of his wife and young son. He himself survives an attempt by Commodus to have him killed, but he is sold into slavery and forced to become a gladiator. (There are parallels here with another Roman epic, 'Spartacus'). Maximus's skill with weapons ensures that he quickly rises to the top of his new profession, and when his troupe is taken to Rome to fight in the Coliseum he sees an opportunity for revenge. The older classical epics were noted for spectacle, and 'Gladiator' is a worthy successor in this regard. The opening battle between the Romans and the Germans and the scenes of combat in the arena are both vivid and exciting. It does not, however, rely on spectacle alone. Like the more distinguished of the earlier epics (especially 'Spartacus') it contains some very good acting performances. Russell Crowe, as Maximus, shows that he has, like Kirk Douglas or Charlton Heston, the commanding presence to take centre stage in a film of this nature. He brought out both Maximus's physical courage and his nobility, and his 'best actor' award was well-deserved. Oliver Reed, in his final film, was also good as the gladiator trainer Proximo, as was Richard Harris as the ageing Emperor Aurelius (although I preferred Alec Guinness's interpretation of the same role in 'Fall of the Roman Empire'). Joaquin Phoenix brought an original touch to the role of Commodus, portrayed as a basically weak and petulant young man rather than a ranting tyrant. His cruelty arises from his sense of weakness and insecurity. Both 'Gladiator' and 'Fall of the Roman Empire' are, to some extent, historically inaccurate. All the evidence, for example, suggests that Marcus Aurelius died of natural causes, and he does not seem to have entertained any doubts about his son's fitness to rule. (It is not, however, a goof, as some have claimed, to show Commodus fighting in the arena; there is historical evidence that he did so on many occasions). The politics of 'Gladiator', with its preference for republicanism over monarchism, seem to reflect modern American values rather than Roman ones. The distinction between a republic and a monarchy was not as clear-cut then as it is now. The Romans, even when they were ruled by an Emperor, continued to refer to their state as 'res publica', and the Emperor never claimed to be a king. (The title 'Rex' was never used during this period; the Latin title 'Imperator' literally means 'Commander'). Succession from father to son was not automatic; the accession of Commodus was the first time in over a hundred years that an Emperor had been succeeded by his natural, as opposed to adopted, son. If Aurelius had really wanted to disinherit Commodus, he could have done so by adopting some distinguished Senator or military leader as his successor. (Aurelius himself was no blood-relation to his predecessor Antoninus Pius). It seems unlikely that he would have wanted to abolish the office of Emperor and replace it with direct rule by the Senate (which was an oligarchy, not a democratically elected Parliament).I was not, however, too worried by this; 'Gladiator' is by no means the only historic drama to look at the past through the eyes of the present. (Indeed, it is probably impossible when making such a film to avoid this trap altogether). 'Spartacus', for example, projected modern ideas about political freedom back to ancient Rome, and 'The Egyptian' had the people of ancient Egypt practising a quasi-Christian religion more than a millennium before the birth of Christ. The epic tradition had been allowed to languish for too long. Ridley Scott showed, in this intelligent and visually striking film, that it was possible to revive it with success, a revival that has continued with 'Troy' this year and 'Alexander the Great' to come next year. I should also mention Hans Zimmer's excellent musical score, which seems well on the way to becoming a modern classic. 8/10</fullReview>

Everything about this movies is perfect... especially the music by my all time favorite music producer Hans Zimmer. I have a lot of respect for Hans, all his work is SO original and every piece he does for movies fit so well.I was surprised when I saw the credits a the end and it said this was directed by Ridley Scott. He really is an awesome Director. If he can produce a movies like Alien, which was also very very good. And then produce something totally different which is just as amazing... I think that makes him a Director that should always be remembered.IF you've seen bits of this film but your put off because your not really into the Roman style... WATCH IT! You will surprise yourself and have a totally different view on this type of movie.This film has become one of my top 3 films of all time... the others being LEON, The Shawshank Redemption and now Gladiator. Blade Runner is also a massive favorite of mine.If you haven't seen Gladiator... please... watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History updated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to the brilliant but eccentric historian Gibbon, the succession of the philosopher-king Marcus Aurelius by his mad son Commodus marked the start of the decline of the Roman Empire. It was this event which provided the setting for Anthony Mann's 1960s film, 'The Fall of the Roman Empire', and 'Gladiator' is a modern reworking of the same story, with a hefty nod to Kubrick's 'Spartacus' as well. At first, what catches the attention is what's new in the film: the odd, Enya-esque soundtrack and the impressive, almost convincing but over-used computer generated animation (I mean, how many digitally-enhanced thunderstorms does one film need?). But behind the slickness, what's more noticeable is how firmly this film sits in the tradition of earlier Roman epics. I rather like this genre, as the inherent political and personal drama in these almost true stories is immense; though in 'Gladiator', some of the potential is lost through sentimentality and a tendency to reduce events to an elemental struggle of good and evil. Russell Crowe in particular, all honour and valour, is dull in the central role. But as is usual in films such as this, a clutch of talented British thespians lend some class to the project: in this case, Richard Griffiths, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel and of course Oliver Reed, his magnificent eyes still wild with life (though he died before filming was complete). Overall, 'Gladiator' is a welcome addition to a canon that has lain untouched since 'Cleopatra'. What I'd really like to see, though, is a film of the life of Dicoletian, one of Gibbon's few heroes in the long tale of the dark years.</fullReview>

This scene should have been the highlight of the film, but it is hard to tell what is going on.The rest of the film really loses direction, like it can't decide whether to be political or revenge-based. Why does everyone want Commodus dead? In what way is he running a 'dictatorship'? This may have been explained but the movie is far too short. Apart from Commodus, all of the characters are 1-dimensional and tiresome. There are a few good fight scenes but they don't really fit into the story. I give this a 6/10 because there are some interesting elements (all involving Commodus, the only believable character).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gladiator" has some of the best elements I have ever seen in a film. This is an invigorating, passionate, potent, and beautiful production, in almost listless ways. The direction is near impeccable, chronicling a simple tale of injustice and revenge in such a powerful, under- standing, and reverent manner to both the trials and conflicts of Maximus and the oppressive, grandiose atmosphere of Ancient Rome. Russell Crowe's performance as Maximus is beyond brilliant, perfecting nearly every confliction, strength, and intensity his character possesses and experiences; his attitude is fierce, his movements suggest he is disturbed, and his actions prove he is ready to "have his vengeance", and Crowe provides everything he can to make Maximus one of the most compelling characters to ever grace the screen. Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus, Maximus's enemy and the man who has robbed him of virtually everything he once possessed, is vicious, brooding, and bitter, as he nearly perfects this antipathetic role, where we love to hate this villain, and root for Maximus to achieve his demise. Everything else, from the riveting, stirring, and flat-out indelible music, some of the most portentous and potent in film, to the dialogue between the characters, containing some of the most memorable lines (e.g. "What we do in life echoes in eternity"), to the fast-paced, involving cinematography, to the incredible realistic look of the visual effects (One would never believe the audience in the Colosseum wasn't entirely there, or for that matter, the Colosseum!), and on and on and on. This is the quintessential revenge and Roman Empire story, executed in a near impeccable and rousing manner. A true sensation of film-making genius. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always liked Ridley Scott. I like Alien and Blade Runner, and all of his other films (except for perhaps Black Hawk Down). And I'd have to say this is one of his better films. Simply because every aspect of the film comes together and creates a beautiful, interesting and thoughtful story of a roman general. Plus we get some awesome battle scenes.Maximus is a General in the Roman Army, in the year 180 A.D. He is leading the Roman armies to fight against the barbarian tribes of Germania. After all of Germania is conquered, Maximus looks forward to finally being able to go back home and seeing his wife and son again. But the Emperor has other duties for him. But before Maximus is able to perform those duties, the Emperor is killed and Maximus sentenced to death, by the Emperors own son: Commodus.Maximus manages to escape the clutches of Commodus but finds that Commodus also ordered the death of his family. Maximus is however captured and sold off as a gladiator, and finds himself in a situation where he must fight to survive. But his real goal is to get revenge on the man who killed his family: Commodus.The film is visually stunning. The battle scenes are awesome. The acting is superb. The script is excellent. Everything about this film is top-notch, but what can you expect from Ridley Scott? He directs the film like he knows exactly what he wants and the end result is something you'll want to watch over and over again. Russel Crowe is absolutely fabulous in the role as Maximus. He outdoes himself completely. You really care for his character, and in the end I always find that a tear rolls down my eye whenever the end credits roll across the scene. Oliver Reed (R.I.P) also gives us a great performance as the aged gladiator; Proximo. To bad he died before principal photography had ended, and had to be replaced by a CG Puppet in some scenes (altough I never noticed this while watching the film). Juaqin Phoenix also gives a stellar performance as the insidious and evil Emperor Commodus.The battle scenes are all great. My favorite is the battle between the Roman army and the Germanian tribes, which gives us some good IL' dirty warfare shots of people getting mutilated: The dark ages way. Other great scenes are when the gladiators are forced to play the part of the Barbarian horde in the re-enactment of the battle of Carthage. Hans Zimmers music in these scenes may very well be some of the best aggressive movie scores I've ever heard.All of this, combined with Ridley Scotts excellent visual style and superb directing, makes for a flawless film that should never be forgotten.10/10</fullReview>

Russell Crowe deserves to be a superstar based on this performance alone. He controls the screen with such ease he was destined for good things from this moment onwards. This film also kick-started Ridley Scott's second career high which is a good thing for the movie world as he can be one of the best directors when he wants to be. The score by Hans Zimmer is as amazing as usual, I can't recall the man creating a bad soundtrack for a movie.Now for the downside. The film is only really good when Crowe is on screen. Joaquin Phoenix put in an amazing performance as the new Emperor but that didn't help the scenes in Rome from being very boring. I also can't help but cringe at the ending, only because watching the slaves walk out into the coliseum and stand around while Connie Neilsen badly acts being sad was a terrible way to end such a good film.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...about the historical accuracy of the film. So, I did a few minutes of online research, and what I found was mildly distubing: the story borrows from history the names, dates and significant events (the conquering of Germania), but the plot is essentially fact-free, at least as far as what we know of Roman history can tell us.I find this somewhat irksome because it's using just enough history to sound as though it's telling a fact-based story, when in fact it's fiction. Admittedly, there are others who take far more egregious liberties with the truth (Oliver Stone comes to mind) but the taking of names from history seemed pointless and a little misleading.This is admittedly a nit against a tremendous film that deserved all the critical acclaim it received, but I do wish directors would be a little more discerning when it comes to blending fact and fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do You Like Movies About Gladiators?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time, Hollywood made lots of movies like this, with "Quo Vadis?" "Ben Hur", and "Sparticus" springing most quickly to mind. Then the space age arrived, and sword &amp; sandal epics became as pass as the western.Fortunately, Ridley Scott and a talented team of writers figured out a new way to breathe life in the old formula, with the help of CGI and a talented leading man. Frankly, the story of Maximus, a toppled Roman general who reclaims his political clout in the ring of gladiatorial combat, is a little thin when you think about it. But it's delivered with a lot of panache and visual flair.Russell Crowe isn't too multi-dimensional, but he's more than adequate in the role of Maximus, tender at times but more a gloomy muscleman. He's interesting, even brilliant in flashes, like when he finds the dead bodies of his wife and son, but he doesn't engage you enough to fret overmuch over his fate. Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best performance as the mad Roman emperor Commodus, "vexed" as he is by Maximus's reappearance but trying in his own sad way to be noble and loving. At times Phoenix seems to be channeling Malcolm McDowell, though not the time McDowell actually played an emperor in the nasty "Caligula."Speaking of British film stars of the 1960s/1970s, there are three of them in this film, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, and David Hemmings, all of whom are now dead just four years after the picture's release. This amounts to something of a swan song for all of them, a fitting one as it turns out. Reed especially has his moments. Connie Nielsen presents us with both regal sexiness and hurt-stained eyes as Commodus's sister Lucilla, Maximus's former lover who clearly carries a torch still.We wait for Maximus and Lucilla to take up again where they left off, now that Maximus is single again, but the film reminds us time and again that Maximus's loyalty to his family extends beyond death, that he believes he will see them again in the afterlife. This spiritual dimension, unexpected from a film set in pagan times, lifts the film in my mind to the point where it really clicked with a lot of audiences. It also sets up Crowe's best bits of dialogue in the second half of the movie.Of course, there are some amazing fight scenes as well, in the Colisseum and other gladiator venues as well as Germania, where we are introduced to Maximus putting down a barbarian rebellion. The combat scenes are where the CGI work and other special effects especially shine, with a fight between Maximus and his cohorts against a squad of charioteers making for one heady adrenaline rush.But Maximus's followers are never adequately developed as people worth caring about. Also half-baked is some intrigue involving Lucilla and some Roman senators, including Derek Jacobi, who needs to be wearing a toga like Clint Eastwood does a cowboy hat. The crowd reactions to Maximus, especially when they suddenly recognize him en masse as the lost general who had never visited Rome and chant his name to spare him from Commodus's fury, cries out as obvious plot convenience. These aren't major flaws, but they do stick out on repeat viewings. 'Gladiator,' like many spectacles ancient and modern, never quite satisfies as well as it does the first time you see it.All in all, I have a hard time accepting this as the 2000 Best Picture Oscar winner, especially over "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," which is a more amazing feast for the senses and a better story besides. But 'Gladiator' is a good film, something more than your average blockbuster, and worthy watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie with incredible fights!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is the most phenomanel film of 2000. Probably one of the best films of that year. Russell Crowe played his part excelletly. One of his best films!!! The fight with him Joaquin Phoenix was excellent. Joaquin was the biggest weiner I have ever seen actually. Him stabbing Russell was cbeing a true coward and then fighting him and losing was even the funny part about it. I felt like I just wanted to fight with Russell and kick some gladiator asses! This is definitley a recommended motion picture. I remember seeing this movie in theatres and having a ball. This is a very fun and entertaining film!!9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator, a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PLOT SPOILER!!!!! The Roman Army is commanded by Maximus. The Emperor Marcus Aurelius is dying and, knowing that his son Commodus is not a suitable heir, asks Maximus to take command and restore the republic. But when Commodus finds out, he kills his father and orders the execution of Maximus who defeats his would-be assassins and rides to Spain. But he arrives too late to save his wife and son, who have been brutally murdered. Delirious from a terrible wound, he is sold to Proximo and goes to a school for gladiators. Maximus fights with success that he is acclaimed by the crowd. In a fight, he is saved from Commodus who is horrified for discovering that he is still alive. The opposition to Commodus focused on the Emperor's sister Lucilla and tries to persuade Maximus to defeat her brother's Empire. In an effort to win back the support of the people, Commodus decides to face Maximus in the arena, but takes the precaution of wounding him before the fight begins. After a tense battle, Maximus succeeds in killing the Emperor, despite his wound, His gladiator friends are freed and he joins his beloved wife and child in the afterlife, leaving a weeping Lucilla behind.COMMENTSIn terms to characters, the main, Maximus, had the ferocity of a warrior, but with dignity and character. He combined the great feeling of heroism and bravery with goodness. Commodus, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius's son was a person with an insatiate thirst of human blood and capable of the most inhuman actions. His dislike about himself was reflected in his difficult personality. He was envious of Maximus because people loved him and above all because the Emperor loved Maximus mere than him. Although his wickedness, he suffered for this condition and, it causes into the public a sense of pity. The Emperor was an honest man and he fought for his people. He was never proud of his son and he paid for it with his live. The Commodus' sister, Licilla, was a beautiful woman who loved Maximus. Until her brother's dead, she had always lived beyond fear and contempt for him.The gladiatorial combats are an important part of the film. Gladiators were drawn from various sources, but many of them were men who had no alternative: slave and criminals. As we see in the film, the combats were never equal: either the weapons were different or the odds heavily weighted in favour of one side or the other. The problem of keeping the crowd entertained reminded and, as time went by, increasingly extravagant events were devised.As well, we have to pay attention to the dialogues. They speak about honesty, loyalty, courage, live, friendship, memories, etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film really does have it all.It's got the best British director at the wheel, it's got the pure charisma of Russell Crowe, it's got sword fighting with Romans, it's got an amzing musical score, it's got great special effects, its got the best cinematography you've seen in years, it's got evocative historical accuracy, it's got a man fighting a tiger, it's got Ollie Reed (clearly p***ed on a few occasions)............the bloody lot then.THe mastery of this film is the way in which the heart-wrenching story of Maximus is interwoven into a historical epic. THe story would have been a success even if Gladiator was lacking in the human element, but the fact is that the unholy tragedy that befalls Crowe and his subsequent quest for revenge drive the rest of the film, and make all of the various actions scenes those of 'higher stakes' than normally expected (ie. the only risk is your own skin, here it is a whole set of moral beliefs and a legacy of love).Such a perfect fusion of drama, acting, action and musical score, this film is Hollywood at it's very best, with a British twist - humilty. See it as soon as you possibly can.9/10 A future classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is a decent film. It lacks great emotional value, but it makes up for that with excellent pacing and an interesting visual style. Russell Crowe plays Maximus, a general who was friend to the aging emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) and betrayed by Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). His family is murdered and he winds up being sold into slavery to fight as a gladiator. At first, he accepts his new life with sorrow and apathy. Too much sorrow and apathy, especially since we know it won't last. Russell Crowe pouts throughout the whole movie and makes Maximus a distant a cold person. It's hard to imagine him being liked so well by his men. We see nothing human about him, he takes pain as if it were nothing and he has no remorse about killing in the arenas. That said Russell Crowe does deliver some excellent lines throughout the film. At one point when one of his subordinates says of the Germans in the beginning of the film that people should know when they are conquered, Russell delivers the line, `Would you know, Quintus? Would I?' The timing is perfect and there's just enough emotion to make it believable, and to help foreshadow Commodus' new vision of Rome. Joaquin Phoenix plays Commodus and from the first time we are introduced to him, we are aware that he is a troubled man. The movie portrays Commodus, the son of Marcus Aurelius, as feeling he had an unloving childhood. One needs only to look as far as Michael Jackson to see what happens to someone when they feel unloved in their childhood. Joaquin takes his portrayal to the extreme as his character is in love with his sister and makes little secret of it. Even I felt uncomfortable watching him on screen, which is a statement to how powerful Joaquin is as an actor. Unfortunately, it doesn't fit with the rest of the movie, and while the pacing is good for the most part, it is the scenes with Commodus that seem to stick out. As the plot unfolds, we learn that Maximus was Marcus Aurelius's chosen successor to restore Rome to a republic. Commodus is of course insanely jealous of Maximus and kills his father to ascend to the throne. He then has Maximus executed, which of course doesn't happen, and his family killed. I must admit that I don't feel it is necessary to show a child being run over by a horse to get an emotional rise out of the audience. Most of the action in Gladiator happens in the arenas both in Rome and in Africa. They are well put together, although as is expected historical accuracy gets thrown out the window in favor of cool fights and emotional drama. The lighting and colors of the movie are odd, mostly dark with a yellowish tone to them, even in Rome. I'm not sure why this was done, and while it's interesting, it doesn't appear to serve anything more than to add to Russell's constant scowl. Oliver Reed and Richard Harris are both excellent in their roles, as is Connie Nielson who shines as Commodus' sister. All of this leads up to the big fight and it probably isn't much of a spoiler if I tell you who wins, it isn't as exciting a finish as one would want to an action/drama. The good thing is that the drama part kicks in and it does a fabulous job of closing the movie. A good film but not quite a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a truly great epic film in the vein of Spartacus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Russell Crowe plays a general in the Roman army who through a series of treacherous actions finds himself a gladiator. In the same genre as Spartacus, this movie is far more spectacular...and I loved Spartacus. Despondent at the loss of his wife and child, Maximus (Crowe) has refused to fight as a gladiator and wants nothing more than to be reunited with his family. Of course, he does fight, and looks forward to revenge for his misfortune.Crowe plays the part of a loyal Roman general (of Spanish descent) very well. The king looks at Maximus as a son...and there is where the problems begin. Joaquin Phoenix plays Commodus, the king's real son, who is nothing short of a spoiled brat. The fight scenes in the movie are spectacular, but the plot will satisfy even the ladies who go more for the romantic films.</fullReview>

Gladiator then makes an expression as if he knows who Verus is and looks around to see if someone is watching him. Is Gladitor the boys father or is it someone else? Could Lucius father be Lucilla's brother, or one of the Senators? Was Gladiator fooling around with Lucilla while he was away from his wife and broke it off with her before Lucilla had a chance to tell him she was with child? Their son's are the same age, but still it is not clear who Lucius father is. Perhaps Verus means 'bastard' in Latin. Anyway, if someone knows please give me some insight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is one of the best films of the year. I hesitated to see this film for a long time for many reasons; however, when I saw it the other night I was thrilled. Also, "Gladiator" is laced with great scenery including the Roman coliseum and enriched with the history of Roman culture. Watching this movie was an experience I will never forget because it is like watching history come alive. The film is rich in history, the writers made it fun to watch because we learned about the Roman coliseum, gladiators and life in Rome."Gladiator" is an energetic, action packed, drama filled thrill ride which will excite everyone. Two other movies came to mind when I was watching this film; "The Patriot" and "Braveheart" were very similar to "Gladiator" because they all contain unique action sequences, will become classics and all star actors in Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe, who have become major players in Hollywood. "Gladiator" may not be the best movie, but it will win over the hearts of viewers when they rent it at their local video stores. I can't wait to let everyone know "Gladiator" has become one of my favorite films. I hope everyone will enjoy it as I did. "Gladiator" is rich in history and is a masterpiece with all the trimmings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Commodus has issues."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My teenage son wanted to see this film so we bought the DVD version which offers extra features including commentary by director Ridley Scott. I hadn't been interested in catching this Roman a clef flick in the theaters and two and a half hours of watching it last night underscored my original reluctance.It isn't a bad movie but virtuous hero against mad Roman emperor has been done before in literature (from Shakespeare to Graves) and often on film. Russell Crowe's effort as Maximus (Max the General) is good but hardly empire-shaking. Richard Harris as the aging emperor is a nice almost swan song for a fine actor who, for a change, doesn't shout.My son thought that Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix, lacked a number of important qualities. When he comes on big time to his sister, Lucilla, Connie Nielsen, he remarked, "Commodus has issues." Commodus is everything a viewer expects from a big time villain: scheming, madness and - of course - a yellow streak down his back as wide as the screen.The big arena fights are exciting for a while but how many heads can be loped off before a viewer has seen it all too often. The events try to recreate faithfully the exciting games once put on by the Roman Gladiatorial League with a cast of thousands (or some darn good computer work).The commentary accompanying the deleted scenes is amusing. Director Scott explains why he left out a scene of lions turned loose on kneeling Christians by explaining that the animals were too passive as they went to lunch."Gladiator" is a huge money-grosser proving that this formulaic and potted snapshot of a crucial era in western history can't be reproduced too often.6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We saw this in a local flea - pit and sat in front of an old guy who gave a running commentary to his friend all the way through ("Look at the size of that spear, etc."). Luckily it only served to enhance our enjoyment, rather than detract from it, providing a certain comedy element that was otherwise lacking.If you've seen Ben Hur, Spartacus and Braveheart then you've already seen Gladiator (not forgetting Life of Brian, which features one of the most memorable gladiator scenes in movie history). The action scenes are fairly entertaining, but not to be recommended to those of a squeamish disposition. The main character, Naughtius Maximus or something, is supposed to be Spanish, but sounds remarkably Australian throughout the film.It's nice to see Oliver Reed back in action, reminding us that he used to be famous for more than appearing drunk on chat shows. However, for those of you that are unaware, he sadly passed away before the film was completed, calling for several rewrites and some technical jiggereypokery. Possibly the film does suffer as a result, as you get the feeling that some elements of the last act were stuck on with blu-tak.However, I did actually enjoy a lot of Gladiator, particularly Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the cowardly emperor who's desire for power (and his sister) gets a little out of hand. For those of you who like your action loud, brutal and featuring men in skirts I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was absolutely shocked by the rating this movie got here and elsewhere, I thought it was a poorly written, pseudo-histroric dribble.&lt;Some spoilers ahead&gt;First-off, the story. I'm pretty sure it's been ripped-off from "Fall of the Roman Empire", removing all original parts from it and replacing them with various "gritty" decapitation and disenbowling incidents. The characters are fac-similies of any cheesy action blockbuster role: the vengeful general-turned-gladiator, the power-mad emperor and the grieving orphaned-widow only searching for a little tenderness, c'mon!! The story evolution itself is lacking: the people of Rome are ready to rebel just because they like some gladiator's fighting-style, and the praetorian guard who kill Maximus' family and allies suddenly turn to help him on a whim. Any attempt for character studiy is abruptly interrupted by more gore-tastic antics.Now the acting. Let me say that this is not one of Crowe's good acting days. I loved him in the "Insider" and a "Beautiful Mind", but here, he is wooden and amateurish: they say the indicator of a bad actor is his "angry scenes", well Crowe's look-at-the-ground-tense-my-biceps-ball-my-fists-and-growl routine (the very same from L.A Confidential, just different costumes) is definitely an indicator. Joaquin Phoenix, an amazing actor normally, is bogged down in his horrible, horrible, role. Even Richard Harris's and Oliver Reed's stellar performances aren't enough to save this picture.Finally, the history. First-off, Commodus wasn't a power-hungry arrivist, he was a retarded, fornicating party-boy who had to be dragged to the throne. Secondly, all historians agree that Marcus-Aurelius died of natural causes. The historic details are so badly done that some latin shop signs have spelling errors (it's not my opinion, I read it in a film magazine).It seems Ridley Scott is about to join the hallowed mass of directors with great technique but no regard to content.</fullReview>

I was frankly quite surprised at Crowe's acting abilities (he was pretty damn good!), but overall, the film was lacking something. The effects were amazing, the directing pretty good, the score was fantastic, yet I didn't feel that it lived up to the hype. It just doesn't measure up to other epics such as Braveheart. I think too much time was spent on effects, so some of the heart of the film was lost.

		<fullReview>The production values are high, courtesy of computer graphics, but there are one or two flaws which do nag. First, the computer effects themselves give the texture of the film a certain muddy, unreal quality. It is difficult to put your finger on it, but there is something artificial about the look of the film which cannot be ignored.Second, there is a huge hole in the narrative which makes you wonder: our friend Maximus arrives back home, finds his family murdered and homestead burnt down, is taken by slave traders (who came from where? Where is the home? The suggestion was that it was somewhere in Southern Europe - Spain possibly - rather than North Africa), transported to North Africa/Asia, trained as a gladiator etc.This whole process would surely take many months if not a year or two. But at the end of Maximus' training - of at least a year if not more - young Commodus arrives back from murdering his dad. What's he been doing those past two years? Surely not hanging around somewhere as deeply unattractive, not to say rough and ready, as Germany? The whole timeline is even more unconvincing in that Maximus seems to manage to get from his would-be execution in Germany to Spain in about a week and a half. This might not seem important to some, but basic flaws like that make you wonder whether this is just, at best, supercharged schlock with added computer tricks.</fullReview>

There's evidence that the characters that Crowe plays best are not dissimilar to the man in real life. In this Maximus is full of hate and longs for revenge on the new Caesar.Crowe is well supported by the rest of the cast which includes Oliver Reed's final performance. Perhaps the other thing that this will be best remembered for is the reconstruction of Rome in all it's Glory. The final speech by Lucilla is a bit over the top, but that aside this is modern filmmaking at its best.</fullReview>

Well balanced dynamics (action versus silence versus dialogue). Highlights for me were the later interactions between Caesar and his sister - in particular the busy bee tale and later the only time he really raises his voice at her.Visually, it's a little monotone, but there's good use of space by the director - the claustrophobic scenes give you that sense of discomfort and the more open scenes can be quite airy.Violence levels were expected to be high, so there's no point in anyone complaining about that, you have all the warning you need before you've ordered the ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a epic story set in ancient Rome. Roman's general, Maximus (Russel Crowe) fight in the arena as a gladiator, for vengeance. His family was murdered on the order of the bad emperor, Commodus. Maximus was badly injured and sold to the gladiator's school. He didn't have any hope - he wanted to die, but first he wants to kill Commodus. It's a story about friendship, loyality, honour and love, who wins over death. The movie's director is Ridley Scott, a famous British director (Alien, Thelma &amp; Louise, Black Hawk Down). Fantastic good music composed by Hans Zimmer &amp; Lisa Gerard (she's stars in the group Dead can dance).

		<fullReview>Gladiator is a great film, not only for it's gore, but for it's performances. Russel Crowe does a fantastic job as Maximus and Pheonix is great as Commodus. The battle scenes are terrific, but don't just watch it for that, watch it for the fights and the acting. It's a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard Action Film meets Costume Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A truly APPALLING lack of male nudity for a film about ancient Rome. Really. Why else does one rent gladiator movies but for to get lots of good gore &amp; sinewy doomed slaves oiling each other up while clad in naught but metal miniskirts? Resounding disappointment there, Ridley.Even the gore itself was disappointing, although there were some rather good mid-air splatters. The editing during the fights was very odd-- the blood looked stroboscopic, fast-motion, as though someone were rushing to get through the fight without focusing on any scary bits. It is possible to have a really good unflinching bloody fight without pandering to the goremongers, but that line isn't reached here.I quite liked Joaquin Phoenix as the screwed-up little emperor... His eerily pathetic performance was the only one that stood out. Phoenix's costume was nice. The scenery was nice. That exquisite bald Nubian, first appearing naked in the slave-market, was a definite mitigating factor. The historical accuracy was questionable but not atrocious.But overall, this flick struck me as "Lethal Weapon" without explosions. Upstanding white man with super fighting powers; works for corrupt governmental body; wife &amp; child killed; This Time It's Personal; etc. Just substitute the LAPD for the Tribunal, and you've got this movie, already made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> ..............come to mind when watching this epic-style Roman Empire story. And I do not grumble about the story, nor even of its telling. Ridley Scott is obviously a highly professional director; the screenplay is worthy of the film, and the photography is frequently wonderful. Some of the sets are superb.My grudge, I suppose, is that with so much Hollywood razzamatazz, I was falsely led into expecting something different from Russell Crowe. His performance is good, or even better. But so good as to win an Oscar? So be it: Hollywood criteria once again goes astray. Well, anyway, it is all good for the box-office. Do not get me wrong: the film relates its story well, such that at over 150 minutes by no means did it seem too long. Battle scenes and Gladiators in the Coliseum were well filmed. Richard Harris's interpretation stands out head and shoulders above everybody else. What really makes me gripe is the music: it practically ruined the whole film. It seems that Zimmer `borrowed' (if not plagiarized) anything he could get his hands on, with pieces which sounded like replicas inspired by people ranging from Gustav Holst and Andrew Lloyd-Webber, via Vangelis and even a touch of Richard Wagner. I suppose a grandiose-intentioned epic film required music of the same proportions, but Zimmer was not inspired and has never much inspired me in his other films, especially for TV series.A little below seven out of ten for this one, despite the several good points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High quality, little content</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING - Big spoilers (but if you can't figure out the entire plot after the first 20 minutes, go back to TV)I just saw this movie on DVD, watched it all, enjoyed it as a fight movie, but felt dissatisfied. Then came up with the following analogy. The movie is like a 20 Oz high quality Sirloin stake. The cinematography and fight scenes were great, but after the first 8 Oz you start to feel you have the measure of the thing, why eat the next 12? The story was a very old one, the only question to be resolved - does Maximus kill Commodus before he dies? 12 oz later, the answer is yes. Oh, the stake never lost its quality - the Coliseum was great, more excellent battles. But 8 Oz would have been fine.The acting was very uneven. Joaquin Phoenix turned in a great performance as Commodus. Oliver Reed had the best role since Oliver. Russell Crowe was just not there. That he used a lot of the same tics for Maximus as for Charles Nash was odd - but this is the guy who did LA Confidential - what happened? Derek Jacobi being saddled with the 1-d Gracchus made me want to cry - this is the actor who made I, Claudius!And it is not that Ridley Scott can't thrive with 1-D acting - he did after all, make Blade Runner with Mister Frown, Harrison Ford. But that movie had a great, interesting, novel plot. This one could have been lifted from any of a 1,000 different predecessors.But why is it so not compelling? Compare to another period piece with odd accents - The Lion in Winter - lots of satisfying complexity there and Katherine Hepburn. A story that could twist in many directions and characters that were passionate - with many different passions. (OK - it did have an unfair advantage in screenplay from the Bard.) But when the acting is gripping, you can overlook all the anachronisms. And a movie motivated by the love of a woman, but with no strong female role, isn't likely to convince you of its passion.Finally (really!) there is THE MEANING OF IT ALL. When Max is dying on his feet, but gives(!) democracy back to the Senate (Gracchus), to fulfill the wishes of a dying emperor(!), what are we meant to take from this? Hopeful interpretation - democracy handed over at the point of the sword has as much chance of living a long life as the dying man handing it over. Pity President Bush didn't see that. More likely interpretation - there is no deep meaning. Ridley Scott thought that if you do a little regime change and "hand over" democracy, then you have yourself a Triumph. Hmm, perhaps President Bush did see this movie this way...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A grand epic ? told by a master storyteller. Sit back and watch a master ply his craft. As noted by previous reviewers - director Ridley Scott's cinematic masterpiece explodes onto the screen with the force of Spielberg's `Saving Private Ryan' ? with the best battle scenes since Gibson's Braveheart.This film is an epic tale of one man's loyalty, betrayal and revenge - - against the backdrop of Rome at the height of her glory ? and brutality. Director Scott weaves an intricate fabric paralleling one man's fight for justice ? and a nation's struggle for freedom ? both cumulating in the final battle between one just man and the deific ambitions of a megalomaniacal Cesar. Sit back too ? and take a lesson in acting from the old master Richard Harris. His `whispers' are more powerful than another man's battle cries. Then too ? take a lesson in acting from the new masters Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. These two actors can do more with a glance or a tilt of their head ? than most actors can do with their whole bodies. Last but not least ? was Spielberg's Dreamworks ? being the icing on the cake. Director Scott was exceedingly careful in not making that all too familiar mistake of letting the special effects overpower the story line. DreamWorks' `unleashing hell' in the opening battle scenes ? through to the recreation of the Coliseum in all of her terrible splendor was truly captivating. Throughout ? there was not one weak link throughout the movie. Supporting actors and actresses were the best in the business. Derek Jacobi and Connie Nielson never disappoint. Plus ? I'm at a loss for words to describe the visual impact of Ralf Moeller and Sven-Ole Thorsen.On a parting note and in scanning some previous comments ? I'd like to observe that those folks ? who have been nurtured on Kung Fu flicks - - will be understandably disappointed in a film of this depth and breadth ? and realism. In summary ? a truly captivating and entertaining movie - - with perhaps its greatest strength being that it forces one to give ample pause to reflect on one's own life and life goals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator reminded me very much of The Patriot. Both men were respected because they were heroes, both are threatened by the enemy, both lose their families to the enemy(although in The Patriot, the man's wife was already dead), and both seek revenge for what has happened to their families. Gladiator, to me is one of those movies that leaves you thinking for several minutes after the ending. Gladiator is very well acted, very well directed, and has very good special effects.Rated R for strong fighting, and gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is one of those movies that could never be good no matter what. The historically inaccuracy of the movie was laughable, and movies that take place thousands of years ago irritate me. I like movies that take place in the present day. The acting in the film was very good, but the story itself just wasn't suspenseful enough. Plus this movie is well over 2 hours. That is just unacceptable in my opinion. The movie could have been done in 90 minutes and that would have made it much better. I would recommend this movie to people who don't mind watching movies that take place in olden times, movies that are historically inaccurate, movies that are over two hours long, and movies with mediocre story lines.

		<fullReview>Gladiator is a film which contrives to be something more than just another 'no-brain actioner' but unfortunately the film tries too hard to be unique and simply wallows in its own pretensions and clichd dialogue, delivered by unconvincing cardboard cut outs of characters.The plot,in short, revolves around Maximus(Russell Crowe) a talented Roman general who, after winning a huge battle at Germania,is privately chosen by the Emperor(Richard Harris) to be the next ruler of Rome. Commodus, the Emporer's son is informed of this and does not take the news well and swiftly reasserts his right to the throne by .....well I think the rest is already covered quite sufficiently in the 'Plot Summary' section, so I'll begin criticizing this bloated piece of historical nonsense.Ridley Scott is famed for his distinctive visual flair, and Gladiator is another impressive piece of style over substance, as Scott lavishly recreates imperial Rome with the aid of some imppressive computer graphics and superbly choreographs the elaborate battle sequences with brutal attention to detail. However once you get past these superficial details you discover the glaring faults that prevent the film from being as good as it should have been. Crowe's maximus is a fairly 2-dimensional character and his facial expressions seem to be limited to either scowling, suppressing rage, or just generally moody, whilst his dialogue consists of 'uber-hero' clichs all delivered in a typically macho, gruff voice lacking any inflection or emotion. Crowe can be a very good and versatile actor but he flounders in this role, remaining in dull monotone for most of the picture.The Film is partially redeemed by solid performances from Connie Nielsen as the tragic, but strong-willed, heroine and Joaqiun Phoenix completely camps it up as the vile Commodus to great effect and Derek Jacobi is impressive in a small role as a member of the Roman Senate.Many people love this film but I don't consider it to be particulairly special (maybe I'm too demanding) so I reccomend you check it out for yourself, but the fact this film won the 'best picture' oscar proves very little and only demeans the academy's already waning credibility.For now I'll give the film a mediocre score of 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Russel Crowe won his first Oscar for playing gladiator Maximus, a Roman soldier betrayed by the emperor's son Commodus (Jaquin Phoenix). Maximus is forced to become a gladiator, fighting and slowly gaining the respect of the Roman public. Crowe's performance defines drama, as the heavily reluctant and equally mourning Maximus. Phoenix almost matches Crowe's brilliance, but over-acts a little in some scenes, losing a possible Oscar win.Aside from the fabulous acting there is also the perfectly choreographed sword battles. From the beginning raid on the barbarians to the climactic Crowe vs. Phoenix fight scene, the battles, and everything else in "Gladiator" for that matter, never disappoint.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The three good points of "Gladiator"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. Derek Jacobi: I love Derek Jacobi and he is one of the world's most brilliant actors. However, seeing him perform in such a lowbrow, low-class, low-quality movie is disturbing. It's a bit like seeing John Cleese in James Bond films or Kenneth Branagh in "Wild Wild West." It's sad, really.2. Sets and costuming: This film is visually stunning. I suppose Ridley Scott has to be given credit for his work here instead of being blamed for a bad script.3. It ends (and this one takes far too long to happen) "Gladiator" is almost as over-hyped as "The Sixth Sense" and "Titanic" in the pantheon of bad movies that somehow convinced idiots that they were good. Russell Crowe's performance is decent, but how in the world can you win a best actor Oscar for playing a completely flat, empty character like Maximus? Kevin Costner or Keanu Reeves can play a role this simple and do a decent job! It is possible to add some depth to this character in performance, but Crowe seems incapable, unwilling, or unallowed to do this and thus instead plays this one-dimensional piece-of-paper role and somehow gets accolades for it. However, the part of this film that kills it is the thing that truly makes or breaks a film: the script. A good script can make up for bad acting (as evidenced in "JFK" and "The Matrix"), but good acting cannot make up for a truly bad script (as evidenced in "Best in Show" and "Titanic"). "Gladiator" is a case of the latter. Crowe doesn't give an amazing performance, but he is given little to work with. In fact, the only actor who really does have a full character to work with is Joaquin Phoenix, and he performs it quite well. The other characters hardly need acting, even though one is filled by the ever-brilliant Derek Jacobi. The truth of the matter, though, is that the script is trite and stupid. As a matter of fact, it's like a very ineloquent version of "The Tragedy of King Richard III" without the fascinating central character. There is also far too much battling in this film. I got bored with Kenneth Branagh's "Henry V" because of ONE long battle scene, but this film seems to have about five of that same length. "Gladiator" is like all of these "crime dramas" that are really just action films with just enough plot for stupid people to think they are intelligent. In sum, if you want to watch a typical, run-of-the-mill action film set in ancient Rome, watch this. If you want to see nothing other than stunning visuals, watch this (though I would more suggest that you watch anything directed by Peter Weir if you want visuals). However, if you want to see a movie worth watching, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifyingly overrated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How this movie is being widely accepted as a "masterpiece" is beyond me. Frankly, the only good thing I can say about this movie is J.Phoenix' performance - IMHO, he was great, as always.However, which is more than I can say for R.Crowe. The poster, who mentioned R.Crowe's range of "two expressions - arrogant &amp; silly", was dead on, at least for this movie. I can see that Crowe did a great job by preparing for the role physically - i.e. growing muscles and all that, but his actual performance raised no emotions in me. Neither did the rest of the movie (with a possible exception of Phoenix' Commodus, as I mentioned above). The plot was predictable and ludicrous - oh, poor guy's family is killed (hmm... wonder where I have seen that before? Oh, yeah - in at least dozen of frickin'. Similar. Flicks.). So he's off to his revenge mission. And he gets his revenge by fighting the emperor in the gladiators ring. Now stop for a moment, please, and think about it. A slave (and I'm not even going into the fact that a roman of his position can't possibly stay a slave when his identity is known) challenges an emperor to a duel. Please. I'm not usually the one who bitches about and picks apart the inaccuracy of loosely-history-based movies, but the stupidity of these plot points is too much glaring. I can't take the events seriously, when they pretend to be realistic and accurate, but are not. For the f**k's sake, such final battle would fit in "Rocky", but here is too absurd. Once again I have to quite one of the previous posters with an analogy of fight between Bush and a prisoner. 'Cause that's what was going at the end of "Gladiator".So, to sum up - acting: mostly meh; character development: practically non-existing; dialogues/writing: you call that writing??? special effects/fights/visual: these were good, of course (since this is a supposedly Epic. Hollywood. Movie!!!). But that's not why I watch movies. I watch movies for characters and plot. Alas, I wasn't able to find neither in this so-called masterpiece. So if you're at least tiny bit like me, I'm taking an unpopular stance and saying: don't waste your time on this movie. Even watching it purely for the visual side isn't worth it - there are much better movies with equally good effects and fights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott is a trustworthy director, and even though a couple of his movies (Hannibal, Black Hawk Down) aren't as great as his older ones (Alien, Blade Runner) he still manages to at least direct them good. Here, he takes the more Hollywood type of approach and uses camera style previously used in the 1998 feature Saving Private Ryan. What Ridley Scott understands is that to see the action, one must be in the action. He uses his this technique in Black Hawk Down with his rapid- fire photography of the battle scenes. In Blade Runner, the camera was constantly focused near Deckard. He carefully chooses his shots here and instead of just saying "Okay, let's make it realistic" he choses to be more detailed and shows beauty in the scenes. He should have won Best Director instead of Steven Sodernbergh. Unfortunately, John Logan and co's script ends up being mediocore at best. They are trying to dazzle the audience with a magnificent feast of old proverbs and tight dialouge, but it ends up being the typical cliche type of dialouge. Maximus is the hero, yes, but the writers smolder it in our faces showing how he can just take anyone on and still hold out well. The performances are first- rate, and even though Russell Crowe's performance was powerful it was not as good as his "The Insider" of which he truly should have won for. Did he deserve at least a nomination? Yes he did. In support is the always energetic and young Joaquien Phoneix as the deceptive and brutal son of the Emperor, who always seems to have a few tricks up his sleeve. His performances blends craftiness and muscular strength in a beautiful tense and even if his character is a bit cliche it's not noticeable. He should have beat out Benicio Del Toro. Also in the backround is Richard Harris as the wise and friendly Emperor Commodus who wishes for war to end. His performance masterfully builds off himself and his character, and he at least deserved to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor. As Commodus's daughter, Connie Nielsen provides most of the emotional work but she's harldy in the movie. There are some masterful shots here of the towering (CGI) arenas and the interesting costume designs to build upon everything. Even if the script isn't too good, the rest of the movie adds up enough to be a somewhat enjoyable experience and still one of the best movies of 2000. 8.5/10</fullReview>

And, Ridley Scott (screwed at the oscars) delivers with this cinematic masterpiece!Crowe is phenomenal as Maximus, the hero of the story. Maximus is driven by an insatiable thirst for revenge, yet beneath that burns the love for the dream of Rome, shared by the former emperor (Harris). But, Joaquin Phoenix (also screwed at the oscars) turned in one of the most disturbing portrayals of evil in moviedom. Commodus (played by Phoenix) can't be purely hated--look at his upbringing. But, his actions can ONLY be hated. And, the threat he poses to his own people cannot be settled through talk or appeasement. One cannot reason with insanity. They are, by nature, unequivocable, and Maximus/Commodus portray these elements beautifully.The characters are believable, played perfectly, and the story is impeccably blended with action, drama, and even romance. This is easily the greatest movie produced in the modern era!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But pretty damn close :)I cannot say anything about this movie that has not already been said, really, but I'll try:The plot, in a few sentences:Maximus (Crowe), a General in the Roman Army, is asked to be the next Emperor of Rome. When the current Emperor is killed by his son Commudus, Maximus is sentenced to death for his lack of Loyalty. Maximus escapes, only to find that his wife and son have been brutally killed. He is forced to become a Gladiator, and his plot for Revenge begins......(ok, not exactly that, but fairly close)A lot of people gripe how this movie is "Historically Inacurate". I won't say "It's a movie for god sakes, not a documantary!" (tho that is true). I'd just say "Well, there's a ton of phone-book sized texts on Ancient Rome at the Library, why not check one out and have a entertaining night with your friends?"My favorite part of the movie is the Cinematography (sp?). It's great, even though some of the best shots are CGI (though you couldn't tell).The performances were all great. I especially loved the late Richard Harris' Marcus Aurellias (sp again!), even though it was brief. Maximus was very well done by Crowe, he deserved the Oscar. All the other performances were top notch as well.My 2nd favorite aspect of the movie was the Soundtrack. One word: FANTASTIC. Couldn't have been better. I have the CD and listen to it all the time.I've recently bought the DVD, and even though I've seen this movie at least 8 times, I still love to watch it with my GF and her friends.In 1 word: EpicOverall, 10/10.James "Black Wolf" Johnston</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GLADIATOR Russell Crowe - Joaquin Phoenix - Connie Nielsen - Oliver Reed - Richard HarrisA fabulous drama film packed with brutal and bloody gladiator fights and exciting story, a really fantastic movie. What we do in life echoes in eternity"On my signal, unleash hell" Director Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Alien) has runned into a dramatic and quality, brutal and epic. Film with supreme overall where Russell Crowe shows that he really knows how to act and with great co-working with Joaquin Phoenix as the cruel and evil emperor Commodus. Danish Connie Nielsen is also good and sadly the dead Harris does a wonderful supporting character as Marcus Aurelius. "Roma victor!!"STORY: The great General Maximus is the emperor's personal favourite to take over the throne, cause he thinks that his son Commodus is far to brutal. But then Commodus kills his father and sends Maximus out in the woods to be executed. But Maximus escapes with his brilliant skills and soon his trained as a gladiator, and soon he also gets the people's favourite under the name "Spanian". Commodus understands that Maximus is obviosuly after revenge cause of him killing his wife an d son...a hero will rise...The movie won Oscars like Best Picture, Best Actor in Leading Role, Best music, Best director - and it was all big and important awards. The movie was the big movie in 2000 and is a coming classic with it's perfect dialog, mood and directing. Music made by Hans Zimmer and many sang by Lisa Gerrard is simply beautiful music and makes a unforgettable soundtrack. STARS: ***** 5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of 2000.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was definitely the best movie of 2000. It was everything you could possibly want from an epic adventure!The story is about a man, General Maximus (Russel Crowe) who has been betrayed by the new Emperor, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), whose family was killed and turned from a General of the Roman Empire to a Gladiator; and now seeks for revenge.The plot is outstanding, it is very well written, and it has a lot of historical background. Even though is not 100% accurate, it is excellent. The performances were good as well, Russel Crowe did deserve the Oscar for this movie, he made us be on the brink of our seat the whole movie. Joaquin Phoenix was equally good as Commodus, his performance is so convincing that you actually end up hating him. All the rest of the cast were equally good, most of all Richard Harris and Oliver Reed.The music of this movie is possibly one of the most important parts of it, it is perfect in every single situation. The special effects were outstanding, we get to see the glory of Rome back in those days.This movie is a must see, however; if you are looking for a movie based 100% in history facts, watch the History Channel instead. If you want to have a great time, watch this movie. ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen this film four times because I was so excited about it, but never got around to reviewing it. This is the story of Maximus, played by Russel Crowe, who won that year's Academy Award. Before his death, the Emperor chooses Maximus to be his heir over his own son, the wicked Commodus, played by Joaguin Phoenix, and a power struggle leaves Maximus and his family condemned to death. The powerful general is unable to save his family, and his loss of will allows him to get captured and put into the Gladiator games until he dies. The only desire that fuels him now is the chance to rise to the top so that he will be able to look into the eyes of the man who will feel his revenge. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scott is a visual storyteller, but not an auditory one (mild spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Ridley Scott has rarely made movies that have strong emotional content. Mostly they are showcases of his visual flair, here is no exception. Nonetheless, I find Gladiator better than Braveheart for the following reasons.1) More epic in scale and better use of lighting rather than Braveheart's take on Henry V.2) There is a visual style here that Mel Gibson doesn't provide in his movie. There are many Scott trademark shots and some new ones.3) More characters to deal with. Overall, Braveheart was Gibson running the whole show. Here there is a helpful supporting cast to get him through. Kudos to the late Oliver Reed.4) Less outright brutality. If Braveheart is a medieval version of Saving Private Ryan, then Gladiator is a Roman take on John Woo's "THE KILLER". 'Nuff said.Both films have their highs and lows, but the biggest fault I have with this one is that there is very limited sound effects usage. Only one or two different slash sounds seem to be used for the (MULTITUDE, I kid you not!) stabings.In the end, you may or may not like it so rent it first. I give it 4 out of 5.</fullReview>

Yes, the environment is very realistic but if your going to do a movie about the Roman Empire and Gladiators then do it right.ON A SCALE OF 1-10 STARS (10 BEING BEST)I GIVE "GLADIATOR"- 10 STARS (-**********)ON THE POSITIVE SIDE (+ SIDE)1) REALISTIC ENVIRONMENT (Using C.G.I. to repair the Coloseum was brilliant)ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE (- SIDE)1) CONCEPT OF SLAVERY (No slave has ever won his or her freedom)2) OVERLY BRAVE EMPEROR (No way did any Emperor die while fighting in a Gladiator type game. It was just a poor excuse to have Marcius kill the bad guy)3) UNREALISTIC GLADIATOR ARMOR (I saw a show on the history channel and they showed all the types of Gladiators in Ancient Rome and there was no tiger man armor)SPOILER WARNING (IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN GLADIATOR AND STILL WANT TO THEN STOP READING)4) BAD ENDING (After all the trouble to earn his freedom, he dies shortly afterwards)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that makes it hard for me to understand why and how the Academy awards are handed out. I think it was a good enough movie, entertaining and all that, but there was too much emphasis on the special effects instead of the actual story, which wasn't great to begin with. I was not impressed with any of the acting abilities but it was entertaining. I guess maybe it shows that I'm not a huge Crowe fan. Liked him best in Vituosity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, how I wanted so much more....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As actors are fond of repeating ad nauseum, it's more fun to play a bad guy than a good guy. The same goes for reviews: it's just so much more fun to trash a movie than to praise it. With that in mind, it is taking an act of will not to completely trash GLADIATOR. Instead, I will point out the good things. Its visuals are stunning. It's the first movie I've seen with really superb CG backgrounds that looked real and added to the film without distracting. Its fight scenes are incredible. The opening battle scene is nasty, bloody, loud and almost overwhelming. Plus, it has a plethora of great old actors hamming it up the way actors should in a movie this big. The movie was obviously made with a great deal of care and an eye for details. It is, truly, a big-time, Hollywood epic. And yet it could have been soooo much more.....First, Russel Crowe delivers the least heroic hero. An epic lives on its ability to make you want to watch the hero's story for three hours. Crowe has the size and swagger down, but his squinty-eyed disdain is too off-putting to make him sympathetic. Furthermore, Joaquin Phoenix's villain is just not villainous. The hero is measured by the quality of the obstacles he overcomes. If Phoenix is an obstacle, he's an obstacle with no charisma and a laughable accent made even more laughable by its proximity to the Shakespearian delivery of Derek Jacobi, Oliver Reed, etc. These guys mouth words like they're sucking hard candy, while Mr. Phoenix mumbles like he has marbles in his mouth. It's a poor choice. (Why must he have an accent at all? Only Britain was British to the Romans, right?) And finally, the story (though I have friends who SWEAR it really happened) is a little ludicrous with a preachy ending. It just felt hollow. As gladiator pics go, this does have the violence and mayhem that make for some good watching. Unfortunately, with a little bit of editing and recasting, it could have been so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything you could want, and more...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(some spoilers, not many)Some people lament this films not-completely-accurate interpretation of ancient history, citing that though a good deal *is* accurate, other parts are not. Others deem this film unworthy due to the fact that it was too "Hollywood".While both are valid points, I don't believe them to be at all damaging to what should be the central part of every great movie - not the cinematography, not the score, nor even the acting - but the story. A good story tells itself, as all of us should know, and a good story can overcome any other limitations.Gladiator does just that.Reminiscent at times of Spartacus, at others of the infamous "I, Claudius" series, Gladiator does a good job of introducing people (many who probably have only cursory knowledge of anything prior to when they were born unfortunately) to ancient times, with obvious emphasis on Rome.The depictions of the Roman senate are correct. All of the soldier's equipment is also accurate, as are the tactics employed in the opening battle sequence. Yes, yes, yes - there was no such thing as a "thumbs up" at the true Gladitorial games, but there have to be some sacrifices to relate to the non-historically inclined.Ultimately however, the story is what truly shines. And I'd say it's as non-Hollywood as they come in some essential ways. First of all, our hero and protagonist, Maximus, is not your typical hero, bursting with bravado and dropping one-liners like some bronze-age Swarzenegger. He is a capable man, thrust into a role he wants no part of. Right from the beginning, it is established that all he truly wants is to return home to his family, and nothing more. He dreams neither of glory, nor wealth, but peace after many years of war.The terrible tragedy that befalls him is not of his own doing - he is a politically naiive man, defamed and stripped of rank by politicians, an entity he cannot comprehend. Embittered by the betrayal of the nation that he fought so hard to protect and expand, Maximus is a sullen, resigned character, who only shows brief spurts of contentment throughout the rest of the film - and after what happened to him and his family, he has every reason to feel this way.Ultimately, as may (or may not) be a surprise, in VERY much anti-Hollywood fashion, our hero dies at the end. After all he has accomplished, all he suffered, he still dies anyway. This made me quite sad actually, but enhanced the emotional pull of the picture ten fold. As an almost unwritten rule, the hero does not die. Sure, he may get beaten, stabbed, shot up, and sworn at, but in the end, he still lives, gets the girl, and life goes on...None of that happened here, and so we were fortunate to bear witness to one of the few great cinematic moments of the last decade.9.5/10On a purely "guy" note - wonderful combat. Enough blood and hacking and slashing to keep me properly entertained :0)</fullReview>

A powder keg of a performance from Russel Crowe as a scorned general turned gladiator seeking revenge for his family's execution, an expertly recreated view of ancient Rome, a darkly comic performance from Phoenix as the villainous and terribly vexed emperor, a "hey, look at me I'm hot and a great actress" turn from a virtually unknown Connie Nielson as the emperor's conniving sister and Crowe's love interest, taut direction from a seasoned director (Ridley Scott) who knows something about pacing and action and visuals, an amazing musical score from Hans Zimmer, awesome costumes and sets, and tons of blood and carnage, all make this one of my personal all time favorite movies. Some of the CGI make look dated in years to come, but I don't think I could ever get tired of this story oft-told, but not oft told this well.</fullReview>

Crowe becomes a Gladiator for reasons not fully explained (to my satisfaction at least) and manages to become the greatest Gladiator over a period of time (well, DUH!...it wouldn't be much of a film if he got killed early on, now would it?). The film is very well filmed and Crowe is excellent in this one. This is a don't-miss!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stirring, action-packed epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8 out of 10Russell Crowe stars as Maximus, a Roman general whose family is slain when he refuses to swear loyalty to the new emperor (Joaquin Phoenix). Sold into slavery, Maximus becomes a gladiator, and upon proving his mettle in combat, plans his revenge against the emperor as he begins to win the audience over victory after victory. Visually stunning and brilliantly directed, this epic tale does come up lacking somewhat when it comes to plot, but the film is so meticulously crafted and exciting, it's hard to care. The gladiator battles are the movie's highlight, never copping out when it comes to explicit violence and brutality. A sequence involving chariots and surrounded gladiators is an intense, bloody fight to the death. Expect tons of visceral satisfaction if gory combat is what you're looking for. But those wanting memorable characters and heart will also be pleased. Russell Crowe's powerful performance brings genuine emotion and drama to the screen, you can't help but feel for the man's pain. Hans Zimmer's score is his best to date, alternately rousing and emotionally satisfying. Don't be surprised if the music is enough to induce you to tears. Gladiator has something for everyone: action, drama, romance, laughs, and ambition. This is in every way a stirring epic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, the film is beautifully crafted. Haunting music expresses the tragedy of a good man wronged, superlative acting and direction realises an Ancient Rome of epic power, savagery and bloodlust. This is a "Rome of the Mind", a tale of what might have been. History was different, Commodus Hercules never really killed his father Marcus Aurelius for example, but all of that is forgotten in the magnificent sweep of the story. Monumental grandeur is mixed with sharp, bloody conflict, told with mastery. The gore is never superfluous, the characters and dialogue never overdone. Russell Crowe fully realises the honourable man flung into catastrophe by fate, and the tragedy is rendered painfully palpable by superb villainy expressed by Joaquin Phoenix' embodiment of conniving evil. Richard Harris is magnificent as the aging, weary Marcus Aurelius and Derek Jacobi plays the archetypal politician to perfection. This is a totally engrossing, absolutely magnificent work.Bravi, bravissimi!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps a little late coming, but still worth the time to review.So much has already been said about this movie that it's difficult to even come up with anything of any originality at this time. This movie is such a joy from start to finish that it's difficult to find much fault with it. Enjoyed originally in the cinema, and then on a large widescreen TV with the correct DTS surround setup, 'Gladiator' maintains a terrific atmosphere thanks to Ridley Scott's fantastic direction, and a phenomenal score by the great Hans Zimmer. Yes, some might find the fight sequences a little fast and the camera movement difficult to focus on in places, but if you let the movie wash over you, it completely trounces any movie of the year 2000, and pretty much every movie since then in terms of style, quality, and presentation. Spend some time studying the actors movements, and it's a real joy seeing Joaquin Pheonix's expressions of anger and torment throughout the movie. Acting at its finest all round, in fact. If you haven't already seen this movie, do so as soon as possible. Epic in every sense of the word.</fullReview>

The computer graphics were stunning, the war scene very realistic (read gory). But I knew 20 minutes into it almost exactly what was going to happen and all the fighting that happened along the way was just fluff to fill out space in between the plot points. The love story is unconvincing and the villain, the emperor, is entirely evil with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, rendering no only unsympathetic but unbelievable. Since Russel Crowe's character is almost entirely good, he doesn't need an entirely evil character to counterpoint him. Don't see this movie for the story, see it for the special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems as if the folks at DreamWorks could not decide whether they wanted to remake "Ben Hur," "Spartacus," or "The Fall of the Roman Empire," so they decided to remake all three. They took two awesome scripts and one mediocre screen play, stuck them in a blender, and the resulting concoction has become the better-than-average "Gladiator." It borrows most heavily from the mediocre "Fall of the Roman Empire" in terms of characters and basic plot, but quite a bit of influence from "Ben Hur" and "Spartacus" can easily be noted.This is the story of Mad Maximus (Russell Crowe), an Australian who moves to Spain, looks good in a toga and so becomes general of the Roman army. Unfortunately, he refuses to kiss the behind of emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), because he's a bit upset that Commodus killed his own father and Max's best friend Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). One bad thing leads to another, and old Mad Max finds himself mixed up with an international cast of characters fighting as gladiators in the Peoria of North Africa. Soon the day of their big break comes, and it's out of Peoria and on to the Hollywood and Broadway of the ancient world: Rome; to play games of life in death before tremendous crowds at the biggest theater in the world: the Coliseum.Many find the gladiatorial contests of ancient Rome to be rather savage and brutal; but you have to give the Romans a break, in that Hollywood, video games and ice hockey had not yet been invented. What else is there to do for entertainment other than watch a bunch of strangers poke and stab each other with sharp objects? Sure, Playstation II has better blood &amp; gore graphics, but several centuries of technological advancement will do that for you. In the old days, the blood and gore of the arena was all that was available.But an interesting twist develops in the plot: Commodus' sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) finally realizes after thirty years that her brother is a sick, unrepentant pervert and lunatic. Some are slow learners. So she decides that the ol' gladiator/general Mad Max might be just the guy to help her submarine her bro, and restore peace, justice and the American Way to Rome.Anyone who has seen "Ben Hur," "Spartacus" and "The Fall of the Roman Empire" has already seen this movie. There's no surprises or suspense, just lots more scenes of people being decapitated and/or disemboweled. It's amazing what special effects artists and CGI have been able to do to help bring brutality into a far more realistic light than in the past --chalk up another great moment for Hollywood.In the hands of most directors, a film like this would be the scorn and bird droppings of most film critics. But DreamWorks had an ace up their sleeve: they got Ridley Scott to direct this train wreck of a script, and then work his incredible magic to make the ugly duckling transform into a beautiful swan. Well Ridley is good, but he's not God, so what we end up with is a swan who's kinda cute, but not quite up to the cover of Sport Illustrated's swimsuit issue. Still, this is far more than most could have done with such muck.Ridley Scott is one of the few directors who the word "genius" sticks to like glue. You've seen what this guy can do, and do better than most anyone else. For the movie "Gladiator", Scot goes all out. He gets the BEST actors, the best set and costume designers, and the best composer, then puts it all together and creates a tremendous feast for the eyes &amp; ears. There are many great performances all throughout this picture, and the camera work and art direction are absolutely top notch.If there is a complaint, it is with the fight sequences. They are the typical fast cut/shakey camera mish mash that's been going on for ages. One minute a group of guys are facing one another, the next minute a whole bunch of them are dead. How did it happen? Who knows, who cares. Instead of carefully staged shots and fluid camera work, we get the cinema equivalent of projectile vomit. Oh well, at least I can always put on "Crouching Tiger" or "Phantom Menace" if I want to see sword play done properly, or the Tyrone Power version of "Zorro" (1940). But I will admit that the battle scene between the Germans and the Romans at the very beginning of the film was extremely well done. The fast cuts and bouncy camera did an excellent job conveying the excitement and confusion that is prevalent in large scale combat.The actors and the performances they give are far too good for a film of such tripe. Of particular note is the performance of Lucilla by Connie Nielsen. The film is worth the price of admission (or the price of the DVD) just to see this woman's face light up the screen and give the over used theme of blood vengeance such dignity, poise and grace. Lucilla is by far the most interesting character of the film, for she is the only one who goes through a process of transformation by means reflection and examination, rather than by forced external entanglements. The characters of Commodus and Maximus could have been easily played by cardboard cut-outs with the words "Bad Guy" and "Good Guy" stenciled on each. What you see of Commodus and Maximus in the first ten seconds of film is what you see in their final scenes, there is no change or awakening in these two guys. But Lucilla rewards us with an interesting sort of redemption that makes a rather predictable film worth watching. As Ridley Scott himself said of Ms. Nielsen: "She can rule my empire anytime."My generous rating: 7/10</fullReview>

If anything it was a harmless summer blockbuster that got too much hype.I thought Russell Crowe was good in this movie, but not better than Tom Hanks. Crowe was better the year before in The Insider, but not as good as Kevin Spacey. The best performance HANDS DOWN was Joaquin Phoenix. I think Joaquin is a great and under-used actor. Just look at To Die For. Totally different roles, it's almost hard to believe they're the same person. If anyone deserved an Oscar that year, it wasn't Crowe, it wasn't Benicio Del Toro, it was Joaquin Phoenix. Del Toro should feel ashamed for accepting an Oscar he didn't deserve.I liked the directing in this movie, the end was well done. But all the fluff between the fights were boring.

		<fullReview>i must be the last person on earth to have seen this (5/02), and i was in no hurry. i almost always disagree with the "academy"on the good side - some cool cinematography, good set design and special effects (mostly) and Joquain Pheonix.the bad - the characters seem a bit flat, they should have developed more. i couldn't help but laugh at some of the names Commodus and Maxiums Exodus Leviticus Deuteronamy whatever... and one really bad FX shot where Russel kills a tiger - it looked like they got a stuffed tiger from a state fair.overall: good, but i don't ever need to see it again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm still trying to figure out if "Gladiator" is trying to criticize the human tendency to gravitate towards gruesome, grotesque spectacle or appeal to it. I suspect the former, as the film is so frequently shot in bland earth tones and dimly lit settings that it's rarely appealing to the eyes. One of the characters calls the human race "shadows and dust" and it's a decent metaphor, but did Ridley Scott have to use it as a visual motif so constantly?Far from terrible, yet not the Oscar-worthy triumph it has been lauded as, "Gladiator" was instrumental in Russel Crowe's rise as Hollywood's current darling, thanks to his performance as the wronged soldier Maximus. And Crowe does show moments of brilliance in the film, but for my money he's not the most watchable part of it. That honor goes to Joaquin Phoenix, as the emporer Commodus. Commodus is an interesting character study: weak while fancying himself strong, he seems plagued by insecurity even as he grasps at the power which he believes himself to be entitled to. He yearns for adoration--from the public and from his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen)--yet his every action proves him unworthy of it. He's pathetic, yet it is his weaknesses which make him so dangerous.For his own part, Crowe has little more to do than brood over his revenge. His wife and son have been murdered by Commodus--innocent victims of the latter's ascention to the throne, which also claimed the old emporer (the ever-stately Richard Harris). En route, Maximus seeks the aid of Lucilla, who pays lip service to her brother in order to protect herself and her young son. Nielsen is fine, but she and Crowe don't really strike sparks on the screen together, and the past relationship of the characters is never clear. The numerous fight scenes are also muddy, with spurts of blood the only clear image emerging from those ever-present shadows. Scott has also made the error of speeding up the footage in several scenes. Presumably intended to mirror the chaos of battle, the motions instead call to mind the feel of a silent-picture comedy. There are flashes of genuine emotion and charm here, but they emerge from stretches of film that can only be described as murky.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked this movie but it wasn't that great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie a lot. However, I don't think it was worthy of so many awards. It had some nice adrenaline-rush scenes and a few dramatic moments, but I don't think it had the right stuff to really go into the hall of fame, except maybe just for the fact that they did just a good job of capturing and envisioning Rome.So many people have commented on the cinematography of this film, claiming it's top-notch. I have to disagree for most part, especially in the battle scenes where the camera man seemed to be on speed with shaky footage in slow-motion. I think the intent was to capture the frenzy of combat but I think it just made it seem slow and dizzying. I believe Scott redeemed himself for this in Black Hawk Down, which I thought was a crappy movie but had some really great directing. The cinematography in Gladiator seems particularly poor when in comparing it to Crouching Tiger, a movie that I didn't like too much but one that I definitely believe should have won that award.I also found out that the beginning battle scene involved many, many, many extras suited in real armor and that they spent a great deal of time and money filming the initial battle with the barbarians. I didn't think the footage gave much sense of the sheer magnitude of Roman soldiers at all nor was the action very exciting.As a special effects artist myself, I have to admit that I found some of the special effects to be pretty impressive. I'm still trying to figure out how they managed to composite some of those background shots with the live footage to create the coliseum and some of the other buildings.I also don't think Russell Crowe's acting was that great in this film. He has a great snot-nosed crying scene but I don't think his acting rivals the earlier work he has done in movies like The Insider and Romper Stomper.Anyway, I've pointed out a lot of flaws I've found in the movie and I can go on and on. I still have to say I like this movie a lot and it's definitely one of my favorite historical movies. It's just that so many people are saying too many good things about this movie - it seems a bit overrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator was good but it drags on in parts, especially when Maximus isn't fighting. The battles are great and it is fun to see the suspense between Maximus and the Emperor when the Emperor finds out Maximus' true identity. This movie borrow's from the Conan the Barbarian idea about an oppressed man who fights the odds to become a king among men, and get revenge against the man (or men) who made the oppressed's life the way it is. (The trailer of the movie also borrow's Conan the Barbarian's theme score for the music.) A must see for fight fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid Best Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all of the awards and money that went to this movie, this movie is still not regarded very highly by the online movie community (usenet groups etc..).There are several reasons for this. One is that it was in contention for Best Picture against some extremely well made movies : "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" ; "Traffic". These are some really incredible movies as well. All three of the movies are deserving of the Best Picture Award. The two losing movies have since become cult classics in their own right, with a very strong following.Another reason that some have played it down is because it SO many Awards. The one that seemed to bother people the most was Russell Crowe's Best Actor Award. Many felt his role was simply physical, and not too difficult to portray.These are valid points in their own right. However, I have viewed "Gladiator" many times on cable. It is practically on every other day. With these viewings, I have noticed that the film has a great amount of staying power. There are many great performances in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is his best without a doubt.So many other elements (which it of course won awards for) will suck you into this movie again and again. I was never a fan of "Gladiator". Frankly, I liked "Traffic" better. However, I still find myself watching it when it is on - and every time I watch it there is something new that I like.I believe in 5-10 years many people who believe "Gladiator" didn't deserve all of the awards it garnished will also realize that you have to view "Gladiator" for what it is : a gigantic epic with an enormous amount of elements to be appreciated after many viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike many Hollywood blockbusters, the huge-budget special effects are justified. The Colosseum scenes are truly visceral, and it took a giant budget to really bring them to life.However, there's nothing in this movie that will enrich or edify you in any way, and it doesn't stand up to repeated viewing the way a top notch film would.Utterly undeserving (in contrast to "Spartacus" and "Ben Hur", both of which having uplifting messages and strong acting to go along with Roman period pic fun) of Oscars, but not a complete waste time, especially if you see it on the big screen, where some of the imagery will linger with you.(Some small spoilers follow).I will cite this irony in Gladiator's defense: Some of the 'cheesiest' parts of the film are also the closest to historically accurate. For instance, Joachim Phoenix's performance will constantly remind you that he's an actor 'playing Commodus.' The irony here is that by the best historical accounts, Phoenix nailed it; Commodus *was* an actor, playing himself. (Also, he did enter the gladiatorial contests, and was a complete lunatic).The wistful longing for the Republic was probably passe by the time of the passing of Marcus Aurelius (known as the last of the "Five Good Emperors"), but certainly something that had been a common sentiment in Rome for the first two centuries after Augustus (mostly due to the motley crew of idiots, lunatics and monsters who ruled immediately after him).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One big 'meh'...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ay, carumba... I was looking forward to this film, as I generally like these types of films, and I was thinking it would contain some epic qualities of action, intrigue, characterization, etc. However, this was one big 'meh', and I ended up regretting the time it took to watch over a few days during my lunch hour!The picture just wasn't very exciting or interesting. There was nothing in it that I didn't expect to happen as I watched it. The characters were predictably bland. Even the fight scenes were rather ho-hum. Just a lot of bashing and blood, which is probably what it really was like, but you know, in a film, you expect some more kind of essence or drama to it. The final fight between Maximus and Commodus? Who cared, by that point? There was very little artistry or drama to something that should have been quite a powerful confrontation... I agree with Roger Ebert's review that the look of it was very dark and bland and depressing, both visually and in terms of character.What's really baffling is how this was awarded best picture of the year, and Crowe as best actor, and that what's his name playing Commodus was even nominated for an Oscar! Yikes. I mean, I suppose it may have been a weak year, and you certainly can't count on the Best Picture being the 'best picture', but you expect it to at least have something significant to it. This had very, very little to it. I think of just two years ago, when the Best Pic noms were - Shakespeare in Love, Life is Beautiful, Saving Private Ryan, Elizabeth and Thin Red Line. Every one of those movies had so much more to them than this film does. It's almost ridiculous, the difference there. Not to mention others that weren't even nominated that year, like Truman Show and Gods and Monsters...Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix (that's his name!) were both rather unspectacular, mumbling their way through their lines like David Mamet's mock GREAT ACTOR would. (It's no wonder they were rewarded so!) They just didn't really cement themselves into those roles, particularly Phoenix. I can think of several others who could have done that part, and might have been more interesting. Then again, it could have been the direction, or the script, but his character actually seemed to have some of the more interesting things to say, so that probably rules that out. And it's not so much that Crowe was bad in the part, but it just wasn't that much of a part. He fights, he looks veangeful and sad, he mumbles a few lines, he fights some more, he longs for his family, fights some more... Not all that much to dig into, really. I haven't seen The Insider or A Beautiful Mind yet, but I must imagine that there's a lot more for him to have been 'best actor' for in those characters and films.There were some little things here and there that were alright, and some of the minor characters did well, but on the whole, a pretty big waste of time to watch...-EE-</fullReview>

The plot still doesn't satisfy me because you never become completely attached to Maximus. So, who the hell cares if he dies at the end?

This comming from the guy who did Blade Runner where NOTHING is so shiny.This, however, was enough to forgive. What made it harder to forgive was the fact that Russel Crowe has one single expression on his face in every frame and talks with a monotonous Ben Stine kind of voice throughout the show. When you have a lead doing nothing at all though the film, it makes you notice how your standards for B-FILMs are high.Ridley, if you read this... next-time you want to glamourize and sugar -coat a cliche.

Gladiator seemed amazing to me too after the first time I saw it. But after the 2nd or 3rd viewing, the only thing it had going for it were the action sequences(which were shot very confusingly, nice job Ridley).Anyway, I'll close by saying it didn't even deserve to be nominated for Best Picture, much less win. Steven Soderbergh's Traffic more than deserved the win for Best Picture. But it's not that big of a deal, the Academy lost all credibility when they picked Shakespeare In Love over Saving Private Ryan...</fullReview>

I didn't even find the special effects to be that great, they were often blurry and disjointed. Overall...the movie makes no real impact on me. It's a decent enough movie, certainly not great.

I just can't believe someone can change so much from artistic craftmanship to commercial fast mediocre production.All of his movies since 1492 has been merely average Hollywood productions, with solid scenery and photography I agree, but nothing more than Roland Joff or some other directors. And his movies then respected all of Holywood's codification, would it be for the music, the editing etc... CLICHES!! And Scott was almost forgotten by the cinephiles...With Gladiator, suddenly, Scott makes a "come-back", with a lot of advertising... Then what is it?Well, to me, it's the same Ridley Scott who made 1492.While Gladiator has a brillant photography, the poor psychology, the mediocre scenery and the bad editing turns the whole thing into an average peplum with lots of visual effects to compensate the lack of substance.Sure, some scenes are very good, Ridley has a lot of savoir-faire then is able to make some very good shots just because he's fundamentally talented.But I simply can't understand how so many people just can't see the vacuity of this film, and the mediocrity of its production!So my question to all the people who rated this film with reverential "10" is: Have you actually looked at it twice, and AFTER all the hype?</fullReview>

The music was out of the world but the rest just fade in oblivion. The biggest disappointment for me was the poor character sketching. Where are the complex characters? Throughout the movie every character is just a good guy or the bad guy. Black or white. Where are the shades of grey? those mysterious characters that elevate drama to the next stage.I would call this an average movie that has been over-rated because of the mediocrity that it surrounded itself with. Instead of Aussie Russell Crowe, watch his fellow A Mel Gibson in the classic "Braveheart" for a truly complex and heart-rending epic.An average 5 (mostly for the music and technical wizardy)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator was not a bad movie, but I must say that I was disappointed with it. Maybe my expectations were too high (hard to believe with most of the movies coming out now a days). But I came out of the movie feeling a bit ripped off.The acting was solid. Russell Crowe made a good brooding hero. But my main grievance with the movie would be the total lack of originality in the story. Basically change Maximus to a NY city cop, Rome to NY and the Emporer to a corrupt politician and you would have pretty much every other action film to come out of Hollywood. They billed it as a throw back to the epic Roman Empire era movies like a Sparticus or Ben Hur, but it just wasn't. Basically it was the same ole, same ole with some good acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched "Gladiator" the other day, and to be honest, it's not as great as I remember. Sure the fight scenes are great, but at some points it becomes boring and uninteresting. The acting is okay, except I found Joaquin Phoenix to get a bit annoying. It's not quite on the same level as "Braveheart". Watch that one instead. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Really Like Russell Crowe!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He is a truly skilled actor, very intense and dramatic, and his style is magnificent. I am starting to watch him in all of his movies, and he has made a true fan of me! His performance in Gladiator was exquisite. He was just so believable. His accent, though try as he may to mask it still projected itself into the movie and this I truly loved and found so fascinating about him. I love to hear this man speak. He does give a solid strong performance in this role. I have always been a fan of Oliver Reed and he will be missed. What a wonderful performer he has been and a wonderful addition to the ranks of all the wonderful actors their have been in hollywood. This movie is one that will be added to my collection. With the awesome good looks this man has, I am certain their are many plans to utilize him in many more projects to come. I look forward to see what is fresh and new in the coming time for Russell Crowe. Peace Sandy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After finally getting to see this film, I wondered what all the fuss was about. By the end I was bored to death by the trite story and corny dialogue. The special effects are terrible (as bad as any film of the 1950s about ancient Rome), and it is only saved somewhat by the fact that the actors (if a little camp) seemed to believe that this was real life. And who chose the terrible music that burdened the film with meaning it did not possess? Has anyone noticed that when millions of dollars are spent on a film (Titanic, Pearl Harbor, Gladiator), very little of that is channelled into the dialogue? In the end the only thing that holds these films together are the actors (not all, but usually just enough of them).As my parents used to say, they don't make films like they used to. Well, they do still make good films, but only if there is a very strict budget.So, thumbs down. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie a couple of times, and I still don't understand why so many people love it so much. I so wanted to love this movie, but I just don't get it. I really liked the authenticity of the sets and props and such, and the initial fight scene was very good, but the movie bored me to tears! Perhaps I just don't enjoy revenge fantasies. Anyway, I couldn't help watching this and thinking "Russell Crowe really deserved the Oscar for 'The Insider', not this piece of Hollywood pap." But the rest of my roommates absolutely love this movie, so maybe it's just me.I've got to file this movie under "Movies that were WAY too overhyped". I may have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been told how incredibly fantastic it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't believe this film won Best Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie winning best picture is an example of how corrupt the Academy Oscar Award system must be, even Russell Crowe should not have won best actor (or even have gotten nominated period). Tom Hank's performance in Cast Away was far better even if he has two oscars already and Cast Away itself wasn't that great. Don't get me wrong though I believe that Crowe is a good actor and I would have given him a nomination for his role in L.A. Confidential. Gladiator is a summer movie and that is all it was. This movie was incomplete and full of cliches, and then out of no where the film ends abruptly, with of course a show down between Crowe and Phoenix. I believe that Roger Ebert is a great critic, and have no problem with the rating he gave this film (one and a half stars), but I don't agree with how he rates certain films such as summer movies. When a filmmaker makes a film such as a summer movie they usually aren't going after best picture, they're more going after giving you a ride, and if this is the case you should critique the film on this basis, and not judge it as though it was meant to be some kind of masterpiece in the art of film, however even on this basis Gladiator still somewhat fails. I was given this film on DVD and I sold it without even watching it. In order for a film to be worthy of beset picture or even good, the film must be tied up and have no loose ends, all issues should be dealt with and after the movie being almost 3 hours it actually has no story. When I first (the only time I watched it) watched Gladiator I thought that there was going to be some kind of inventive story line and then out of no where the film turns into a senseless basher movie. And if the Academy is going to allow films like this to continue to get nominations, some other film festival should be deemed more prestigious. This kind of thing is just scary, the next thing you know Pearl Harbour will get a nomination or probably even win. Here's how it is, Gladiator is an alright (two stars) summer movie, but for a well made movie of Best picture quality watch something like Chocolat or Enemy at the Gates instead.PS. Just for the record, I have no problem with summer movies winning Best Picture as long as they're made properly, up to now the "Empire Strikes Back" is still my favourite film and I would have given it BP, and "Star Wars" also got a nomination because they were great and well made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-Hyped Hollywood Idiocy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything about Gladiator was completely *wrong*. Everything--every single thing about this movie--was handled in the wrong way. An excellent example is the gore and violence in this film--while the director made sure to include huge amounts of blood and guts in the fight scenes for no discernable reason, he weasled out in the one scene where such a graphic display might have made an emotional impact on the viewer (the murder of Maximus' wife and son). Why? Because it would have added a tiny smidgen of controversy to the film, and everyone knows that controversial films *never* get Oscars.And speaking of which, the number of Oscar nominations this film received is a joke, exceeded only by the number of Oscars it actually won. I'm not saying that Joaquin Phoenix and Russel Crowe aren't good actors it's just that they were given so little to work with that their lack of conviction was inevitable. I was especially surprised with Russel Crowe's victory over Geoffrey Rush, who I thought had given an exceptional performance in Quills.Well, at least Best Director went to Steven Soderbergh. Seeing that evil scowl on Ridley Scott's face when they presented the award almost made the whole rest of the evening worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a dud of a movie! Don't get me wrong. This movie had some amazing scenes, but I didn't think Russell Crowe's performance was anything spectacular (he was much better in "The Insider", and should've won best actor for that, but that's another story.) The story was too predictable. We've seen this epic type movie many times over, and quite frankly, it's hard to come up with new material...I understand that. But to totally rip off scenes from it's predecesors...what's up with that? I guess this movie just ranks up there with all of the other over-hyped movies (Titanic, There's Something About Mary, ANYTHING starring Julia Roberts!) To be honest, I thought that Gladiator was almost boring. There was not enough action to keep the movie rolling.As for Best Picture? I know that the Academy loves the epic, but there were a few movies in 2000 that deserved the awards more than Gladiator. (Almost Famous, Traffic, Crouching Tiger...) Overall, I guess I just expected more from this movie. I guess I just have friends who hype movies too much. Maybe I should tell them to shut up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I prefer Spartacus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film to be massively overhyped, and was unbearably derivative, particularly of Spartacus.Spartacus, on he other hand, is one of my all time favourite films. And given the immense similarities, I should have at least found Gladiator ntertaining. And I figured out why I didnt today - characters. Gladiator has none. Maximus the Gladiator is deliberately played by Crowe as a walking Zombie throughout the film, the Emperor is barking mad, and only Oliver Reed's part has any sort of substance, and even then is a carbon-copy of Peter Ustinov in Spartacus.And speaking of carbon-copies, the emperor bears a strong resemblance to John Hurt as Caligula in the classic tv series I, Claudius (incidentally, Derek Jacobi, Claudius in that series, crops up in a small role here). However, Hurt's character had far more depth and believabilitly, and most importantly, was better played.None of the other characters here really got anything to do, so that rules them out as well.At least the emperor was fairly enjoyable to watch. Joaquim Phoenix has a lot of potential, he should go far. And another thing. The score was dreadful. God knows why it sold so well. And God knows how come this film got so any Oscars. Russell Crowe as best actor? How difficult is it to look grim and stand still a lot? Dear oh dear.The best scene was the opening battle. That, at least, was brilliantly filmed and very powerful. If only the rest could have lived up to it.If you liked this, you should vastly prefer Spartacus and I, Claudius. If you havent seen this, dont bother and watch those instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have probably missed out on a good part of this film's appeal by only seeing it on video, which medium doesn't really preserve the grandeur of big battle scenes and scenic vistas. Still, I can't imagine the acting or dialogue would be much improved by seeing it in the theatre, and watching it at home allowed the viewing audience to guiltlessly engage in an ongoing game of Spot-The-Cliche. That interactivity and Joaquin Phoenix's OTT performance actually kept us more-or-less tuned in for the full two and a half hours, which puts this ahead of quite a few blockbusters and/or Oscar winners in my personal top ten thousand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown! As Shakespeare wrote -"Much ado about nothing!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was really quite silly. Blurry photography, and oh so obvious special effects (I think they should have asked for some of their money back, you could see the computer enhanced crowds, buildings etc. but maybe this matched the movie as everything was so damn obvious and excessive and fake). I liked Commodius (or whatever his name was) thought the Phoenix one played his role well, you could say he "rose above" the others. Russell Crowe was talking in a lower register (what this is supposed to be sexy?) and mumbling. Blood and guts and about as much feeling and emotion as a dead log. This really is Hollywood Big Budget gone mad. Give me good storyline and small budget any day. Just colour and movement. Much ado about nothin'. It seems a case of "The Emperor's New Clothes" the old children's fairy tale where cunning tailors fool the pompous Emperor that he is actually clothed in fine garments they have "made" when he is really naked. It takes a couple of children to laugh and "expose" the truth when the Emperor parades in his "birthday suit" Same thing here. Everyone is saying it's huge and fabulous so it must be true. It ain't. Rome wasn't built in a day and neither is a good movie. Hollywood quit the overblown effects and get back to the basics. A rivetting good story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Solid and honest acting, true to the character, with actors daring to put themselves on the line, and "real" settings - not computerland fakes! Gladiator Smadiator - there's something rotten with this Rome - and it sure as hell stinks!</fullReview>

The cinematography was great, and Joaquin Phoenix as the Caesar was excellent(which should have won him an Oscar), but of course Crowe won for an ok performance as best actor. The film was directed well by Scott, but our appeal to the characters was lacking as opposed to a similar Oscar winner in "Braveheart" in that it had a lot of violence but Gibson was wonderfully captivating where Crowe was again just ok. It seems like Oscar always tends to like a overly-produced epic know matter how good it is these days. I hope that it returns to simple storytelling for it's best picture winners (aka.

		<shortDescription>Worst "Best Picture Oscar" since "The Last Emporer"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just such a mess, that last year must have been a worse year for movies than I'd realized. That said, Traffic is head and shoulders in quality beyond this silly toga movie.There are little scenes in this movie that do not relate to ANYTHING - most notably, the scene near the end where someone puts a poisonous snake in a bed. The viewers are lead to believe that a certain traitor was being killed; the set-up about Cleopatra had been made in the previous scene. But nothing happens - the character is clearly alive later.The scenes involving war crib from the best - Rashoman and Henry V, with music stolen from Holsts' The Planets. The gladiator scenes steal from Spartacus (with more gore, of course; Spartacus, made over 40 years ago, is a vastly superior movie despite Tony Curtis' problems with acting). The Collesium scenes use many shots from Ben Hur.The performances are all over the place. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed (whose ruminations on death in the movie are all the more eerie since he died during the filming) are terrific. Russell Crowe is pretty good, but not great. His best scenes are during his general days early in the movie. But Juanquin Phoenix and, to a degree, Connie Nielsen feel like they are in a completely different movie.Some of the photography and most of the CGI work (except when they attempted to animate a tiger) is quite good. The animated tigers intercut with real tigers showed the CGI isn't perfect because the perspective is extremely flat when the animated tigers are used.This movie is an ambitious disappointment. It is very much like Ben Hur in that it has flashes of brilliance but is undercut by a surprisingly awkward script. On the whole, I'll take Ben Hur and Spartacus for great cinema about Rome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not worthy of Best Picture Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To tell you the truth, when I first saw this movie, I was kind of supprised that it was nominated for best picture. However, considering the years batch of movies, I can see why. 2000 had a lot of good movies, but only two of them (Traffic and Crouching Tiger) were worthy of winning best picture. Previous years have had movies of even higher calibur (American Beauty, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Forrest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption). If it wasn't for the ending I probably would have not even considered Gladiator for Best Picture at the Oscars. Gladiator is a movie with good acting, decent special effects, exciting gladiator scenes, and a solid, but a times drab screenplay. In certain parts of the movie the dialogue seems kind of cheesy, but these errors are not glaring. Those who are looking for an intelligent, mentally stimulating screenplay should look look elsewhere. However if you are willing to compromise a little, then Gladiator should not disappoint. Russell Crowe does give a solid performance, but I think his performance in last years drama The Insider was far superior. Crowe's vocal tone is good, but at times his New Zealander's accent seeps through in Gladiator. Joaquin Pheonix gives a Performance that just barely qualifies as worthy enough for an Oscar nomination. When compared to the other movies of this year, Gladiator's acting is on the level with Traffic, Crouching Tiger, Almost Famous, Erin Brockavich and various movies heavily considered by the academy for nomination. As far as screenplay goes, Gladiator gets smacked by movies such as Crouching Tiger, Traffic, and Almost Famous, among others. As far as the other categories go, Crouching Tiger's Cinematography and Traffic's film editing do more for their respective movies than did Gladiator's excellent sound and decent, but flawed visual effects. I would highly recommend this movie to just about anyone, but I'm afraid the Gold Guy for best picture should have gone elsewhere. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially, I didn't want to comment on ?Gladiator` at all, but now, as it won so many Oscars, I think I should:How could that happen?! How could Hollywood sink so low and nominate this monstrous combination of pure commercial thinking and perverse blood lust for twelve Academy Awards, especially Best Actor and Supporting Actor (???), Best Writing, Best Director, Best Music and ? Best Picture? Or is the Best Picture nomination only a result of the number of other nominations?It really hurts seeing how the American audience ignored the terrible way history is treated in Hollywood. Ridley Scott commercialized the Ancient Rome so obviously that one might believe he meant it ironically. But the movie is deadly serious (as is ?Oscar-winning actor` Russell Crowe who moves his face I think three times during the whole film!), so we are really supposed to believe that Maximus the Gladiator was Christian and hoped to meet his family again in the Hereafter. The whole story is so dumb that even eight-year old children should say they are too old for such nonsense.It is no argument pro Ridley Scott that he gave a second birth to the genre of the ?sandal movie`. The real Roman movies were historically more accurate, more intelligent and not so overloaded with glaring computer-animated visual backgrounds. Those were movies. ?Gladiator` is more like a videogame. An absolute disgrace happened on March 25th. It showed how poor in quality pictures the year 2000 was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No I am not entertained. I went to this movie expecting little and receiving less. I could single out certain individuals to point the finger at for this artistic failure of a film, but can't seem to see the point in it, this film was bad in so many areas that it really is a collaborative debacle. Even the general audience failed, because in accepting this film the standards for what will be honored as a great film have been lowered dramatically. The dialogue was stupid, the characters were completely overdrawn, the performances were typical, the plot was as formulaic as it gets, not one moment in this film left me anticipating the next, not one character was original or intriguing, and the cinematography was unimaginative and monotonous. On top of this they kill off Richard Harris the best actor in the film at the beginning of this movie which crawls on its belly to the end. To its credit the film does a decent job of creating the coliseum which unfortunately is not as impressive given the fact that Spartacus the original gladiator film was done four decades before this release and was just as successful if not more in this aspect. This film never comes close to achieving the success of similar films made long ago. At best Gladiator is a watered down flat derivative of Spartacus. The film is as dead as the time period it was supposed to depict, and perhaps just as dead is the general public's knowledge of a good film. As a side note when one asks why it is important to have an appreciation and understanding of history in regards to art or a lexicon in the language of film I can think of no better reason than 'without a perspective of a variety of great works one will never fully be able to appreciate or understand what a great work truly is.' In short this film lacked everything that constitutes a great film. What is that? Great filmmaking.</fullReview>

And as for the performance by Joauqin Phoenix, well to say he was overacting his role as a madman would be to insult the undisputed title holder of overacting madmen, the one, the only Brad Pitt.It's not bad, but how anybody could say that this is a better film than the simply sublime 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' proves how little taste there is in the world and how unfortunately good guys so often don't get what they deserve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointimus Maximus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is quite possibly one of the least rousing, most underwhelming films to ever win a Best Picture Oscar.This is the tale of Maximus (played with spirit by Russell Crowe in one of the film's few interesting performances), the Roman Empire's best general, who is betrayed by a vengeful emperor-to-be, and eventually enslaved to serve as a centerpiece for entertainment in the arenas of the gladiator. Robbed of his power as a citizen and a general, Maximus finds new power in the admiration of a crowd who adores him.The interesting premise for this film is poorly executed, plodding along for much of the exposition before getting to any real development in traditional Ridley Scott fashion. With the exception of Crowe, most of the other main performances are uninspiring, and in the case of Joaquin Phoenix, downright dreadful. Phoenix's characterization has as much bite and energy as flat week-old beer, and he creates a villain who is so textbook that he is not formidable in the least.The fight sequences are entertaining, but shot with such unsteadiness that we are robbed of seeing much of the action. The visual effects are surprisingly bad, looking inappropriately hazy and low-res, with many details ignored.All in all, Gladiator fails to entertain on many points, and stands, in my opinion, as the most egregiously overrated film in the history of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator isn't a great film by any means, but it isn't nearly as bad as some reviews would suggest. Sure, it depends mainly on big budget spectacle and production design to achieve its effect, but it's surprising how far big budget spectacle can take you.I disagree with those who say that Russell Crowe was more or less interchangeable with any other Hollywood action star in the main role. I thought his basic persona - the strong yet vulnerable man carrying deep hurts - was quite well used in this film, and his performance and Connie Nielsen's lent a semblance of human interest to a script that didn't give them much to work with. The film's ability to build human drama isn't helped by its failure to provide a credible villain: it's obvious from the beginning that Commodus is no more going to be a match for Maximus than Frank Burns was for Hawkeye and B.J.Some people have also criticized the film for its gratuitous violence, but I'm not sure if I go along with that either. If you are going to make a gladiator movie, you might as well go for broke. As a number of commentators have pointed out, we go to gladiator movies for pretty much the same reason as the Romans went to the Colosseum. To see blood.Having said all that, I don't think the film was particularly well made. The film seems if anything to get less spectacular as it goes along, and what should be a series of climactic sequences at the end come across as hurried and confused. There are also rather too many places where the film is unintentionally comic. There's the film's odd notion that the Roman ruling classes all spoke in upper-class British accents. Then there are what look like odd borrowings from, or maybe misplaced tributes to, other films: the American Beauty-style falling petals, or the slow-motion battle sequences, which looked elegiacal in Kurosawa but seem Pythonesque here. Actually, even Maximus' name struck me as Pythonesque - I kept wondering whether his first name was Naughtius, and whether he had a friend called Biggus. Perhaps Naughtius Maximus would be an apt nickname for Russell Crowe in real life.Once or twice the film does hint at higher ambitions. It touches on the theme of Commodus', Gracchus' and Maximus' relationships with the public, and the potential was there for the film to be a very original type of political thriller - something that would have given point to all those crowd scenes and all those power plays. But that theme isn't developed. In the end, Gladiator is not that kind of film.</fullReview>

I came out thinking it was nothing more than Death Wish B.C.It is brilliant technically with astonishing visuals, and it is competently directed for such a massive exercise. The performances are good too, adding a contemporary dimension. Crowe is commanding as are each of the supporting players. I do not think they will rate the same way 20 years from now they will get lost in the extravagence of the film.Gladiator probably ranks so high this year(2000) because everything else is pap. As usual there are stronger films in the indie and foreign circles, but if the mainstream dominates this could very well be the best picture......depressing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but a great one?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator", the movie favored to win the Oscar for Best Picture this coming March 25, is an epic movie that I found to be just good. I didn't think it was a great one like most people thought it was. Certainly not as great as "Ben-Hur" and "Spartacus", which "Gladiator" is no doubt inspired from. The good things about this movie are the two main performances by Russell Crowe (Maximus) and Joaquin Phoenix (Commodus), the action scenes in the Roman Colosseum, and the beautiful film score. All those elements get high marks. The cinematography, editing, and production design are very good as well. But if there's one element that keeps this movie from being a great film is the lackluster special effects. The effects aren't all that great here. Even though they're not bad at all times, there were some effect shots that looked obviously phony. That shouldn't happen in a film like this. Nevertheless, if you like historical epic movies, then you'll probably like "Gladiator". I was just a little disappointed that it wasn't the great film I thought it would be.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a cheap chocolate Easter Bunny: pretty package, but hollow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a scene in Gladiator where Maximus is eating with a couple other gladiators. One is Juba, the man he befriends almost immediately after getting captured; and the other is the really big man (I'll call him Big Guy), I am not sure of the name, who Maximus refused to fight earlier, while the gladiators were, I presume, getting evaluated on their skills. In the scene Big Guy asks Maximus about his days as being a general. He asks if he fought in Germania, and Maximus responds, and I apologize for not having the exact quote, "I've fought in lots of countries." Something to that effect. When the question was asked, I thought to myself how interesting it would be if Big Guy had lost family in Germania. When you think about it it was a terribly odd question for Big Guy to ask. It became a distraction. I kept waiting for the great climax of the film, when Rome is safe and secure with Maximus finally being able to retire, when along comes Big Guy to do what none of the Romans could do: kill Maximus. And why not, I figured. After all, there were families killed in Germania too, right. Unfortunately nothing came of it, and I don't think I am giving anything away when I say that Big Guy eventually gets shot with arrows (despite the obviously apparent safety vest underneath his tunic). O.k. So I am giving something away, but he is a very minor character, as it turned out.I only mention this delusion of mine because I think it says something about how hollow the script was, and what could have been. I mean, we had already been given a possible subplot during the "evaluation scene" when the two men give each other very serious looks, to put it mildly. I thought that this subplot would have given the film what it dearly lacked: something worth saying--perhaps a comment on violence in our society, how the brutality of war effects people on both sides of the battlefield. Frankly I would have liked to have had it happen. It would have made the experience much more enjoyable. Of course, the F/X still would have looked kind of cheesey, and the battle scenes would have been confusing and, quite frankly, poorly executed; but what a turn it would have made. Only a handful of people (possibly those who had long since gone bonkers) would have seen it coming. Instead of this we get nothing really. Just an especially brutal film that has nothing serious to say about anything.</fullReview>

Russell Crowe wasn't even that great in this movie, he only carried the monicker of 'Next big actor'; the Hollywood flavor of the month.So now, just like Titanic, it has road it success all the way to the Oscars and will probably win when other quality movies like Almost Famous, Wonder Boys and State and Main get snubbed.

		<shortDescription>fiction better than reality; the mindset of Rome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Warning: spoilers. Recently, a kind person out there notified me of an historical mistake in my previous commentary, pointing out to me that it was Lucius Verus who co-ruled with Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris' character in the film) and not Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). I have to thank that person, because to be honest, I have not read much about the later years of the Roman Empire in many years, and had forgotten many details concerning the end of the Pax Romana. Nonetheless, and I may be wrong about this as it comes off the top of my head, I do believe that Marcus Aurelius did in fact approve of the choice of his son Commodus, which was not the case in "Gladiator". But I have to say, in this matter, I prefer the fictional account of the events over the reality. And to me, "Gladiator" does capture the essence of a broader Roman history in microcosm. In particular I found it strikingly interesting that at one of the gladiating tournaments in the film, the commentator spoke of the ancient Roman enemy of mighty Carthage as something out of "hallowed antiquity"... it seems unbelievable to imagine that the Roman empire lasted nearly a thousand years, and its citizens would probably have never been able to imagine it ending (doesn't it LOOK in the film as though the colosseum was built to last forever? And they do call Rome "the Eternal City", after all) or that a dark age would follow, with a thousand more years of ignorance and illiteracy until our modern age. It's hard to imagine that by the time in which "Gladiator" takes place, the Punic wars against Carthage which they use to stage gladiator battles in "Gladiator" had been over for around four hundred years! It kind of puts it into perspective how short-lived our own modern era is thus far. And just how long will we prosper before our "empire" begins to decline? When I think of this and put myself in Marcus Aurelius' shoes, who, in "Gladiator", could foresee that under his son Commodus, the empire would be heading into disaster (it IS nice to think that Marcus Aurelius would have foreseen this), I can understand why he was so determined to choose Maximus as his successor in order to return Rome to a republic (arguably something better). "Gladiator" is on one level a satisfying film because it not only asks what might have been possible to save the Roman Empire from collapsing but tempts us with a possible answer! As it turned out, nothing could save Rome; though the strength of Maximus' character is such that you begin to believe that he can save Rome from itself. To sum it up: if you enjoy a thought-provoking film that will leave you with more questions long after the film is over, you'll enjoy "Gladiator".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator, though entertaining, is one of the most overrated movies of the year.The biggest problem with this movie is the direction during the battle and fight sequences. The camera is too close to the action. This closeness causes many problems. First of all, the close camera work during the fight scenes left me feeling cheated. The close camera work puts us into the action a little too much, and some of the fight sequences weren't as exciting as they could have been if there were a few wide shots put in there. This closeness also made the "special effects" of the Colosseum look hokey. The people siting in the nosebleed sections of the stadium looked fake (granted, they WERE computer generated, but shouldn't they at least appear real?).Other problems with this movie include cliches ("On my signal, unleash hell"), anachronisms (Maximus says something in Italian, though the language doesn't appear until much later) and historical inaccuracies (Marcus Aurelius didn't die that way the last time I checked)Other than that, this movie is an entertaining one. The acting is excellent, especially by Joaquin Phoenix as the evil twit Commodus. All in all, I would recommend this movie simply for entertainment purposes. As for Best Picture of the year...I think not.**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hindsight is 20/20 - and in the world of movies that is as true of surprise box office successes as it is of unexpected box office failures. Ridley Scott's `Gladiator' struck such a deep chord with spectacle-starved audiences this past summer that one tends to forget that the project itself was anything but a sure bet in its initial planning stages and that the studios and filmmakers who produced it took quite a financial gamble in bringing it to the screen.The good news is that `Gladiator' emerges as a respectable return to both a subject and a style of filmmaking long abandoned by Hollywood. Here is an epic tale filmed with the kind of sweep and scope not seen much since the passing of David Lean - though `Gladiator' doesn't even begin to approach in quality that director's greatest work. Still, this film offers any number of rewards even beyond its grand scale and epic vision. Although one doesn't naturally expect profound psychological insights from a film of this nature, `Gladiator' seems to be a bit more character-driven than most similar multimillion-dollar extravaganzas. Utilizing the same basic set of historical characters that were chronicled in the 1964 film `The Fall of the Roman Empire,' `Gladiator' manages to flesh out its principle figures in impressive and exciting ways. Richard Harris as the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius sets a very high bar at the outset of the film. Here is a man wearied by his many years spent spilling blood to keep his vast empire together who, as his death approaches, yearns to restore Rome to its basic philosophical roots as a peace-loving republic. Fearing that his amoral son Commodus will be constitutionally unable to fulfill this wish, Aurelius appoints his premiere general Maximus (Russell Crowe) as his successor. Commodus, when he is informed of this decision, does what every self-respecting candidate for Roman emperorship must do - he kills his father and orders the death of his nearest rival. But fate being what it is, Maximus is not quite ready at this point to bid a fond farewell to this mortal coil and he finds himself instead not only sold into slavery as a gladiator, but eventually earning a reputation as a crowd-pleasing fighter, his popularity far surpassing that of the emperor himself, much to the latter's eternal chagrin and frustration.The most fascinating character from a psychological point of view turns out in fact to be Commodus, whose innate weaknesses and insecurities serve as the underpinnings for his immoral behavior and actions. Joaquin Phoenix does a superb job capturing the many facets of this complex character, seething with petty jealousies as he blazes a path to his own destruction and the destruction of the once glorious empire. Unfortunately, Maximus as the hero fails to rivet our attention in quite the same way. Though Crowe brings an impressive physicality to his role as a reluctant killer, the writers don't seem to be able to fully flesh out the character in the same way that they do Commodus. We sympathize with Maximus' plight, but his internal motives occasionally seem too conventionally sentimental, particularly with that tiresome standard plot device - of seeing his loved ones slaughtered - that seems to be practically a requirement for reluctant hero characters. Maximus is just never all that convincing as a central figure. The late Oliver Reed delivers a dynamite performance as the ex-gladiator turned promoter but his quality of wry cynicism is unfortunately undercut by a final character turnabout that is strictly cornball Hollywood. And it is nice to see Derek Jacobi donning a toga again after all these years since "I, Claudius." (Another strange phenomenon: why does the penultimate image of the film replicate almost exactly the final shot from `West Side Story'? I merely observe and ask).Although it doesn't approach the subject directly, `Gladiator' does make oblique reference, in its basic imagery of the arena and the bloodthirsty audience contained therein, to the paradox inherent in a culture that prided itself on its `civilized temperament' while at the same time indulging itself in so clearly barbarous a form of entertainment. We are then struck by the fact that here we are in the beginning of the 21st Century finding our own adrenalin flowing at the very same sights - albeit with the comforting filter of make believe and fiction separating us from the ugly realities of the actual thing itself. Who can avoid noting the stunning similarity in tone and image between what we are seeing here and what we see when we sit down to watch a boxing match or the latest episode of WWF Smack Down? More than anything else, `Gladiator' becomes a bit of a mirror in which we see something of ourselves reflected (`Fight Club' did the same thing but in a more direct and intentional way). The excitement of the gladiatorial fight sequences only serves to draw us in and make us complicit in the very same brutality we find ourselves decrying intellectually. In many ways, Scott may be making a more profound comment than he realizes on a conscious level. For that aspect alone, `Gladiator' deserves to be seen.</fullReview>

The screenplay contains some horrible dialogue that even great actors can't make sound plausible. The acting is inconsistent. You have Russell Crowe playing it as some huge epic, Joaquin Phoenix horribly overacting, Richard Harris underacting- and no one seems to be acting in the same movie with each other. Then, look at the special effects- Ridley Scott makes the entire screen dark and blurry so you can't tell how crappy his effects are.

I had no idea what was going on during the battles most of the time and thus found myself getting more and more bored. The film definitely looked great, but the battle scenes were a bore because of the extreme closeups and quick cuts after quick cuts. Weren't the battles the main attraction?

		<fullReview>I was reticent about seeing this movie - I thought it was just going to be another slashem/hackem macho movie. But from the opening sequence in Germania to the end, I was caught up in the film completely. Russel Crowe was marvellous as a simple man who just wanted to do his job and go home. Joaquin Phoenix was vile and despicable as Commodus, but surprisingly sympathetic - one pitied as well as hated him. Derek Jacobi was a perfect touch for those of us who learned of the machinations of Roman politics with I, Claudius and Oliver Reed went out with a great performance. The initial battle portrays the domination of the Roman army perfectly. The combat sequences were the right balance of blood and skill but the director did not focus on gore in graphic slow-motion detail which would have bogged the movie down. Even the music was well done, although I think Mr. Zimmer should have acknowledged the influence of Holst's 'The Planets'. An excellent production altogether. I'll definitely purchase it when it's available.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is drivel. But it's kinda funny drivel, like when a five year old kid shows you a picture he drew, and its a terrible picture, but you laugh because it's cute that a five year old is proud of his terrible picture. Ridley Scott is the five year old in this case. Of this nearly 3 hour long film, I would say a good 20 minutes were landscape shots, with a poorly mixed musical chiming in to make them seem important. Speaking of the score, that battle theme music (again poorly mixed) is more than slightly reminiscent of Gustav Holst's famous "Mars". This film is derivative in so many ways that it hardly matters, but why didn't they just use that piece instead of paying some guy to imitate it? That opening battle scene was the most poorly filmed sequence of events I have seen in awhile. The cinematography is pretentious and irritating throughout the film. It's truly terrible, but it seems that everyone involved genuinely wants you to take it seriously. That makes for good camp at least. I would like to point out one irony. The film criticizes Commodus, and the Roman empire in general, for attaining wealth and power by providing trashy entertainment for an unintelligent mob, who love every minute of it. Well, Gladiator is certainly trashy entertainment, and judging from the user ratings, I'd say the mob loved every minute of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take "Spartacus" and subtract: beauty, heroism, intelligence, competent editing ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love ancient world epics. Before seeing "Gladiator" I didn't think it was possible to make one that isn't worth watching; and, indeed, Ridley Scott hasn't done so either, although he certainly seems to have tried, and his film certainly is bad. For a film set in Rome at its most magnificent there's remarkably little spectacle (and what little there is is largely computer-generated - appallingly). For a film so reliant on fighting the combat scenes are confusingly, ineptly, MORONICALLY, shot and edited. Scott's latest fascination is with triple-framing. Every moment of combat looks as if it was lit by a stroboscopic lamp. This, plus occluded angles of view, over-use of extreme telephoto lenses, and rapid, more or less random editing - all combine to make it next to impossible to tell what the hell's going on. How I miss the clean, clear spectacle of "Spartacus" or "Ben-Hur". The other thing I miss is a score by Alex North or (better still) Mikls Rzsa. Hans Zimmer's music (think of "Crimson Tide", but more minimalist, more new-agey, less tuneful) is horribly out of place (and just not very good); it combines with the stupid camera-work to make the whole film play like a music video - or a 154-minute trailer for something else.Well, not entirely. Every so often - not VERY often, mind you - some STORY coalesces out of the cinematic debris, and some grandeur rises above the digital fog. As I said: is it even POSSIBLE to make an ancient world epic in which this never happens? But such moments are rare, and usually undercut by some conceit of Scott's. They never last very long.I'm amused (I know people tend to say they're amused when they're really annoyed; okay, perhaps I'm also annoyed) by those who say that this is a story of simple heroism, unsuited for cynics. The reverse is true. If you're more cynical than I am you'll probably like the film better. Two instances:(1) When Lucilla meets Maximus in his cell, the latter has suddenly become the most cynical, world-weary, why-bother person on the planet; he refuses to so much as lift a finger to help Rome despite the fact that he has nothing to lose, and despite the fact that quest Lucilla offers him neatly coincides with everything he's been dreaming of for the past year or so. Where did THAT come from? I'm sure that one of the bullet points in "Screenwriting for Dummies" is: "make your hero a reluctant hero"; although I expect they go on to add, "but not reluctant to the point of selfish petulance".(2) Commodus threatens to kill Lucius unless Lucilla betrays all the good guys. Well and good. But then we cut IMMEDIATELY to shots of the consequences of Lucilla's betrayal, and it becomes clear that we were meant to infer that Lucilla would, of course, turn traitor - Scott didn't think it worthwhile to show us what Lucilla's response was. The possibility that she would make a sacrifice for the cause she knows to be right is not meant to even OCCUR to us. (And it's not as if her character is so clearly defined that we have any idea how she, in particular, will act. It's clearly meant to be a GENERAL LAW that nobody makes noble sacrifices.)The last point reminds me how poorly defined ALL the characters are. Some blame the acting, or the dialogue, for this, but there's nothing wrong with either: in fact, most of the lines are stirring - "corny", my foot - and impeccably delivered. The problem lies deeper. "Gladiator" has a disjointed, stitched-together script filmed by a director with no clear idea of what it was meant to be about.P.S.: Surprisingly many people, including professional critics who should know better, have exhumed the mouldering old chestnut about how bloody modern cinema is the modern equivalent of the Ancient World's bloody gladiatorial combat. Some even think that when Maximus cries out, "Are you not entertained?", he's talking to us. Well, Scott's film is stupid in many ways, but this isn't one of them. Cinema is FICTION: it wouldn't appeal to us if it weren't. Gladiatorial combat was REAL: it wouldn't have appealed to the ancients if it weren't. Modern sport, and modern documentaries, are much closer to being modern equivalents of gladiatorial combat; but why suppose there IS a modern equivalent?</fullReview>

The adversities of the winter in Germania's hinterland and its barbarous inhabitants are displayed very realistically. This breathtaking effort will not be surpassed for decades to come. But afterwards??? It seems like Ridley Scott's work was done. The computer took over - a big mistake. Digital Rome, digital Forum, digital Colosseum, even digital people - so obvious, that the film becomes more and more similar to an "Asterix"-Cartoon. The plot... well, what plot?? It disappeared somewhere between two fighting scenes. And another very disturbing thing about GLADIATOR is, that every single line is spoken in such an over-significant way, that it could be as well the final line of the movie. Every time I thought: "No line can outdo this superb quotation". But it goes on and on and on... There's more to a good movie than exceptional fighting-sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OLD HOLLYWOOD MEETS NEW HOLLYWOOD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great thing about GLADIATOR is the way in which the film combines elements of the classic Hollywood epic with a modern style. It is both respectful of the tradition to which it belongs, and bold enough to step in a new direction. It is not simply a remake of FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE (though outwardly the story is virtually the same), but a combination of all the great Roman epics that graced the screen during the fifties and sixties. You have the gladiator school from SPARTACUS, the horrors of the Colosseum from QUO VADIS, the burning conflict between two former allies from BEN HUR, and countless other references to what we have seen before. But, as well as being an example of solid golden Hollywood storytelling the film is stylistically very much of the age. The epic as a genre invariably stretched the scope of film-making, being at the forefront of the latest technical innovations -be they in colour development, sound, format (eg. CinemaScope) or, as with GLADIATOR, computer-generated imagery. But at the heart of any epic is the conflict between (usually) two opposing forces, represented by two characters. And no matter how fine the effects, the art direction and the staging, it is this conflict that must grab our attention. In GLADIATOR, the characters of Commodus and Maximus represent the two opposing forces of insecurity and stability. The dynamics of this conflict, so wonderfully presented by Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe, are classical in form, though with many ambiguities and cadences that make their conflict far more than a simple battle between good and bad. It is in this aspect that GLADIATOR takes a bold step in using classic Hollywood tradition (goodie versus baddie) to unravel and show the complexities of its characters and their dilemmas. This is a successful strategy because the film holds our interest throughout because of the psychology of the protagonists as much as the grandeur of the staging. Simply big is never enough -there has to be a very identifiable human conflict for the film to be personal too. GLADIATOR is both epic and personal.The film boasts a number of fine performances. Carrying on the Hollywood convention of having English actors play Romans is an echo of past epics -a reverent ploy. Joaquin Phoenix, though American, speaks with a British accent too ..Roman emporers in Hollywood films invariably did so! Such details give a sense of nostalgia, or at least recognition -always a key factor in genre films. Another example of genre convention is the "bad but loveable" supporting character, in this case played by Oliver Reed. He is an instant reminder of the sheikh in BEN HUR or Peter Ustinov's character in SPARTACUS, and serves the same purpose.The effects are fortunately never allowed to get before the conflict of the story, but one cannot write about GLADIATOR without mentioning them. I have always been sceptical of computer generated imagery, and I think there is still some way to go before I believe "totally" what I see on screen, but GLADIATOR shows a historical accuracy both in the battle scenes and in those in the Colosseum, which can only be commended. I only wish the film had been made and presented in 70mm, for if ever a picture in recent years demanded it, then it was this.</fullReview>

We went to see Gladiator because it was so highly rated (8.4!) by the participants in this great website (IMDb) and because we wanted to see Meg Ryan's new love, Russell Crowe, in the starring role for which he has won praise for his acting. Because of the length of the movie, we came away wanting less. Save it for a rainy day and video when you have a lot of time to kill. (But you better have a big t.v. screen so you can appreciate the action). We rated Gladiator as a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical Baloney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who may care : this movie is historical baloney, pure and simple. It is true that, in the late 2nd century of our era, there was a wise Roman philosopher-emperor named Marcus Aurelius whom the unfortunate circumstances of his time forced to wage incessant wars on Germanic tribes and that, after his death, near the front, he was succeeded by his son Commodus, a madman who fancied himself the incarnation of Hercules and often performed in the arena. But the connection stops there, and that is a pity, for the true facts of Commodus? reign, which lasted some 15 years (A.D. 177-192), would probably have made a much better story than what we have here.As for Maximus, he is a pure invention. The only character by that name in that period of Roman imperial history is the young son and heir of the short-lived emperor Maximinus Thrax (A.D. 235-238). There are, it is true, some similarities between the career of that Maximinus and that the fictional Maximus, for Maximinus was both some kind of a muscle-man and a good general, who won many victories on the German front. However, when you read more about him, you also find out that he was also a brutal tyrant who enjoyed killing large number of people, when he was not busy dispatching bulls with his bare hands - his favourite past-time... (I could never quite understand why Hollywood feels the need to change the facts of history when they are so sensational!)Tons of money were poured into the making of GLADIATOR, and one wishes that the producers would have made better use of those resources. The sets are impressive, but hardly accurate - except for the reconstruction of the Colosseum, which corresponds more or less to the current scholarly consensus on what that extraordinary building looked like. (Notice the awnings on the top-tier. Their purpose was to provide shade to the audience. It is only recently that scholars have begun to work out the complex details of their structure and operation.) But the Roman skyline, full of elegant fluted domes, is all wrong. That is the skyline of SEVENTEENTH CENTURY Rome, as rebuilt by the Renaissance popes and their successors. In ancient Rome, the only large domed building was the Pantheon, which survives, and it did not at all look like that. Also, as anyone who has been there will tell you, Rome is located in hilly, not mountainous, country.They also botched their Marcus Aurelius. Richard Harris is a fine actor, but a bit old for the part and there is a big problem with his hair, which is long and straight, whereas the hair of Marcus Aurelius, whose features immortalized on his coins are familiar to anyone who knows anything about Roman history, was short and curly. That may sound like an insignificant detail, but it would be like making a film of the life of Adolf Hitler and forget the moustache... For a spitting image of Marcus Aurelius, check Alec Guinness in THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.In my opinion, the best, and perhaps only true good, moment in GLADIATOR is the impressive opening sequence, a graphic illustration of the kind of ruthless and savage campaigns which the Roman emperors of the period had to wage over and over again to stem the barbarian tide on their Danubian border.The rest of the movie is only slightly better than mediocre, with Derek Jacobi looking like if he were a guilty man, very embarrassed to be there and very anxious to take his money and run. I am sure that many people will disagree with that harsh assessment, for this film has clearly been designed as an audience-pleaser.To those interested in more than well-packaged trash, I suggest to go to the nearest video store and rent a copy of Stanley Kubrick?s SPARTACUS, a vastly superior gladiator film, and one that will give you a remarkably accurate sense of the greatness that was Rome, an eternal thought in the mind of God?.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like GLADIATOR, I really did. My sister said it was a great movie, and I really wanted to please my sister. But I can't, you see, because GLADIATOR is not a great movie. In fact, GLADIATOR is not even a particularly good movie.GLADIATOR is ineptly directed by Ridley Scott; no two ways about it. What else can explain keeping scenes in which the otherwise competent Russell Crowe lets his Australian accent slip through? What else Can explain allowing leading lady Connie Nielson sleepwalk through her performance for two thirds of the Movie? What else can explain carefully crafting a subplot involving a German Shepherd dog, then abruptly dropping it? The ineptitude goes on and on. The lack of chemistry between Crowe and Nielson is bad enough without further undercutting it with obtrusive, inappropriate music in early key scenes. High- and low-key cinematography is intermixed without any concern for dramatic appropriateness. It is almost as though Scott said, `Cloudy day? No problem, the audience won't notice.' And lets talk about this cinematography. Many of the low-key interiors with Joaqin Phoenix and Connie Nielson are so poorly lit, you cannot see Phoenix's eyes! Poor Phoenix, probably the least experienced of the leads, has the toughest role. Despite what you may hear, Phoenix does pretty well, despite Scott's undercutting. ACTION FANS BE WARNED. Scott shoots ALL the action scenes without benefit of long shot (for perspective) and with computer generated and slow-motion action. Think widescreen movie being shown in television (3:4) format. Expect to be more confused than entertained.There IS plenty to like in GLADIATOR. The late Oliver Reed as the gladiator owner is magnificent. Richard Harris is very good as Marcus Aurelius. Djimon Hounsu, Derek Jacobi, David Schofield, Sven Ole-Thorsen and, especially, Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) are all fine in supporting roles. Savor them if you must see GLADIATOR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As his character commands legions, does Russel Crowe command his audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a spectacular historical drama such as Gladiator, the acting must be on the same scale or the whole thing becomes comical. Russel Crowe brings brings a style that portrayed a character of heroic proportions while at the same time making him accessible to the average person. Crowe has a approach to this role, as he did in "The Insiders" that shows the human foibles of his characters without making them look weak or pathetic, but rather human and vulnerable. This makes the character look all the more heroic in their pursuit of the quest, their meeting of the challenge. A hero is all the more appealing when he disposes of a truly despicable adversary. Meeting the challenge to provide the evil, in this tale of good over evil, is Joaquin Phoenix. This guy gave us a totally corrupt and spineless adversary from frame one. Playing the power hungry, selfish, insecure, lying and witless, son of the Emperor, who kills his own father to gain power and then tries to seduce his own sister to satisfy his warped desires, Joaguin succeeds handily at turning the audience to the side of the out manned and helpless hero. All of this played out on the stage and setting of ancient Roman Empire. The action scenes were spectacular and well thought out. The costuming was interesting, but I think not accurate historically. Except for a couple of incidences of scenery players, guards and line soldiers, chewing gum, I felt that Director Ridly Scott did a good job of taking us back to a time when there was only one ball game in town, The Roman Empire. It reminds us that while world conflict takes nasty turns and is fraught with danger from the unknown and unknowable, it is equally dangerous to put all of the power into the hands of the few for the convenience of peace.</fullReview>

Proves to me that hype is mighty. Certainly will not watch on Video.

		<shortDescription>A great big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film extremely disappointing. Maybe it is wrong to make comparisons but if put besides Ben Hur or Sparticus, this had a distinct lack of narrative power, interesting characters, heart or intellectual meaning. I personally did not care about Maximus ? a man with the minimus of personality ? or indeed about any of the barely sketched figures which people the film. I also found Ridley Scott's visual style contemptuous. He does not seem the least bit concerned about making images with meaning or power but merely illustrates the script with pretty, overly crowded pictures. Most of it looked like an expensive advert. I kept expecting the actors to climb into a bath and eat a flake, or a new model of car to drive by, or the gladiators to run round the stadium in adidas trainers! With the exception of Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed, the actors (especially the wildly overrated Joachim Pheonix) were not up to the job, the script lurched from one meaningless event to another and the human interest was zero. I simply cannot understand why people have fallen for this drivel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hmmmm... well, not the worst film I have seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I dunno. I was really excited about going to see Scott's new film, I am a big fan of his work. Also, I did part of my undergraduate degree in Ancient History and find Marcus Aureliuz and his reasons for appointing Commodus to be very interesting. However, I am not one of those picky historians who needs to have every little detail correct. I realize that film is a fictional medium and accept fully that it will NOT represent historical events accurately, but will alter them to fit the dramatic needs of the story (no one criticizes Shakespeare for doing the same thing, so why attack others). Hence, I will not dwell on historical inaccuracies... there were a few, but they did not impact my appreciation of the film.*Regardless of any of these things, the movies just wasn't that good. The characters were not particularly engaging and the battle scenes were so staged that there was little, if any, serious tension. I am not really sure what this is, but Gladiator was simply not very exciting. Aside from this, the plot was not really germaine to anything that happened in the film. The characters were sort of placed into the film without any real sense of context for their actions or motivations. The individual stories that were being told within the movie were not particularly interesting nor did they serve to advance the main plot significantly. None of this would have been a problem if there had been more action, or more emotion or more... well, something.The acting was good, but the dialogue and story were so generic and dull that this really could not save the film overall. Richard Harris was good, but underused. Joaquin Phoenix was fine, but really wasn't given much to do. Most of the supporting characters were far too one dimensional to allow the actors to shine through.Essentially, this film did all of the things wrong that Braveheart did right (another historically innacurrate, but far superior film) and suffered because of it. It is truly unfortunate, because I have a certain love for historical dramas when done well (I even liked Titanic), hopefully Mel Gibson will save the genre once again with The Patriot.* Well, there was one that bothered me a bit, the film attempted to end on an up note, but if I remember my Roman history, the death of Commodus lead to a century of civil war and destruction. This leads me to question Scott's choice of time and historical characters. A similar film could have been set much earlier, dealing with Nero or Caligula and been more consistent with historical events... oh well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a silent movie "Gladiator" would be a milestone. A great photography and very good action scenes turn it into a visual experience. But dialogues and story are a complete loss. Only cliches and kitsch: Honourable warriors vs. corrupt senators; a father complex with greetings from Sigmund Freud and - as the highlight of kitschy boredom - Russell Crowe as the humourless super hero Maximus, who finally dies after giving a lecture. "Gladiator" and it`s characters are nothing else but a cinematic comic. The exception is Joaquin Phoenix as Commudus. The malicious emperor is the only interesting character. Such a pity that he does not win. The movie shows the technical opportunities to wake this genre again. But "Gladiator" is a sandal movie - a shoddy effort. T</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why all that praise???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie last night and must say it could have been worse. The recreation of the antic Rome was a great job. That's what I liked about the movie. But the story????????? I don't know. When I heard about the movie I didn't want to see it at the movies but thought I would maybe rent it when it came out on video. But my friend asked me to join him so I did.The first 30 minutes are really bad and I wanted to leave the theater. I am just not the kind of person who pays full price for a movie that is one big slaughter. I think it was very violent and where is the thrill when two people fight each other and many persons die? The movie did however get better when Russell Crowe got to Rome. Not good, but better. At least I was willing to sit through this to the end. The whole time I had 1 question: why all that praise? The critics love it and many viewers too. I can't see why. But I am not into those historical epics anyway. The actors were okay. Russell Crowe can be a good actor but this part was just boring. Joaquin Phoenix was so wonderful in Return To Paradise with Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn. That movie should actually get all that praise, it's very good. He still gave a good performance in Gladiator. Overall, it was okay because it got better when Russell came to Rome and there are beautiful pictures in this movie. But don't bother to wait until it comes out on video or they show it on TV. I rate it 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At least it was better than that 13th Warrior "movie" that came out last year... it's actually quite entertaining at time, but Gladiator is much too sloppy it seat itself on the top 100 list!Beginning with a badly edited battle scene (what's with all the close-ups of swords clinging and such... I can't tell what the hell's going on!) and a cameo by an very, very old-looking Richard Harris, Gladiator finally shifts into high-gear when the guy starts to do his Gladiator-thing. The problem is that it takes too long to get there, and when the film's there they ruin it with ye standard old "revenge" plot - basically the same thing that brought down THE CROW.Russel Crow is wooden, but there's some good supporting performances by Oliver Reed (his last performance), Derek Jakobi, and even a small role for seldom-seen actor David Hemmings (from HEROIN BUSTERS, DEEP RED, and SWINDLE) as a wig-wearing ring announcer. Ridley Scott's "dark" Alien/Blade Runner moody photography is out of place in the many interior and (in one case) exterior shots of Rome... which looks a bit too Computer Graphicky to buy. The high points come with the gladiatorial combat, which looks good and has some decent ideas and bloodletting, but is confusingly shot and edited. One thing I really didn't like was Joaquin Phoenix as the whiney bad guy... how would he have intimidated anybody? The ending is highly unplausable, not to mention historically inaccurate. It's enjoyable at times, but is an overall groan-inducing experience. Not Scott's worst work, though not his best either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie, not a great movie. Better to see on the big screen, and it is worth the 8.50 I paid for. I am a follower of history, and when I entered the movie line for the film I hoped this would not turn into a either or hollywood or politically correct film, in order to have a believable script. It did, the story was a little hollywood, but gave a good description of the brutality, and views of the time. I will not spoil the story, but it is sort of out a Shakespearian play, with revenge being the main motivator in the story line. This give you a good feel for the brutality of the time, and the sort of honor that follows this hypocrisy. A good epic. The budget was big enough to make this a believable epic, and the action is done with perfection. It's nice to see lesser name actors in films these day, because it give you bigger over all budget for the film instead of watching some one get payed 30 million and it hurts the rest of the film. The film wasn't too long either, and that is good considering how long it was. I gave it a 7 maybe, because it didn't grab me, but if I watch it another time I will probably like it more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this is when you wish you could rent just the highlights of the movies... Most of the action scenes were really cool even though not entirely original, but the story was boring. The movie had nothing important to say, so I don't understand why we were forced to sit and watch many endless dialogue scenes that led nowhere while we waited for Maximus to kill someone else. Best part of the movie was the opening battle where there was real "setting up the mood" scenes to delay us from seeing a visually enticing battle. The only action scene I didn't like was where he fought the fat guy with the tigers... OK let me explain! Maximus killed about 8 guys in 20 seconds in one the earlier matches with incredible speed and skill.. but when he fights this overweight, slow, old pushover Maximus was moving as slow as molasses.. and no one could just shrug off a tiger that has jumped on your back!!By the last few blows I was ready to move on but then I realized what I was moving on to.. MORE BORING DIALOGUE THAT LEADS NOWHERE! I gave it a 5 out of 10 and I think that's generous!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the year's highlights?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie not plugged for mass hysteria and advancements of special effects that seem to occur with every movie released promising unique and original experiences is literally a must-see. Although the film currently co-incides with the release of "Mission Impossible 2", this is definitely the more intelligible and less senseless of the two. "Gladiator" proves that an epic can be good, produced on a massive scale and not run over three hours. Sometimes two and a half hours however, is still not enough to finish a large popcorn and drink.One of the most noticeable elements of the film is its breathtaking cinematography, much of it possible by the special effects and beautiful European locations, not reliant on exploding helicopters, let alone the flaming city of the Rome. Spectacular battle sequences, a glimpse into an interpretation of the afterlife and even the employment of the simple slow motion technique provide handsome treats for the eyes.Russell Crowe is the general turned slave, turned gladiator, turned risen hero, turned Hollywood star. His rugged, reluctant performance is naturally the centrepiece of the movie, although almost the entire cast turns in good performances, enhanced by an above average screenplay.The only disappointing performance is from Joaquain Phoenix, whose pompous Commodus evokes a road company Peter Ustinov as Emperor Nero from "Quo Vadis", only no one will be handing any Academy Award nominations or nods of any sort to him. In terms of the possible bouquets handed out to "Gladiator", come February 2001, it looks like the film will be receiving a whole lot of them. "Gladiator" evokes the classic epics of the Golden Era, "Ben-Hur", "Spartacus" and the definitive biblical epic, "Quo Vadis." Although the latter was filmed under more strained, theatrical-like conditions now almost fifty years ago, "Gladiator" is reminiscent of the film, albeit a more attractive looking one. Its plot line even seems to be similar, Ancient Rome, corrupt authorities, handsome hero falling for the forbidden fruit...a woman, even if Crowe's has a sense of partial fidelity amid faith and personal devastation. The success of "Gladiator" has been enjoyed, primarily because the current generation has yet to see such a grand, lavish epic. Since I am fifteen, I can truthfully state this is the only large scale, true historical epic I have ever seen, made in the current day. Since there's enough historical accuracy, heroes, special effects and gory battle violent sequences, which insures box office and something for everyone, there's enough in this film to convince me that, for now, Hollywood may be capable once again of occasionally making films like they used to.

I really hated it in the first hour of the film when he came in the picture, his acting was really horrible. But, the last 40 minutes he did a better job. The fightscenes were the best I've ever seen and I never did feel bored during the movie. I was pleased that in the movie the fightscenes didn't play a leading role. The story was excellent but a bit clich at the end. It wasn't that hard to find out how it was going to end. The film's score was good, but not the whole time, but that's I think a matter of taste. I hope Russell Crowe will get an Oscar and that this movie will be nominated a lot of times. Great!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing compared to Ben Hur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the first trailer of this movie I was excited. I always was a fan of the epic movies of the fifties and sixties and of ancient Rome too. I also adore "Alien" and "Bladerunner" (but who doesnt?) so I expected a great, spectacular movie. I should have known better. Ridley Scott hasnt made a really good movie since the early nineties and so "Gladiator" is a I-wanna-be-an-epic-film-but-am-only-a-plain-popcorn-movie. I just cant believe how any one dares to compare it with classic epics like "Ben Hur", "Spartacus" or even "Quo Vadis?". OK it could be pretty good entertainment to the average audience but its a torture to viewers with knowledge of ancient Rome. The fifties and sixties epics werent completely authentic either, Ustinov was an outstanding Nero, but Nero didnt burn Rome. But they managed to recreate the atmosphere of the Roman Empire. "Gladiator" doesnt! This movie is located in some historic fantasyland. Take the cinematographic style of "1492" add battlescenes from both "Braveheart" and "Saving Private Ryan", a plot from "The Fall of the Roman Empire" and a gladiator school and fight scenes from "The Gladiators" and "Spartacus" even a little bit of "Star Wars" and you get "Gladiator". Sometimes such mixtures of well-known elements and images work out see "Star Wars". But although this movie lacks innovative ideas it features nearly every known clich and is absolutely unrealistic concerning historic accuracy. Of course nearly no historic movie (see above) is completely accurate, but none of the epics of the past (leave out the trash from Italy or Spain) ignored history like "Gladiator" does. It starts right in the beginning. The roman legions fight a germanic tribe to conquer its land. Completely wrong! During the reign of Marc Aurel the Romans fought desperately though still successfully to keep the germanic tribes away from their borders. They did NOT fight to conquer Germania, they didnt conquer any new german territories after their defeat in the Teutoburg Forest battle more than a century ago. The germanic warriors shown are pure fiction, nothing is correct, not their appearance or their weapons or the tactics they use (in the movie they have none!) The battle is completely unrealistic beginning with the battlefield in the midst of a forest, the romans avoided forest battles. The roman forces used ballistas at sea or at sieges but not in field battles. Instead of arrows they threw their pilums and then fought with their swords. The roman army was infantry since the late days of the republic and had no own cavalry, they only hired cavalry from allied tribes. A roman general who was respected by his soldiers that strong could never have been arrested this easily without the risk of revolting troops. Maximus would have cremated his dead family (romans didnt bury their dead) and why on earth was Maximus captured and enslaved at his burned homestead (Hello George!) and brought to what, Morocco? He was a roman citizen and at least when he was identified in the collisseum he would have had to be released from his illegal slavery. The gladiators costumes were more like "Excalibur" a pure fantasy design. The CGI-made rome is more like L.A. 2019 from "Bladerunner". Totally unrealistic architecture, with the exception of the collisseum itself, not to mention the cityplan. And the dark, faded-out CGIs of the city werent very convincing either and surely they didnt impress me they just looked like a big videogame. Of course Commodus arrival in Rome was impressive and by the way looked like Riefenstahls "Triumph of the Will" (or like the Massassi Throne Room George?) but it would have needed nothing less than the entire roman army to fill this fictitious monumental plaza . The dark, sombre, windy palace was more like a medieval castle and didnt create at all the atmosphere of a roman setting. I dont want to say to much about the absolutely nonsense concerning the "political" background of the "plot" ("Fall of the roman empire" wasnt that accurate too) but Marc Aurel wasnt murdered, but Commodus was, after a 12 year reign of terror. There were no intentions at all to restore the "Old Republic" instead of the Empire (sorry George no violation of a "Star Wars" trademark intended) and the pseudo-democratic message in the end of the movie just hurts with its forced pathetic atmosphere. All of these mistakes (I left out a lot more, especially considering religion) could have been ignored if the movie would have what I call "magic". But it hasnt, it lacks atmosphere, good cinematography (not ONE good shot of Rome!) and a convincing plot. It has some good actors, but Russell Crowe is no Charlton Heston, Joaquin Phoenix is no Ustinov and Harris is no Alec Guiness. Finally Hans Zimmers soundtrack is a mere desaster in a mediocre movie, an uninspired pseudo-vangelis music-jam from several non-roman cultures (why did he use HEBREW chants in the end of the movie?) without any regognizable or memorable leitmotives which doesnt fit at all to the roman background. Hans Zimmer is definitely no Rosza! I know to most viewers I am a pedantic old-fashioned (although Im only 31) nit-picker but I was shocked to see this lame and overhyped movie in the Top 250ies of the IMDB. When I came home it was past midnight but I had to watch "Quo Vadis" immediately as an antidot to the disappointing movie I had just experienced.4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've always got to review a movie based on what it set out to do. Gladiator set out to be a grand, summer movie, action set piece. And it did that. Masterfully. And most glorious of all, it didn't make you feel guilty for enjoying it. The plot was thin but it was solid. Everything that took place happened for a distinct reason that was in context with the time period and the characters. The characters themselves were written archetypically. Maximus is the unflawed hero, Commodus is the sniveling villain, Proximo is the scoundrel with a heart of gold etc, but the performances took all of them to another level and made you care. Russel Crowe in particular is a master of doing just that. Give that boy a clich, and he will beat it into submission. And he will do it sexily, which doesn't hurt. The action scenes are big and exciting but never unbelievable or embarrassing. To grade Gladiator as an extremely serious, epic film in the same mold as say, Spartacus, is a bit unfair. It is a summer action movie, but it is a smart, well done, and exciting summer action movie that thrills its audience without playing down to them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally, when I comment on a movie, it is to encourage someone to see some little "gem" that I think was overlooked. This time, I'm going against the grain. I didn't HATE Gladiator; the production values were great, the directing good --- I guess it was mostly the story, and (believe it or not) the acting that I take exception to. In my summary, I called it "Titanic in a Coliseum", and I wasn't kidding. I found Titanic to be an okay, but overlong movie. That's how I found Gladiator. Actually, it wasn't tremendously long...but about three-quarters of the way through, I found myself glancing at my watch. I simply didn't empathize with Crowe's character...I found too many thing ways way too under-explained (like his becoming a slave...no spoiler, they tell you that much in the trailers), and I also didn't find many of the supporting characters particularly charming me. All in all, I'm probably one of only three or four guys in all of North America who didn't love the movie. But again, let me make it clear...I didn't hate it. It simply didn't ring my chimes. The plotting was murky at crucial points, the sound track too "Titanic-y" (that soft, ethereal music just didn't cut it for me), Russell Crowe simply didn't impress me all that much, and neither did most of the other stars of the show. Sorry. Not a thumbs down, but I won't be rushing out to buy a copy.</fullReview>

I was right. The plot is weak and very unoriginal. Everything about the plot wreaks of banality, since there are no original ideas introduced into this film.I find Russell Crowe a good actor - believable, and able to provoke sympathy. This film provides a lot of star status, but little acting potential, besides the disgusted looks when he gores someone with a spear, or the moments of pain when he finds his wife and child murdered.Commodus is a completely overplayed villain. The film tries so hard to make him seem evil (using all the bad-guy tactics) that it just gets old.Special effects were mediocre, although they were hard to discern due to the poor lighting throughout the movie. Rather than be given a chance to appreciate some of the tactics and maneuvers of the gladiators, we were thrown into a jumble of random fights that did nothing but confuse.How this movie can be given an average vote of 8.5 on IMDB is unbelievable. I suggest that those voting actually watch the movie rather than marvelingat the blood and armor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So this is how I start my summer movie bonanza. Looking forward to Russel and a good story and some big budget action to produce serious eye candy.How disapointed I was soon to be. Gladiator is an unfortunate rehash of the same ole good guy revenges against evil and of course it's ALWAYS the evil one's love interest that is in love with the good guy. This movie falls into that same ole trap, and none of the actors and actresses have anything to work with. Everyone seems fine, Crowe who is normaly dynamic and plays interesting characters is uninteresting cause his character is the same banal hero in every BAD revenge movie out there. Joaquin Phoenix as Commudus is ok he seems like the only person in the film who looks like a Roman but he's BORING. It's not that they are bad, it's that their characters are so stereotypical and bleak that there's nothing interesting about them. And then of course it plays into that HOPELESS cliche when the weak evil guy we all know how pathetic he is, will try to defeat the hero in a battle we know he will loose. WHY??? cause he's a looser. Gee couldn't figure that out..So then I would think at LEAST there'd be some good action in this picture.. Wrong again.. Sure some of the battle scenes are neat, but I found them boring and they were hampered by the BIGGEST complaint I have with this picture. This film was SOOOOOOOOO darkly shot that I could barely even make out the characters faces. There is nothing wrong with this effect but it was used so poorly here that the fight scenes were chaotic and blurry (I found my eyes jumping all over the first battle scene), to the simple dialogue scenes where I could barely see even the characters eyeballs. Historical inacuracies?? Probably several, do I care? No. I went to this film for the entertainment value and it didn't even give me that! DisapointingRating 4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it likely that emperor Commodus fights in the arena with a gladiator (although wounded) who already proved himself Rambo plus Terminator? Is it likely that one can make a general disappear in the middle of his army without arising the slightest suspect or reaction in an era in which emperors were made by armies? Is it likely Marcus Aurelius standing few yards away from a risky battle like general Lee on a cliff overlooking a Civil War fight? Nobody wants a movie to be absolutely consistent and historically correct, but a shade of inner plausibility is always required not to look ridicule. Besides, all can be forgiven as long as it's entertaining. But all you can save in this mess is a bit of digital architecture which seems dej? vu after Star Wars, and battles (although edited in a dizzy way): the rest is boring, the screenplay childish. Scott is running out of inspiration (like the last De Palma and the late Kubrick), cinema has less and less to be proud of, and I like Ben Hur better.</fullReview>

It has all the stock characters in place: rugged, down-to-earth hero, his slain family, the princess who loves him and the effiminate prince who hates him. The whole movie was filmed in a murky indistinct way, and half the time you couldn't tell what was going on (except in the oddly lucent "floating" flashbacks when everything seemed very computerized and unreal). There are no high points of emotion in "Gladiator"; an epic movie needs ecstatic joys and breathtaking lows, but all this movie gives us is grim unpleasantness, which is not fun to watch. I don't know why there's so much crowing about the acting here: everybody does what they're required to do, but nothing extraordinary happens that couldn't have been done by thousands of actors across the country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has everything you need for a good night at your local multiplex. True it doesn't challenge the grey matter but neither did Ben Hur or Spartacus and this is much better than either of them. The opening battle sets the pace of the film and you are never left with a moment of boredom or the film slowing down, which is what happens a lot in films today. The story grasps you and even though you could probably guess the ending there are a few moments when everything is thrown into doubt and it makes a great experience for a Friday night. I found the two and a half hours flew by as I was enthralled by the excellent action scenes within the Colloseum and the breath-taking scenes of Rome and the Colloseum are what computer effects should be used for. Ridley Scott has once again gone to a genre and brought it something fresh. This is the definitive Roman epic and the best film of the year so far and it is going to take a monumental film to top this, watch it.</fullReview>

E.g., we never learn how Maximus, who is supposed to be a farmer, knew the emperor a dozens of years before the movie takes place -- is this just to plant the prequel?The acting is very uneven: Joaquin Phoenix gives depth to Commodus, Russell Crowe is very good, he almost manages to pull together the movie, but the other roles are terribly underwritten but overplayed.As for the filming: I don't know which gladiator movies "Gladiator" is supposed to be an hommage to, but the scene where Commodus and Lucilla enter Rome in the chariot made me feel very eerie -- they alluded, strongly, to the Nazi parade pictures from the late 30's or, for that matter, Leni Riefenstahl's film on the Berlin Olympics. Tell me it was not on purpose!The major problem, however, is the historical accuracy, or, to be precise, the lack thereof. I'm not talking about Maximus being a fictional character, Commodus having reigned 12 years or so, and other licentia poetica here. I'm talking about the way Roman religion and weaponry was depicted.As for the latter, the Roman Legions looked like medieval professional soldiers, but who cares? The religious beliefs attributed to Maximus, however, are absolutely false for the period and for the character. A Roman to believe in the "Afterlife"? A Roman to pray "for somebody", aloud? A Roman to kneel down while praying? Anybody who took a 101 Classics class knows that Romans did not include portraits/statuettes of their loved ones, alive or dead, in their home altars. One might think that Christianity is penetrating the good old Roman religion here -- but why is then Maximus not a Christian hero? Unfortunately, all his character (farmer, pater familias, great soldier; honest and just) is consistently taken from the Republican idealizations of a Roman hero. This is not a Christian hero. Somebody just didn't do their homeworks on the background checks on Roman Antiquities.Plot and acting credits taken away, "Gladiator" might still be good entertaiment -- but, it seems to me, only the fight scenes are there to go for. And the music, of course, the only really epic thing in this flic.</fullReview>

The king dies, the son plots, the hero is almost assassinated and decides to overthrow the new King, blah blah blah...

		<fullReview>A truly incredible film, "Gladiator" is epic in nature with an interesting plot, strong emotion, beautiful imagery, and fierce action that held me on the edge of my seat until the final credits fell. Due to the human struggles of the plot and the identifiable characters, I became empathetic and emotional, truly "pulling" for what I wanted to happen (as was intended, I'm sure). The battle scenes were highly engaging and interesting to watch--not just the same old fights. The beautiful locations and imagery really added a great visual layer to the film that enhances its entertainment value, its enjoyability. A couple scenes have aspects that are unrealistic, and the special effects were sometimes pixelated and unrealistic, but I appreciate all that "Gladiator" accomplishes and recommend it highly to anyone in the mood for a -quality- action film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it autumn already?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is being hyped as the first blockbuster of the summer moviegoing season, which is strange to me, as it doesn't exude a summery vibe at all. To be sure, Ridley Scott's high-tech update of the classic sword-and-sandal genre boasts plenty of July-style blood and thunder, but the picture also sports a grim, somewhat heavy mood that undercuts the thrills and gives the film the kind of brooding texture more commonly associated with prestige autumn and winter releases.The story, set in 180 A.D., follows Maximus (Russell Crowe), a mighty Roman general who is selected by dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) to restore the republican government to Rome upon his death, at the expense of the Caesar's own ambitious son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). A furious Commodus kills his father, as well as Maximus' beloved wife and son, and condemns the general to death. Maximus escapes, but is captured as a slave and trained as a gladiator. Transformed into a brutal killing machine, he is returned to Rome...just in time for Commodus Caesar's gladiator festivities.It's an engaging story, more intricate than is common for popcorn fare, and it's given appropriately serious treatment by Ridley Scott. Scott has always struck me as a director of primarily visual gifts (his "Blade Runner", my all-time favorite science fiction film, is one of very few pictures in which style and subtext really tell the story), and he serves up an always-convincing past here. Every detail, from the sprawling grandeur of the Roman Colosseum to the surprise of seeing female archers in combat in the ring, is eye-catching and enjoyable. The picture is great to look at, with cinematographer John Mathieson, production designer Arthur Max, and costume designer Janty Yates positioning themselves as early Oscar favorites with their work here. The same cannot be said for composers Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, whose stentorian score at times overwhelms the action. The film also features some choppy editing choices that deaden the drama at a couple of moments (the scene where Maximus discovers his dead family, for example, was marred for me but a jump-cut that threw me out of the moment).Of course, there are many people who will be seeing the film primarily for its scenes of gladiatorial combat. They should be warned: this isn't your typical rousing action stuff. It's brutal, shockingly gory, and a bit chilling in the bloodlust it brings out in the citizens who sit back and cheer as men are dismembered and eviscerated. Anyone who thinks boxing is barbaric should watch this movie, a chronicle of a time when cold-blooded murder was something you paid money to watch for fun.The screenplay, credited to David Franzoni, John Logan (who did his own modern-day gladiator story with last Christmas' football tale "Any Given Sunday"), and William Nicholson, is relatively unremarkable in terms of its dialogue; they really haven't improved on the sort of slightly stilted Shakespeare Cliffs Notes speech Cecil B. DeMille got off on. Still, Scott's actors put it across with more conviction than an army of Charlton Hestons. Phoenix really impressed me with his Commodus; perverted, ambitious, and nursing a Herculean inferiority complex, he's a gripping villain. You don't love to hate him. You just hate him. Also impressive are Djimon Hounsou as Maximus' gladiatorial comrade and the late Oliver Reed, who exudes cynicism and faded glory as a former gladiator turned bloodsport merchant.Front and center in all of this, of course, is Crowe, who impresses yet again with his versatility and control as a performer. Maximus is worlds away from the nervous, conflicted Jeffrey Wigand of "The Insider", the role that won Crowe an Oscar nomination earlier this year. This hero is solid, tough, and single-minded of purpose, a man who does what he's got to do to see justice done. Crowe's charisma and conviction carry the audience through the most ferocious of the bloodletting, and provides a strong force to compel the audience through the drama."Gladiator" is a gritty, surprisingly serious melodrama, a story of blood and revenge which may not be a lot of people's idea of a fun way to spend a hot afternoon. Still, anyone with a taste for period cinema and classical old-fashioned storytelling will be in for a good, if not always rousing, experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bigger Than Ben-Hur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's film of Dreamworks $105 million epic, GLADIATOR, is one of the most visually stunning and exciting cinematic entertainment experiences to come out of Hollywood in nearly four decades.For its 153 minute running time Ridley Scott has crafted a spectacle quite superior to its predecessors yet very carefully paying homage to the genre at the same time.Not since William Wyler's Ben-Hur and Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus has a genre returned and exploded so vibrantly on the screen.It is important to note that Ridley Scott and Steven Spielberg's "passion" for film and a specific genre show in every frame. The history of cinema plays the most important part in the structure, execution and subsequent success of the film.Russell Crowe as the avenging GLADIATOR warrior, Maximus, dominates the screen with a rawness and freshness of energy from the opening frame to the last and will catapult Crowe to superstar status.The supporting cast includes Richard Harris, Joaquin Phoenix, Derek Jacobi Connie Nielsen and David Hemmings.All are equally impressive in their respective roles but it is the late Oliver Reed who stands out above the rest in a wonderful role reminiscent and clearly inspired by that of Peter Ustinov's in Kubrick's Spartacus. It strongly confirms not only a great performer and screen presence, but a great loss to cinema. GLADIATOR is a fitting tribute to a most talented and gifted performer.The music score by Hans Zimmer is stirring and triumphant. Combined with Ridley Scott's spectacular vision it is one of the most exciting and original marriages of music and film ever put together.GLADIATOR is definitely the blockbuster hit of the year, and won't be forgotten at academy award time next year.Exhilerating, exciting and entertaining. Now, thats what cinema is all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is one of those rare films that really stays in peoples minds and is remembered for a century to come. It is also one of those extremely rare films that I would sincerely rate 10/10.It's difficult to even know where to begin with this film. The acting? The directing? The soundtrack? Oliver Reed? This truly is a spectacle to behold! Russell Crowe delivers the performance of an outstanding career. He manages to captivate not only the crowd of the Coloseum but also those watching at home, cheering on and watching intently on the edges of their seats. Jouaqin Phoenix makes you truly hate him and sympathize with him all at once, and Oliver Reed as Proximo; the gladiator set free who turns to owning and training his own set of gladiators. Oliver Reed delivers exactly what you would expect and you receive exactly what you want from him.Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer deliver an essential soundtrack to accompany the film. Epic in proportion the original scores also aim to rend tears and jerk emotions straight from the crowd.Released in 2000, Gladiator stands to be one of the most atmospheric and truly magnificent films I have seen. I marked my tenth viewing only a few nights ago and each time I watch, I feel like I'm watching it for the first time all over again.10/10! Wowzer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Special Movie Encompassing Much of What is Good About Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An epic which goes beyond the spectacle of the Roman empire, to delve so delicately into some of what we've come to believe is good and evil. It is unfortunate that a movie so well grounded in fine acting will probably be remembered more for the inescapable violence.If you enjoy movies as an escape, something you can imagine yourself being transported into, this story, the scenes, will literally swallow you, beckon you to come in to a place and events that you will be sorry to see end. For me, it was the retractable awnings in the Coliseum and the fleeting shots of the hillside villa home of General Maximus, and his beautiful wife and precious son.From the photography to the acting, the rest is Hollywood at its finest. More words are not necessary, let the grandeur of this fine movie sweep you away to an era which we believe was fundamental to civilization on our planet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Roman Epic, Better On The Second Viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a Roman general (Russell Crowe) is betrayed and his family murdered by an emperor's corrupt son (Joaquin Phoenix), he comes to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge.The music is very much like that for the "Pirates of the Caribbean" series, which should not be surprising given that both come from Hans Zimmer. Did he recycle the music here for "Pirates", or is it just a similar style? Hmm.This is the film that really made Russell Crowe an international star, and helped him earn an Oscar (though it probably should have gone to Geoffrey Rush). This is also probably the best film from Ridley Scott since "Blade Runner". While on first viewing it may not seem like anything special, it really does present a great telling of Rome and its problems (fictionalized) and could have parallels to empires today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was it like to be a gladiator?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's "Gladiator" (2000) takes place in 180 AD and begins with a decisive Roman victory led by General Maximus (Russell Crowe) over the Germanic tribes in what is now Austria. The Emperor (Richard Harris) is dying and wants to turn over control of the empire to the noble Maximus rather than his pathetic son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). After Commodus catches wind of this, Maximus and his family are condemned, but the general survives and winds up a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed), who trains gladiators. Connie Nielsen is on hand as Commodus' sister who sympathizes with Maximus.I saw "Gladiator" in the theater when it came out. It was over-hyped at the time and, as a result, I was let down, which isn't to say it's bad?not at all?it's just not as great as the hoopla made it out to be. Maybe I was a little disappointed because it's hard to watch "Gladiator" without comparing it to 1960's "Spartacus," the first hour of which represents some of the greatest filmmaking ever, and "Gladiator" is underwhelming by comparison (with the first hour anyway).Yet "Gladiator" has a lot of strengths, including the serious tone, the score, locations, the recreation of the Colosseum in Rome and the cast. Speaking of the cast, Crowe is probably the film's greatest strength as he makes a worthy protagonist; and Reed is no slouch as he's his typical magnetic self. Believe it or not, Reed died during filming and his remaining scenes had to have his face superimposed over an anonymous actor (!). Maximus' fellow gladiators and friends are also notable (Djimon Hounsou and Ralf Moeller). Furthermore, the arena action sequences are thrilling and indeed give you a glimpse of what it must've been like to be a gladiator.Phoenix is also exceptional as the love-to-loathe villain, but this is where the film suffers. Commodus (obviously derived from 'commode,' lol) is so repugnant and dishonorable that the viewer has no interest in watching overlong dramatic sequences of him in the palace, etc. These scenes could've easily been cut in half.While "Gladiator" has a simplistic revenge plot there's some depth to glean here and there. For instance, the Emperor (Harris) chooses Maximus to replace him not only because he loves him as a son, but also because he wants someone outside of the corruption of Roman government to return the empire to a republic. That's what we need in the USA, someone not tainted by Washington politics. Then there's Commodus' sister, Lucilla (Nielsen), who initially comes off ignoble, but then you start to understand her plight and sorta hope she's redeemable.As far as historical accuracy goes (***SPOILERS***), Marcus Aurelius allowed his unworthy son, Commodus, to become Emperor, knowing his incompetence BUT it is believed Aurelius wanted Claudius Pompeianus to succeed him as Caesar in preference to Commodus but was turned down, just as Maximus turned him down in the film. The fictional character of Maximus was partially based on Pompeianus, who had a similar career to Maximus' and personality traits as well, as documented by Herodian. In fact, Pompeianus married Marcus Aurelius' daughter, Lucilla, following the death of Lucius Verus. Maximus was also an amalgam of historical people like Narcissus (which was the protagonist's name in the first draft and Commodus' real-life killer), Spartacus (who, of course, led a significant slave revolt), Cincinnatus (a farmer who saved Rome from invasion, then resigned his six-month ruler-ship after 15 days), and Marcus Nonius Macrinus (a faithful general and friend of Marcus Aurelius). As for Commodus' entering the arena at the end and taking on a mighty (albeit wounded) gladiator and dying, Commodus was known to engage in show combat in the Colosseum, but he was actually strangled by the wrestler Narcissus in his bath, not killed in the arena, and he ruled for a dozen plus years, unlike the relatively short time shown in the movie.Say what you will about these (common) cinematic deviations, but the movie does inspire you to look-up the historical facts. The film runs 155 minutes (the extended cut 171 minutes) and was shot in England (the opening battle scenes), Malta, Morocco, Tuscany and Lone Pine, CA.GRADE: B</fullReview>

Same story continues in both movies. The production values for this movie is extraordinary. In the year 180, the death of emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) throws the Roman Empire into chaos. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is one of the Roman army's most capable and trusted generals and a key adviser to the emperor. As Marcus' devious son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) ascends to the throne, Maximus is set to be executed. He escapes, but is captured by slave traders.

		<fullReview>A nice movie indeed, however what is interesting in my opinion and partially sad is that even though the movie takes place in Italy, and the concept is completely Roman, the movie itself is completely American. Values and plot wise. Quite disappointing yet proof how Hollywood dictates our perception on other cultures as well. I really enjoyed the movie at the beginning when i first saw it, however it took a couple of years and an interesting lecture on movies and society, to finally realise that this movie that i liked so much since i was little wasn't so roman at all. It is obvious but you never truly come to think about it. The man, war hero, victim and warrior falling in love with the woman who is spoken for. And the woman obviously falls in love with the hero. Such a Hollywood style. Not that its a bad thing its just that the movie pretends to be foreign, pretends to reflect European history and values but all it does, is that it promotes the idea of Hollywood and its ideology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a die hard movie fan, I believe movie reviews are all about personal opinion, so I'll start off by saying my personal opinion is Ridley Scott's Gladiator is the greatest film I've ever seen. I'm sure there are a lot of sci-fi nerds out there who will argue that Alien or Blade Runner is Scott's best work, but those films lack the heart that Gladiator has. From the films intense opening to the awesome Battle of Carthage, this movie captivated me like no film I have ever seen before. Of course, the performances in Gladiator are one of the main reasons why this movie is so great. Russell Crowe is excellent as Maximus, the Roman General turned slave earned him a well deserved Best Actor Oscar. A special shout out goes to Joaquin Phoenix. Few actors have the ability to truly make u loathe them in a movie, but Phoenix's portrayal as the young Emperor Commodus is so conniving and evil it's pure genius, although this wasn't Phoenix's first movie, to me this role was his breakout performance and I thought he was snubbed at the Oscars that year. This film has it all, brilliant acting, great cinematography, and intense battle scenes. My hats off to Ridley Scott for creating this cinematic masterpiece."What we do in life, echoes in eternity" -Maximus</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben-Hur, Spartacus, Quo Vadis - that was when they made movies as big as cities, proper, meaty, swallow-an-afternoon films. Well, what may have been out of vogue for 40 years is making one hell of a comeback. In the grandest tradition of them all, Ridley Scott, together with man of the moment Russell Crowe, has enriched the legacy of sandals, swords and leather wrist things to create a magnificent epic. Hammering on all the touchstones of yore while utilizing all the tricks the modern filmmaker has to hand, this is hardly subtle, but its impact is absolute, its performances loud and clear and its ambition all up there on screen.Commencing with a full-scale, extras unlimited, realism unabated battle sequence in a mud strewn Germanica, we are confronted by a general tired of war and an emperor, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), near death. Furious at the bond between Aurelius and his beloved warrior, his unhinged heir, Commodus, kills pop and condemns Maximus to death. Big mistake. Especially when you kill his loving wife and child, whom he yearns to for, by burning and crucifixion.And so the plot follows Maximus rise as a gladiator - trained by a remarkably vociferous and effective Oliver Reed, whose face is peculiarly CGI'd in certain scenes from beyond the grave - driven by lust for revenge. In the meantime, Rome is in turmoil with the nutty new emperor, played with gleeful vindictiveness by Phoenix, attempting to dismantle the Senate while his doting sister Lucilla (Nielsen) seems to have other plans. And just to make things more complicated, she happens to be Maximus' ex.Russell Crowe was clearly born in a hard month, in a hard year during a freak outbreak of total hardness. The man exudes the physicality of a wild animal. Shifting testosterone like a pure-bloated Brando, he holds the screen with such assuredness and force you simply can't rip your eyes away from him. When he looks furious (as he does for 90 percent of the time), the movie possesses its own gravitational pull.Ridley Scott was also the man for the job. His trademark visual panache - making everything seem utterly glorious no matter how brutal or gritty - presents the events on a truly epic canvas of filtered light and ancient landscapes. CGI has recreated Rome's massive Colosseum and the gore splattered combat sequences therein are literally stunning - the face-off between Maximus' and his gladiator brothers and a stream of chariots in mid-arena makes a mockery of Ben-Hur's fabled race sequence, and utilizing Private Ryan-esquire frame-jumping techniques gives the fighting a tangible realism that crashes out of the screen.There is an interesting if token commentary on the use of violent entertainment to subvert the masses, but on the whole, historical accuracy is reserved more for the technical elements than any sense of political, religious or dialectic truth (accents are all over the shop). The film also bobbles in its need to cram so much politicking in, to draw in an empire in crisis to the more personal story of one man's revenge.Courtesy: Empire magazine</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gladiator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can say there's only one issue with this movie; the Emperor just doesn't seem believable. I didn't buy it. Why would he get in the arena and challenge a foe he knows he can't beat one on one when he has an entire army at his disposal? That's the major issue. If the Emperor was really crazy enough to do something like that, then he should of been a completely different character; he was portrayed in the wrong way. Just the fact that this movie ends by Maximus getting his revenge in a 1 on 1 death duel against the Emperor seems so lame and so Hollywood. Couldn't you give us an intelligent, realistic ending (like the Emperor has Maximus executed but then someone else comes in Mark Wahlberg in The Departed style and ends up killing the Emperor anyways)? Something other than the simple A-to-B ending it has. It's just a shame because it's such an awesome, epic movie. The writing and story is so smart; there's not a single bad scene. The visuals are epic. The Emperor character is the only reason this beast of a movie earns a 9, not a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator, 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is near-perfect. When we watch a movie, more then often it relies on other factors, for example violence, or crude humour to weave the plot, or simply to entertain. Not often are we allowed to watch a simple movie, told simply and yet beneath the story we get a sense of something immense and complex.Gladiator, told simply, is a film surrounding Maximus Merridius Decimus, a general who becomes greatly acquainted with the emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Upon Marcus' dying wish he wants Rome to become a republic and entrusts Maximus to the task. Commodus, the Emperors son is deeply wounded by Marcus' father treatment to Maximus and seeks revenge. What continues is a beautiful told story of friendship, jealousy and anger. What I love about this film is that it centers around Maximus/Commodus and doesn't center around the violence of the arena. This movie is, fictional - it is made to entertain and it does so, it is not a real account and should be watched open-minded. I highly recommend this film to anyone, the only criticism of this film that I can give is the first battle scene which is unfortunately a little strange, but the rest is...****1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man robbed of his name and his dignity strives to win them back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A second-century Roman general (Russell Crowe) is condemned to death by the Emperor (Joaquin Phoenix) but escapes to become a slave and a gladiator before wreaking a spectacular revenge and restoring the moral compass of the Roman Empire.Gladiator is an expensive, elaborate, action film that became the first bona fide sword-and-sandals epic in four decades. The pace never falters thanks to director Ridley Scott's attentive direction, buttressed by an astronomical budget. Crowe, alternating between hand-to-hand combat and grave contemplation, is hugely credible in the title role. A massive hit for wholly understandable reasons. The film was nominated for and won multiple awards; it won five Academy Awards in the 73rd Academy Awards including Best Picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>since it's release i've caught parts of the film but never saw the full thing, last night i finally did. To be quite frank, Russell Crowe's performance bored me to tears. I couldn't believe in his portrayal of Maximus, there just seemed to be something lacking. The only scene in the film that he actually made me believe was when he was speaking to Marcus about his home and how he didn't want to be emperor. There I was convinced after that... nothing. Joaquin on the other hand did a phenomenal job. He was ruthless and i literally couldn't wait to see what he would do next. To me he was amazing as Commodus. The fight sequences were a little drawn out but I feel that way about most fights in movies and they weren't bad but just a smidgen over done. The scenery was awesome and the sets had a great WOW factor to them but thats all that was really good about this movie. The ending ticked me off the most. I hate movies were from the beginning you know the main character is going to die. I mean why even bother with it? They should've at least had one of them live, maybe it would've made it better I don't know. I think this is one of those movies where you either love it or hate it no matter what and despite the issues with it, I have to give it a thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies I've seen - especially among modern films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I typically prefer classic films because I, for one, don't think Hollywood makes movies like they used to. Plus, I think most modern films are heavy on the sex and foul language - and as a Christian, I find it offensive.So it is rare when Hollywood puts out not only a great film in terms of the quality of the story and the performances, but which also has very little language and no explicit sexual content (inspite of this being rated R but that is due to the violence).This movie did something that rarely happens with me in modern films in that it completely absorbed me into the time period, the location and the story. I felt somewhat transported for the entire length - which given its long running time, was quite a feat. It never once seemed to lag or get slow - but kept my complete attention. Not only that, but I have seen this film numerous times (probably at least 6 times) and it never fails to capture my complete attention - even though I know what is going to happen next. That is the sign of not only a great movie - but a MASTERPIECE in my opinion.Crowe's performance was amazing, but I'm a little surprised that he won, while Joaquin Phoenix was ROBBED. He was nominated, but lost to Benicio Del Torro for TRAFFIC. Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus was so completely engrossing - the creep factor was exponential. I think his is one of the all time great villainous portrayals - but in ways that at times were so subtle that it made him even more despicable.I only had one mild complaint of the film which is I felt the past history between Lucilla and Maximus was not completely explained and I think would have enriched the understanding of the 2 characters.I own very few DVD's but this is one that we did end up getting since it never fails to deliver a completely absorbing experience - time after time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rote Revenge Pic Poses as Historical Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator", winner of the Best Picture Academy Award in 2001, is less a historical epic of swords, sandals, and the fate of a mighty empire, and more of a bloated B-movie about a guy with a gloomy face seeking revenge for the murder of his family. "Death Wish" in Ancient Rome, if you will.Thanks to director Ridley Scott it's a very pretty picture to look at: the icy blue light of a wintry Germanic battlefield, the amber hue of the emperor's throne room, and the Coliseum littered with rose petals like confetti. The many gruesome gladiatorial fight scenes are frenetically paced, visceral if not actually coherent. Some of the modern special effects, however, like the CGI cityscapes, look a bit crude, even by 1999's standards.The script, like most of the scripts that Ridley Scott works from, is strictly rough-draft material. The characters are shallow, the dialogue is stilted and awkward, and the story tries too hard to intertwine the drama of the Roman political arena with the action of the hero's central journey in the more literal arena -- the former scenes only serve as breathing room between the latter scenes, which are the real meat of the film. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix make the most out of their limited roles -- Crowe's terse delivery and brooding eyes establish his character better than the writer ever could -- but veterans Richard Harris and Oliver Reed nearly vanish into parts that ask too little of their great talents.In the end it doesn't feel like a proper epic: it's not the sort of epoch-defining story that spans years and continents and a huge historical canvas, like "Ben-Hur" or "Spartacus" were -- or Anthony Mann's "The Fall of the Roman Empire" which told essentially the same story in 1964. It's not even "Braveheart", another gory, overblown revenge flick. It's trying to be big and important, but it has nothing important to say; its only purpose is to construct a framework for swordfights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Are you not entertained?" Russell Crowe shouts to a crowd that has just watched him destroy a half-dozen hulking gladiators. Well, with a motion picture like this one, it would be very hard not to be entertained."Gladiator" director Ridley Scott has created a modern spectacle, a "swords and sandals" epic full of wide-screen Mediterranean majesty, high treason, hot passions, and brutal murderous action.Furthermore, the shots of Rome are incredible, the opening battle mind-is blowing, and even the ability to bring Oliver Reed back from the grave to finish out the movie is very humbling in its own way. And if you're wise, will you see parallels to our modern world? The film's strong points are unquestionably highlighted in its various battle scenes, but don't let it be said that these fights are set adrift in a plot-less movie. In fact, many internal struggles take place in this picture with love, redemption, revenge, honor, tradition, allegiance and blackmail all making personal appearancesRussel Crowe brings his breath-taking intensity to the role of Maximus, a heroic Roman general caught up in a power play and marked for death by the new emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). I never for one moment doubted his character or his motives. Maximus survives only to end up a gladiator slave in a remote Roman province, where he begins killing his way towards revenge. A unique masterpiece portrayed with excellence by Crowe. 9/10</fullReview>

The story is complex and very dull in many places, and it could have been shortened. Now, I am a big fan of historical fiction films, but this one just did not do it. The story was very weak, and I could not get into it at all. The characters were also another problem. I felt that I could not relate to them.

		<shortDescription>A Bit Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2001, the Academy awarded Gladiator the title of Best Picture 2000. I disagree with that choice, though 2000 is not a very good year i would say this is the 5th best of the year. The best film of the year is Chocolat, which i also give a 7/10. As i said the year 2000 is not a good year. My #1 film of that year i give a 7/10. I kinda agree a little with Ebert, i don't think this is a bad film like he thinks, but i don't think this is right choice for Best Picture.The reason why i think this is overrated is because some of the scenes in this film are very boring and uninteresting. Kinda like in Braveheart, but i like Braveheart much more. In Braveheart some of the scenes were a bit uninteresting and maybe boring but the film is still an 8/10 because of great battle scenes and a brilliant score. If Gladiator didn't have great battle scenes(but they are not as good as in Braveheart) i would give it a 6/10. Sometimes i want to stop watching the film when the boring scenes are. Russell Crowe had a good performance and he is one of my favorite actors. Russell Crowe has been in 5 films that were nominated for Best Picture and 2 of them(A Beautiful Mind and Gladiator)won Best Picture.**MINOR SPOLERS BELOW** The plot: The year is 150 B.C(i think). Russell Crowe plays Maximus, a roman general which leads a battle against the barbarians of Germania in the beginning of the film. In the end the Romans win and after the battle Marcus Aurelius(the old father of Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix)) asks Maximus to replace him after he dies. Commodus finds that out and kills his father and Commodus replaces his father, not Maximus. Commodus orders his soldiers to kill Maximus but Maximus survives and goes home to his family.Then he sees them dead and is captured and becomes a Gladiator in a small village and then becomes a Gladiator in Rome. In Rome he plans to seek revenge for his family and is going to kill Commodus. I will not say anything more about the plot now. Best Performance: Russell Crowe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good try, but too many flaws for "classic" status.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is an ambitious attempt to tell the story of a man's revenge against the backdrop of the Roman Empire. Russell Crowe stars as a successful general who is sold into slavery after being deposed by a ruthless upstart young emperor. We see him fight his way through the ranks as a gladiator and eventually square off against the young tyrant on the floor of the coliseum. Though not a historically accurate film, it is still worth seeing for a few of the fight scenes, and some of the performances.Crowe is as good as he needs to be as Maximus, the deposed general who only wishes to return home to harvest his crops after defeating a barbaric army at the film's beginning. However the dying old emperor, well-played by Richard Harris, wants to hand over control of Rome to this fine man. When the emperor's evil son hears of this plan, he kills his father and takes control of the empire. Since Maximus refuses to swear allegiance to the new emperor, he is order to be killed along with his wife and child. Maximus escapes the Roman soldiers, but is soon captured and sold into slavery as a gladiator. The rest of the film is centered around Maximus and his plans to overthrow the young emperor with the help of the emperor's sister and a few well-meaning senators.Gladiator could have been a great film, but it's a little unfocused, and some of the scenes could have been filmed a little better. For example, the opening battle starts off well. We see a fully-armed Roman army set to do battle with a Germanic hoard. We get some good shots of Roman archers and infantry men launching a barrage of arrows and flaming debris on the barbarians, and that looks pretty impressive. However, when the battle becomes hand-to-hand combat, everything becomes too murky and hard to follow. Some of the fight scenes between gladiators have the same sort of problems. Maximus, as his instructor tells him, does in fact kill too quickly. Sometimes he has dispatched five or six men without us even realizing how he did it. True he was an experienced soldier who would have gone for quick and efficient kills, but the spectacle is lost in some instances. The re-created Battle of Carthage is probably the most memorable combat scene, and it works fairly well.Few of the characters in this film are likable or well-defined. Oliver Reed gets the best lines, but his character is never fully developed to the point that we understand him. This could be the result of his untimely death during filming, though. Connie Nielsen and Derek Jacobi also have curious roles in the sense that we never really know who's side they are on, or if they are only using Maximus. There is an implied close relationship between both Maximus and Nielsen's character, but it leads nowhere. When I first saw this film, I thought Jaoquin Phoenix was over-acting badly, but now I'm not so sure. It is more than likely that a young emperor of Rome would have behaved with selfishness and paranoia, and Phoenix seems to revel in his role.Overall, this film reminds me quite a bit of Conan the Barbarian. We have similar scenes and themes throughout. Also, we even get an appearance by Sven Thorsen who played a bad guy in Conan. Here, he plays a former champion who comes out of retirement to challenge Maximus in one exciting scene.This film is really no better than Conan The Barbarian, and Crowe lacks Ahnold's charisma and physique.Bottom line: 7 of 10 stars. Worth a look, but not really Best Picture material.The hound has spoken.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are thousands of reviews about this film. Some critics love it, others do not. Some are indifferent.So what can be said about it that has not been said before? Not a lot really. But what I can say is that any film that can create so many opinions and discussions has got to be worth watching to find out what all the fuss is about.People will talk about the performances of the actors, the dialogue, the cinematography and hundreds of other in-depth subjects. But for the laymen such as myself, what do you get from this movie? Well firstly, the movie excites you with the action of the battles, then angers you with injustice of the new emperor. Then you feel the pain of our hero and his despair at the futility of his new existence. Then you are brought back with him as he once again takes control. The power, the invincibility. You feel euphoric as you sense that revenge is near...but then.... Every emotion you can think of is summoned in this movie. A clich I know, but it is a roller coaster!! Crowe will always have his critics, but, if this movie is re-made a thousand times, no-one will do it quite like Russel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated movie about fight techniques (minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the feeling that Gladiator uses its plot primarily to show brutal gladiator fights. It has certainly an intriguing plot, which depicts a Roman general's revenge for betrayal, his family's slaughter, and his Emperor's murder, but there were too many fight and battle scenes for my liking. Still, it is an entertaining film that shows not only the shiny grandeur, but also the bloody, ugly cruelties of the Roman Empire, although some scenes, such as the bird-view look of the Colosseum, or the city landscape in the background when Commodus and Lucilla are standing on the balcony alone and talking, looked too CGI. What I had the most problems with was the final arena fight: We know that Commodus is so hungry for acceptance by his people and popularity, that it is unlikely that he would dare to kill Maximus in front of the watching crowd. And although this is a fictional story, it's unimaginable historically, that an Emperor would fight against a gladiator in the arena. As for the acting, Russell Crowe was very good and well suited for this role, but most of the other actors were only mediocre, especially Joaquin Phoenix, who overacted too often.I think the Oscar for Best Film was way too exaggerated; maybe it received it because there hasn't been a film about ancient Rome for a long time.</fullReview>

In fact, this movie is so mesmerizing that it's worth the price of admission to just go and look at the beautiful images. Gladiator, however, also features excellent performances (especially Crowe), a great script, and action-packed, fast-paced battle sequences. These battle scenes are very exciting including an opening Saving Private Ryan-esqe style forest battle and several unique gladiator fights. Yet, the movie's success goes to 2 people: Russell Crowe, who will probably be nominated again for an oscar, as the tough, rough, and seriously ticked off general/gladiator Maximus and Ridley Scott, who returns to great form after average movies like GI Jane. So see this movie when it comes out, as it deserves to be seen at least once on the Big Screen.</fullReview>

Like Star Wars, Gladiator has no big stars, opting instead for very talented actors who do not happen to be famous. Gladiator has a terrific hero and villains worthy of the name. The battle that Maximus wages is both personal and epic, and the amazing backgrounds that the story occupies create a very real world. This movie is immersive unlike any other movie in a very long time. Where Episode I failed to give the audience characters they could care about or a plot they could decipher, Gladiator keeps things simple, elegantly depicting the conflict without clutter. The plot is a combination of a royal drama similar to Shakespeare's plays, and an Anglo-Saxon battle epic. Everything works, and just as Lawrence of Arabia makes you thirsty, this movie makes your pulse pound.</fullReview>

Joaquin Phoenix is also very good as Commodus.WARNING---SPOLILERS CAN BE FOUNDNow for the bad parts, and unfortunately, there are many: Damn it Ridley Scott- Read a history book! The movie is FILLED with historical mistakes and errors. I tried no to think too much about them, and I tried not to care, but when they are so obvious and incredibly silly, I could not ignore them. Here are only four of them, to keep it short. FIRST: The Germans did NOT stand in an open place, waiting as the Romans loaded their siege equipment and prepared their archers. Speaking clearly: The Germans were not freakin' STUPID! They used a type of guerrilla warfare, hiding in their forests, and making surprise attacks, often at night, when the Romans were camping and resting. SECOND: SO, Maximus rides from Germania to...Spain? wounded? And taken by slavers to northern Africa? That would have taken months, even years! THIRD: Maximus is what..Spanish? The word Spanish was'nt even invented by 180 ad. Spain was called Iberia and the inhabitants Iberians, and these where barbarian warrior tribes of possible Celtic origin. FOURTH: The emperor is fighting a gladiator in the Colosseum? Very silly.Furthermore, the acting could have been much better. Russel Crowe is quite boring! You can't feel for him in the same way as you could feel for Mel Gibson in Braveheart, just for example.I know- Everyone is NOT historians, and some only want to get entertained and have some action at the screen, but I can't help but feel that this movie is overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shamelessly bad film *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator has little to teach us about the past. In fact, it has little to teach us about anything save what not to do if you're trying to make a thoughtful film of artistic merit. The beginning has some promise. We are presented with the main character, a general named Maximus, who has seen battle for untold years and desires to resume his humble life as a farmer with his wife and daughter. If it weren't for his unshakable sense of blind civic duty he would have done this long ago. We see Marcus Aurelius, the old, passive emperor known for his stoicism. The movie does not paint him as the relatively aggressive imperialist he actually was, and perhaps we wonder why it doesn't, until we realize that the movie is following a simple rule: all characters must be one-dimensional. Our first impression is the correct one. There is no more than meets the eye; these people are either good or bad. For example: Maximus is good. Anyone trying to kill him, e.g. other gladiators, a.k.a. people who have probably been forced into exactly the same uncomfortable position as him, is bad. It's that simple. Gladiator does have an attention to certain historical details. The costumes, including the armor, for example, that the soldiers (Maximus included) at the beginning of the film are wearing is likely what Romans of the time would have been wearing. This is a departure from previous Roman epics, which tend to use the brass breast plate with the muscles etched into it for Roman soldiers regardless of the time period. So, score one for Gladiator, right? Maybe. But who cares, when we consider the absurd battle that follows? It quickly breaks down to a chaotic melee, with a lot of slashing, that looks completely uncalculated and un-Roman. The Romans win it easily anyway, but if they had actually fought like this they would never have been the consistent victors that they were. They had a method, and they used it, and it definitely wasn't 'every man for himself!' Another perfect example of the film simplifying history comes when Marcus Aurelius says that he wants Maximus to succeed him, so Commodus, Aurelius' son, murders him before he can tell anyone else. In actuality, the succession of the throne to Commodus was not in doubt. The film wanted to make it clear, however, that Aurelius is good, Maximus is good, and Commodus is bad.To examine the character Maximus in detail, we ought to look at his deeds. In the eyes of the filmmakers, he is without flaw. But look how he behaves!He spends the film ruthlessly seeking revenge on Commodus for the murders of his wife and daughter, and eventually his revenge is satisfied. There are no negative consequences for his brutal, murderous revenge. In fact, he gets exactly what he wants: on one hand Rome is handed back to the senate and thus becomes a republic again as Aurelius wished (and what Aurelius wants, Maximus wants because of his sense of duty). On the other hand, he is reunited with his family in death. The movie never tires of telling us that this is his ultimate goal, and then has the nerve to show it literally instead of knowing that it is understood! Remember the moment when Maximus is first handed a sword at the gladiator training camp. He throws it down in protest, either because he refuses to obey his captors or because he is opposed to gladiatorial combat (or both). Roughly two minutes later, though, he is in the arena fighting, though his life never appears to be in immediate danger, because he is so much stronger than his opponents, and such a superior strategist and swordsman; it seems more likely that he enjoys the killing. The movie refuses to acknowledge this completely, because Maximus is the hero, and a necessary condition of being the hero in this movie is flawlessness. Consider also the people he is killing. They are just like him, probably abducted or born into slavery against their will, and forced to fight, yet somehow the movie pretends that they are evil or inhuman. It masks them and makes them out to be the aggressor. At one point Maximus spares a man's life against Commodus' thumbs-down (which should have been a thumbs-up, but that's merely a historical point), but he isn't being merciful out of compassion. As a matter of fact, he is not being merciful at all! All he is doing is showing that he and he alone has complete control over whether a man lives or dies. It is sadistic.The contemporary relevance of Gladiator that I was able to uncover is its warped political perspective. Its sentiments are republican, in the Roman sense of the word, and in the sense of the Republican Party in America today. It values things like civic duty, being a manly man, a family man, a strong man, someone who isn't afraid to kill to defend?whatever. It views liberalism as controlling, preventing Maximus from living the humble farm life that he might enjoy in the state of Montana or thereabouts. It opposes sexual irregularity, and seemingly with it homosexuality. If it were aware of stem-cell research, we could guess that it would oppose it. Essentially, its year 2000 release was the perfect kickoff to eight years of hilarity with the Bush gang. A better way to be contemporarily relevant is to make a thoughtful film that asks deep questions about human nature, or the best way to govern people, or something like that, instead of flaunting some obviously hypocritical moral code.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this the same guy that made Blade Runner? Seriously?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I hated this film; I've hated nearly all Ridley Scott's films. Loved Alien; Loved Blade Runner. Then I hated everything up to American Gangster, which I thought was alright but not fantastic. Robin Hood was the next one I hated. Then came Prometheus, which I didn't hate, but after three viewings I'm still wondering if it was just a really expensive commercial for Christianity. Still, at least Russell Crowe wasn't in it.Russell Crowe! Does he know something about all the big Hollywood directors that they don't want made public? Did he find their sex dungeon? Seriously, how is he getting all these roles? It certainly isn't on ability. I think he might actually be a worse actor than Sean Connery.That's the main problem with Gladiator, and with many of Ridley Scott's films. Russell Crowe is in them, and I think it's a sign of Scott's increasingly poor judgement. Yes, I grant you, Russell Crowe may have appeared to be good in Romper Stomper, but we now know that he actually is a mentally challenged thug with delusions of grandeur so it doesn't count.Anyway, there are other issues, like the mind numbing tedium of watching an unimaginative director play with his enormous budget for hours, or the excruciatingly familiar plot lurking beneath the costumes, or the pantomime bad guy hammed into the middle of next week by Joaquin Phoenix.That brings me back to the acting, and the Crowe. Crowe time! That's what my inside voice shouts when he appears; it helps me get through films that he's in. The worst instance of Crowe time! in Gladiator is the bizarrely comical moment where he finds his character's family dead and tries to act accordingly; it's like an acting version of karaoke. I started to think that the original role was played by Harvey Keitel and he was probably this Australian bloke's favourite actor.Story wise, it's like a badly remembered history lesson retold in the style of Dallas, or Prisoner Cell Block H, at least that's the way the "Dramatic" scenes come across; the action is much more in the direction of a period Arnold Schwarzenegger film where the bad guys appear to have run straight out of a computer game just in time to be slain due to their low skill level and intelligence. Don't get me wrong, I like Arnie; you know where you stand with Arnie. Ditto computer games. The problem here is that it seems really out of context.Some people have complained about the historical accuracy; I don't care about that. I'm not overly interested in the Roman Empire and as a result the level of historical detail/accuracy would be lost on me anyway. I mean, if Attenborough started telling me that Gorillas are actually cleverly disguised Ninjas I'd be a bit annoyed ? assuming peer review established such a claim to be untrue ? but I went into Gladiator expecting a film not a documentary.I'm not saying that accuracy is never an issue; I'm from Belfast and I know that a great many people were upset at the awful way the Titanic disaster was treated by Hollywood. You can't help but wonder if, somewhere in Hollywood, there's a script for a whimsical look at the Hindenburg sitting on someone's desk.I think it's long past time we all stopped expecting the next great Ridley Scott film; it isn't going to happen. Ridley Scott is not a great director. David Lynch is a great director. David Cronenberg is a great director. David Lean is a great director. Why are they all called David? I don't know. In Britain high profile political journalists are called John. No one knows why?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two things about this film intrigue me: the novel integrated talents of Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe.We are creatures who depend on idea fragments in everything we do. Virtually everything is a rehash, sometimes creative but mostly not. When someone or something comes along and adds to the vocabulary, something essentially new, it is a big deal -- that's my definition of genius. Today, a major force in defining our basic vocabulary is cinema, the visual element of filmaking. But all the easy stuff has been done as we leave the first generations of the art.So when someone comes along who can conceive a world that is new and unfamiliar, and who can actually deliver the illusion of being in that world, it is notable. Scott does that here (and in Blade Runner). Kubrick did it once or maybe twice; Polanski had the skills when he had an edge, but this is exceedingly rare. Note here how little quoting Scott does of prior battle in his battle scene, how Ben Hur (and all the lesser period pieces) are not at all referenced. How new this all is. (The only concession is the annoying British accent of the Romans.)What is remarkable is that it is all visual. It is not in the writing, the effects per se, or the acting, though they are all good enough. I intend to see this film several more times for just the visual experience. I suspect that because of the coherence and advance of the visual vocabulary. this will be seen as a landmark film long after Private Ryan and Titanic become footnotes.But there is also Crowe, and there's something notable here. I don't see great acting in the normal sense, but there is something else, and this seems new to me as well. To check this, I reviewed LA Confidential and The Insider. Crowe has the ability to develop tension, a normal enough skill, but he also has the ability to project this tension into the environment of the film. Watch how the scenes flow as his acting in one scene is tossed into another; it's remarkable.When he did this in The Insider, he seems to use as his resonator the unwitting, ever-bombastic Pacino. Here, He uses the similar exaggerated scope of the story, both the setting and the violence of the context.WARNING! Spoilers follow:Both Scott and Crowe seem to know what they are doing. So they have eliminated many of the elements normally required: there is no backstory, no explanation of what went before, no comic relief, just the barest of scaffolding. But in that, it is made of huge, strong girders. In another film, we'll have revenge driven by the death of the Hero's wife. Here, she and their child are gang-raped, burned until nearly dead, then crucified. In another film, the bad guy is conventionally bad, but here we have patricide and incestual rape. In another period film, we'd have lots of street scenes (which are cheap) to convey a sense of place: not so here. Nothing not essential to the core projection and resonant backdrop are used. So instead of parading the effects (as with Titanic or Jurassic Park), they are handled casually, incidentally as background. Just a huge visual sweep through which tension is passed. It is early to know, but this could be one of the great films.</fullReview>

And to be brutally frank, they'renot all that great technically. Crowe gives it his best shot, but hisopponents have to do a lot of incompetent poses to allow him to chopthem up, and for me that ruins any actual dramatic effect that theaction sequences might have had. The extended conversations are just boring. The characters are wellacted, but are sketchy and uninvolving, and I just can't bring myselfto care about any of them. And sure, Maximus has a sad story, but sowould all of his fellow gladiators, yet we don't get to hear themwhining. Rank apparently does have its priveleges even in the slavepits.Oliver Reed stands out by actually making his character vaguelyintersting, but that's the balanced by the insipid Connie Neilsonwho's utterly mundane and can't decide what accept she's trying toaffect.Gladiator is a waste of budget, time and talent. It's a greatshame that it was such a success, because it will just encourage morestudios to throw money at similar follies on the basis that no filmwith a budget in excess of 100 million dollars US has ever lost money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real stinker of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am an off and on student of Roman history. While viewing this movie again recently it struck me that almost every "fact" about the Roman Empire that this film introduces is wrong. I counted no fewer than 17 huge inaccuracies in the opening fight scene. These are important inaccuracies too, such as the cavalry charge through the woods. Try that yourself sometime and see how long it takes for you to end up with a branch in your teeth. Also, the general leaving the army to go lead a minor cavalry charge and the catapults and ballistae being used were glaringly inaccurate as well. I could go on and on just about the opening scene but the theme continues throughout the movie with inaccuracies piled on top of each other.The bottom line is, this movie only has the vaguest resemblance to the historical Rome. Once you remove the historical distortions you are left with nothing but a cheesy movie with bad dialogue. Whoever wrote this should have spent some time reading a book or two about Rome.</fullReview>

Bombastic music masking dramatic vacuum. Ridley editing like his tourette-suffering brother Tony Scott. Everything is fake, the story has no message. Killer kills as soldier. Killer kills as gladiator. Killer kills Emperor. That's it ! Art direction triumphs over realism.Spartacus is not just twice as good a film, or even ten times better. It's simply a different class of movie in every single aspect of film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst "historical" film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you know ANYTHING about the history of Rome, please do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie.Lets see: Film opening sequence. General Maximus speaks such nonsense about troops, casualties etc. The massive battle in the movie would have been fine if they didn't have archers or catapults in the scene. After that, they should have used the scene in "braveheart", instead of a film about Romans.Remember that Roman army didn't charge into combat without controlled formations? Not considering this fact, the battle is the BEST part of the film. After this incident, the plot of the movie is sooooo predictable, as if the manuscript had been written by someone with the imagination of 12 year old child.Actors then...I have only seen worse acting performed by mr. Sylvester Stallone than the Aussie playing the role of Maximus. Even a wooden log could have put more feeling into the scene when he finds his family slaughtered. Besides, he rode a huge journey in one day, came to the smoking ruins of his villa from a distance of 1000 klicks (try that yourself).And the final scene: Emperor challenging a gladiator into a duel, how stupid is that? This movie has the same value as a historical movie as Rambo III.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the very epitome of what I hate about movies. The Hollywood-ization/bastardization of what could have been a great movie. The FX and action were great, the characterization was adequate, the plot was dumb, and the ending was abysmal. Why doesn't anyone in Hollywood have the courage to take a movie where it ought to go instead of where the test audiences say it should go?This is a gladiator movie. You know what that means? It was set during the Roman Empire. During the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus. It was NOT a fantasy. When you set a movie during a historical time frame, there are certain rules you have to abide by. One of those is, you do not rewrite history on a grand scale. The main reason to set a movie within a historical context is to give it plausibility. You do not then crap on that plausibility by having the characters do things that would have caused all of history to lumber down a different path.In Braveheart, William Wallace did not rally the Scots, defeat the English, march into London, kill the king of England in a duel, and establish a democracy. Why? Because that isn't what happened; and it would have turned a great movie into a crappy movie. In Dances With Wolves, John Dunbar does not rally the Sioux nation in a war to conquer the United States, kill Ulysses S. Grant in a duel, and establish a new form of government in Washington based on Sioux practices. Why? Because that isn't what happened; and it would have turned a great movie into a crappy movie. In Gangs of New York, Leo DiCaprio's character did not face Abe Lincoln in an arena, kill him, and establish a new form of government in Washington where the Irish were the ruling class. Why? Because that isn't what happened; and it would have turned a mediocre movie into a crappy movie.***SPOILER ALERT!!!***So in Gladiator, an exiled Roman general kills the Emperor in the arena and in so doing allows the reestablishment of the Roman Republic in 182 A.D. You know what? It didn't happen that way, and it turned a great movie into a crappy movie. The makers of this movie took all the plausibility of setting and trashed it. They took a pretty good historical action movie and turned it into a suck-ass fantasy. And the better the movie is before the movie-makers pull their pants down and squat over it, the more I resent the dump being taken on it. And that's the case here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most films require that the viewer identifies with the character to truly be engrossed with the film. If you can't feel something for the character, than the audience is lost.Luckily, in Ridley Scott's case, Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders.Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast, most notably Connie Neilsen, buoy the film to new perspectives.Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotistic persona he should display, stealing every scene he's in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator.But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences which jolt the viewer right in with the opening sequences, as Maximus' true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed. Scott's camera work within these completed sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome scenes.Crowe will now get the respect he deserves for this colossal performance. Gladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours, marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL HAIL MAXIMUS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In modern times people used to be selfish, egoistic and greedy. They can do everything to reach their goals ? even they can kill their relatives. People always were the same. They never change. Even in Roman Empire people used to be such.Ridley Scott clearly knew that and decided to make a movie "Gladiator". The whole crew and cast are fascinating: Ridley as a director, Hanz Zimmer writes soundtrack, Russell Craw and Joaquin Phoenix as a main characters ? it's definitely a masterpiece!The plot of the picture is that Emperor Marcus Aurelius' was killed by his son Commode, and Commode unfairly became Emperor and made general Maximus a slave. Maximus' family was cruelly killed also by Commode. And Maximus began to revenge for justice. This movie is a big adventure of one person who didn't want to accept what is happening in his homeland. He is the only one who wanted to change something. And he changed.I am really proud that the world have such great people like Maximus. He is the one to which all people should be equal. People betray, take bribes, do unfairly things. And Maximus is impersonation of justice, devotion and all virtues. The film touched a lot of topics: politics, problems of higher and lower societies, compression of the old and new generations, respect for traditions and history and a lot of another life problems. It can be good ground for reflection. "Gladiator" ? it is like the Pacific Ocean ? very extensive and full of mysteries, intrigues and adventures.In my opinion it is legendary movie that people will watch at any time.

Every man wants to take a step forward and leave the mark of his existence, that is why Maximus is so likable - true hero. For me, the most interesting thing was how the director will show roman soldiers - and he did it well. Also it is interesting to watch how politicians work against each other. It is hard to say why I like it so much. I think, because it is fully accomplished. Vibes is essential thing for me watching this film. And I can do it again, and again, and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderfully filmed classic about a roman general turned gladiator who lives to avenge the death of his wife and child. It's a long film but it rarely drags thanks some great fight scenes and a towering performance from Russel Crowe as the gladiator Maximus. There are great performances throughout from Oliver Reed as the slave seller and an amazing performance from Joaquin Phoenix as the sniveling and cowardly Commodus. Gladiator is similar to another epic Spartacus but thanks to a superior dialogue and better fight scenes this even eclipses that great movie. It has all the ingredients a great film needs, a great cast, good story, believable dialogue, great cinematography and a great ending. There is very little you can fault this film for. Maybe it's running time but even though I watched the extended version no scene seemed superfluous. Without doubt of one of the best films of the modern era and a film that will be much loved for years to come.</fullReview>

Since the setting takes place in Rome it is captivating that terrific lines and speeches be involved and this movie showed how that works and blends with the acting by Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nelson. This movie is one the best because through out the film, the mood of the of the story is maintained just like the mood is maintained in Million Dollar baby and it doesn't slip. I feel the mood was enhanced by the music by Hans Zimmer. Of course, the fine attention to detail through set and costume really brought out the feel of the whole film and that was incredible.

Probably one of my favorite songs in movies, rivaling the Gattaca theme.Other than this, I thought there was a lot of clich and corniness, especially his final battle and death at the end and the woman's cheesy speech. I did like his after death scene where he sees his wife, though and the final lines of his Gladiator friend, where he says "Now we are free. I will see you again. But not yet."

Yes, almost all films haves messages in them but not all have a sentimental feel to the film.Ridley Scott did a wonderful job directing old Rome as best he could. The Colosseum was wonderfully reanimated. Also the actors/actress were very well casted. Crowe as Maximus gave one of the best performances of his acting career I think an Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus was very good at making me hate him.Gladiator is a film that brings us to our feet. When Crowe's character Maxumus says the line about his son and mother you cant help but cheer him on. This film is a film that gives meaning to film making. Movies like Gladiator which have great film making and character depth,love,and more stand in a Field all there own.For me Gladiator goes with films like Jaws, The Breakfast Club, and Inseption."GLADIATOR" the score is amazingly well done and i think flawless.

And the hero isn't! And most of the "Good guys" are played by Brits! If recent Hollywood epics (E.G "Braveheart","The Patriot", the one where the bloody boat sinks) are anything to go by, we English are all sadistic, devious, perverted Nazis! (Actually, the whole "need a villain, get in a Brit" thing goes a long way back- George Sanders as Shere Khan, Basil Rathbone and Alan Rickman as Sherrifs of Nottingham ) And if "Private Ryan" and "U571" are anything to go by, we just curled over and downright surrendered to Hitler without a squeak! (Mind you- does anyone remember Errol Flynn in "Mission Burma"?- plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose, as the French sometimes say, when they're not too busy collaborating with Germans (That's a joke, by the way). Oh well, it's nice to see a thoughtful film with a memorable cast and visual appeal go down well with the public. Am I the only one who thinks that cinema goers are getting a bit brighter and perceptive? I hope I'm right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shakespearean epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is pure Shakespeare. I hadn't seen it in years and tonight was my first time watching it in Blu-Ray, which just elevated it to an even higher plane. All of the technical aspects of the film are wildly impressive. The costumes, the sets, the score, the cinematography in particular was an astonishing achievement. So many shots felt like they were paintings, the actors working on some master artist's canvas. Ridley Scott crafts an epic tale of the warrior Maximus, but it's interesting how intimate the sets themselves are. The battles take place within arenas and almost the entire film is in dark hallways, cells or rooms within large structures. Even the big battle scene that opens the film is on a small field, yet Scott is able to give the film such a grand scope. It speaks a lot to his skill as a director.The blending of fantasy and reality, as Maximus is constantly looking into the afterlife, reaching out to be with his slain wife and son, is seamless and beautifully touching. We are given an inside look into what Maximus fights for, and Scott's direction is so clear in delivering that to us. It's truly some of the most precise direction I've seen, working from an immaculate script by David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson. The fact that this was an original script still blows my mind. If I had gone in not knowing that I honestly would have thought that it was a Shakespeare adaptation of some play I had somehow never heard of. Dipped in themes as old and violent as revenge, betrayal, incest and battles both physical and political, the film feels like it was ripped straight from the man himself. The dialogue is some of the best of recent years, poetic without seeming like it's trying too hard, memorable without ever becoming unnatural to it's characters.It's all played out by a tremendous ensemble, highlighted by the explosive force that is Russell Crowe. He turns Maximus into a stone badass, but in his eyes you can still manage to see a warm and honest soul. He's a good man who is forced into a dark place and the result is someone you would never want to have coming after you. As the man he's going after, Joaquin Phoenix is the ultimate slime, having so much fun in the depravity of the role but also managing to bring a surprising vulnerability to the part. I was very caught off guard the several times that I actually felt bad for his Commodus. The battles are wildly entertaining, appropriately violent and so immaculately choreographed, as is to be expected on a Scott production. Working in this genre is just another example of the superb diversity that both Scott and Crowe are capable of, and guiding this achievement is both men at the absolute top of their game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well, you should see for yourself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sword-And-Sandal Epic In Modern Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is a historical epic film directed by Ridley Scott, starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Ralf Mller, Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel and Richard Harris. Crowe portrays the loyal Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when the Emperor's ambitious son, Commodus, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murder of his family and his Emperor.A man robbed of his name and his dignity strives to win them back, and gain the freedom of his people, in this epic historical drama from director Ridley Scott. In the year 180, the death of emperor Marcus Aurelius throws the Roman Empire into chaos. Maximus is one of the Roman army's most capable and trusted generals and a key adviser to the emperor. As Marcus' devious son Commodus ascends to the throne, Maximus is set to be executed. He escapes, but is captured by slave traders. Renamed Spaniard and forced to become a gladiator, Maximus must battle to the death with other men for the amusement of paying audiences. His battle skills serve him well, and he becomes one of the most famous and admired men to fight in the Colosseum. Determined to avenge himself against the man who took away his freedom and laid waste to his family, Maximus believes that he can use his fame and skill in the ring to avenge the loss of his family and former glory. As the gladiator begins to challenge his rule, Commodus decides to put his own fighting mettle to the test by squaring off with Maximus in a battle to the death. Ridley Scott and an excellent cast successfully convey the intensity of Roman gladiatorial combat as well as the political intrigue brewing beneath.Though the digital effects lack the weight and conviction of their equivalents in old Cecil B. De Mille movies,Scott's sword-and- sandal epic has some of the intensity of old Hollywood in terms of storytelling, spectacle, and violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Gladiator' is one of those films that everyone should watch at least once. I would highly recommend it for anyone to watch simply because it does everything a good film should do:The acting is for the most part excellent, particularly Joaquin Phoenix's role as Commodus where he becomes more and more creepy as the film goes on. Even Russell Crowe performs well in this film despite being a bit over-the-top in some scenes. The supporting actors of this film all perform well and there is no one in this film who lets it down.The scenery and set designs all work well too, despite the CGI Colosseum being over-sized, the interior sets are beautiful.The music is the main aspect of this film which is truly brilliant. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard did an excellent job with this film's soundtrack, especially the track at the end of the film. This film is also shot beautifully by Ridley Scott, with the slow motion sequences at the beginning in the battle against Germania being a good example but also the tiny slow motion shots of Commodus, revealing his evil character. The story is overall very good, there are no points in the film where you are left confused and there are not loose ends.Overall, I can see why this won Best Picture at the Oscars in 2000. It brings out emotion in viewers throughout its entirety and its tearful end will stay with you for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for CompII class</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is one of the greatest movies of all time. From the plot to the way it was shot. It is one of the only rated R movies that I would recommend to a middle schooler or high schooler. the only reason it is really rated R is for its violence and gore. There isn't any inappropriate sex scenes or foul language. The movies plot is about a man named Maximus that was a leader of the Roman army and double crossed by the emperor's son who later became the Emperor of Rome. The anger and Hate Maximus has for his enemy fuels him through may epic battles in the arena. The character Maximus played by Russell Crowe is played perfectly. His look and the way Russell portrays his hate sells the whole movie for me. The way the movie was shot from the CGI Coliseum to the costumes worn gave the movie a realistic feel. The dramatic angles and editing made the fight scenes second to none in this movies genre. Gladiator is a movie that will be timeless. No doubt in my mind my children and their children will still be watching this movie. The awards this movie won could speak for themselves, but i recommend that you find out for yourself how great this movie is. I rate this movie 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic that isn't epic enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's highly acclaimed, best picture winning film seems to be the right formula for the quintessential roman epic. However, I wouldn't allot it quite that much praise. In my humble opinion, speaking that highly of this film would be giving it a little too much credit when it isn't that masterful of a film. It's good, but not that good. It's the story of Maximus, a valiant Roman soldier who is betrayed by his emperor and cast out of Rome, only to return and find his wife and son murdered. Having lost everything, Maximus is captured by slave traders and sold to a man named Proximo who is assembling men to fight in Rome's epic gladiator games. Maximus takes this opportunity to return to Rome and enact his revenge on Commodus, the evil emperor who betrayed him. The film prides itself on being an epic scale action film, using it's flashy showmanship and it's enticing bloodlust to disguise some of its dullness and its weaknesses in many areas.This is a film I really wanted to like. I really thought I could fall in love with this film, and I thought I was during some of the epic fight scenes full of bloody disgusting action that thrills and horrifies to no end. But there's a certain dullness which saturates everything else about this film so that it doesn't quite reach the heights you are expecting it to. Basically, it is your average hero's journey with every necessary archetype standing out and moving about as you would expect. There are no surprises in this film when you really feel like there should be. This film's storyline isn't inherently bad, it just doesn't offer all that it could with a story as epic as Gladiator perceives itself to be. I found myself very bored at times and never fully being able to buy into what was going on. Maybe it was in the acting, maybe it was in the dialogue, I'm not sure. Maybe it was a combination of all the factors of this film that just left me wanting more and feeling like I had been cheated out of some great potential in the end.But what doesn't leave you feeling cheated are the fight scenes. They are explosive, graphic, shocking, and wildly entertaining. Ridley Scott shoots the film with his frenetic display of camera angles and quick edits that make every fight scene incredibly intense and almost too much fun. Honestly, everything that took place in the Colliseum I really enjoyed. And that's only appropriate for a film called Gladiator, right? However, everything else I wasn't all that fond of. The film strikes no emotional chords with me, despite being a well constructed story that, in theory, exceeds expectations. The execution isn't perfect but I still respect a good story, and that's what Gladiator has at its core. Everything that surrounds it is a different story, though. The film just lacks true prowess and integrity to live up to its epic expectations. If you just take it as is then it's still a good film, but it could have been so much more.I spent this entire film going back and forth between liking and disliking it. There were things I thoroughly enjoyed and thing that just left me feeling empty and careless. In so many moments I felt like I was really going to love this film in the end, but the excitement and intrigue over this film flatlines just below a level of greatness. Gladiator isn't the epic scale story of bravery and violence, but it tries very hard to be. I wouldn't go as far to say that this is a bad film, but I wouldn't give it enough mercy to call it a great film either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic for All Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Gladiator' is the story of General Maximus. Like the famous movie tag line Maximus is the general who became a slave, a slave who became a gladiator, a gladiator who defied an emperor. It has been little more than 11 years since this movie was made and its influences and precedents are legion. More than that, it may yet be the best of all the historic Roman movies (Ben Hur, Spartacus, etc).For one, the character Maximus is a great expression of the Athenian Ideal. He is a citizen soldier, trusted leader of one of Rome's greatest armies. He serves Rome because, in Maximus' own words, he has seen much of the rest of the world, which is brutal and dark - Rome is the light. He believes in Rome and in its exalted leader, Caesar Marcus Aurelius. Maximus' defining characteristic is love - love of country, love of Caesar, and most importantly love of his family. He does not seek power nor influence, he only wishes to do his duty with honor. Russell Crowe fleshes out this character expertly, and brings a quiet soul to a very violent life. Winning the Oscar for his performance understates how timeless and beautiful an acting job he gave.His antagonist, Commodus, is quite the opposite. While Marcus Aurelius pointedly prefers Maximus, he spurns Commodus from assuming the throne because of his weakness and immorality. Joaquin Phoenix deliciously plays the corrupt and vile Commodus and creates one of the great 'characters-you-love-to-hate'. When the movie was still playing in theaters the common review I heard was 'but I hated Joaquin Phoenix'. I would ask why, and the response usually centered around how 'creepy' or 'slimy' he was. Joaquin made the villain so sinister he made us hate him, as we were meant to. Connie Nielsen gives a heartfelt and stoic turn as Lucilla, who in many ways reflects the broken heart of Rome and its hope that it can be whole again.Most movies, particularly in the modern era, tend to cast antagonist and protagonist as very similar in character and ideology save one critical, large difference. Here, 'Gladiator' gives us polar opposites: Maximus the general who fights for honor and love and idealism, Commodus who schemes and lusts for self-serving power. It makes for an extremely compelling script with a venerated supporting cast, many of whom were already well-established classical actors such as Richard Harris, Derek Jacoby, and Oliver Reed. They bring gravitas to small but critical roles and supply the weight of Roman political intrigue.Enough cannot be said for Ridley Scott's vision and direction. In so many ways, the movie is an accurate portrayal of Roman history, and in others a wild fantasy of it. He paints a grand and imposing visage of ancient Rome that is as much a character in the movie as any actor. It gives scope to the stakes Maximus and Commodus are playing for. Stylistically, the influence of this movie has oft been repeated, but never duplicated. The violence is simultaneously brutal and vague, bloody and implied. The cinematography is at times elegant and vicious, still and harried. Its a great blend that keeps your eyes glued to the screen and leaves a thin, glossy veneer that elevates the movie above slasher B-flick violence, which is precisely what gladiator fighting was. The gray tones of Germania, the warm sepia tones of Trujillo, the bright granite of Rome - a wonderful color palette that Ridley paints with to perfection. I especially like many of the Rome scenes that mix shots in half-shadow, half-light underscoring the divided, dark nature of the Roman empire.Its a stylistically transcendent and progressive movie of conscience and soul that tells a very old, classical tale. Many professional musician friends of mine did not like Hans Zimmer's music score at all, but I disagree. Its simplistic and stirring and fits the movie perfectly. It cues the audience into the horror, the tension, and the grandeur that was ancient Rome. This movie will endure because it has a timeless soul and is told artfully and truthfully. I have seen many of the 50s/60s period epics that are so revered, but I do not think they will stand the test of time as well as Gladiator will. To me, a product of post-modern cinema, those movies do not connect emotionally nor historically. Ridley Scott brought an historic grittiness to 'Gladiator' that I think will endure and, consequently, was one of the forerunners to the last ten years of cinema where movies are now revered for their gritty accuracy, rather than their bubble gum ignorance of it. Like the conflict between Maximus and Commodus, 'Gladiator' is a refined study in balance and conflict and threads this needle expertly with as poetic an ending in movies as you'll ever see. It is great now, and still will be when movie lovers not yet born discover it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is one of the most epic movies ever. Grand, bloody and violent, you will be drawn to Maximus Decimus Meridius' struggle for the entirety of the film.It starts with a concept, and Gladiator is prime film material. Historical fiction? Good and evil? Betrayal and revenge? Action? Some film concepts work, some don't. This does.The action sequences are intense, with the creative team asking themselves, "What can make this fight more nuts than the last? Chariots? Tigers?" And we look to see it. Visceral and well done, the many battles are the best part of Gladiator.Characters in Gladiator are well designed. We root for Maximus, the good guy who lost it all. We hate Commodus, the coward. We don't feel pity for the bad gladiators: they're meant to kill our hero! Maximus is well-developed for an action hero, he believes in the afterlife and has rituals.Have I mentioned how epic Gladiator is? It's size is intimidating. The gigantic opening, the first fight, and the entrance to the Colosseum... magnificent.Gladiator is one of the best pictures of the last decade, one of the best epics ever, and a deserving Best Picture winner. 9.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well crafted if not historically accurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ancient Greeks enjoyed plays, formal feasts and competitions of athletic prowess; of which the Olympic games was one. The Romans, on the other hand, loved torture and bloodsports; watching Christians being torn apart by lions or fierce gladiator fights to the death. The premise in this movie involved the murder of emperor Marcus Aurelius - a philosopher in his own right - by his son. One problem - he was not murdered, rather dying of the plague in (what is now) Vienna.Russell Crowe plays a general who had served under Marcus Aurelius and vows revenge against his "murderous" son and to instate his last wish; to hand the power of Rome back to the senate. Even though this never happened in real life, this plot device drives Crowe's character to exact revenge against the "murderer" of his master. Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) was also strangled to death in his bath by Narcissus basically because he was a vain, masochistic character.So know this information before you watch this film. It is so exquisitely made that you may be tempted to treat it as a historically accurate document.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One among my favorite movies.. it stayed number 1 on my list for many years replacing Braveheart and sliding it down on my list until is saw "Saving Private Ryan"Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less "popular" artists who also deserve a big "bravo". Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders. Connie Neilsen is gorgeous in the Movie and a real treat in the eyes. Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotistical persona he should display, stealing every scene he's in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator. "Gladiator" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but moving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score The scenery used for "Gladiator" is brilliant ? and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie;The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy.The ending is just awesome. it was simply emotional. The music is wonderfully beautiful as if Maximus' family are telling him...you have arrived. a class amongst all the movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some movies that move your spirit in an indescribable way - a way that makes you look at life differently. A way that causes you to not take your loved ones for granted, ever. Gladiator is such a movie.Gladiator is one of those movies that is the ultimate version of good versus evil. In one corner you are cheering on the protagonist, and the other your skin crawls when you see the villain.Probably Russell Crowe's finest performance, Gladiator brings us back during the time when the Roman empire was at its peak. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is the leader of the army and has just come off of a major victory. His desire is to return to his family, but Caesar's son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) has other plans for him - to continue to lead Rome as a world superpower. Where there opinions differ is in the rule - Commodus in an emperor and Maximus believes it should be given to the people The rest of the story involves Commodus's attempts to destroy Maximus because of his "betrayal" to the Roman empire. Maximus becomes traded as a slave and is forced to fight in Gladiator wars, which frequently result in death.The scene in the movie where I felt the most tension was when Commodus confronted his father about a particular issue.During this time Maximus forges a few strong relationships with his cell-mates and becomes a symbol of perseverence.Maximus is bold,courageous, and never backs down. My favorite quote from the movie is "What we do while alive echoes in eternity." Lots of great quotes throughout the movie.The music is incredible and earned an Academy Award nomination. I would describe it as being hauntingly beautiful. The scenery is breathtakingly exquisite and gives us a good idea of what it looked like at the time The cinematography is probably the best I've seen, in particular during the Gladiator fight scenes. These scenes also got my adrenaline pumping, while anxiously watching to see who would die next.The final scene of the movie is simply stunning and moving, a fitting end for a film of this magnitude.As I can't think of one thing to change, my movie review for Gladiator is 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

The scenes of the Colosseum and the gladiatorial fights are the work of a true genius. Of coarse it helps to have a great cast and Russell Crow is the perfect man to play Maximus. His performance is amazing and it leaves you totally believing in everything the Roman did or said. Joaquin Phoenix and Oliver Reed ( who died during the filming of this ) are also fantastic and deserve a great deal of credit for their displays. Gladiator contains one of the most iconic movie scenes of all time - who can forget this " My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next." Pure dramatic pleasure. If you haven't seen this since 2000 you must see it it again.

		<fullReview>Another Ridley Scott masterpiece, next to Alien, Blade Runner, Black Hawk Down etc.Gladiator packs a lot of punches and drama, with violent arena battle scenes.The film stars Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, etc.In Gladiator, victorious general Maximus Decimus Meridias (Russell Crowe) has been named keeper of Rome and its empire by dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), so that rule might pass from the Caesars back to the people and Senate. Marcus' neglected and power-hungry son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), has other ideas, however. Escaping an ordered execution, Maximus hurries back to his home in Spain, too late to save his wife and son from the same order. Taken into slavery and trained as a gladiator by Proximo (Oliver Reed), Maximus lives only that he might someday take his revenge and fulfill the dying wish of his emperor. The time soon comes when Proximo's troupe is called to Rome to participate in a marathon of gladiator games held at the behest of the new emperor, Commodus. Once in Rome, Maximus wastes no time in making his presence known, and is soon involved in a plot to overthrow the emperor with his former-love Lucilla (Connie Nielsen, Commodus' sister, after whom he lusts, and also the widowed mother of Lucius, heir to the empire after his uncle, and democratic-minded senator, Gracchus (Derek Jacobi).Without a doubt, one of the best films I've seen.Gladiator gets 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I personally wouldn't have given it Best Picture, but it is a very fine, bravura motion picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scenes of "Gladiator" are a little stodgy. The movie, like many of its genre, commences with a big battle scene in which our hero, Maximum (Russell Crowe) sets fire to a forest while storming against the enemies of Rome. The scene opens up with predictable set-up dialogue and the following battle is rather unconvincing with a plethora of strobes and far too much blurred-up slow-motion. Frankly, I also just did not care for John Mathieson's cinematography in this scene or throughout the movie (I'll agree with Roger Ebert on that note).However, after a rather uninteresting opening, "Gladiator" counterattacks with a lot of bravura and a lot of kinetic power. Ridley Scott, who has not disappointed me in the cinema yet, succeeded yet again here. He just had to come back from a lackluster opening.Following the scene I just described, Scott takes us on a (partially-true) journey in which General Maximum is betrayed by the sudden heir to the throne of Italy (Joaquin Phoenix) who smothered his father (Richard Harris) and put the penalty for the crime on the general, whom Harris had originally intended to name successor to the throne. Rather primitive motives, but Scott whips through that rather quickly and moves onto a really enjoyable saga that seems, oddly enough, more like a remake of Stanley Kubrick's "Spartacus" than of Maximus. He is captured by a slave trader (Oliver Reed) and trained to be a gladiator in the Coliseum. Phoenix wants to slay Maximus, but since the public goes for a tough gladiator, his only real method of doing so would be to pit him against tough opponents in the ring.Every now and then I'm in for a good, old-fashioned adventure tale with a fairly familiar flow and a lot of technical virtuosity. All I require is that there be a competent creative artist sitting in the director's chair. And Ridley Scott, who immortalized himself with "Alien" in 1979, is most certainly one who fits those requirements. I think Scott realized early on in production that he did not the greatest of characterization in his screenplay and that the motives of all of the characters were primitive. It's a typical jealousy-revenge tale, so instead he proceeds to give it a lot of energy and zest. He presents us a lot of scenes in which Russell Crowe is clad in armor and forced to duke it out with other gladiators and sometimes dangerous beasts such as tigers.I don't really have a whole lot to say about "Gladiator" because I said most of it when I wrote my review for "Spartacus," the picture that this one most reminds me of. That also being said, I think "Gladiator" is a very good movie, just as entertaining as the one I just mentioned, and well worth seeing. Although personally I would rather skip over that dull opening fight sequence and predictable setup dialogue and cut right to the chase. And I still think the cinematography by John Mathieson is phony-looking and ruins some of the intended historical atmosphere. But that's just me, measuring the pros and cons. The former outweight the latter.I probably wouldn't have given it Best Picture, but "Gladiator" is a very fine historical epic with a lot of bravura showmanship and kinetic energy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A potent motion picture depicting loyalty, corruption, and slavery in the most brutal, uncompromising fashion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The release of Gladiator helped significantly in consolidating Ridley Scott's reputation as a master filmmaker. His best two works are still Alien, and Blade Runner made in the early 1980s. But Gladiator has been a cause of optimism for Scott, a box-office success, as well as being nominated for twelve Oscars, bagging five, including best picture. It's a confidence booster for the premier director whose works in the 1990s have been mediocre by his own towering standards.A visual spectacle, Gladiator combines elements from Spartacus, and Ben-Hur, and is made in the tradition of classic epics, but enhanced with modern special effects technology. The result is a potent motion picture depicting loyalty, corruption, and slavery in the most brutal, uncompromising fashion, set in medieval Rome. The level of cinematography accomplished is of the highest standard, capturing Rome in astonishing detail, yet with a certain degree of credibility. The film is 2.5 hours long, but Scott keeps it tightly paced, without going overboard with fancy editing.Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix provide the two supporting pillars, carrying the bulk of the film on their shoulders, giving a powerhouse, and devilish display respectively. Gladiator would only be half as engaging without Hans Zimmer rousing, grandeur score. It's a perfect complement to the visuals. Gladiator comes at a crucial time when the epic genre seems almost non-existent since Mel Gibson's Braveheart. It started a trend of similar films such as King Arthur but those are cheap offerings that makes us appreciate Gladiator even more.SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiatorial coup de grace - moving and exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite it's historical inaccuracies Gladiator without a doubt deserves it's 5 Oscars. The story follows Maximus, a Roman general who's family is murdered after he is betrayed and left for dead. While the story echoes The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Gladiator's revenge theme is far more ambitious and poignant.Meticulous portraying the social and political issues of the time, proved director Ridley Scott, utilising David Franzoni story and screenplay, single handily brings back the sword and sandal epic that prompted a flurry of copycat films. The opening scene is astounding, the fights are incredibly choreographed, however, Gladiator is far from perfect, let down by a variety of CGI shots, the lack of grandeur that other epics have and several hollow palace scenes. That said, Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer score is exciting, emotionally moving as much as the actor's performances.Thankfully, Mel Gibson turned down the part of Maximus that Russell Crowe portrays with such conviction and energy. Even though it was Oliver Reed's last great performance and one of Richard Harris finest, as Marcus Aurelius, the new comers hold their own and are just as effective. Juaquin Phoenix. Connie Nielsen, Derek Jacobi and supporting actors are perfectly cast. Aside from the magnificent sets and locations to the cast credit it's the ability to render the viewers concern for these characters is what separates Gladiator from being an run of the mill flick.It's no masterpiece but far from a gladiatorial coup de grace. Scott's compelling Gladiator is impressive, moving and exciting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather good action adventure, not sure if it was really an Oscar caliber film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was released in the summer of 2000 and was a bit more of a film than your typical summer blockbuster. However, I am a bit surprised it won the Oscar award that year mainly because as it is not in its entirety your typical summer blockbuster it has most of the elements of one. It has a lot of action and a lot of blood, granted there is some story to it that makes it a step above mindless summer popcorn film. The movie was also a hit with an R rating which is why I will never understand why they weaken so many films these days, bringing them down to PG-13 thinking this is going to bring them more money. This one proves that you can make a ton of cash with an R rating. This along with other R films like "300", the entire Matrix trilogy, "Hannibal" (hell this one wasn't even a good movie", and a host of others yet they still insist on making most movies PG-13. Well enough of that rant, on to this film. Its story is fairly good involving the leader of an army who is basically retiring after the death of the emperor. Well his son for some reason tries to have him killed and does succeed in killing the soldier's family. Well the soldier ends up being sold and becomes a gladiator who amazes the crowd with his awesome brutality. Well he ends up competing in the coliseum where the man who had his family murder watches. So in the end a nice bloody film and one of the few best picture winners I have ever seen at the theater. I think the only other Oscar winners I have seen at the theater are "Titanic" and "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King". This one is good, I do not know if it really merited an Oscar, but I am not going to say something else deserved it that year either as I remember it being a rather weak year for movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot say that this film is really bad or really good but it just didn't do it for me. I have now watched it three times and have not changed my mind after the first time I saw it. It didn't 'feel' right and although I can safely say that a lot of time and effort went into its creation I just cannot in all seriousness recommend this film to anyone. The story line is fairly strong and most of the performances are reasonable but I was not impressed with the special effects. The special effects in my opinion did not enhance my enjoyment of the film indeed they had a negative effect on me. On my initial viewing I was also not at all impressed with the leading man. Russell Crowe in my opinion was given far too much praise for his performance. Joaquin Phoenix was adequate and some of the other performances were OK but in my opinion there was more than one person miscast in this film and overall this is not a good combination. I am not at all interested and never have been that I may be the only one who happens to be a dissenting voice. I will not be watching this film again because its not good enough to hold my attention and it does not have sufficient quality. For the first time viewer who is insistent on watching this film I would say don't get carried away by the hype surrounding this film and just keep an open mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, with slight apologies to history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is a great film, a must for anyone's library if they call themselves a student of film, history and/or entertainment in general. The film is a beautiful representation of the Rome of our dreams and a brief period, the age of Commodus, within that grand vista. The film did take several liberties from the truth: 1-Commodus was not a scheming adult but a bit of a lad when he became emperor; there is no evidence he did or could eliminate his father. 2-The man that killed Commodus was not an erudite military general but instead a crude brute wrestler, hired by conspirators to do the job. 3-His sister was not a victim of Commodus; indeed, she conspired to have him killed; he caught her 1st and had her exiled from Rome. 4-Far from being treacherous, Commodus was a relative "babe in the woods" who was assailed by conspiratorial senators who "missed" several times until that "wrestler" ended his reign, in a hot tub of all places.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>His values were the victors!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>17) Gladiator by Margot Malone on May 28 2000 10+ helpful votesI have been waiting for the big budget Roman epic ever since Spartacus...and Babies THIS IS IT!!!!Gladiator grabbed me by the gut and didn't let go...not even at the end...my body and psyche are still reverberating from its impact. The only other movie to have so visceral a reaction on me was Saving Private Ryan,for some similar reasons but more frequently for dissimilar ones. The impact of the incredibly orchesterated gladiatorial skirmishes tested my seat repeatedly but they were shot with such photographic skill and framed with such directorial insight that my body didn't go into total meltdown....unlike Private Ryans visions of carnage that ate away like acid at my very soul. Aside from the incredible photography, the intensity of the meld between storyboarding incredible angles and images that created such a sumptuous visual feast, and impeccable acting by a fine and long to be remembered cast... what stands out Most about this film are two things...The betrayal of devotion and Russell Crowe as Maximus whose will to decency and sense of honor made him a victim of the times he lived in. Good God almighty....there are few actors these days that could have brought this kind of raw masculinity to such resonance on the screen....but it is not just this that makes Crowe shine but his incredibly sensitive portrayal of Maximus as a man of the sword by his sense of duty, but a man of the soil in his heart. Crowes physicality and ability to translate Maximus to the screen is a performance worthy of an academy award...but it is Maximus who steals the show!!! His heart,his strength, his determination,his unfailing love for his family, his need for justice,...his Values are the Star of this film. He reminds me of Cyrano DE Bergerac in many ways....and I can give him no better accolade than that. There are so few role models for this age....characters like Maximus are what civilization is all about. He lived up to the heritage and meaning of his name...there is no more...there is no better...than to strive for decency, to uphold honor,to value family, to recognise duty to high ideals, to love the earth,to defend civilization at its best, and oppose tyranny,to cherish life...other lives as well as your own. Maximus was a product of his time, an honored soldier ultimately betrayed. This betrayal cost him the values he lived by for a while to pursue survival...ultimately his values were the victors...and it is they that made him a Hero. Ridley Scott has given the big screen some of its most important and enduring images from Blade Runner to Alien..on and on...he continues to amaze with his ingeniuty at getting his vision transfixed in our minds...no less so here...his use of digital imagery to create Rome and the Colloseum alive with spectators is riveting. Joachin Phoenix is a wonderfully tormented Commodus with his deep and unrequited cravings for love and approval from his sister and his father to his vicious malevolance towards Maximus...what a contrast. He is showing talent far beyond the youth of his years. And the appearance of several of my personal favorites added all the extra spice to a film I was already in love with from the first battle scenes in Germania. These additional screen luminaries and legends were Richard Harris, duly sincere and remorseful as Marcus Aurelius, Derek Jacoby as a Senator hopeful of a new Rome,and the wonderful Oliver Reed, in his last role,as an ex-Gladiator turned provider of human fodder for THE GAMES. WOW!!!This is a film NOT to be missed,and the story of a man to be remembered!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The illusion of Roman civilization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This extended version is a lot denser that what I remembered of the 2000 commercial version. The politics of Rome are explored in a lot more detail, particularly that strange power the Roman Emperor had because of his own praetorian guard that was doing absolutely everything he ordered, and took orders only from the Emperor. At the end, when the Emperor is dead or nearly dead because he is defeated and disarmed, they refuse to obey their own officer. They will obey him only when the sister comes down and legitimizes Maximus. You only meet servile people and even the Senate and the Senators are just as servile out of fear for their welfare. That could be extended to today, even if today in our democratic countries this manipulation of people is less obvious, less direct, less based on the fear of the leaders but on the fear of an external danger propped up and exploited by the leaders. Fear is still the main nerve of the crowd, and then provide them with some bread and good circus entertainment and they will follow your fears to the end of the world. The film is also extremely clear about two barbaric practices of this supposedly civilized Roman Empire. The conquest war that is not, far from it, always justified by any offensive aggressivity from the "barbarians" from beyond the frontiers of the empire. It is brutal and unequal. The advanced technology of the time is on the Roman side. Easy to win when you add to this advanced technology the military professionalism of the Roman Legion. And even so it is shown as what it is: an unclean inhumane and inhuman practice. Worse even the film shows the slave trade and the total reduction of these slaves not even to animals but to objects, properties, commodities you deal with and dispose of the way you want. What the film does not say is that the vast majority of this Roman society is composed of slaves, house slaves, garden slaves, hard work slaves, sex slaves and of course the famous gladiators, the fighting slaves. They all end in death, these slaves, a vast majority premature death imposed onto them by their masters or circumstances, but always to satisfy the desire of a free Roman citizen. The particularity of gladiators is that their end is to die in public from the hand of another gladiator or just mangled by a wild beast or some technical trap. At the top of the ladder of that death is the death decided by the Emperor himself. The film is of course extremely precise about these circus entertainments though concentrating only on the gladiators. There were many other ways to entertain the populace in the Coliseum, true entertainment always bringing death to some people down there in the arena for the real pleasure of the public. This has not changed at all, I mean the pleasure of being the witness of some gross, violent, repulsive dying process imposed onto the dying person by one or many other human beings. The only change is that it does not happen in circuses any more, and with real live, if I can say so, performances of the death of each victim. We have invented in the meantime a machine that enables us to give the illusion of seeing that and yet that does not happen for real. That is called the cinema. In the old days, the Greeks had dramatic productions for that cathartic function, but the Romans did not want anything illusionary, they wanted the real thing and they got it for several centuries with these gladiators and later the Christians, and all the time the executing in public places of all discontents, and even, when you could afford a slave, the real torturing and killing in all possible variations of your slave. We seem to forget, and this film reminds us of it, that the Roman Empire, and before it the Greek or Hellenistic empire was just based on the inflicting of death to any kind of people as the very justification of the social order, the political order or plainly your own prestige or authority. And some speak of this empire as a great period of civilization. Due to these slaves some inventions like watermills devised in the first century BCE were only exploited in the 10th century CE by the Benedictines, hence in the middle of what some call the dark ages (sorry no capital letters). A great film in this extended version.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a real hit in 2000. I can remember that in Romania, everybody was talking about " Gladiator". This was the first movie where Russell Crowe made a good impression for me (of course,at that time I didn't know that he acted in "The Insider"). The only fact I dislike is that the story presented in the movie it is not real, even if the movie is considered to be an historical one. There are some facts that really annoyed me: the battle presented in the beginning of the film takes place in Germania,but a country with this name didn't exist. "Germania" presented in the movie was a land of barbarians,not a kingdom or empire. Maximus has to fight with some tigers in a scene, but in the ancient Rome, only the prisoners used to fight against wild animals, the gladiators were fighting only with other gladiators. Even if the story is not true , the remains a real masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First time you watch this movie you are blown away by the sheer spectacle on the screen,but after repeated viewings you'll find a typical action-flick driven by the typical revenge plot of hero avenges dead loved ones. I am as everybody else impressed by the CGI effects in the movie, but compared to real thing of thousands of extras in the golden age of the Hollywood spectacle, there is no comparison. Russell Crowe is very good in his part and cuts an impressive figure,but the part doesn't allow him the opportunity for any broader characterization. The one actor who impresses in this movie is Oliver Reed. In his last role he is magnificent. Joaquin Phoenix performance as Commodus didn't impress me. He made the emperor into a pathetic human being instead of the deranged and dangerous Commodus. Connie Nielsen as his sister did an acceptable job.

		<fullReview>If you have seen Spartacus, Quo Vadis, The Robe, and even Ben Hur, then you know there is really nothing new here. Where the aforementioned films used fabulous set designs and second unit directing, this film opts to try to impress the viewer with computer generated scenes meant to impress the eye in an artificial manner. Russell Crowe seemed to have phoned in his performance on this one, and is very disappointing considering his range as an actor. His Academy Award for this film was to compensate for his loss for the film, "The Insider", in which he was truly excellent. While it was good to see old timer pros like Reed and Harris, they only served to remind the viewer of those days when Hollywood knew how to produce a spectacle through solid direction, set design, and the coordination of extras through the use of second unit directing, i.e., Yakima Canutt. A good filmed marred by Crowe's unusually wooden performance. As for Joaquini Phoenix, well, he was very good as usual, but his characterization was a repeat of Peter Ustinov's in Quo Vadis.</fullReview>

The movie should be credited with its success in the battle and hand to hand fight parts. It can be even said that Gladiator has the best ever "arena - fight" episodes. Sadly, this is all there is to this film. The entire movie is dull and apart from action parts you keep yawning and looking at your watch wondering when the next action scene starts. Weak dialogs and gloomy air is the reason for the downfall of Gladiator. I still recommend it if the cinema hall you go allows you to go to canteen and have some coke between action scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crowe wins big as Maximus in "Gladiator"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Russell Crowe earns high marks for his performance as Maximus in the heavily Oscar nominated "Gladiator". With a superb supporting cast consisting of Joaquin Phoenix, late Oliver Reed, Connie Neilsen, Richard Harris, &amp; Djimon Hounsou, "Gladiator" quickly vaulted Crowe to super stardom. The brutal battle scenes, background shots of the countryside in Rome, the costumes &amp; weaponry, &amp; the gladiator fights exceeded all expectations. Ridley Scott's masterpiece of film-making will stand the test of time &amp; should be used in film schools to teach students effective film direction."Gladiator" chronicles the story of Maximus(Crowe), General to frail Caesar Marcus Aurelius' Roman Army as well as a husband &amp; father. After a victorious battle far from home, Caesar(Harris) holds private court with Maximus to offer him his position after his passing. Overhearing this, Caesar's jealous &amp; scheming son Commodus(Phoenix) guilts his father then murders him. Commodus plots to get rid of Maximus because of his lust for power &amp; envy of his father's love for Maximus. I could go on but I would be giving away too much.To make a long story short, Maximus survives Commodus' henchmen's attack, is found near death only to be sold into slavery, loses his wife &amp; son to murder by Commodus' minions, &amp; becomes a very celebrated gladiator in the area. Maximus exacts his revenge on Commodus in the end but pays a heavy price. Maximus soon is reunited with the ones he loves most, his lovely wife &amp; son.There are no disappointments to report with "Gladiator" other than to say that Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus was not his best performance of late. He does get back on track later in "Ladder 49" which suited him much better. All in all, a very good film with beautiful cinematography &amp; background music as well. So, grab your snack &amp; beverage from the kitchen &amp; enjoy this soon-to-be classic. And hey, thumbs up!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Tale of Revenge and Power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is about revenge and the struggle between two men for Rome, one an emperor, the other a gladiator slave. The movie begins as Emperor Marcus Aurelius ends his twelve year campaign against the "barbarians" to secure the borders of the Roman empire. Following a victory against a Germanic tribe, Aurelius tells his favorite general (who is like a son to him) that he wants him to be his successor and to be the "protector" of Rome until the Senate is ready to rule. He wants Rome to be republic once more, but has reservations about whether his son Commodos is willing to give up power. The favored general, Maximus, turns down the emperor's offer because he does not feel that he has the political background to rule Rome, and because he wants nothing more than to go home to his wife and child.In less than a night, Maximus' hand is forced when Commodos assassinates Aurelius and declares himself his heir. When Maximus realizes what has happened, he refuses to give Commodos his loyalty. Commodos orders him and his family executed. Maximus escapes, but his family is burned and crucified (an execution method of which the Romans were particularly fond). Maximus is enslaved and turned into a gladiator when a passing caravan finds him at his burned out home unconscious. Gladiator fights have become very popular since Commodos overturned his father's ban on them, and the man who runs the gladiator school where Maximus is being trained, Proximo, if looking to profit from his new acquisition. Although he initially refuses to fight, Maximus soon gains fame throughout the empire, and respect from his fellow fighters, as "the Spaniard," and eventually finds himself fighting in the Coloseum in Rome.The Rome that greets Maximus is completely under the spell of Commodos, who has won the people over with spectacular gladiator matches. When Maximus become a crowd favorite, Commodos takes an interest in him (not having recognized him). As the two men meet in the middle of the arena, and "the Spaniard"'s real identify is revealed, a power shift occurs, and Commodos realizes that he can no longer kill Maximus and still keep the Roman public on his side. Maximus realizes this as well, and what follows is a beautifully orchestrated contest of powers between the two men, which culminates in a final showdown in the Coloseum, and an emotionally charged ending.Also to be commended is Hans Zimmer for his beautiful score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is along the lines of what every other comment has been getting at, but I can't stress it enough."Gladiator."...wonderful, dazzling, spectacular action scenes. Maybe the action is like that of "Troy"......but Gladiator is unique, unlike Troy, it is not cheesy...or corny for that matter. For it's genre, the epic, big screen epic film, it is unique.We get our action and our beautiful sets and all that good stuff that Troy had....but we also get wonderful acting, good directing, good music...you name it, "Gladiator" probobaly has it.Some might have gone in to the theater expecting a popcorn box-office summer hit that may get a visual effect nomination or a minor Oscar...but mixing the action that movies like Troy have, and combining it with the talents of Sir Ridley Scott, we get so much more then a summer hit.We get an Oscar winning, unique, wonderful film....and even if one can not see what is so unique and non...cheesy about this film, then they can just enjoy the action, right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I just have to say that the first time I saw this movie I was so captured by it. Russel Crowe did an amazing job as Maximus and for that he is one of my favorite actors.The way Riddley Scott manages to set the setting into the Roman Empire is truly fantastic. You have everything you have ever thought about as typical roman, and Riddley manages to put it all together perfectly. The best thing about the movie is the emotional part. The movie stir up strong emotions, especially at the end where it's like Riddley unleashes a combination between thrill, excitement and sadness. If you somehow haven't seen this movie, and you are reading this comment, I shall not reveal anything. All I say to you is: Sit back, enjoy the perfect combination of emotion, entertainment, and last but not least the thrill of your life. Be sure to turn off everything that can disturb you, and MAKE SURE YOUR STEREO IS WORKING PERFECTLY! YOU NEED GOOD SOUND! If you haven't seen it. SEE IT. If you have seen it.

As for Crowe: if you have any doubts about his acting ability, please see Romper Stomper (1993). His character in that movie, the charismatic but terrifyingly cold leader of a gang of skinheads, is the polar opposite of the one he plays here in Gladiator.The soundtrack, insipid new age vocals, is so bad it nearly ruined the movie for me. What starts out embarrassingly anachronic, by climax just grates. Scott managed to get competent innovative sound out of Vangelis for Blade Runner, so what's up here?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Guy's Night Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the guy's movie. No way around it. There's armies in combat, there's a father and son drama, there's gladiators (no duh, in a movie called Gladiator), there are women in skimpy outfits, and by the end, more violence. Not that any of this is bad. You just need to know what to expect when seeing this 2000 Oscar winner for best picture. Oscar winner Russel Crowe plays Maximus, a general in the Roman army who is next in line to be ruler of Rome, as the rightful Emperor-to-be Commodous (Joaquin Phoenix) is bypassed by Caeser Marcus Arillias (Richard Harris) in his final attempt to bring back to the old republic. After the Caesar's death, Commodous orders the execution of Maximus, which begins the epic portion of Gladiator. By the end of the movie, scores are settled, more battles are won, legacies are sealed, and every man in the audience has seen everything he could have wanted. No romance here, so the ladies will have to rely on seeing Russel Crowe running around without much clothes on. The best performance for my money is by the late Oliver Reed, who died while filming was in progress. Reed plays an emotionally unattached slave trader who trains Gladiators to fight in Rome. The movie looks good, for the most part. The computer generated Rome leaves something to be desired however, as the buildings look metallic and cold and some of the people watching the Gladiators are out of focus and not wearing togas. For shame, no togas!!! It's a great man's movie which have some small faults to it, but still good nonetheless.</fullReview>

Russell Crowe was a brilliant casting choice and his performance is excellent, further proving himself as a force in Hollywood. I did feel however, that the side story of Commodus' life after the death of his father was perhaps a little too dark and complicated, but hey, that's just me !</fullReview>

It had action to keep men involved and the love and sensitive family issues for the women. Although, not totally historically accurate (i.e. purple everywhere instead of red) I felt the setting was overall great. It made you feel like you were actually seeing the Roman Empire.The character of MAximus is a strong one. He is also very human like in his emotions and decisions.

		<shortDescription>Another Incredible Ridley Scott Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" [2000] is another great directing feat for one of the Scott brothers (Ridley, this time). The story is a very touching one, though rather violent (as are most of the Scott bros. films) that takes place in the latter half of the second century. Russell Crowe's dynamic performance as Maximus, the drafted general who wishes for nothing but peace and a safe return home to his wife and children. Richard Harris is great as the dying Caesar Marcus Aurelius, who is a good friend of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix also delivers an incredible performance as the emperor's son, Commodus (and he really looks the part); Connie Nielsen plays his beautiful, more intelligent sister.===SPOILERS=== After a great victory in Germania, Maximus requests leave to return home to his family. The Emperor, however, does not want to simply give Maximus away: He wishes Maximus, not his own son Commodus, to rule Rome in his stead, for he sees that Commodus is unfit to rule. Maximus cannot decide just yet. But when Marcus Aurelius tells Commodus of his choice, Commodus kills his father out of depression, and perhaps failed ambition to rule. Claiming his father has passed, Commodus takes command then and there. Maximus, however, sees right through Commodus and intends to inform the Senate of the Emperor's slaying. He is stopped and taken into the forest for execution (only real story flaw). He fights his way out of that and rides home, only to find his fields ablaze, his house raized, and his wife and young son crucified on their porch. Not long after, he is taken by a convoy of slave-herders out to a remote desert city where he and others are trained to fight as gladiators. Maximus fights his way through all others with the cream-of-the-crop, and is even befriended by his owner, a former gladiator himself, Proximo. He plans to have Maximus and the rest of his gladiators go to Rome to engage in combat before the masses, and the Emperor himself, which is what happens. Maximus is clearly the best of them all, which is recognized by Emperor Commodus. He comes down into the arena to meet with the mysterious champion. Hesitantly, he removes his mask, states exactly who he is, and essentially calls Commodus out, but in a way only he would understand. Commodus' nephew, of his sister, idolizes Maximus, which leads to his mother meeting with Maximus. Eventually, they scheme to spring Maximus from his cell, ride out to his hopefully loyal former army, charge the imperial palace, and give rule of Rome over to a willing Senator. The plan goes awry when Commodus and his spies hear word of the plan. The senator is arrested; and Maximus and his fellow gladiators fight their way out, suffering heavy losses, and only for Maximus to be captured. He is held until Commodus can finally decide what to do: He will fight Maximus in the Colosseum. But before they do, he wounds Maximus to weaken his strength and help himself win. The fight ends with Commodus slain under his own dagger by Maximus, who soon collapses and passes himself. ===SPOLIERS===I suppose the moral of this movie, if there is any, is "Victory in life or death, neither is sweeter." I think is a great film, probably the best of 2000, one of the best films of this decade, and the performance of Russell Crowe's career, except for "A Beautiful Mind." One of Ridley Scott's best directorial achievements. 8 out of 10 starsR for Intense, Graphic Combat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is indeed one of the top ten best movies ever produced today, I would say. The magnificent battle scenes with the crowd of the enormous Colosseum, interferes with the sad story in a splendid way, that takes your breath away for almost the entire movie. There couldn't possibly be any better actor to fill the place of the great gladiator with, than Russell Crowe (Insider). Maybe an even better, or at least as good as Crowe though, was the old actor Richard Harris, who unfortunately died a few years after playing Marcus Aurelius in Gladiator.I really like this one, and I will keep saying that it's a masterpiece in every way. Thumbs up for Gladiator!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, most of it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen 'Gladiator' a couple of times now and I still think it is a very good movie. But the more you see it, the more you notice little flaws. The story is about a general Maximus (Russell Crowe) who is chosen by emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) to become protector of Rome after his death. Instead he becomes a slave because the son of the emperor, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), kills his father before anybody knows his wish. Maximus is sold as a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed) and he trains gladiators. Maximus has to make the crowd love him to make it to the Colosseum, to face Commodus who thinks Maximus is dead. Most of the story is fictional.There are a lot of good things in this movie and they almost make you forget the bad things. The movie opens with a battle between the army of general Maximus and a Germanian army. The set-up is great. We see how the Roman army is preparing for battle, with a lot of little details, and how the Germanian army arrives at the battlefield. After this the actual battle is a disappointment. Where everything looked great right before it all started, you can hardly see anything during the battle. Here the editing, cinematography and even direction or not very good. The only thing that is still great are the costumes. I admired them in every shot of the movie.After this the real story, the one I told you above, begins. Most of the things from here on are very good. Russell Crowe is great as Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen, who is Commodus' sister Lucilla and an old love of Maximus, are very good as well and veterans as Derek Jacobi (as Senator Gracchus), the late Oliver Reed and the late Richard Harris simply disappear in their characters. The animated Rome looks great and new in one way but therefor a little too perfect, too animated, in another way. The battles in the arenas are pretty good, although the last one is a little too much fiction. You will know what I mean. The ending is the one you expect, a real Hollywood ending, but it doesn't spoil the movie.Last but not least I want to mention the music by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. This is one of those scores you will remember. It is perfect in every scene of the movie. This beautiful score, great acting, a fine direction by Ridley Scott and some exciting battles make this movie very entertaining and still one of the best movies of 2000.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched this movie, I was expecting everything it promised: "A Spectacular Historical Epic From Ridley Scott" But after seeing it, I can't understand the reception it got (four Oscars!). As far as I can tell, it was a botched attempt by Mr.Scott to create a historical epic of Braveheart proportions, and since Mel Gibson turned it down in favor of The Patriot, took the next Aussie in line, Russel Crowe. But the casting is the least of the problems, as the story seems derivitive and uninspired, which usually leaves it to the special effects and editing to carry the film. Sadly, even these are quite amature and ineffective. There where many times I couldn't believe I was watching a Scott film, for a tight picture and perfect visuals have become his trademark. If you want my opinion, don't even waste time on this failure, there's much better ones out there. 1/10</fullReview>

Is this old man Marcus Aurelius,the warrior-philosopher-emperor?I don't think so.He spend his reign constantly fighting to defend and expand the empire.He never finished fighting actualy.Rome was not out of enemies.The Picts in northern Britain,the Germans in the North,the competitive Parthian Empire in the East and the restless Arab raiders in the South hardly left him any piece.And this movie claims it was all for nothing and that a republic could be better?Absolutely not? Who the hell is Grachus?Pertinax was the next emperor and he was an army officer not a man of the declined Senate. And about gladiators they were not only slaves.Many of them were free man who were searching for glory,fame and most of all money. Why does Hollywood have to ridicule history?And what a false praise to Republics.The Roman Empire survived with its original capital between 27 Bc and 476 AD and continued to survive without it.What Rebublic ever survived 503 years?This movie is a disgrace considering it's plot and it's messages.</fullReview>

Talk about woeful miscasting - Mr. Phoenix is atrocious (he is so much better in Clay Pigeons, and U-Turn). I can hardly watch him anytime he is on the screen. And what's with Lucilla's son? He looks like a pre-pubescent Adrian Lyne circa "Fatal Attraction". I disliked the score by Hans Zimmer - yet another component of a film that yearns to be epic, but isn't. Disappointing also in it's outright theft of Gustav Holst's "The Planets". Lisa Gerrard's beautiful voice is unquestionably suited for a vast, cinematic opus. This isn't it. This film suffered from too much explaining of it's special effects. Knowing how fake the Coliseum is with it's liberal use of CGI robbed me of any awe it could have produced. I didn't like the slow-motion effects in the opening battle scenes. And the dog jumping through fire? Please. A film that should have been great, but is just another over-hyped (but I did love the Kid Rock trailer-music promo), poorly executed waste of two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Hur Lite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is an infuriating movie, an immensely overrated Ben Hur light that is clearly a graduate of the Armageddon school of filmmaking. Nevertheless, it does some things very well. And this is the problem perhaps. The combat sequences are a sight to behold, as exhilarating in their beautiful bloodshed as anything Ridley Scott has ever done (and he is the American master of beautiful bloodshed). But the drama that connects these sequences seem only filler, existing only to move us (sometimes in a most incoherent way geographically speaking) to the next moment Russell Crowe gets to bear his teeth and fight another battle. But how is this a good movie? If anything Gladiator is more of a punched up, swords a blazing series of dance numbers. The drama rests on the shoulders of a one note performance by Russell Crowe, whose core emotion seems to be one of grimace and pout. He is a character who has one desire and one desire only: revenge. Many critics loved the intensity of the performance but why? A complex, interesting character should have complexity to them. But this character has no complexity, no range of emotions: he is a Stallone character trapped in an art film.Joaquim Phoenix, on the other hand, was a delight, an over the top sociopath who brings a few precious moments of levity to an otherwise drab, ugly, and humorless film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Sorry" to Russell Crowe's "Insider"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason that Russell Crowe received the best actor award at the Oscars is for "Gladiator" is to make up for not giving him the award for his performance in The Insider the year before. A charismatic actor, Russell Crowe was the only reason to watch this overrated movie. I've lost faith in the Academy for their past choices when it comes to their "Best Picture Award". "American Beauty" and "Unforgiven" were the only winners that truly deserved the award. Though supposedly historically correct, the story does not offer anything to be impressed about. Russell Crowe's character "Maximus" is unbelievably noble (Spaniard with Australian accent?) throughout this 3 hour movie. Even his brutal killings (to prove what point?) are designed to be admired. All the characters are one-dimensional and dialogue is clich?d to the point of being ridiculously fun (not a good thing).*POSSIBLE SPOILER*A general wins a battle, loses everything (position as general and family) and climbs up the ladder of success to face the evil emperor to a predictable end... Death.The story is the least of this movie's problems when compared to the battle scenes. The camera moves too quickly and misses it's aim most of the time (horrible, even if it was intentional). This is what you get when you pace the camera for a gunfight instead of a swordfight. Editing is even worse than the cinematography if you examine it closely enough. A scene in which a sword is taken by Maximus from an opponent is unbelievably screwed up. After all of that, we are exposed to a rollercoaster ride in which the rails have loose screws.Yet, after all it's flaws, majority of the people like this movie. Why? Add it's box-office competition when it was first released with a barrage of more horrible movies plus advertising and promotion plus DVD with special features designed to make people admire it even more plus Russell Crowe with Meg Ryan equals "Movie of the Year". It's difficult to disagree with majority but this is very overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Weep For American Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything there is to be said about this movie has already been said, so I will keep my comments brief. "Gladiator"'s musical score is breathtaking; the rest of the movie, in all other facets, is garbage. If you generally like what the majority of the American population likes, you will enjoy this movie. If you usually prefer films with competent direction (including action scenes where you might actually *GASP* be able to see the action), intelligent dialogue (it took three people to write this?!), professional acting (brilliant death scene Russell...you really deserved that Oscar), or special effects that seem even remotely realistic, you may wish to look elsewhere. The latest in a long string of inane Best Picture choices, this is by far the worst in the history of the Academy Awards.The only consolation for myself and those who share my opinion is that in twenty years, "Gladiator" will come to rest in the same category as "Rocky" and "Kramer vs Kramer"--not that there were any "Taxi Driver"s or "Apocalypse Now"s released in 2000. If this is a sign of things to come, the future of cinema in the United States will be very grim indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film being confused as a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie basically came off as I expected, a good film, fun to watch with a lot of eye candy. However, a great film it is not nor will it ever be (let's see what history has to say). The script is horrid and predictable. Crowe does his job, maintain a dark and quiet intensity throughout the film (much like L.A Confidential, a projection that he did even better in that film than in Gladiator). The character of Commodus, with all of his flaws, was perhaps the most inept bit of scriptwriting I have seen (in a film that is supposed to be of high quality with great writing). Some have said that he lets down his guard and shows us a pitiable side (and a depth of character). There is nothing that comes across as pitiable. He wallows in self-pity, and when combined with his depravity as a human being, there is nothing there to like, nevermind find sympathy for. The script took an easy way out by giving us an antagonist that is far too easy to hate. If there was anyone deserving of a "best supporting actor" oscar nomination, it was Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius and not Joaquin Phoenix. All in all, it was a good film, fun to watch, not quite as nice on the tv screen as the movie screen, and definitely not deserving of a best picture nomination (take off chocolat and gladiator (saw all 5 nominated) and put up Almost Famous and Billy Elliot for the award...now those are great films and worthy of the honor).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maximus waste of effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who applaud this movie do so for it's excitement and action. Those who denounce this film focus on the derivative plot, lack of character development, campy special effects, and sub-par acting. I choose to be with the latter group.This film is worth seeing, in the theater alone, but please don't expect a masterpiece. Gladiator's massive decor is entertaining viewed on a large screen, but that's where the film's success ends. The plot took quite a few ideas from BraveHeart, Spartacus, and other epic period pieces of the past, but in this case, had nothing new to add. I would like to stay away from the comparison's to BraveHeart, but the similarities between this film and the former Oscar winner is too common. Another highlight of the film is Phoenix's character, Commodus. If you don't already know, the commode's namesake was this Caesar, so you can basically conjure up the outcome of this evil emporer.I highly recommenend this movie if you enjoy 'neat' fighting scenes and 'cool' special effects. But I am still baffled from the fact that this picture is receiving so much attention from the Acadamy Awards. This film, like Titanic, will not stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well recorded sound on DVD, little else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented Gladiator (1) to try out my new home theater speakers (upgraded from "2.1" to "5.1") are any good and (2) to see if Roger Ebert is right, whether this could be the worst movie ever to win the "best picture" academy award. The answer to both my questions is "yes."Wow, this flick really sounded great on my stereo, dts encoding a special treat! Even the perfunctory and unremarkable "epic music" sounded good. I was able to tune up all 5.1 of my speakers, so don't touch my levels, I got them set just the way I want 'em. And now, the bad news.Gladiator is overlong, overdirected, underscripted, and totally forgettable (aside from a being DVD showcase). It's hard to make a good epic. Spartacus this ain't. Moreover, as good as the sound was, the visual effects looked artificial. The tigers in one of the fight scenes were particularly cheesy. In the action sequences, it looked like the actors were filmed as they moved slowly, and then were restored to real speed through mechanical/digital means... this makes everything well focused, but ironically, a perfectly focused swinging forearm w/broadsword looks more like claymation than reality.The acclaim of this movie doesn't astound me--people like gladiator movies. Indeed, all I kept thinking of as I watched was Peter Graves' line from "Airplane": "Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?" Hey, at least I got a laugh when I thought about this... 2.5 hours of total humorlessness is tough on a viewer. "Saving Private Ryan" had more laughs than Gladiator. Oh wait... the exploding firebombs in the opening fight scene had me howling. I love anachronism.Such an oh-so-serious tone should be saved for the likes of Schindler's List or Judgment at Nuremberg. Gladiator fails at profundity. In trying to be an action flick, it fails worse--it's an hour too long. As an ode to history, I have no idea--I have problems identifying, much less cheering for, the "good Romans" of the reign of the Caesars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Long And Not Very Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In German there is a good expression for movies such as Gladiator (G): "Historienfilm" -- it means that it is a movie which has a historic backdrop, but is not a movie ABOUT history. What worries me is that many people will think that G is realistic, that the historic context of it or even the entire story are accurate, which is not the case.I found the movie definitely too long -- it would be much better if it had been cut by 45 or 60 minutes. The story line was too pompous, without much suspense, and ordinary. The "look and feel" (camerawork, lighting, sound track, decoration, casting, etc.) is high quality, though too glossy and commercial - like for my taste. As for believability -- oh well. Maybe seen from America ancient Germany is just a quick horse ride away from Rome and right next to a gladiator training center in the middle of the desert, but trust me -- it is not. And I do understand that there has to be a bad guy, but did it have to be a hare - lipped, father - killing, sister - fancying, paedophile dictator? And did the good guy have to be such a sickly - sweet mixture of George Washington, Rambo and Walt Whitman? And -- on a slightly jingoistic note -- if the ancient Germans were such club - swinging barbarians ("hunh? cavalry attack from back, that no fair"), how come the Romans never did capture the territory?Conclusion: if the movie had been shortened, I would have found it OK to watch on the small screen (rental or free TV). As it is, I did not like it. And I find it depressing that such a great director as Ridley Scott seems to have dedicated himself to producing glossy, mind numbing garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its a joke that this film is up for an Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oscar material? Hardly. Gladiator is at best a "B" level action flick. This film is filled with endless scenes of gore and mayhem, which hardly constitute acting. It is the typical B level flick with tension building to the inevitable encounter of good guy and bad guy, which good guy obviously wins. Crowe walks around for 2 hours and 35 minutes with a semi-pained expression, but not saying much and certainly not acting. A further disservice of this movie is the way it warps history. Marcus Aurelius died of the plague. His son, Commodus, ruled for 12 years and although he was insane and did enter the arena, he was murdered elsewhere. The final Germanic wars of Marcus Aurelius were fought on the Danube frontier and I don't know how you go from the Danube to Italy via a desert, unless you're miserably lost. Which is sort of the theme of this movie. People see this and think they're getting a history lesson rather than just junk. I can easily think of ten movies this past year which had more meaning, intellectual content and stronger acting than Gladiator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the good things about this movie: costumes, set, decorations, and locations, and an excellent beginning fight sequence.Otherwise, I have to agree with others that this is a poor movie with a weak story. Every character was one-dimensioned and shallow: Russel Crowe as a honorable warrior-family man who who cannot be corrupted by power, Richard Harris as an aged ruler who realizes his legacy should not be about the size of his empire but about the people, Joaquin Phoenix as a conflicted boy who feels unloved by his father, so on and so forth.Ridley Scott is contrived and conventional. *Possibler spoiler* Case in point: on a deleted scene on the DVD where Lucilla admits that Commodus may have to die to save the Roman Empire. Scott says this was the first time Lucilla expressed her ambivalence regarding her brother and Scott decided to delete the scene say so he can stretch the ambiguity. Hello - was that ambiguity not painfully obvious after we see them together for 10 minutes!?Hans Zimmer music does not help other - the score sounded like `Lion King' plus `The Prince of Egypt' without the musical numbers.Overall, the film is problematic and a disappointment. I rank it a 5 out of 10. Watch it for the mise-en-scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Narcissistic Exploits of Capitalist-Pig Producers In the Hunt for a Quick Buck!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film, laughingly called Gladiator, there's all the glitz and glamour, the sets and costumes, the special effects, and actors necessary to make a decent film, but they completely miss the mark. Well, you've probably seen this movie and you're thinking to yourself, I don't see how someone could say that... And on the surface, the film does have two redeeming aspects... the cinematography, which I must admit is awesome, and Russell Crowe in a little blue dress. However, this beautiful, big-budget movie lacks one seemingly minor, but key element: a substantive plot. Although excessive violence, a forced hero, a sexy heroine, and a stint with incest may look like the makings of a great film, Gladiator would only measure approximately twenty-five minutes if you removed all the fight scenes. You could probably get more plot from watching the Superbowl than watching this film. In the first ten minutes of the film you know exactly what will happen in this movie and how it will end. We've all seen this movie before with a better leading man, a smarter heroine, a crueler and more tyrannical ruler, and an actual plot. It's called BRAVEHEART and it won five, count 'em FIVE Oscars! This piece of trash that calls itself a movie is not even fit to be considered Braveheart's little sister. First of all, Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe) is not there to save his people. He's there simply to get revenge on Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), a ruler who's only concern is lifting the skirt of his babalicious sister, a woman who just happens to be madly in love with Maximus (shocker there). Why does Maximus want revenge? Hmm, because his beloved wife and son, people who are barely in the movie and hence receive little pity from the audience, are savagely butchered. Haven't we seen this before? So Maximus is forced to fight for his life. Yada yada yada. This lasts about two hours. He does the usual stuff... He kicks ass, makes adversaries into friends, and shows off his shapely legs in a little powder blue dress... most fetching. Then obviously, he faces the odious Commodus in a final fight scene so that he may unleash his terrible wrath. Woo. And he is, much like William Wallace, killed and reunited with his dearly departed. Filmmakers today think that they can pass off a movie that everyone's already seen as something new by dazzling them with sparkly lights and flashy special effects. I'd like to point out that basically everything from Braveheart, even the Australian-accented Russell Crowe trying to be Mel Gibson, has been replicated but as with most copies, it ain't as good as the original. And yes, this year's movie-pickings have been slim, but that doesn't make it good by default.</fullReview>

You can tell where they are, which is too bad. In a year with better movies (hardly a bold statement, and its not like they get much better), this wouldn't be considered for anything.

		<shortDescription>Common Historical Misconceptions Clarified: (just the facts, ma'am)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ESSENTIAL TO THE PLOT and you might want to know:Commodus did indeed fight gladiators in the arena. Sort of a fixation thing. Needless to say, he arranged to win -- yes, *every* time. Insane emperors were dicey. *Stupid* emperors simply did not go the distance.Roman citizens were *never* enslaved within the empire (this includes Spain), no matter what they did. Never. They were executed in Rome (for major treason) or banished (for anything less). Stray slavers did *not* just pick up tired or wounded folks left on the road. Any Roman citizen would 1) have on a ring of citizenship to proclaim his inviolability or 2) be given every courtesy once declared. Citizenship was precious and worth many lives -- you did *not* mess with Citizens of Rome. This was *not* a democracy. Maximus would *never* have been enslaved on such a ridiculous pretense. Sheesh.Make no mistake: The ARMY was the *real* power in Rome. --They had the swords-- *Not* the unarmed populace (this is laughable). *Not* the solitary emperor. Proof? The entire Roman Empire was auctioned to the highest bidder by the Praetorian Guard (the only armed troops within the city) 1 year after Commodus and his shortlived successor were murdered. Beyond the guard, the greatest threat was a successful general with a vast and loyal following in the legions. And the army outnumbered the Praetorians. By a LOT. So just imagine Maximus getting hauled away for execution within sight of his vast, victorious and worshipping army. WITH Commodus in the camp. Ridiculous. 'Might' wins every time. Commodus would never have been so idiotic as to have even approached his camp. His father, yes. He did actually attend this battle. He was secure. But Commodus? Ridiculous.Roman generals were quite politically sophisticated. This was part of the job as the upper eschelon of Roman power. NO Roman general would have so annoyed an 'emperor elect' as Maximus did when he refused to shake hands with Commodus. No Roman general could have been so politically inept. No Roman general would have expected this rebellious gesture to be ignored. And where are the Preatorians (right here near the emperor!) and where are the army (10 feet away)? This is not only a tactical, but a strategic event. Think here! It's what generals do best. Give EVERY successful Roman general credit for his survival instincts. ANYone (even a slave) at this juncture would have done the required thing (shake hands) and then MET HIS ARMY to engineer a coup. He needed his (vast, victorious, worshiping) army to acquire power. No Roman general (no human being!) would have been so dense as to make a damning futile gesture when his power base was only 10 feet away celebrating a major victory, just waiting for him to make his move. Sheesh.EXTRANEOUS TO THE PLOT, but you might want to know (the credits clearly state this movie is fiction):You were hoodwinked if you thought that battle scene was realistic. The Roman army was primarily effective because of its supremely structured and disciplined front *line*. Barbarians fought as a mob and were often defeated even if outnumbered several to one--simply because they could not break that line. The chaotic beginning battle scene is straight out of the Middle Ages and has *nothing* to do with Rome. You saw a classic 'free-for-all' (or 'melee') out of the age of knights. Fun, but not Rome. Romans would have held their line and moved foward as an intact, solid unit, thrusting ecnomically upward with their short swords (never meant for this wasteful barbarian 'swinging' business) as they went.Romans fought only to secure Rome and make some denarii. Glory was *not* part of the program. Forget that. Remember: Barbarians overran Rome in the end--they never stopped being a threat, esp. the Germans. AND Romans became *very* venal once conquest began. GREEDY and SCARED. That about does it. Skip that glory bull. They sure did.Regarding Maximus fighting hand-to-hand in the beginning battle. Julius Caesar occasionally fought so when his troops needed some fortitude (granted as infantry, not horsed). We remember this because it was unusual. Perhaps Maximus was unusual also. (?)The Republic was so long and so deeply dead that it is *comedy* to suggest that Maximus (or even Jupiter) could bring it back. Senators had been merely pawns since Octavian. It could not have been brought back 200 years earlier, either. It was also *not* a democracy--not by a long shot. This is pure Hollywood playing to your emotions. Slavery was so part of the infra-structure that the revolt of Spartacus (in Julius Caesar's time) ended with 6,000 slaves crucifed every 1,000 feet on the major road out of Rome (the Appian Way). Not exactly democratic. Think about it. You going south for a vacation this summer? Nice view.Romans did not kneel to pray. They stood and covered their heads with their toga. And their idols were *not* tiny little figures of their immediate family. The idea would be shocking to a Roman.Marcus Auraelius named Commodus as his heir when his son was 5. Commodus reigned for 12 years. Indeed, he was *not* a nice person.Skip the stirrups. They arrive much later.Above? just the high points. Read others in this list for more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judging from the box office, entertaining the mob with gore still works as well now as then. So well that most folks disregard the ludicrous storyline, lame characterization and historical inaccuracies.I give this movie a 6 for excellent manipulation of the crowd, exciting (if overdone) fight scenes and for making a tremendous spectacle of itself. And I bet it will win an Oscar because it does so well what Hollywood values most - As a previous reviewer states `you could almost smell the blood.'-SPOILERS-LUDICROUS STORYLINE/LAME CHARACTERIZATION: Great Roman General takes a *very* sudden fall, somehow becomes a slave, then a depressed gladiator, then hugely entertains the Roman rabble (and us) with his blatant defiance of the Emperor.Oh any Emperor would just sit right down for that, especially one psychologically resembling Caligula. This particular Emperor doesn't off this insolent guy supposedly because the mob rules Rome and they like him. Well, the mob is notoriously fickle, as well as easily led. I'm sure any creative Emperor could work something out. (Check out the storyline of this movie if you don't believe me.) Besides, it's the army that rules Rome. As Pompey so succinctly explained, they have swords.First off, Marcus Aurelius (reputedly a wise and canny philosopher) decides his amoral (read insane) son will just say "Oh, ok dad. Guess I won't be Emperor ?cause you say so. No problem you like Maximus better." NO one could be that naive, even in the movies.Then a great Roman general becomes a slave. Here's how: He intentionally ticks off the new Emperor, escapes from the Emperor's minions through his eXcellent fighting, then stumbles around wounded and in a daze for a *really* long time, somehow crossing half a continent without shelter, food, water, sleep or a change of scenery, and eventually reaches home (Spain). Or something. `If you go home wounded you will become a slave?' Guess he didn't have any friends or neighbors in the area.Then, once Maximus reaches the pinnacle of his gladiator career, some Senators and the army want to support him in a coup. Wouldn't this coup have been a *lot* more realistic back there on the Germanic battlefield, *before* the slavery bit? But Maximus missed his chance. Instead, he childishly gestured defiance to the new de facto, *patricidal* Emperor without even consulting his power brokers, the army, who happened to be on site celebrating a major victory. Could any great Roman general be this politically inept or have such underdeveloped survival instincts? Besides, it would have saved him a long walk and a lot of grief.We also have the ruthless slave master Proximo (kudos Oliver Reed, RIP) who sells the goose who layed the golden egg because he develops higher ideals. He just suddenly loses interest in profit because he *likes* this guy? I have a sneaking suspicion that people who habitually and mercilessly exploit others do not suddenly become kind hearted, even for someone who reminds them of themself at that age.Last and best, a sniveling, cowardly Emperor intentionally stages a final public battle in which he takes on the world's greatest, undefeated gladiator single handedly. (Ok, so the gladiator isn't 100 percent here.) Now it is an historical fact that Commodus fought some tough gladiators in the arena. Weird but true. But would *this* character have done so? I just can't believe it, no matter how much of a tantrum he had because everybody liked Maximus best.HISTORICAL INACCURACIES: It says this is fiction in the credits. Still...I don't care how decayed the Roman military system was at the end of the Pax Romana, I imagine they could hold a line in battle better than *that*.As for fighting battles purely for the ?Glory of Rome,' even King Arthur wasn't so fatuous. How about to protect Rome from the barbarian hordes (clearly a continuing threat) and for *financial gain*?And various Senators (to say nothing of Marcus Aurelius!) want to reestablish the Republic? They hadn't had any real power since Augustus. It was just a ceremonial post that could bring in some bucks if you played your cards right. And reestablishing the Republic is laughable. They were all a little too busy trying to stay alive to worry about reactionary revolutions. Besides the army would never have cut off their own power base voluntarily. And they had the swords.Hey, but lots of shots of Russell Crowe sans shirt though!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this film my generally neutral attitude to Fall of Roman Empire (the film the Gladiator is almost a remake of-at least the same period and the same characters, almost the same beginning and the end) to almost an admiration. Almost forty years ago they made a watchable, highly spectacular film, with no pretention to be more than a big costume drama, with a wonderful star cast and the magnificent Sophia Loren in the midst of it. What about the gladiator? special effects used to restore the ancient rome are very good. And film is a good sample of new technical solutions for historical films. But apart from this The Gladiator has nothing to be proud of. I can say that there are at least 2 reasons for a film-addicted person like me to dislike it:1. The story. This is not even a drama, this is melodrama, plot lines concerning children and Christianity are very weak and can be used as a samples (in comparison with the above mentioned nice film of sixties) of incrreasing religiousness and family values addiction of Americans (the trends that may be are not bad as just a social-cultural phenomena but have a very bad impact on cinema). The development of the story is very flat and predictable, (europeans,especially french, often make some new interpretation of old movie themes, but always add something new and original not just to filmmaking process but to the story as well. The story of Gladiator is to polished,well known, reserved, making impression that its makers were doing everything to avoid any originality and interesting moves. 2. The cast. Well, its nod bad, but the main character looks more rather like rugby player than roman general, though his acting is rather good(though not an Oscar-worthy), Mr. Phoenix visually is rather a good type for the Emperor, but all the rest are very boring and unappealing, including the main fimale character (good looks, good acting, but.. not Sophia Loren), It was especially disappointing to see a very bleak and unimaginative acting of great actors of the elder generation (Richard Harris and late Oliver Reed).Finally I must say that the director of this film, Mr Riddley Scott who made several very good films in his early career started loosing imagination in 90-ies. All his last films have a very promising plot, but a rather ordinary solution. Unfortunately The Gladiator is not an exception.</fullReview>

I sit alone however on the other side of the fence. He who wins the love of the people, wins Rome. I get it already!I was hoping that the fight scenes might save this movie but I found Mr. Scott's MTV-style editing style to be distracting. Instead of the nitty-gritty fighting of "Rob Roy" or the impressive scenes in "Braveheart", we got a lot of flash to cover up for the lack of substance.Only Mr. Crowe and his charisma and impressive Coliseum shots saves this film from a "1".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually Ridley Scott's movies are exciting and full of suspense but this one was a total disappointment to me. Only Joaquin Phoenix was worth staying in the cinema. The movie was too corny since while there was no fight scene the actors always were near weeping, the fight scenes were too brutal and the whole movie was much too much hollywood-like. Letting the Roman Cesar fight in the Colloseum was ludicrous as well as the figure of the old Cesar - absolutly not authentic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the great scenery, costumes, camera and actors are impressing, the film as a whole is not.After having seen a good and wise, grey-haired caesar in the beginning, who wishes nothing but a fair government for his people, followed by a two-day's horseride from Germania to Spain, you can't take the plot serious anymore, so even the most tragic scenes become ridiculous.Other highlights in braindead scriptwriting include a bunch of freshly enslaved gladiators-to-be, listening to a motivational speech by their owner instead of slicing him with one of the few dozen swords scattered about the scene and leaving the place.For anyone who can switch off his brains in favour of some nice monumental action, the movie might still be worthwile.

Pheonix did one of the worst acting jobs of the year, though what could he do when the script couldn't decide if we should hate him because he's a coward, because he's cruel, or because he's a pervert. The three reasons didn't mix well at all. I do have to say the fight scenes were great, with the exception of the direction in the first one and the blade on the wheel cutting someone in half.

		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is a movie with a lot going for it. A big budget, a big director, an up and coming star, a summer release date, etc, etc. But in my opinion, it falls just short. Despite what you may have heard, this movie is predictable, slow, and corny. The fight scenes themselves are stellar, even fantastic, but they are few and far between. The majority of this movie deals with a whiny Joaquin Phoenix and his incestuous lusts and obvious motives. Russell Crowe does well with what he's given, but most of the best scenes involving him involve so much CG background and action that it ends up taking away from the acting, as was evident in another so called summer blockbuster "The Phantom Menace." The violence is overboard and gratuitous and the movie moves like molasses. Overall, I say thumbs down. Give me real action over CG action any day of the week.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The big epic that forgets about character.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, everybody loves this movie, which can only make me wonder, why? Why has America become so easy to fool? We see the trailer for a film like `Gladiator' and get all pumped up and slap our $8.00 down as soon as we can. But after sitting through 2 ? hours of a slow, unoriginal story, I could feel nothing but disappointment. Yes, I will admit that there are some cool scenes (the first fight in the Roman Coliseum is by far the best), but that's not enough to make a good movie. We start with an ok plot, but one key element is missing ? CHARACTER. None of these characters have any substance to them at all. They are all flat, stereotypical boring characters that have little to nothing of importance to say. I won't blame the actors, I think all of them have shown what they are capable of with a good script, but with a bad one ? not even the most talented of actors can save a film. So, that is probably the biggest problem here, a poor script that lacks true character development and interesting dialogue. But the direction is also poor. It was like Ridley was trying to do a little `Saving Private Ryan' but did not succeed in doing it nearly as well. To compare it to a similar film - `Braveheart' ? we see why `Braveheart' was a much more interesting film, because it had a great bunch of characters that the audience identified with and cheered on. `Gladiator' just could not deliver, and boy ? was the ending disappointing. I'm sorry people ? if anybody can tell me why this is such a movie, please do so, but this movie just reinforces for me the idea that Hollywood will always undermine the intelligence of its audience. `Gladiator' gets a big fat 3 from me.</fullReview>

In fact, some movies that are very long don't seem very long at all, such as the Lawrence of Arabia, the Godfather movies and Braveheart, all riveting throughout. No, Gladiator's problem was that it was obviously going for the look and feel of an epic. It got the look just right. No question, this movie looked fantastic; can't possibly give an argument there. Unfortunately, the film didn't have enough story for an epic. Solution? To have long stretches of dialogue and to have long pauses between each line of dialogue which, by the way, was very, very bad. The acting, therefore, was understandably average as no actor could possibly seem that convincing behind such overblown dialogue.</fullReview>

Oliver Reed and Richard Harris are so good in this film it is truly a shame that they will not be around to entertain us in the future. Gladiator shows us that a well written story and a well acted and directed movie can transport us to another time and place.

		<shortDescription>A terrific film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, Ridley Scott's Gladiator does not fit the description of Oscar. To me it sounds like something that would be nominated for MTV movie awards. So when it won Best Picture back in 2000, I was a little surprised because I thought it wasn't going to go to Steven Soderbergh's terrific drama Traffic. But I must say that Gladiator is better, but only a little better.The emperor (Richard Harris) does not feel that his son (a terrifying Joaquin Phoenix) is the right choice to be king; he feels that Maximus(Russell Crowe in his Oscar Winning performance), a super macho soldier, is the right fit. So when his son realizes this, he kills his father and pits the blame on Maximus. Maximus, having lost everything, sets out for vengeance, and becomes a gladiator.Gladiator is long, and requires your full attention. But trust me, that shouldn't be a problem. I couldn't take my eyes off of it. It's a sprawling, big, blood bath of an epic that always holds you and is far from reaching boredom.The film really belongs to Crowe and Phoenix. Every moment with Crowe is enthralling, and every moment with Phoenix, well, any time Phoenix is on screen in any movie, he sends chills down my spine. Crowe is good, but he doesn't deserve the award here as much as he did in 2001's Best Picture winner, A Beautiful Mind.This is one of Scott's best works. It's up there with Alien, Blade Runner, and American Gangster. It would not have been my top choice though. Personally, I would have chosen Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Erin Brockovich over this. But Gladiator is terrific entertainment nonetheless.A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing and a bit disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visually, "Gladiator" is a masterpiece. I saw a documentary about how they made this film long before I saw the actual movie and it's amazing to see how they used CGI to construct an enormous FULL stadium even though most of it wasn't real! The costumes, props, chariots and trappings were also gorgeous--as good as anything you'll ever see in a film about ancient Rome. And, with some spectacular stunts and TONS of blood, it is brutal--but spectacularly brutal. You really have to see this film and it will knock your socks off.If you look at my summary, however, I say that the film is a bit disappointing as well. As a retired history teacher, I know that much of the history shown in this film is wildly inaccurate. It bears only a very superficial semblance to the facts and it's a shame, as the true story of Emperor Commodus would make for an exciting film. In addition, at times I felt as if the dialog was just awful. Too often, folks talks as if they were making speeches or delivering lines in a high school play. And, it turns out I am not alone. After the film, I read through the IMDb trivia and noticed that the actors ALSO hated the dialog and much of it was changed....though in my opinion, not enough of it was changed. There was often no emotion other than rage or boredom from Maximus, for example. His grief at the crucifixion of his family sounded LESS emotional than it should have--like he was upset that the commissary forgot to but cheese on his burger--not like a man grief-stricken with loss. Simply put, the human side to the film is stilted.So what you are left with is a WILDLY exciting film--a true spectacle. But it lacks the humanity and truth that would have made it even better. Still, it's well worth seeing.</fullReview>

I wouldn't say anything else, but still this is a movie, and a great one as well perhaps one of the best i've ever seen. You say its not historical right or the plot sucks or something like that, but you've got to face the fact that if this is supposed to be a movie it cant be 100% historical accurate (don't get me wrong i love history especially around this era) because that means the movie would be much longer and not as nail biting exciting as it is now. Lets take "Conn Iggulden" as an example, he has wrote some of the best books i've ever read (historical novels) but still they aren't 100% true to what really happened, because then the readers would'not have been grasped by it the way they are now (i don't say i wouldn't cause i would but everyone wouldn't have). And therefore you can complain about this and that perhaps with good reasons but you got to get over it cause the fact is that it is a great movie "YES A MOVIE" and truth is that there are those who are much worse (The Last Legion for example), so try to enjoy the movie aside from historical errors which will always appear and accept it (to a certain degree) So enjoy this fantastic movie and love it :) Vennlig hilsen Simen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies are made to be watched over and over again, that's how good they are. Gladiator is one of those movies. It has all the elements that makes for a good movie. There is a compelling story, an altruistic hero, a sinister villain, a damsel and her young son, excellent musical score, great cinematography, great support cast, strong dialog and a solid finale. The movie has become a Hollywood icon. Its characters have achieved legendary status. Jaoquin Phoenix is superb as the Emperor Commodus, who is reviled by everyone, including his own sister. (Yet this does not stop the indefatigable emperor from doing his paperwork.) Russell Crowe gives a tour-de-force performance as Maximus, the hero general who refuses to cave in to the vindicative and jealous emperor. Oliver Reed, in his final performance, is great as Maximus's friend and ally. The scenes in the Colosseum are spectacular; the Colosseum itself is shown in all of its grandeur, a fitting venue for the kinds of spectacles that became symbols of Roman decadence and cruelty. All in all, this is a wonderful movie, one that deservedly is a classic.The part of the movie where Maximus reveals himself to the emperor is one of the greatest scenes in the history of Hollywood cinema. This is the scene that every director strives for, dreams about and rarely attains. Ridley Scott must have felt great to have put together such a stunning and evocative scene. The corrupt emperor and his erstwhile general, facing off, in front of the crowd, witnessed by the Senate, and the emperor's sister, indeed, by the entire world. Wow!

So what? Does every film that is based on a period of the past need to be historically accurate? Ie. Shawshank Redemption, L.A. Confidential, The Mummy, Saving Private Ryan, 300, Inglorious Basterds etc. The answer is simple - NO! It's called creative license and it's been used by authors/script-writers for countless years.If you wish to watch something that has been extensively researched and is historically accurate then find yourself a nice documentary!

He is sold and then is trained as a gladiator. The man who betrayed him is now the emperor of Rome and Maximus wants to win his freedom and get revenge. It won 5 Oscars for Best Actor, Best costume design, Best effects/visual effects,best picture and best sound. You should not pass the chance to see this movie.

		<fullReview>Historical inaccuracies aside, Gladiator is the film deservingly awarded the Best Picture of 2000. I'm not very keen to the history of the film, which might put my opinion of the film into a different context than that of a person who knows where, when, and what happened at the specific day and age this movie takes place.The acting is all well done. No one is wooden or stale, and Russell Crowe is absolutely flabbergasting as Maximus. Phoenix is superb as Commodus, and Oliver Reed does a marvelous job as Proximo. Richard Harris' few moments of screen time are very good, and Djimon Hounsou is excellent as Juba.The writing and direction is spot on. This is one of Ridley Scott's better films, and David Franzoni's script is beautifully written, despite the reported inaccuracies.Hans Zimmer's score is also the best of the year. Deep and moving, the score is gorgeous from its more subtle tracks, to its absolute bombast and explosive moments.The special effects used to create a thriving Rome are remarkable. Very realistic and adds to the epic scale of the film. The action is great too, though the camera angles and editing is a bit muddled, and it tends to get difficult at times in which the audience is trying to judge what is happening to who. The visual style of the film can get disorienting -- which is a positive and negative critique -- as some of the scenes are shot with shaky-cam moves.Overall, Gladiator is one of the best sword-and-sandal epics of all time, and definitely the best film of 2000. From its tragic story, to amazing performances, this film is one I highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As resplendently near perfect as you'd expect it to be; Gladiator resurrects the Roman Epic from cinema oblivion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's Oscar winning 'Gladiator' (2000) effectively resurrects the Roman epic from oblivion and to thunderous effect. The film stars resident Aussie heartthrob, Russell Crowe as Maximus, a loyal General to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (the late and very great Richard Harris). After a victorious campaign in Germania, Marcus decides that Maximus will succeed him on the throne; a move that does not bode well with the Emperor's only son and legitimate heir, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Determined to secure his birthright, Commodus murders his father before he has a chance to tell Maximus of his placement, and shortly thereafter frames Maximus for that murder. And although Commodus' sister ? and sometimes incestuous playmate, Lucilla (Connie Nielson) is both enamored and loyal to her father and Maximus there is little she can do but acquiesce to Commodus' sycophantic desire to be loved, in order to keep his psychotic wrath at bay. Escaping certain death, Maximus returns home to discover that his wife and young son have been slaughtered under Commodus' authority. From here on, the story develops magnificently along the lines of a revenge tragedy, sumptuously fleshed out by a series of stunning digital visual effects. And although this reviewer has never been a fan of digital manipulation in cinema (for most of it betrays total integration with elements of the story), for once at least the thought-numbing grandeur of ancient Rome seems to have been the perfect compliment to the prowess of technical wizardry. The screen is filled with gorgeous, mesmerizing ? and for the most part ? realistic renderings of the coliseum and senate, the byways and winding streets of ancient Rome, and the reinvented rustic countryside and battlefields peppered with barbarism. Derek Jacobi, David Schofield and the late Oliver Reed, round out the cast with superb character performances. The screenplay by David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson keeps every plot entanglement sharp and moving in a linear fashion, culminating in a series of climactic battles that ultimately ensure a showdown between Commodus and Maximus and seal their fates. If one complaint may be levied at the production, it's at its sometimes heavy handed use of camera panning and film editing that generally makes a rabid coleslaw of the action sequences ? never once allowing the viewer to rest on an image but instead having to endure a barrage of snippets wielded as though under the disguise of being visually paint-balled. On occasion these sequences grow more tiresome than thrilling ? a quality tempered by the rest of the movies attention to detail and formidable direction. Ridley Scott, long overdue for the Oscar as Best Director, was again overlooked for the honors on this occasion ? a genuine shame. Though, at least in this reviewer's mind, nothing will ever rival the titanic and emotional swell of William Wyler's Ben-Hur (1959), Gladiator is a close second on both accounts; a vivid, powerful and ultimately satisfying bit of escapism that should continue to thrill as long as there are fans of the sword and sandal quickie. Gladiator has been re-released in a handsome three disc set from Dreamworks. This set includes both the theatrical cut and a newly assembled director's vision for the film that is 17 minutes longer. In both cases Dreamworks has gone back to the drawing board and remastered the image ? removing much of the heavy and distracting edge enhancement that accompanied its first release on DVD nearly four years ago. Though digital images still tend to appear a tad harsher, or more finely defined than the rest of the image ? thereby betraying the fact that they are more blue screen than actual set design, the muddy color scheme that plagued the original DVD have been greatly corrected on this reissue. Fine detail is superbly rendered. Contrast and shadow levels are perfectly realized. The stylized look of the film is more finely rendered this time around. Truly, there is nothing about the image to dissuade one from indulging in the splendor of this epic storytelling. The audio is 5.1 and appears to be the same audio mix as the previously issued DVD. It's sonically bombastic and a great compliment to the image. Extras on this occasion include all of the previously issued material ? some slightly fleshed out with added material that ably fleshes out the production from start to finish. There's also a new audio commentary and intro to the extended edition from Ridley Scott, a trivia track and snippets of Russell Crowe speaking on his participation in the film. On disc 2 there are seven featurettes ? which cumulatively add up to one 3hr and 20 min. documentary on the making of the film. Disc 3 includes a visual effects reel and insight into several abandoned sequences, as well as trailers, television spots and previews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I missed this on first release, but have watched it on DVD. To be quite honest, it's tripe of the first order. The script is awful, and the acting generally not much better (thank heavens for the computer-generated actors: they are at least the equal of their flesh-and-blood rivals). I found this film to be deeply contrived and boring. As for the garbage of the Emperor Commodus fighting 'mano a mano' with a gladiator, the scriptwriters must have been on something stronger than LSD.Presumably Ridley Scott hired Derek Jacobi for 'Gladiator' because he'd played a Roman before (to whit, Claudius, see below), but even in his minor role he out-acts the far starrier names (except for the late Oliver Reed, who steals every scene he's in).If you want a _real_ flavour of 'life at the top' in the Roman Empire, get the DVDs or videotapes of 'I, Claudius', the BBC's conflation of Robert Graves's 'I, Claudius' and 'Claudius the God'. This is far better written and it's superbly acted. It's also more convincing, despite being made on a shoestring budget. If 'I' Claudius' is an excellent fillet steak in a superb restaurant, accompanied by the finest wine, then 'Gladiator' is a gristly hamburger in a seedy fast-food joint, washed down with a 3rd-rate clone cola.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History or entertainment?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Either you want to make a movie which is true to the facts (as we know them) or you just want to make a big screen spectacle, not bothering too much about the details. This movie is neither. Considering all the "realistic" scenes and scenery, it wants to be a depiction of true historical facts, but it is not! So for people who know a little bit about Roman history it is hard to take the story very seriously, but, on the other hand, because the makers seem to take it very seriously, it is hard to watch it as simple entertainment.To name only a few examples. Which Roman general would ever leave his troops in the middle of a (political) conflict? His army is his power basis. Of course, had Maximus done the most sensible thing and called his army for help, then Commodus would have been wiped out and the movie would have been over within 15 minutes. But no, Maximus runs, away from his army.Second example. In the end, when Maximus returns to Rome as a famous gladiator, he is recognized by people who remember him as general Maximus. Remember, when he became a gladiator, it wasn't as general Maximus, but as an anonymous. Is he released....? No, but only because the story dictates that we should wait for the climax, not for any logical reason.The coincidence that Maximus, fleeing from Germany to Spain on foot, which would have taken a few months at least, finds his house still smoking is just too much.So maybe the old Hollywood epic historical movies didn't look so realistic (actors were clean and had white teeth), but Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks were so much more fun to look at, because they didn't take it all too seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard many people refer to this movie as a "Braveheart" rip-off or as a movie that tried to make some cash out of the success of "Braveheart". I don't think that's completely fair. Sure there are some similarities but "Gladiator" is original enough with an own unique style.The movie has a very good unique atmosphere like we are used from Ridley Scott movies. Visually the movie looks wonderful (with the exception of a few fake looking background shots of Rome). Especially the battle scene's (the gladiator fights in particular) are filmed in a wonderful way with some good editing and are something you have never seen before. You can almost feel the tension and fear and smell the sweat of the gladiators when they are entering the arena.The acting is top class! Russell Crowe is a great leading man but was his role Oscar worthy? I don't think so, he deserved an Oscar more for his role in "A Beautiful Mind". Joaquin Phoenix gives an impressive performance and the same goes for Richard Harris, Oliver Reed and yes, Spencer Treat Clark that shows his talent.What makes the movie even more complete is the excellent musical score by Hans Zimmer and the great looking costumes and epic settings and feeling.But no the movie is not perfect. The story at times is messy and at times it loses it's speed. It feels like it's just a lame excuse to fill up the scene's between the gladiator fights. Also some characters and moments don't feel needed at all, I don't know I can't really put my finger on it. But it's not a bad thing, the good things about the movie makes you actually forget the bad things.Worth watching if only just for the spectacular and impressive battle scene's.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

It seems like the Academy Awards aren't the best at picking who and what deserves it, just like Julia Roberts winning over Ellen Burstyn. All she did was act pissed off and wear revealing clothes. Many actresses could've done that.Anyway, this movie is just a bigger budget for a Jean Claude Van Damme movie. A tough guy's family gets hurt, and he goes out for revenge, but along the way he gets tortured and hurt yet kicks all their butts. That pretty much sums it up...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit this movie looks great. Ridley Scott did a great job as the director and production designer. Moreover, the actors are superb. And Hans Zimmer's work as composer is awesome.However, there is one MAJOR complaint: THE SCRIPT!Ok, from a commercial point of view I can understand that it looked appealing to the producers. But what about Mr. Scott?The plot is a recycled Early-Eighties-Chuck-Norris-Movie put into the Roman setting.No twists. No suspense. Just action and some romance. No good movie!Gladiator is a B-Movie script made into a multi-million dollar piece of post-modern recycled junk.If you really want to see it, here is my recommendation:Rent the DVD or video and put it on fast forward. You will still get the simple story, some action and you won't have to waste two hours and thirty minutes just to be disappointed.My verdict: 2 out of 10 (for the looks, acting, and score)PS: Unfortunately, the producers felt obligated to insert a Saving-Private-Ryan-This-Feels-So-Real war sequence at the beginning. It pales in comparison to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Exciting story. Well acted. This movie has every element of being an instant classic. Don't haggle about historical accuracy; just enjoy this epic with wild eyed anticipation. A story of love, vengeance and will power.Russell Crowe plays Maximus Meridius, a Roman general that winds up a gladiator after refusing to pledge loyalty the emperor's power-hungry son Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix). Emperor Marcus Aurelius(Richard Harris)on his deathbed wants to turn the leadership of Rome over to Maximus; but the jealous Commodus smothers his already dying father to death and takes over the throne. Maximus escapes a death sentence and becomes a slave; then a gladiator that avenges his murdered family by constantly defying Commodus.Crowe is excellent as is Phoenix. The two contrasting personae make a great rivalry. Connie Nielsen plays the sister of Commodus and the object of his sexual obsession. Stand outs in supporting roles are:Oliver Reed, David Schofield, Derek Jacobi and David Hemmings.From scene to scene the marvelous story flows and the music of Hans Zimmer orchestrates the many moods of the movie. Your heart will not let you forget this movie.This will be one for the ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Curious Best Picture Winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is a special effects tour de force that tries to combine the major elements of "Ben-Hur" and "Braveheart" but fails to generate the interest, intensity, or intelligence of either of those films. Military General Russell Crowe (Oscar-winning) is going to take over the throne of Rome when ruler Richard Harris passes away. Son Joaquin Phoenix (Oscar-nominated) finds out and takes matters into his own hands (literally). Crowe is to be killed, but he escapes and becomes a slave. His family has also been slaughtered in the venture. Crowe is then bought by the wise Oliver Reed and learns that the coliseum is to reopen with gladiator games. Now he is a gladiator and he wins over the country and continues his plans to get revenge on Phoenix. "Gladiator" is definitely a good-looking film and it is well-made. The costume designs, editing, special effects, and direction are all exceptional. However, the screenplay is nothing special. It has been done dozens of times before in better films. All the performers seem overwhelmed by the production as well. Crowe does admirably, but his part is not very complicated at all. His Oscar win is a bit strange. Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, Djimon Hounsou, and the late Oliver Reed are all disappointing. Joaquin Phoenix is excellent though with his laid-back, but sometimes over-the-top performance. He is the spark that the film desperately had to have. The incestuous and deviant sexual under-tones do nothing to help out the film and end up being an unnecessary distraction. Overall a good film, but "Traffic" should have won the Best Picture Oscar in 2000. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

This is the kind of "historic epic" that is neither historically correct in the details nor the epic it considers itself to be. The endless historical errors are mentioned in other comments and in the "goofs" section of the IMDB page for this movie, so there's no need to get into them here. As for the epic part ... well, I spent much of the time trying to decide which real epic was being ripped off ("Braveheart" a lot of the time; "Private Ryan" definitely in the opening battle scenes, via the hectic camera work and the leached-out colors).Let me put it this way: If you thought "Legends of the Fall" was a good movie, you'll probably fall for it again here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are probably some spoilers in this review. On the other hand, if you have already seen this movie, spoilers don't make any difference and if you have not seen it, spoilers may not make any difference either because I very much recommend that you don't bother wasting your time to see it anyway.Considering the hype that Gladiator had before, during, and after its release to the theaters, this had to be one of my worst disappointments. The good guy-bad guy situation was so obvious that I think all the people involved with making this movie must have been too close to it to see what they were doing. Either that, or they thought viewers were all stupid. A little character development might have helped here.This movie is basically about two guys. One is General Maximus something that ends with an s, something else that ends with an s, and he is a really, really good guy. Then there is the son of the emperor, something that begins with a C and ends with an s, who is a really, really bad guy. How do we know this? The movie's first major scene is the general bravely leading his troops into battle (and fighting hand-to-hand himself, which seems dumb for the commanding general), and wins a great victory. He then shows his fine personal side by having a heart-to-heart with the emperor. General Maximus says he now wants to go home to his wife and kid and there is a gooey filmover that shows the audience what a nice family life he has. His boss tells him that he wants the general to take over leadership of Rome since the emperor is about to die. The good general goes away to think about it. Then the emperor's son comes in and finds out this distressing information when he talks to his dad. Naturally, he then murders his father so he can lead Rome himself. What a bad guy he is!The general is awakened to find this out and examines the body so as to determine that he had indeed been murdered. Things get worse for the general when the naughty son orders him executed. A bunch of the son's soldiers then take the luckless general away. They promptly botch the execution, however, when the general with his hands tied and unarmed somehow kills everyone. The general then rushes home, but gets there too late and discovers that his family have been horribly tortured and killed and the farm burned. Can the son get even worse and the general even better? In this movie, the answer is yes, of course.The general is then captured and placed into slavery and made a gladiator in order to please the blood-thirsty people. He then makes an amazing recovery to kill about a zillion other gladiators who have no redeeming characteristics. The son implements his plan to lead the people by hitting on his own sister, making advances to his nephew, and planning 150 days of killing to cement his loving bond with his countrymen. This guy is definetly no George Washington.While this is all going on, we movie viewers are treated to some of the silliest special effects ever. In one scene, an ordinary chariot explodes when crashing into the side of the stadium. In another, tigers pop out of the middle of the stadium to try to kill the already hopelessly overmatched gladiators. Nothing works and the slave-gladiator continues to mess up the son's plans by killing everybody he faces. Even "the only undefeated gladiator in Roman history" (remember when defeated, a gladiator is dead) is coaxed out of five-year retirement to come back and be easily killed by the indestructible general.The movie's ending is still more rediculous. For historical accuracy, all the people in the movie, including the slaves, have perfect teeth, look clean despite impossible conditions of sanitation, and are so well fed that a few look overweight. I just don't understand what everybody sees in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does everyone like this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Am I the only one who doesn't think that scenes of people relentlessly hacking away at each other and severing limbs, heads, etc, blood spouting everywhere is "beautiful" and "stunning cinematography"? I'm absolutely astonished at the other comments about this movie! I found the fight scenes to be uncomfortably gory and grim; and there were so many of them, and they went on and on and on! I had been told that it was thought provoking, a love story (??) and not very violent or gory. What movie was that? Certainly not this one! I was also annoyed at the gratuitousness of his wife and son being killed, just so he could be pissed off enough to justify his desire for revenge. (just like most of the old Charles Bronson movies) Wouldn't he have been pissed off enough by the murder of his beloved emperor, the betrayal of the 'ideals of the Roman Empire' and the fact that he was captured and made a slave? Guess not.I went to the 9:00 pm show, and in between the battle scenes, I kept almost dozing off. I just didn't find the movie or the characters particularly interesting, engaging or compelling. "Gripping" is a word I have seen in other's comments--I don't see it. I was anything but gripped. In comparison to Braveheart, it was about as violent, but you didn't really care about any of these people or what they were doing. Braveheart made me want to find out more about William Wallace and that period of history; Gladiator made me want to go see Thomas the Tank Engine in the next theater to wash those gory images out of my brain and put something light in there instead!I'm not trying to belittle anyone's opinions who loved this movie; I am just nonplussed by them. Basically, I just wanted it to be over, so I wouldn't have to watch it anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say I'm a real big fan of what is known as the "sword and sandal" genre. Admittedly, I haven't seen too many of these medieval epics, but I can only think of two I liked(not counting Monty Python's LIFE OF BRIAN, which spoofed the genre); BEN-HUR and SPARTACUS. The former, despite an annoying lead performance by Charlton Heston, had taste and craftsmanship, the latter, despite a somewhat one-note performance by Kirk Douglas, had irony and intelligence. The others all seemed melodramatic. But Ridley Scott's new film shows there's life in this genre yet.Admittedly, the film does suffer in comparison in one respect; Scott seems less comfortable with the talking scenes and the backroom politics, as it were, than, say, Stanley Kubrick was in SPARTACUS. All the scenes with Charles Laughton, Laurence Olivier, and Peter Ustinov were, in that film, equally as compelling as the battle scenes. Whereas in Scott's film, while he's cast some good actors like Joaquim Phoenix, Connie Nielson, and Derek Jacobi, and they respond with good performances(in particular, Phoenix, an underrated actor, and not the obvious choice as the bad guy), you can sense his need to get back to the action.Fortunately, the action is all well done; while it's clear Scott is trying to have it both ways(make entertaining spectacle which comments on the need for entertaining spectacle), he stages it so well we don't tend to worry about that. Also, he's helped mightily by the casting of Russell Crowe in the lead role. Crowe couldn't play a false note if he tried, and he brings a lot to a pretty standard action hero here. As with THE INSIDER, he's playing another person who takes a stand he didn't think he had to, and he leads by example, rather than bluster. Overall, while I'm not a big fan of the genre, this is a fine example of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many errors and an actor made out of wood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a couple of reasons I didn't really like Gladiator.First and foremost is Russell Crowe. I'm an Australian and while it seems a little unpatriotic, the guy is pure wood. He is the new Charles Bronson who has one expression and sticks to it.Thus I had a problem when he supposedly 'sells himself to the crowd'. I'm also a wrestling fan and I can only guess that 'selling' must mean something different to the people who made this film. Crowe does no selling here.The other problem I have is some biiiiig holes in the plot. Commodus becomes the new Emperor and sentences Maximus, and his family, to death. Maximus kills the guards and rides as fast as he can for home. So fast he kills both of the horses he rides although he might have been a little faster if the cinematographer didn't decide that he absolutely had to put in some visual effect to boost his career.Anyway, he gets home and Roman legions had already arrived, tortured and raped his family, hanged them and then left. My question, how did they know? Did Commodus, still up in Germanica somewhere pull out his cell phone and make a call?! I mean, Maximus goes as fast as he can but the enemy troops seem to not only know Commodus' orders but that he is the new Emperor.A friend of mine said that there were communication methods that could have been used. Carrier pigeons, signal towers, etc. Fine, but if the film makers want me to buy that, they should show me this.Next, Maximus falls to the ground grieving for his dead family and then boom, next scene, he's a wounded slave. How did this happen? Even more curious is why a slaver bothered with caring for a wounded slave with the Mediterranean so close by to act as a dumping ground.Third, I still can't understand how Maximus manages to become such an acclaimed gladiator. Nothing I saw endured me toward him and while he was a general that doesn't make him an exceptional fighter. I don't know if I'd win a fight against General Schwarzkopf or Collin Powell but I bet Mike Tyson could beat them in a fight.Finally, all the other anachronisms just added up to cause my poor suspension of disbelief to evaporate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'll admit that I didn't consider "Gladiator" the best movie of 2000, but it did have it's merits, namely that it focused on plot rather than violence. Russell Crowe certainly did a good job as Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix made a nasty Commodus. Although that was sort of the problem: the good guy was 100% good and the bad guy was 100% bad. It might have been a little better if there had been some gray area.But other than that, it was a really good movie. Since we had just gone to Italy when the movie came out (we went for the millennium jubilee), it made the movie all the neater.

I was surprised and disappointed.People who call this great movie must never have seen a great movie.Gladiator begins with an improbable event. The old Caesar Marcus Aurelius is along in his elaborate carriage in Geremania and he calls for his son Commodus and tells him he is not going to name him Caesar but will have his favorite general Maximumus be the leader who will bring back the Republic. for gratuitous violence and no real message, no real humanity or depth. It seems we have regressed to It's highly doubtful that none of Caesars guards are near both as witness to this important act and as protectors.So of course Commudus kills the old man and then sends soldiers to kill Maximus. Maximus is severely wounded but escapes and then some how gets from Germania to what looks like a desert in North Africa !!These two improbably events are followed by dozens more. There are so many why not throw in a car chase or two...As another reviewer said,it has.. gratuitous violence and no real message, no real humanity or depth. .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What we have here is a mixture of Ben Hur and Braveheart, and unsurprisingly it sucks.The main objective of the film seems to be to cram as much gore as possible in the space of a single movie, without bothering about trivialities like story, character or meaning. If it purports to show the beastliness of staged human fights to the death it utterly fails because it only lowers the viewers to the same voyeuristic level as the Romans themselves.Who cares about Maximus, a cardboard character with revenge as his only motivation? What to make of the crazy editing in the fight scenes that makes it impossible to understand what is going on? What with the bizarre geography and time lines? How to make sense of the opening battle which is claimed to be about a German settlement, yet takes place in the open and shows cavalry charging through a dense forest? Why the fake poetry of the hand in the wheat field? Who cares? Gore, gore and more gore, that is what sells tickets and, incredibly, delivers Oscars.The only thing I could appreciate, contrary to many others here, is Joaquin Phoenix' portrayal of Commodus as he descends from mere creepiness into downright raving lunacy. Nice bit of acting. All the rest is a waste of perfectly good celluloid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great revenge movie that is not as worthy as it thinks it is but is still a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maximus is the favoured commander of Emperor Aurelius' armies in Germania. He is favoured to the point that the Emperor, sensing his death is near, commands him to succeed him and return Rome to a republic. Caesar's son discovers this, kills his father and orders Maximus dead. However he survives and, finding his wife and son murdered, is captured by slave merchants and sold to gladiator trainer Proximo. As his skills increase his strength he eventually comes to the games at Rome, where he finds himself anonymous and within striking distance of the revenge he seeks.If you strip away all the period settings and political battling in the background, this film is essentially a revenge film and a good one at that. It's best to ignore the liberties it takes with both logic and history and enjoy it for what it is. At times it does threaten to take itself too seriously, but it's worthy sheen is just about supported by the emotive story and strong characters. The film hits a good mix of political goings-on and action, with the action being the main body of the film. It is delivered in bloody spades and the action scenes are a lot more dramatic than I expected.Although the characters fit into traditional revenge movie moulds (wronged man, evil man in position of power etc) they still manage to be strong characters in their own right. Maximus is a strong hero and it is hard not to feel for him and thus get involved in the film. True, the script is very generous in it's painting of him but this is a minor issue. Crowe takes the lead really well and, while I don't personally care for him, he really fitted the role here. Phoenix plays it well despite the fat he could easily have given into mugging the evil role. Harris is good in his small role, although Jacobi just shows up once or twice. Reed has a good part for his swansong but this is really Crowe's film and he commands it as his character does his army.The close of the film always gets me as it treats the characters and audience with respect (although it is not as daring as some would suggest. Overall this is a great film to watch as long as you don't take it too seriously or go looking for flaws. The music and direction gives it a great feel ? the music in particular used to support the required emotions created by the action. Three hours go by very quickly and enjoyably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't even describe how much I loath this film, but being a hater I'll try.Lets begin with the historical representation first. Personally I don't give a hoot if the facts are all wrong, if the uniforms and clothing and use of weaponry are historically incorrect. (People who's concerns about this dragon of a film tend that way, I gave those geeks wedgies in High-school) But the representation of the Roman empire as a benign benefactor spreading civilization through out the world is ludicrous, such sentiments belong to the aforementioned wedgie sufferers and elitist euro-republicans.Then there's the script, which is a pathetic attempt at lyrical writing, even Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson could do a better job. Never the less, it was amusing in a so-bad-it's-funny sorta way.And Russel Crowe, let's not forget the torment of watching Russel Crowe act. It's like his brawling: fake and an attempt to hide his 80's new wave rock alter ego; Russ Le Rock. But his constipated stoicism and grunting and mumbling will appear as the classic lone warrior acting to the low-brows who love this film.Oh, Yes and then there's the music. When I heard Rock like rhythms played over roman soldiers marching, I laughed out loud, usually anachronistic film-scoring is the fort of Asian cinema, that can pull this stunt. The music only got worse, from new-age warbling of Lisa Gerrad to pompous choir passages, that even Howard Shore would be ashamed to use.This movie was a non wavering onslaught of boredom and cinematic torture, and I for one was happy when the credits rolled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is filled with so many tired old cliches that I can only sum it up with a tired old reviewer clich. Leave you brain at the door.This movie starts off with a large battle scene where Roman army Sargent, Russell Crowe, displays a unique ability to fight with courage and honor. Yeah! Unfortunately for him he is more concern with getting home to his family where he can raise his children and grow his crops. The only thing that is keeping him in the army is a strong devotion to his Caesar.After winning the opening scene (Believe me, I am not spoiling anything imdb.) Crowe's Caesar comes down from the mountain where he has overlooked the battle to congratulate him. As soon as I saw the old and feeble Caesar get off his horse I literally counted the seconds before the Caesar's `jealous of Crowe' younger brother or son came walking onto the scene. 28 seconds later the Caesar's son who it conveniently late for the battle, enters the scene. Things really heat up when the Caesar names Crowe as his successor instead of his son. What follows is one movie clich after another until a final battle scene between Crowe and Caesar Jr.I have enjoyed movies that followed this kind of formula in the past. Spartacus and Braveheart are my two favorite examples. But what those movies have that Gladiator lacks is simple. Character. Ridley Scott's direction should have been more focus on giving his lead roles a third dimension instead of dragging out action. The bland story and flatness of the characters made me wish that everyone would die so I could arrive home sooner.Although Gladiator did have well choreographed fight scenes and some good computer generated special effects; as most movies today, they left the script as a last priority which this reviewer still believes should be the whole point of movie making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stale plot, older than the Roman Empire!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading many praising comments on Gladiator, I see that I am one of the few who announce how poor this movie was actually. I am not going to write a long comment to explain the shortcomings of this movie because they are so obvious. First of all, the movie was full of clichs and exaggerations. The plot really lacked originality. This was actually the ROMAN VERSION of BRAVE HEART or the latest version of BEN HUR rather than gladiator. I cannot understand why such a stale plot was used...Secondly,, the visual effects were fairly poor, apart from being realistic. For instance the tiger was like a character of one of Disney's animations. It was obviously non-realistic.. And it was also too obvious that the upper part of the coliseum was computer-generated..In the next place, the movie was unreasonably long; long enough to bore the audience. So, all Gladiator fans; please stop giving this poor movie more than it deserves. Since the production cost of this movie was high, some thought this was a great movie, who are fascinated by the fake beauty of gladiator!!! This is the unfortunate fact about gladiator.</fullReview>

Now, they've got what they want: a cool main actor, a cool story in a very cool time, but they don't consider that mostly everything in this I-don't-know-how-to-name-it-film is wrong.

		<fullReview>"Gladiator" was the best picture of 2000 according to the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences. It won the Oscar.... for Best Picture."Traffic" came out in 2000. "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" came out in 2000. "Almost Famous" came out in 2000. "Ghost World" came out in 2000. Not since "Forrest Gump" beat out "Pulp Fiction" for Best Picture of 1994, have I questioned the continued existence of mankind as a good thing."Gladiator," directed by Ridley Scott the once talented man who brought us "Alien" and "Blade Runner," is a carbon-copy of another crappy Best Picture: "Braveheart." The plot is nearly identical making a few alterations here and there to accommodate the setting change to Ancient Rome. This is an unoriginal, uninteresting, golden-brown mess of machismo and special effects.Not at any time did I care if our hero, Maximus (Russel Crowe) was redeemed. I won't go into the plot because I value my time, but suffice it to say, there is no point to his actions nor is there any doubt as to the outcome.Had this film disappeared for being the crap-fest that it is, I wouldn't care at all. But this film was selected as the Best Picture of a year that had many, many other wonderful and actual thought-provoking films.This film gives the art form a bad name. It's sad to think it shares the once great honor also bestowed upon films like "The Godfather," "Man for All Seasons," and "Annie Hall." The Oscars are now, officially, a joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>USE YOUR MIND, NOT YOUR GLANDS: WATCH "I, CLAUDIUS" INSTEAD!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest single indictment of this disatrous excuse for an epic is that the one truly great actor in the movie, Derek Jacobi, is (like Richard Harris and Oliver Reed) brought in to bring a whiff of authentic class (to hide the other whiffs), and, like the others, is quickly snuffed. Jacobi, of course, was the absolutely brilliant star of the probably the greatest Roman epic ever, I, CLAUDIUS. That scintillating 13-hour classic doesn't have a single boring or predictable moment (unlike this mess) and is all characterization and plotting, not spectacle, the exact opposite of this movie, which uses character stereotypes and a ludicrous storyline that wouldn't pass the cartoon test. Half the acting is Russell Crowe swearing revenge and grimacing as he flexes his pectorals. Even the spectacle here is MUDDY and BLOODY. If you want to be like the Romans and enjoy the sight of people being disemboweled and torn limb from limb, then by all means check this out. But, please, watch one of the classics instead and you'll quickly dump this pretender.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE IN HISTORY!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a simpleton's epic. The storyline doesn't pass the laugh test. Here's the outline (I would warn of SPOILERS, but this thing is already ROTTEN):1) After a great victory in GERMANY, a Heroic Roman general (Russell Crowe) and 100-year-old Roman Emperor with BOTH FEET in the grave (a pathetic-looking Richard Harris) plot to bring back the REPUBLIC to Rome.2) The Emperor's EVIL -- that's E-V-I-L -- and effeminate son (a WAY-OVER-THE-TOP Joaquin Phoenix) gets p***ed when daddy doesn't want to give him supreme power,finishes pushing pops into the grave, attempts the kill the good general, but just wipes out his family a thousand miles in SPAIN instead.3) Just after he discovers his wife and kid are TOAST, the grief-stricken good general is conveniently abducted by slavers to AFRICA, where he becomes THE GREATEST GLADIATOR EVER!, killing off dozens of opponents with each rippled bicep and impressing his teacher, played by Oliver Reed (who played with similar scene-chewing bravado in his prime).4) The good general goes back to ROME, where he wipes out legions in the Colisseum simply by ripping off his shirt to show his MIGHTY PECTORALS! Heads and arms and legs and lots of bloody parts fly all over in the MOST RIDICULOUS GLADITORIAL FIGHTS EVER! The EVIL SON, who is now the E-V-I-L EMPEROR quakes in effeminate fear of this MIGHTY GLADIATOR, who is now the MOST POPULAR MAN IN ROME! He suggests incest to his comely sister (Connie Nielsen), but -- strangely -- she prefers the SHIRTLESS GLADIATOR GENERAL, who promises to bring REPUBLICAN freedom to all ROME.5) The E-V-I-L EMPEROR lops off the heads of all the free-thinking Republican Senators and fatally backstabs the CHESTY GLADIATOR. He jumps into the ARENA himself to finish him off, but our HAIRY HERO manages to end the E-V-I-L ONE's misery, and our own.Russell Crowe has a primordial presence which obviously strongly appeals to both male and female audiences, but this movie is a joke. It says a lot when the best performance turned in was by the Oliver Reed, who died during the shooting and had a few of his scenes filled with Oliver's face superimposed by computer over an anonymous actor.The movie also looks terrible with a computer-generated Colisseum which looks totally plastic and a darkness in most of the scenes that is near impenetrable, except, of course, in the ludicrous gladitorial scenes in which every eviscerating moment is in bright sunshine.This movie is Spartacus and Ben Hur for the plot-challenged, character-challenged, nano-second-attention-spanned modern audiences. An Eviscerated Epic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see Gladiator with low expectations, going only because I have a 1-2 movie a week habit, and there have been few good movies opening in American theaters in recent weeks. What follows, therefore, is an opinion about one hollywood summer blockbuster movie from someone who admittedly doesn't like such movies in the first place.First of all, Gladiator has the generic faults of most such movies: 1) sophisticated and expensive production design, editing and special effects contrasted with a simple-minded story, stilted dialogue and characters with incomprehensible or unbelievable motivation; and 2) excessive length. (To be fair, it does not have the very common third flaw, excessive noise.) There are many decent low-budget movies that get by with thin plots and bad dialogue, when directed quickly with some flair; but adding money, big-name (and talented) actors and length makes things worse, not better.I find the violence in Gladiator's battle and fighting sequences very distasteful. I had the same feeling about Braveheart, although that movie at least balanced its violence with scenes of levity. I do not object to cartoon violence in movies, and I have never been bothered by anything I saw in John Woo's or other Hong Kong movies. Graphic scenes of realistic violence do upset me, even more so when (as in this movie or in Braveheart) it is "righteous" violence meted out by the hero.Finally, I was disgusted by the movie's misinterpretations of history. The Roman Senate was an instrument of aristocracy, not democracy. Commodus was killed by disgruntled servants, and no one thought of replacing him with anything but another emperor. Having him decide to fight a skilled gladiator is the supreme example of lame screenwriting in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the worst I've ever been forced to watch. I mean, I came out of the cinema and wondered why the sun wasn't already up. I thought it must have been at least 8 hours long. It's just so BORING! When you think about it, what happens in this movie? Tough guy kills some dudes. Tough guy talks about honour with old guy. Mean guy kills old guy. Tough guy kills some other dudes. Mean guy talks about honor with girl. Tough guy weeps for his family. Tough guy talks about honor with black guy, then kills some dudes. (Repeat last three lines until bored, and then some more). If they would have just stuck to the killing part, then it would have been a mediocre action film. But no, they had to add "depth" (=lots of "philosophical" (=clicheed) truisms, with about 30 seconds of pauses/reaction shots between sentences). Actually, the screenwriter packed the script with so many clichees he actually only missed one: Flavius (the nephew of the mean guy) is not Maximus's son. Bummer. I thought I knew everything that would happen after the first quarter of an hour.O.K. The good points: The first three fights or so ARE compelling (the other 20 or so cease to be). Ancient Rome never looked so real (Shame about the rest of the movie). The actors can act (their roles are just so clicheed the creators could have done with Muppets).One final question : Does Crowe really go from Germania to Spain in one day (Some horse that must be...), and from Spain to North Africa in another two? In a CART? I Refuse to have seen that. I must have fallen asleep for a few hours. It's possible with this movie. Zero stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am yet to come to terms with the hype this film has got. Nothing in it makes it deserve to be in the IMDb's top 250 list, neither the Oscar, nor all the good things that have been written in its praise.The first 30 minutes or so are good, quite impressive indeed. They kill the emperor, kill Maximus' wife and son, but that is it. The story takes off well but completely loses its flight right from the point he is captured by those slavers. From then on the film loses its point and becomes a tiring exercise, predictable too. It gets more and more boring as well as the film approaches its ending. A huge disappointment if I am honest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gladiator" is a good movie. I, personally, didn't think it was GREAT or PERFECT at all, but I still liked and appreciated the film for what it was. An epic action film! There are some great, awe- inspiring moments and battle scenes that really impressed me. You can tell that, on a technical level, a lot of talent was involved with this project, and Hans Zimmer's score only enhances the epic feeling! Plus, the ending is genuinely powerful, and I cared for the characters.However, when there isn't some grand spectacle of a battle sequence happening, a lot of the film felt a bit bland. Not EVERYTHING that wasn't an action sequence, just a lot of it. It also is a bit predictable and clichd at times.Overall, "Gladiator" isn't a masterpiece script-wise, but more of a masterpiece on a technical level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gladiator is possibly one of the most over rated films I have ever seen. I went into this film thinking it would be a masterpiece. Instead I got a bloated Oscar bait film that had me cheering at the end not for its filmmaking style, but that it ended. The film is dull and the character of Maximus is in a clichd story of a father seeking revenge against those who killed his family. I felt that it was more interestingly done, sadly, in Death Wish. Commodus is upset because his father wanted to put Maximus on the throne instead of him. So the film was sort of ripped off by Thor in every way, with one major difference. I don't want to gouge my eyes out whenever I see Thor. Don't waste your time with this overrated garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Roman-Empire movie since Ben-Hur and Spartacus! (Extend edition review-the true Ridley Scott masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would knew that the director of "Alien", "Blade Runner" and "Thelma &amp; Louise", Ridley Scott. Would make one day a amazing Roman epic since "Ben-Hur" and "Spartacus". And speaking of the extended edition (only available on Blue-ray) could not only overcome in several details the original, but also be another masterpiece of Ridley Scott's career.The film tells the story of the Roman general, the Spanish Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe). Maximus is on a military campaign in the barbaric Germania, led by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), which has lasted over ten years. Aurelius sees in Maximus courage and humility, and the spirit of a true leader, as a proof the love and admiration that the Roman army has for Maximus. Aurelius and Maximus nurture a big friendship and a love of father and son, which led to Aurelius appoint Maximus to be the new leader of Rome after his death, instructing Maximus to make Rome a republic again. But Maximus hesitate just because he expects his military pantry and return to his family in Spain, but the respect he has for the Emperor is very large. Everything changes when the arrogant and envious son of Aurelius, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) kills his father and orders the execution of Maximus and his family. Maximus manages to escape and return home, where he finds his wife and children crucified beside the door. Maximus is arrested and later sold to a gladiator trainer Proximo (Oliver Reed), which later becomes the best among them, and sees a path to revenge.You could say that "Gladiator" is Ridley Scott's "Braveheart". As it is filmed in the same realistic and violent style, but (in my opinion) can be much more epic. The direction of Ridley Scott is a great help, along with a dazzling cinematography on each scene. Both in spectacular epic battles (inside and outside the visually stunning Coliseum) and the superb dialog scenes.A major problem with films like "Spartacus" and "Braveheart" was connecting the dialog with the characters, which sometimes it failed and couldn't maintain a line of fiction with true historical facts, often not loyal at all. But I think Scott knew that and hired the right screenwriter for the job, David Franzoni. The writer of "Amistad" along with John Logan and William Nicholson, can build a superb narrative to the film from start to finish. Achieving at the same time creating a fiction story, and be extremely loyal to historical facts of the Roman Empire.This is mostly seen in the extended version of the film. Where we have many more dialogs between the characters never getting boring for a moment. And can demonstrate accurately the Roman political system, since the massive corruption and political rivalries within the senate and also the great imperial totalitarianism with the character of Commodus. And thanks to Scott, manages to have a good level of entertainment within the amazing story.But for all become more epic and exciting, Scott asked the best author of soundtracks of this generation Hans-Zimmer to participate in this epic. And delivers a soundtrack that ranges from the thrilling and exciting to dramatic and chilling (as always done ever since).And course, no one in the cast disappoints. Joaquin Phoenix didn't won the Oscar in this movie for two reasons: 1- F#ckin Critics (as always), 2- Benicio Del Toro superb performance in "Traffic", 3- Blue-ray versions don't compete for the Oscars. But who shines of course is Russell Crowe, with the PERFECT performance that put him on the map.Not that the theatrical version is bad. But after watching the extended version, the original feels very incomplete. Because here it was shown the exuberant performances of all the cast; the superb direction of Ridley Scott giving spectacular and realistic epic battles; a fantastic script that while it is original, it can be historically accurate with a fantastic story of the general who became a slave, the slave that turned into a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an empire. It has a question in the film: "Are you not entertained?" All I have to answer is "Yes, I 'am"! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not have the words to describe how brilliant this movie is, Yet, I'll try to find some.The quality of this film is off the hook! And the action scenes are incredibly nice, bloody, but nice. For example Maximus first battle in the arena. The choreography of that was explicit. The war at the very beginning; also great, but every scene in this movie was great in their own way, so.It's the classic good meets evil, slave meets emperor, right meets wrong, all these classic and endless feuds have all come together in this movie, in a fight, a fight that will not stop until there is but one left standing.David Franzoni wrote the story and David Franzoni wrote the screenplay, and he did an indescribable, magnificent job doing that. You don't believe me? Ask the 5 Oscars, 45 other awards and 79 other award nominations this movie got.This movie is (believe it or not) based on emotions. In fact all movies are. Take away the emotions and what have you got left? Nothing! What is a fight in the arena without rage? What is a relationship without love? What is a good day without happiness? What is the point of righteousness if there is no wrong in the world? You get my point.In this world, there are no words, no words at all that can do the acting in this movie or the movie itself any justice.Before I sat down to write this review I did a search for gladiator to find out the last name of the writer, and I stumbled upon this: "This movie teaches us a crucial lesson about power. Power is one of those elusive qualities that we all aspire to have. We seek it through money, through education, through politics, and through our social ties. When we think of the Roman Empire, we think of "power." The Roman Empire ruled over the Old World for hundreds of years. There were other individuals and nations that managed to conquer much of the world: Alexander the Great is the most famous, and Napoleon wreaked some havoc in his time. But since the fall of the Roman Empire, that level of sheer power has not been matched." Everything with this movie is awesome. The acting, the lighting, staging, music, everything. I can actually not think of one single thing with this movie that is less than awesome. True story.Well, I am guessing you have probably figured this out already, but this was a good movie. So, good that I am giving it 9 stars. Yup, 9 out of 10 stars from me, and If you haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend you to do so.Howdy ho and a bottle of rum! Buenos Noches mis lectores.

"Gladiator" breaks the tendency of not doing historic films. Everybody remembers "Julio Cesar", "Ben-Hur", "Sinuhe, the Egyptian", and "Gladiator" gets in this kind of films. The story has a historic ground, Marco Aurelio and Comodo's reigns, but also it has an human story of revenge and courage. This film may be the best historic film in the last years. Russell Crowe is genial in the character of Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Comodo, but further more, the director, Ridley Scott, a classical in this kind of films.

I was a fan of Russel Crowe before this film but his spectacular performance as Maximus made me appreciate his acting skills even more.I won't go through the plot because let's face it, you've probably already read up about the it however I will say that although the plot is amazing, it is not spectacular. I believe that what made this film amazing was a combination of the incredible acting, directing, scriptwriting and the incredible soundtrack. The fight scenes in this film are some of the best I have seen, there is one specific scene that I have in mind. If you have seen Gladiator, I am sure you will know which one I am talking about.Gladiator is one of my favorite films of all time and it will remain that way. The only reason I did not give this masterpiece a 10/10 is because I do not believe that any film, or anything is truly 'perfect', but Gladiator is pretty damn close.</fullReview>

Yet, as much as I loved Russell Crowe in this movie, I find that Joaquin Phoenix's performance was just a little bit better. Phoenix has such amazing talent and I was really upset when he didn't end up winning the Academy Award for this performance. Also, Connie Nielsen was also very good and made a perfect Roman princess.

		<shortDescription>Gladiator and its vision through Maximus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I want to start off by saying that this is a fantastic movie. The actors and the production crew did a great job at portraying each characters emotions and struggles. The plot is also very well written as it draws the audience into its midst and captures everyones attention. One thing that I want to focus on is the character Maximus. Obviously being the main character, Maximus is the star of the movie. He is for one, courageous and strong, never giving up and always fighting for his freedom. He is also a respectful and very humble man. He never shows disrespect to those above him and he never brags about his strength and power. In a quote from the movie he is asked what he is saying to his family who is in the afterlife. He states, "To my son - I tell him I will see him again soon. To keep his heels down while riding his horse. To my wife... that is not your business." With a sense of humor he respects his family and remains pure at most. Maximus also never gives up. He understands that he has to keep fighting to stay alive. Anything less and he is a dead man. In explaining this to another character he says, "I am required to kill, so I kill. That is enough." Wow. He does it because he has to. If he didn't have to, he probably wouldn't harm a fly. He seems to be the most kind and considerate person, but on the other side of things, understands what is necessary to stay alive. One of my favorite lines from the movie is this, "What we do in life echoes in eternity." While not all of us in this world believe in life after death, there is truth and meaning to this for us who do believe. Maximus has has faith in something far more greater then what is here on earth. I love how the movie is constantly showing how Maximus is looking towards the afterlife. When things get tough and there seems to be know way out, this thought of the afterlife, keeps him going. Maximus understands that there is something greater, and he will one day be able to reunite with his family which he loves greatly. I also love the character that Maximus plays because he is constantly keeping one eye on eternity. In the old testament of the Bible, Ecclesiastes 3, verse 11 says that, "He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end." What a great reminder that this life isn't all that there is. There is more to live for then living a good life, having a good job, and making lots of money. I am not only saying that these things are not important, but they shouldn't control us. What is also very neat in this movie is that the glimpses of the after life are not fully visible. They are not completely clear as to what is happening in these scenes but it is obvious that these scenes of the afterlife are way better then the times during this movie. These glimpses are not completely seen; but we know they seem to be full of life and satisfying. In 2nd Corinthians, the writer says, "So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." What is unseen is eternal. We don't think like that everyday. But we should.Way to go for this film becoming a top favorite movie for many people. But even cooler, intentionally or not, how it uses its main character to highlight on greater things to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator: A breathtaking epic from Ridley Scott</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a jubilant start to his career, I wasn't too impressed with Ridley Scott with his films. They sure were epic pieces, but they usually weren't masterpieces. I wanted to see something visually dazzling and also very good in every other aspect. Gladiator was a perfect example of that...This breathtaking epic was visually sophisticated, well-made, and brilliantly acted. Ridley Scott did an amazing job with the brutal battle scenes, scenery, and characterization. This is truly his best film.The performances are perfect and ravishingly powerful in every way. Russell Crowe simply took the daylights out of me with his outstanding performance as Maximus. The guy was literally born for the role! Joaquin Phoenix is creepy and mesmeric as the evil Commodus, remaining perfect the whole time. The rest of the cast is also great...Overall, Gladiator is probably the best medieval epic you'll ever see. This is mainly because of Ridley Scott's brilliant direction, the outstanding performances, and the Oscar-worthy battle scenes. A must-see that deserved all the Academy Awards it got!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad story, some solid acting, crafted with extremely well choreographed martial-arts action sequences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back when this movie was born, I didn't get the chance to watch it. I'm glad I did today, of course, the 10th anniversary remastered version.In general, it's a typical action-oriented Hollywood blockbuster, where there's not much plot involved. But this film successfully keeps its pace at a mid rate that doesn't make audience fall asleep, which is good for its genre. Compared to action thrillers like Bourne films, it lacks twists, while compared to formulaic ones like Kill Bill and 300, it still offers you a lot to see; not to mention that it's got a good ending.As for the acting, not THAT much can be pointed out as outstanding since for a historical epic like this, it's mainly about men's bravery and the like. But, Russell Crowe's portrayal as Maximus is beyond awesome! He really brought the character into life as well as some depth. And of course, he's looking handsome as always (said by me, a boy who's not gay :D, LOL). Other characters do well enough to keep the film go on, but perhaps it's due to the simplicity of the parts for them that they do just good but not great on the whole.On the other hand, directing, coloring (post-production), score and staging are all very well done. The colorful cinematography reaches state of art. Everything, ranging from constructions, sceneries, costumes to decorations of rooms, is beautifully colorful. Action sequences are where the film truly stands out. Apart from being well choreographed, there're also many little innovations to them that are very original.The major flaw is certain useless subplots that slow the already-not- fast pace down, especially in the 1st act. But that doesn't hurt much, as the later scenes' intensity makes up for it.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a Roman general, who is loved by the people, and the Emperor. Right before his death the Emperor chooses Maximus to take his place, over his own son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Because of this Commodus kills his father, and orders the death of Maximus, and his wife and son. Maximus is not able to save his wife and son, and allows himself to be captured and put into the Gladiator games. The only thing that now keeps Maximus alive is the possibility to win over the crowd, and have a chance to get his revenge on the new Emperor.Gladiator is in my opinion Ridley Scott's masterpiece. With very excellent action scenes, and an absolutely fantastic musical score by Hans Zimmer, it quickly after watching it became one of my favorite movies of all time. Russell Crowe was in every way deserving of the Oscar he won. His performance was beyond fantastic, along with Joaquin Phoenix who was just unbelievable. The characters that these two men played were unforgettable, just like the incredible story. Overall, Gladiator is an outstanding movie, that you will not forget long after the movie is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The very definition of "epic".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate. Its the sand of the Colisseum. He'll bring them death, and they will love him for it."Gladiator ignited or rekindled a fascination with historical epics for a lot of people, and rightfully so. It hearkens back to movies like Spartacus and The Ten Commandments, sweeping and grand film events that go all out in taking you back to a specific time and place.It's a very good movie. The story of a once great man who is stripped of his family and his honor and left with nothing but his desire for revenge and the gladiatorial arena, is simple and powerful. But there are two real reasons why Gladiator works so well: Russell Crowe is the perfect Maximus, and the sets are absolutely awe-inspiring. This is the closest to seeing ancient Rome that any of us will ever get, and if you weren't impressed by Commidus's entry to Rome or the scenes in the Colisseum, I don't know what WOULD impress you. Each building and battle rings of authenticity and attention to detail.&nbsp;Crowe gives a believability to Maximus that many actors wouldn't have been able to pull off half as well. He makes Maximus seem a man who truly would inspire awe among the public and his followers, and jealousy from those who feel threatened by him. There were several notable performances from this cast, but Crowe stands above them all. It's still his finest role, in my opinion.Gladiator is the best movie that Ridley Scott has made since Blade Runner. It's impressive in all aspects, and completely deserves the lofty reputation that it has.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resurrection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the Director's Cut yet and I have to admit, that the story really didn't capture me as much as it did with others. For once, many things that happened were so foreseeable, I was able to close my eyes, open them a few minutes later and could see what I predicted was gonna happen.While that still works for many movies, it did kind of ruin my enjoyment of the Gladiator. A movie which "resurrected" the Sandal movie, as was stated back then. Obviously, ten years later it's safe to say, that didn't really happen. But what made this movie so popular? For one thing, every movie that has a sort of underdog as a main character, can always be sure to get many sympathies. But that's not all! Mr. Ridley Scott shot this movie in a great way. Some symbolisms in the framing and the color scheme, being also responsible for peoples reactions.And while I did like the fight scenes and the scenery in general, the movie left me cold for the main character. I'm not completely alone with my perception of the movie (I still think that a 6/10 is pretty good), but it's more likely that you will like this and won't really think about plot points and the journey of the hero, while you watch this ... Something I couldn't do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone seems to have an affinity for this film. Maybe I prejudged it and did not go in with an open, or even a slanted mind. I look at the background images on the screen as much as I look at the main characters in the foreground. The cinema was impressive as well as the timing from scene to scene. Maybe, just maybe, I missed something important in this film, prompting me to give it a negative critique. However, I will never change my opinion of the impossible story line. Clearly it is just Hollywood. Joaquin Phoenix was great as always and the military uniforms and other garb of the era were well done. Thanks, people. I will view the movie again........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Infamy! Infamy!...they've all got it in for me!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with many Ridley Scott films "Gladiator" is cleverly made,full of dialogue that at first hearing sounds deeper and and more meaningful than it actually is and comic - book characters. Up to the time of Marcelus's death it holds the interest well enough apart from Mr R.Harris's constant use of the word "Ah!" in order to convey "irony" ,and Mr R.Crowe's occasional lapse into his native "strine" isn't too grating and he's certainly handy with a sword.But the development of the role of Commodus (a name worthy of any "Carry on" movie)as the new Caesar (Mr J.Pheonix about as frightening as a baddie in "Batman")and the ousting of Mr Crowe signal a drastic change from a well - realised account of the conduct of the Roman Army in Northern Europe to a second - rate retread of "Spartacus". With bits liberally borrowed from "Ben Hur" and "The fall of the Roman Empire" and "The Searchers" via "Star Wars",Mr Scott's sources are impeccable,it's his execution that is disappointing. A few British TV actors appear as Senators and such,to very little effect I'm afraid,their over-familiarity does them or the movie no favours.Presumably "Isn't that the bloke from Z Cars?" was not the response Mr Scott was looking for. Where the movie scores is in the Special Effects department. The fight scenes are well - handled,the tigers being particularly impressive,but CGI alone do not a great movie make. The late Oliver Reed acts almost as if he knows "Gladiator" is going to be his last hurrah,it's all in his eyes,most of his dialogue is pretty banal.His leonine head held high with obvious effort,he gives the movie what little gravitas it possesses.His may have been a somewhat checkered career but he went out with all guns blazing. Mr Scott,as highly accomplished as he is ,continues,since "Blade Runner" to be a director in search of a movie.I note that many people believe he found it in "Gladiator",but I respectfully beg to differ.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay maybe a 2 out of 10 is a bit harsh but it can make up for the ridiculous ratings of 10 out of 10. This movie was nothing new. It wasn't gripping, or interesting, or factual, it was just boring, I was waiting for it to get kicking all the time. I decided to watch it because of the high ratings and I remember quite enjoying Ben Herr and Spartacus but all this filmed seemed to be was lots of long beautifully filmed shots of the scenery. The fight scenes were good but didn't help make the film any more interesting. The acting was good, but didn't help make the plot any better.

		<shortDescription>And here it is! My favorite movie of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, finally I get the time to comment my undisputed favorite! Gladiator is my favorite movie because it gave me the opportunity to a bit of a 'teaser' of what I could expect in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. But since Hollywood altered and messed up LotR, Gladiator remains my all time favorite. However!!! My favorite thing to do (as you all know), is to rap down on my favorites. This time, Gladiator must pay. Hehe &gt;:)Gladiator did one very serious mistake; it mixed fiction and reality. That's a mistake that a. o. Xena: Warrior Princess made several times. (There, they portrayed the Troyan war to occur sometime during Julius Ceasar's reign as war Marshall. These two event, both actual events from history, occurred with a void of 400 years between.) They started of the film with the Romans going to war in Germanica. And winning. This is wrong. The Roman Empire never seized Germanica, and never won any battles there. (Except for Italy beating Germany in soccer a couple of times.) They continue with Commodus, son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, kills his father to become the new Emperor. This I cannot verify as a true event or not, but it seems far-fetched. I don't buy. However, it does make a good drama scene. And they end the movie with Emperor Commodus being killed by his former general, Maximus, now turned gladiator, in the Colosseum. Now, it is true that Commodus did fight gladiators in the Colosseum, and it is likely that that's how he died, I do not know this for sure myself. But, the film's main character, Maximus, is merely a character of fiction, so if Commodus was killed in the Colosseum, it was not by him. Except for this, the film is the absolute best in its genre, and yes, I still consider it a lot better than the LotR trilogy. Here's my five reasons why. 1. Gladiator had to start from scratch. No one had heard of it before its first press release and premiere. LotR has been common knowledge for more than 40 years. 2. LotR was written by one of the worlds's greatest and most intelligent authors of all time. How are you suppose to best that? I'm not saying that the Gladiator script was better than the LotR books, but at least it was an honest piece of work. 3. Like millions of other LotR fans, my expectations for the trilogy was sky high. And from a book reader's point of view, I was more or less disappointed when I saw the result. This was not Tolkien, this was Hollywood. Gladiator was more Hollywood than LotR, but we didn't expect it to be anything else either. 4. When Gladiator was, and remains to this day, completely free! Unlike, LotR, it's not tied down by copyrights and spinoffs and merchandicing and whatnot. You might find a couple of t-shirts or something out there, but they would most likely only be promotional or something. The LotR concept have released billions of merchandice, and they are dependant on these things being sold, and they expect a certain amount of profit. What was once a wonderful piece of authory art and the most loved and respected piece of fantasy literature of all time has become a money machine. Shame! Gladiator is of course making a lot of money still, but no everybody expected that to happen. And at last 5. Gladiator clearly thought of real talent and realistic appearance before popularity and sex appeal. Compare Russell Crowe's MAximus and Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn anyday, and I am very sure you will have to admit that Russel's MAximus will come out victorious. Russell looks like a regular, everyday worker. A bit grimy and rustic, and hard knocked. Maximus looked like he hadn't seen water ever most of the film and it fit him well. Ergo, Russell fits the bill when a character needs to be down and dirty. Viggo Mortensen, who is a very good looking fellow to begin with, was made to look good as Aragorn, even when Aragorn was dirtied up or injured. He was always stylish, even in the Ranger rags he wore. Now don't get me wrong, the LotR trilogy is so definitely worth a watch, but I don't think you should watch with any expectations whatsoever, and certainly not with the books in mind.So, my recommendations are as follows; watch Gladiator if you don't have the time to watch any of the Lord of the Rings films. I can guarantee that you will be just as entertained, if not more.One more note; this movie was also Oliver Reed's last film as he died during the shooting of the film in Malta due to heart failure. He was 61. The film is dedicated in his memory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Gladiator, but remember being disappointed on first viewing in the theatre. Repeat viewing on VCR and especially DVD have confirmed its place as a classic. Gladiator isn't perfect. A fifteen minute trim could do it a lot of favours, and Joachim Phoenix is too much in certain scenes. On the other hand, its Crowe's finest hour, with good support from Oliver Reed and Richard Harris.Scott's recreation of the second century Roman world is outstanding and ambitious. Battle scenes feel like a Vietnam movie, gladiatorial combat is fast and bloody. What really makes Gladiator work is Scott's commitment to a brutal world. People die, and life is unfair. This darker tone combined with outstanding effects work offers the viewer an epic tale, well told.outstanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That this movie beat out "Traffic" for the best picture Oscar is the definition of idiocy. I admire Ridley Scott, and liked Russell Crowe in "The Insider" and "L.A. Confidential," but they're both responsible for the debacle that is "Gladiator."The rest of the world must have seen a different movie. I saw a bloated, overlong, tedious, humorless, joyless, tired, boring, ugly-looking, cliched film with terrible digital effects and lead characters with zero personality. Scott has directed two of my favorite movies, "Alien" and "Blade Runner," but "Gladiator" is a dead zone. Anybody could have directed it. Alan Smithee may as well have done it.Two movies show up "Gladiator," even as it strives to be like both of them. They are "Braveheart" and "Spartacus." Both Mel Gibson and Kirk Douglas showed more zest for life (and violent death) than Russell Crowe, who appears to be either A) sleep walking or B) angry with Ridley Scott for putting him in the movie. What a boring performance! To see this kind of savage, revenge-driven character done right, there's still no topping Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace. It was over the top, but by golly, you felt the man's passion."Gladiator" is a mess. I don't know any other way to describe it. Oscars and money don't always equal quality, apparently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somehow many people seem to like this Roman empire set action drama flick. I'm definitely not one of them.It's a cheap, yet expensive, excuse of a story, already seen a thousand times (i.e. basically revenge), to cover the real reason for this movie: the fights. In this it is quite similar to 'Braveheart'. It falls far behind many, if not most, other films taking place in the same era, like 'Spartacus' or 'Ben Hur', although these included action scenes, too.The monetary success most likely originates from the same reasons that sports do--among them handsome people, villains/opponents, heroism, "blood, sweat &amp; tears", and plenty of pathos. I honestly think this ultimately proves that today's people would visit real, bloody gladiator fights, if they were still allowed.I must confess that I didn't watch it on the big screen, so maybe I missed the full beauty of larger-than-life landscapes and deaths, after all it was pretty well done technically. It also was dubbed in German.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Final Score:2.8 (out of 10)Oh, please. I was never for a second of it's bloated 3 hours able to get into Ridley Scott's "Gladiator". Crowe's brooding Maximus is a pretty lifeless template of a character as was it's entire Roman revenge flick story. Maximus' adventures from general to slave to star gladiator are unimaginative. We don't empathize so much with Maximus personally as we do with the IDEA of him getting revenge for the murder of his family. That's all the movie is- one big symbol. There is nothing in the drama that is engaging and nothing in the action that was exciting. Honestly, how exciting is it seeing someone jumping around in an enclosed arena. Yeah, I know it historically happened, but it comes off almost silly. I don't want to sound like a snob here. I went in sure I would love it and came out bored out of my mind. From the very first few scenes you can tell exactly where it is going and what plot points it will hit along the way. Then we just sit there and watch as it drags itself from one obvious scene after another toward it's predetermined destination. A lot of times I can personally not like a movie and still respect it on a cinematic and technical level (like "Shakespeare in Love" or "From Hell", which I wouldn't personally recommend but the films are so great in parts that they get high scores and do deserve a look). But other than a nice looking payoff I couldn't find anything in this movie to admire. It's a whole lot of nothing. The special effects are lazy and obvious. It's battle scenes have a rushed and grainy. Plus, we've seen it all before- and much better. It's a viceral movie without any thrills. All style and no substance, when the style isn't even very good. This generation deserves a good Roman empire/gladiator movie (and, based on Gladiator's success, is hungry for one)- but this isn't it. And yes, Russell Crowe only won the Oscar for this movie as a way of honoring his work in "The Insider" the year before.</fullReview>

For Most Money and Research Used to Least Effect, the sinking of the White Star liner and the Roman Empire are just about a tie, but for contrived situations and dialogue that clanks worse than the armour (not to mention cheesy special effects), "Gladiator" is in a class of its own. The film's popularity, and its garland of ill-earned awards are a distressing instance of substituted reality (the late, unlamented Dr Paul Goebbels would have understood this very well), of hype feeding on itself: the movie, as a movie rather than a sales-campaign, is a dud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would never say that the Acadamy Awards mean anything, but still I must say that I take a perverse pleasure out of watching the whole affair. Ridley Scott's Gladiator will most definitely go down in history as one of the most gaudy, inept pieces of commercial pap to come down the tube in a long time. In terms of films that have been nominated for Best Picture, it will rank right up there with Cimarron (and that won!). Have a little perspective, people--there were some great films made this year, and this is an ugly little movie. With barely the inclination to turn its own lens on the idea of our modern audiencing of violence (a theme that would seem pretty obvious, and fairly easy to follow up on), Gladiator is another example of our movie going cultures' willingness to be spoon-fed every little detail, and unwillingness to be the least bit reflective. Did anyone see Hannibal (another Scott crap-sterpiece)? Is there anything left for the imagination these days?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent story, good acting, lots of gladiator action, beautiful filming, I rate "8" of 10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have criteria for a film to make it up to my "9" or "10" rating and this one does not reach that level. Still, it is a very entertaining film that plays shorter than its 2 1/2 hours, and gives a good glimpse of the Roman state of emperors and politics in the second century after Christ. I rate it a solid "8" of 10.The straightforward storyline is not new. A loyal soldier, a "Spaniard" (Russell Crowe)who aging emperor Marcus Aurelius calls "Rome's greatest general", leads the Roman army to a convincing victory in Germania, the last frontier for the 180 A.D. Romans. This general, "Maximus", is the son the emperor wishes he had and asks him to come to Rome to help create a democracy. Immediately all fortunes change and Maximus goes from general to slave to gladiator to rebel. Packed around that storyline are some excellent, however gory, battle and arena scenes. The film ends a bit unbelievably.The DVD picture and sound are great. You get 2 discs for your purchase, the second has all the "extras" which are quite extensive and provide good perspectives on the Roman Empire, and the making of this film.** CAUTION - SPOILERS - READ AT YOUR OWN RISK -----After the victory at Germania, all Maximus wants to do is go home to his farm and wife and young son. It had been 2 years and 265 days since he had seen them. When the emperor's son, Commodus, finds out about his father's favor towards the Spaniard, he kills his own father to become emperor, has his guards take Maximus out to kill him, but Maximus gets the upper hand and kills them all and, badly wounded on his left shoulder, rides towards home. Roman guards also destroy his home, and kill his wife and son. He sees this, passes out, and is a changed man.He is rescued and sold into slavery to become a gladiator in small venues in a remote Roman province. There, he quickly becomes a killing machine, and soon heads for the big time in Rome, where the new emperor is putting on "150 straight days" of gladiator games in the area. The Romans are entertained by seeing gladiators kill each other, or Christian children eaten by lions.Ever since the old emperor was killed, then his family killed, Maximus's sole ambition was to face the emperor and get revenge. At their first face-to-face encounter, the Spaniard's popularity with the crowd kept him alive. Repeated "traps" were unsuccessful because Maximus was such a good fighter.Commodus borders on insane. He has a driving lust for his own sister, Lucilla, and tells her he wants a son by her so he can have his own legitimate heir to the throne, instead of her son by a now dead husband. Lucilla ends up helping in a plot to free Maximus who would return in a few days with an army of 5,000 to kill Commodus and restore some semblance of democracy, to fulfill the desires of the dead emperor. But insiders spoil that plot, kill Maximus' friend, and imprison him again.Finally, crazy Commodus wants to settle it in a fight in the arena between him and Maximus, man-to-man. But Commodus cheats - while Maximus is still shackled, Commodus stabs him deeply in the abdomen in what turns out to be a mortal wound. However, he has enough strength to first kill Commodus, and order all prisoners freed, and Rome freed, then Maximus dies and we see him, in dream-like sequences, joining his wife and son in the afterlife.A couple of things did not ring true. Maximus was so much better than everyone else, and it is only barely credible that anyone could have fought out of all those situations. Also, I am not a student of Roman history, but I find it hard to believe that an emperor would get into the arena and fight a gladiator. Still, it is a good watch and I will see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sword and sandal epic revived, as boring as ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So Hollywood revived the long forgotten sword and sandal epic, absent from the screen in the last decade(s). In the case of Gladiator, it would have better still not be revived.Gladiator comes along as a multi-million, box-office super-seller with actually nothing behind it. We get the mass battle scenes, some sword-dancing fights between gladiators and a lot of togas. The plot: not outstanding, the characters: clich-like. No character gets really developed, everything is aimed at a sensual overflow (sometimes intersparsed with un-motivated sun-set shots). In addition to that, the shooting is quite poor: murky, unfocused and plain. The body count is high, but triggers no emotions (kind like a splatter movie in sandals..)To put it simple: I had to fight to stay awake, save your (over-time) money for some better films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe it will be better on the small screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off let me say this film was merely OK, nothing more, nothing less. We've seen this story dozens of times before, in a dozen different genres, from gladiator movies to football films. The antagonist attempts to, and sometimes does, force out the film's opening hero only to have the hero come back, after a period of rebuilding and soul searching, and defeat the antagonist in the end. James Caan and John Houseman did it much better in "Rollerball" The characters were all your standard Roman cliches with the exception of the wonderful final performance by Oliver Reed. This was the film's one saving grace.The film style in the battle and fight scenes was rocky enough to give the most stalwart rollercoaster fan motion sickness, while the more cerebral portions of the film were so deadly dull that these sections could cure even the worst insomniac. I saw the film at the Cinerama in Seattle and that magnifies everything about the film, especially its flaws. Maybe it will be easier to watch when it hits the small (TV) screen.</fullReview>

I felt sorry for the actors, who were obviously better than the material and were doing their best. I ended up leaving my husband in his seat and ducking into another theatre to see the end of Return to Me, which I'd seen previously and enjoyed. I went back in 90 minutes, thinking my husband would be waiting impatiently, only to find that the movie was still going. I sat through about 10 more minutes before I realized that I had absolutely no interest whatsoever in what had happened to the characters in the interim to get them to that point. So I left again, and walked to a nearby bookstore to wait through the remaining 20 minutes. Maybe I am not qualified to review this movie since I didn't even see half of it, but the fact that I never walk out of movies--this was only the second in 25 years--should say something.

		<shortDescription>A horrible epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the worst movie I have seen this year and I saw "Romeo Must Die". Popcorn farers will consider this movie deep, moving, and informative. In reality, the acting is horribly melodramatic, more sentimental and overblown than anything I have seen in a while. I felt like I have seen every scene in this movie about a thousand times before: that's how filled with cinematic cliches the plot is. Only redeeming future are a couple of great fight scenes, especially the one with the juggernauts, which was the only time I found myself cheering for either of the sides. That marks another major fault of the movie: in the opening scene, it is impossible to tell who the characters are, and what side they are on, with exception of Maximus (who we simply know to be a Roman from the ads) and one big German guy too animalistic to be on Rome's side. There is some foreshadowing done with a dog, who one expects to play a major role in the battle or to functon prominently in the rest of the movie, it does neither. I am not even gonna mention the historical errors, but looking up Lucius Verus or the Gracchus brothers in the dictionary should be enough. That, and I still haven't figured out why Romans should speak with a British accent. Oscar voters should fall in love with this: it's an epic, it scores huge at the box office, all performances are overdone. If you ever liked a Fellini or a Kubrick film, stay away. 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rent "Spartacus" instead . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for "Gladiator." This is the first Roman epic to appear in years (not counting the recently released "Titus," as it is more Elizabethan than Roman), and with the promise of Russell Crowe and a large budget, I thought it would be a wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Though Crowe does deliver a fine performance, this film is crippled by a ridiculous script, delivering thinly drawn supporting characters and perhaps the worst ending since last year's "Pushing Tin." I admit, many of the gladitorial combats are amazing to watch, but they simply cannot support the story. As far as accuracy to Roman customs and history goes, the filmmakers succeed in their portrayal of Roman death games as being widely varied: we see games involving animals, chained gladiator pairs, and battle reenactments ("the Battle of Carthage" scene in "Gladiator" is quite powerful and darkly comic), yet, they make the standard mistake of the "thumbs up/thumbs down" issue in the Roman arena. When the crowd wanted an emperor, or other game sponsor, in Rome to allow an athlete to live, they raised their hands, not their thumbs, to indicate a show of mercy. I admit, this is a minor point, but one could imagine that the filmmakers might have done a little more homework on such issues. Incidentally, there are numerous readable and engaging scholarly works on the subject of the Roman games, Roland Auguet's 1972 "Cruelty and Civilization" in particular. "Gladiator" contains other glaring historical inconsistencies, but I dare not mention them for fear of spoiling the ending.If you're craving a Roman epic, I would suggest skipping "Gladiator" in favor of Stanley Kubrick's 1960 "Spartacus," an occasionally flawed, yet much superior film.</fullReview>

Pure perfection , Tony and Ridley Scott really captured the essence of the Gladiator movies ! It definitely was worthy of every Oscar , it received ! Russel Crowe's performance as Maximus was as stellar as Charlton Heston's in Ben Hur. There was a only one part of this movie, that really got to me. And that was heartless merciless murder of his family. I broke into tears, but despite that depressing scene. It is still one of my all time favorite movies! I would definitely rate it an A +! But due to minor suggestive scenes this movie is not for everyone. But if you like action till the death and some blood shed , then this is the movie for you!</fullReview>

Mainly, this was a good movie because of Ridley Scott and Joaquin Phoenix, who had to work AROUND Crowe, and support his performance, in order for his "work" to even be watchable, much less steal an Oscar for the best leading male role. He SO didn't deserve that.I also have to admit that I did NOT agree that Gladiator was the best movie of 2000. I thought that award should have gone to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Now THAT was a film! Other than my misgivings surrounding Crowe's inept performance and the fact that he did not deserve the awards he won, Gladiator is still enjoyable; despite Crowe's involvement, however, NOT because of it.Joaquin Phoenix is GREAT in this film and makes it well worth watching.It rates a 6.6/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The " Gladiator" did not sound like a film that I would enjoy, however, this film was full of action scenes and great photography. Russell Crowe(Maximus),"Proof of Life",2000, played an excellent role as the General of the Roman Army and the battle scenes and weapons used in those early A.D. ages was extremely well done. Maximus was well loved by the Roman soldiers as well as Ceasar. Connie Nielsen,(Lucilla),"Basic",'03, was the daughter of Ceasar and was a former lover of Maximus. There are a great deal of twists and turns in this story concerning Maximus and he eventually has the great task of fighting among Gladiators. There are great tones hinting about possible incest between a sister and her brother and very little romance. However, this film will take you way back in History and show in great detail war tactics from the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May Contain Some Spoilers.This comment is My opinions.I already commented of the wonderful epic but there just something I wanted to say. First I feel that this is the one of the greatest films ever and it is arguably the greatest film of all time and I feel that everything was perfect. The cast, the music, the sets, everything and the scenes are perfected with such emotional moments. One is that When Maximus returns home to find his family. Russell Crowe put everything he had into that scene! The performances of the great actors Oliver Reed and Richard Harris was outstanding and Joaquin Phoenix was the perfect choice to play Emperor Commodus and what a performance and Connie Nielsen was such a smart choice. It was a treat to see Omid Djalili, Sven-Ole Thorsen, Ralf Moeller, Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, and Tommy Flanagan in one film! One of the greatest things about this epic blockbuster is the music by great composer Hans Zimmer. During the scene when Commodus and Marcus Aurelius are together for the last time (Patricide which it is called on the soundtrack which is track 7) the music plays during this scene and it fits the it perfectly and I believe that that is the greatest piece of music ever composed and I think this is Zimmer's greatest score ever and I don't think he'll be able to top it. Lisa Gerrard's singing in the film is beautiful! Buy the soundtrack along with the second great album by Zimmer and Gerrard on Amazon.com for a low great price! The second album I feel is even better than the first! Ridley Scott's direction was great and I loved the fast past camera effort and the battles were so good and exciting! That's all I wanted to say. I feel that Gladiator gets 10 stars and is one of the greatest films ever made! If you have not seen this awesome movie yet then when you have a chance rent or even buy it because believe Me when you watch it you won't want to stop and you'll want to see it again and again. Its truly a special film and I Hope that everyone will be able to see the golithian epic!</fullReview>

The story makes no sense. There are big holes in it that bothered me so much I couldn't get involved. The writer tries to impose mawkish modern sentiment on the Romans. A Caesar, and Roman population, that want peace. A Caesar who wants to restore power to the Senate. A conquering general (from somewhere in the stix, who has never even been to Rome) who just wants to go home. Sensitive gladiators. Come on! Once you start seeing the failures of this film, the lack of artistry, the lack of creativity, even the lack of originality of the story (see "Spartacus," for a start), you'll find little to like, nothing to admire. Crowe is nice-looking fellow, very poorly cast for the role, and cast is the right word; he has only one facial expression, sort of a sad-dog face. The producers spent a lot of money, obviously, but none of it was on research. This might as well be set on a distant planet as in Rome. There should have been ewoks.

Rome who soon becomes a fugitive and warrior-slave after the Emperor dies and his ambitious, wicked son (Joaquin Phoenix) takes command. Director Ridley Scott's sword-and-sandal, blood-and-guts spectacular isn't anything original, yet it certainly looks good and has many moments of power and emotion. Scott tries for the sweep of a latter-day "Spartacus", but the script isn't as intriguing and the film, while entertaining on the whole, isn't as memorable. Dedicated to actor Oliver Reed (Proximo), who makes his final film appearance, this Oscar winner for Best Picture has old-fashioned ideals transposed after the new-fangled violence, with lots of bloody action to snare modern moviegoers; it works successfully enough, and Scott efficiently uses the long running-time to build character and dramatic tension. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where was Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson???...Russell Crowe's gaze could melt an iceberg...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While viewing GLADIATOR and seeing how the "revenge" theme was carried to the fullest, I kept expecting to see Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson riding in on their horses to avenge the killing of Russell Crowe's family as they did in so many westerns.I have to give the film itself a mixed review--and mostly for technical reasons. First, I thought the performances were all splendid. Russell Crowe's intent gaze could melt an iceberg and he uses this intensity to add power to his portrayal. Believe me, it works. Joaquin Phoenix is so good that he should have won the Supporting Role Oscar for his work. He was spine-chilling as the villainous Commodus, pitted against his arch enemy Maximus. Great acting by both men. The battle scenes were excessively gory with buckets of blood gushing everywhere--on a grand scale befitting an epic but perhaps an indication that today's sensibilities are more than blurred.On the technical side, I don't understand all these comments about the photography. The color took on a distinctly murky look for much of the film, both interiors and exteriors. It made me wonder what kind of color stock was being used to get this muddy effect. Was it intentional? Take a look at the technicolor epics of the '40s and '50s where there was such great color contrast and brilliance in the color. I was very disappointed in the color photography. No need for it to be so dark. Perhaps on a large theater screen this wasn't as much a fault.Another thing--much of the dialog was muttered in soft tones that could not overcome the background music. A good dialog director should have coached the players to enunciate words more clearly. This is a fault that occurs throughout the film and is very distracting--and no, I'm not hard of hearing at all, thank you.Aside from those two quibbles, length was another factor that should have been solved with better editing. There are dull stretches where the dialog goes on much too long to make a point about character development.Definitely not a perfect film and not particularly Oscar worthy although I'm impressed by the performances. While SPARTACUS was a much more interesting look at gladiators, perhaps GLADIATOR was meant to be the thinking man's film about Ancient Rome. It just misses the mark.Russell Crowe's intense style of acting and Joaquin Phoenix's strikingly vivid villain made GLADIATOR work for me.</fullReview>

Also worth seeing is Oliver Reeds' final performance (he's very good). All the other acting is OK, but the story is just so drawn out and I was always one step ahead of it.

He discovers that he has to live a new life and tries to adjust to it the best way possible Joaquin Phoenix co-stars as Commodus along with Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou and the late greats Richard Harris and Oliver Reed.

Music was junk (didn't expect it at all from Hans Zimmer, normally excellent..). The whole movie just didn't have the atmosphere it could have had.

The result is a complete mess of incorrect historical insights, kitsch images based on manneristic painters of the XIX century like Sir Lawrence Alma-Tedema and Jean-Lon Grme. The dialogs are pure soap-opera: the kingdom of obvious bla, bla, bla. Some isolated efforts of Richard Harris and Oliver Reed are responsible for the less camp moments of the movie. For a second time we assist The Fall of the Roman Empire. Now as a farce. As we said in Brazil: Que merda!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was sooo hyped to see this movie. You have no idea. But my God, it wasnt just bad, it was awful. I'm sitting here staring at the glowing Entertaintment Weekly review and I just cant believe it. Other reviews for the most part are just as good. Did everybody else go to a different movie then I did? Did they not see an overlong bore? Did they not see the maybe 2 or so facial expressions Russel Crowe used in the movie that is supposed to be good acting? Did they not see the action scenes that were put in fast motion and slow motion that were completely unneeded, unartistic, and unoriginal? I wonder if Ridley Scott could have ripped off Spielberg a little more? And the dialogue! Did I hear the young emperor say, "Im very vexed, terrible vexed!" I laughed out loud. Was that supposed to be that funny? Or was that just horrifically bad writing? And how about those lovely computer generated lions? Complete trash. How can you people be giving this movie 10's and sending it into the top 100 already. Let there be a backlash please. Movies this bad deserve one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not enjoy this movie very much, I thought that it was a good way for dreamworks to make a quick buck or in this case a quick 200 million bucks. I am saddened that Russel Crowe won his oscar for this movie, as opposed to his excellent ACTING in The Insider. Crowe was great in The Insider because that film showed that he can ACT in many different situations, as opposed to him showing how he can try to get revenge. I think that this will be remembered as a great action movie. This was a good movie because it was grand and it was big and flashy, however some of the other movies that were released in the year 2000 were good movies, because they had meaning, substance, and they were powerful films. These movies were good for reasons other than their special effects and their director and stars. I did not enjoy this movie because I was disturbed that this film won best picture as opposed to Requiem For A Dream, which was a powerful and groundbreaking film. I do not think it was the best picture of the year, no offense to anyone involved with this film, but.. that is my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if this contains any spoilers, but you probably don't want to read this before viewing this movie. I went unto the movie theater with excitement. All the reviews that I had read about this movie raved about it's perfect marriage of stunning action and well-constructed plot. What I found was an unrepentent melodrama of the worst stripe. The audience nearly boo-ed and hissed everytime the villain came on screen, and cheered heavily upon the protagonist. The script for Spice-World has more depth, and certainly more well-rounded characters. Oh well, I thought. At least I could sit back and enjoy the eye-candy. And to a very limited extent, I did enjoy the gladatorial combats. The only problem is that 90% of those scenes were in the commercials that had been run excessively before the release. Other computer-assisted action sequences were quite terribly done, such as the opening battle and all of the psychedelic flashbacks. Overall, I feel that this is an embarrassing abortion of a movie. It's popularity proves to Hollywood that the market for Steven Seagal movies is still expanding fast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing to the maximus!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is stunningly bad.Russell Crowe is so wasted here. And Connie Neilsen could be beautiful so much more entertainingly somewhere else.The sound is muddy, the effects attempt what they can't deliver, and the script is so relentlessly incredible that not even Crowe's acting and Neilsen's astonishing good looks can rescue it.The initial battle scene, like so many, is ridiculous. The opposing forces are cheaply miniscule. The Romans chose laughably bad ground (downhill from the enemy!). And the ease with which the Romans position there cavalry behind the opponents is absurd. It was nice, if incomprehensible, to catch Scott's homage to the great film, ZULU -- the Germans seemed to have the Zulu battle chants down pat.Most annoyingly, Scott seems to think that an occasional spray of blood and a sickeningly jostled camera equals Big Action. More like Mild Nausea. We see much of this, alas, later in the movie, too.OK, so we grant a little geographic and medical license to Maximus as he rides, wounded, across much of Europe, to find his family murdered. But from that moment all credulity must be withheld. Since when does a Roman citizen place himself in jeopardy of being impressed by slave traders just because he makes the grave error of being unconscious? It might have made more sense if he'd woken up belowdecks on a British ship of the line in the 18th century.The climax of the film, though momentarily pleasing in the accuracy of its downbeat rendition of one's chance of succeeding in a plot against a Roman emperor, once again dismisses credibility: Commodus thinks he'll do better against a genuine heavyweight than Johnny Friendly did against Terry Malloy. Or imagine Al Gore suggesting that he and George Dubyah settle this thing mano a mano. Same idea. Puh-lease.The film was kind of a pagan BEN HUR, but without Jesus, the horses, the (real) crowds, and any significance whatever. And it lacked, especially, a crazy emperor like Caligula of the ROBE movies, played in his film debut by the brilliant Jay Robinson ("Messalina!"). Too much post-modern dysfunctional family stuff among Scott's Caesars.Yuck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Roman History Buff, the ending destroyed it. You have the ending where the fictional Maximus kills Commodus (a real Roman Emperor) in gladiatorial combat. (Commodus was actually strangled in his bath when poison wasn't killing him fast enough.) The sister of Commedus, Lucilla (who had actually been executed at the beginning of Commedus' reign) announces that we are all going to honor Maximus and restore the Republic.For a Roman history buff, this is like saying World War II was Hitler giving us all Ice Cream.What actually happened was that after Commedus (who wasn't that bad of a guy, really) Rome went into an embarrassing period known as the "Year of the Five Emperors, where a decent man was assassinated, the office of emperor was auctioned off, and three rival generals launched a civil war.This is universally agreed to be the tipping point of Rome's inevitable decline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, intense and dramatic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gladiator is one of those masterpieces of the past decade. This film contains everything that a film needs. It creates emotion, suspense, drama and most importantly a brilliant story that is mixed with real events and great characters. What Ridley Scott did so well, in what is probably his finest film, is that unlike many directors who may get carried away by the action, Scott remains in complete control of the story the whole way. There is not a second of pointless action that is put into the film. In fact, altogether, this film had very little action and a lot of substance into the story. Even though the theme "Revenge" has been done to death in films such as Kill Bill, Man on Fire and all the other films, no film truly captures its meaning like Gladiator does.The acting in this film is just brilliant. Russel Crowe does a splendid job with his character Maximum, whom during the film we really see as a real person and his tragedy. It was interesting to see the final fate of Maximum from a brave general into a slave and then into a gladiator who still remains a leader until his death. The other character I really enjoyed was Juba, and the friendship between the two was so beautifully done that I, after watching the Extended Edition, wished there was more of that. Something that really masterminds the film is Hans Zimmer's breathtaking musical score which just further perfects every scene. Even the character Commodus, is someone that I felt pity for, but at the same time found just filled with evil desire. He was brilliantly portrayed in the film and the final stand off between the two was just well put together. ***SPOILERS***When Commodus stabs Maximum just before their duel, you really see how pathetic of a person Commodus has become and his death was brilliantly portrayed. Even though I've cried when some characters die in movies, I really didn't cry when Maximum fell down and died because I knew that Ridley Scott only knew too well that Maximum's death meant that he could live a happier life with his family in the afterlife.I also liked Richard Harris' character of the Emperor. Seeing him getting killed by his only son was just depressing but also made only more sense. When Marcus Aurelius said to Maximus that he wished he had become Marcus' son, that continues to remind we of when Denethor from Lord of the Rings said that he wished Boromir had lived and Faramir had died. This film, much like Lord of the Rings, beautifully captures my interest in the film even without the fight scenes. Everything about this film was brilliant and so I loved it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best historical epics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While more "serious" film buffs and film critics don't like Gladiator very much, I, as an history buff, have special interest in ancient Roman history. It is perfectly true that Rome didn't became a republic in 182 AD, and this film can be understood more as an exercise of alternate history. Though is suffers from anachronisms, in terms of dialogue and history: Marcus Aurelius says that he expanded the empire, while in truth he didn't expand it, he only maintained the borders against the pressure from migrating Germanic tribes.Another problem is the fact that Rome never had grain reserves maintained by the State, or at least didn't have according to the historical evidence, and a line o dialogue says: "he is selling our future" when the emperor sells the grain reserves, such anachronisms plague the film and are an important flaw but I don't think that they merit the removal of a full point of the film's score. The dialogue and the characters are not the most complex ever but are executed well enough and this is enough. Excessive complexity and pretension can kill a film.Overall, I highly recommend this film to those people that love films but don't have any great pretension. More more artsy types shouldn't see it. For the benefit of both the public that liked it and themselves.</fullReview>

Ridley Scott brought out the best of Crowe in Gladiator, and his all round performance really felt as though he'd taken the time to research his role.A heart felt story line (loss of family) and the 'father-son' relationship with the Emperor really makes the viewer want Crowe to win in this battle with Commodus.And even with the film lasting well over 2 hours, I could have easily watched more. If you liked Braveheart, you will LOVE Gladiator.There is one line in Gladiator that sums this film up: "Are you not entertained?". Well, if you are not entertained after watching this, I'll be very surprised.</fullReview>

I can pretty much, hands down guarantee that a large majority of people would also enjoy this film and feel the same about it as it do. The best element of the film was the raw passion that the gladiator (Russell Crowe) shows throughout the movie and i also found his passion quite motivating, he constantly gets put down in his story and it seems as if he will never have any luck and i loved they way he kept getting back up and fighting with a new renowned spirit. must watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning Spoiler,,,,It's hard to believe that this bomb gets such high ratings. 1) Wooden acting and dialogue. 2) The MTV 'fast cut" photography does nothing to enhance the movie. It's merely a FAD promulgated by no talent camera people who substitute faddish standards when they can't think clearly or creatively. 3) Scott treats Maximus and Marcus Aurelius like they are noble characters, with corny swelling music. Instead of what they were. Vicious, ruthless creeps on par with the worst of the Nazis.4) Now to the worst part and the spoiler. Even if you've disagreed with the former you have to agree with this. This movie wants us to believe that Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) would put Maximus (Russell Crowe) into slavery because he threatens Commodus's chances of being the Emperor. He lets him live so he has a chance to come back and threaten later. Duh! Yeah that makes sense. He kills Maximus's wife &amp; kid though. C'mon! Any dufus dictator would have just executed him plain and simple.Then we are supposed to believe that Maximus rises to the top of the gladiatorial thingee far enough that he becomes a hero gladiator. Again. Duh! Commodus would allow this? Double Duh! Now the crowning blow to credulity. We are supposed to believe that the wimpy Emperor would be STUPID enough to climb down into the arena and fight the buff, tough, well trained killer Maximus.How stupid can movie goers and reviewers get? Pretty damn stupid I guess judging from the reviews here. Not all of us are fooled though.The real tragedy is that within the story of Rome are countless compelling stories. Truth is way more interesting than this kind of contrived fiction. A real movie about real life Romans would have been far more interesting. Romans were like us. Their rulers were lazy, corrupt, ignorant, egotistical and horribly brutish. They had slavery like us, conquered like us, maintained a republic for 200 years, like us, until they capitulated to a dictator and a dictatorship in the name of security, which I hope we avoid. The Romans were masters of self delusion and deliberate ignorance of the society they created.Spartacus, of course, comes to mind. The way that Kubrick explored the inner decay and fear of Laurence Olivier's Marcus twisted Licinius Crassus was brilliant to say the least. On the surface Crassus is genteel, educated, brilliant, but on the inside... Crassus kills HIS gladiator the way a real Roman Emperor would, after he is wounded, near death and no threat. He kills him in fear, cowardly, with a knife to the throat. He desperately wants Livia's love but doesn't know why or even what love is. He will never know love. He is obsessed with her indifference because it threatens his self deluded image of his own superiority. Rising to become the most powerful person in Rome he's really a pathetic shell of a human being terrified to confront his humanity. So pathetic he is worthy of pity from his slave.There is nothing in this film that even comes close. Its all flash over substance and not even great flash. The tension and anticipatory horror in final battle scene in Spartacus is palpable. We feel it the same as the rebels feel it. We are small and vulnerable in the coming gigantic battle. We feel their fear but we also know they are ready to die free because the alternative is worse. We are with them in spirit because we ARE them. We fear the Romans but we also hate their decadence and lack of decency and what they will do to our families. We may die but we are going to take down as many of them as we can.In Gladiator we are treated like dumb observers who can't think for ourselves. We are marks who are stupid enough to pay the admission price. We ARE the observers in the coliseum, lazy, corrupt, ignorant, decadent, stupidly accepting a absurd plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator - simply a terrible movie (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I'm very surprised at how highly everyone seems to regard the movie "Gladiator." What I don't understand is why. Personally, I think it's a terrible movie. I won't even bother detailing its numerous historical inaccuracies. To do so would require a book. For those of you more historically inclined, suffice it to say that the movie combines elements from the reins of Julius Caesar, Caligula, and Commodus. Indeed, the Emperor actually portrayed in this movie is more like Caligula than anyone else. Some of you may consider this to be a minor point but we are talking about a span of 200 years. If this were equated to modern times, you would get a scene where Abraham Lincoln takes Air Force one and flies back to Washington. 200 years is 200 years. But, as I promised, I won't get stuck on the historical inaccuracies.What makes this a terrible movie to me is the stupid plot. In the beginning of the movie, Commodus has no problem riding into the camp of a powerful general. Seeing as powerful generals often seized power in ancient Rome, this would seem to be an exceedingly stupid thing to do. Next he kills his father, Marcus Aurelius. No one seems to care or suspect. I guess they were more stupid in those days. Next, Maximus refuses to shake his hand, signalling no support for the new Emperor. Of course, because everyone in those days must have been stupid, Maximus does not feel his life is in danger and takes no immediate steps to protect himself. If you believe that people from the past were dumber than what they are now, you can accept these glaring mistakes but I can assure you that people back then were not this stupid.Now Maximus is seized from his tent to be executed. Where is his army? Here is the general who was adulated by his army but, suddenly, his army is nowhere to be found. Next, Maximus overcomes not one but 2 armed executioners. Of course, they had no idea that they had to be careful with the condemned man because they were more stupid in those days.Next comes the confusing part. Maximus has been wounded in Germany. Somehow, he makes it all the way to Spain in a couple of days. (It must've been a couple of days because he's still bleeding!) The only explanation I can offer for his having made it so fast from Germany to Spain on horse is that his horse must've been a Porsche. (He was in Germany after all.) Then, somehow, we find him in Africa. I won't even ask how he got there.Things get even better from here on in. First of all, the gladiator fights are so vicious and brutal that if this had been true historically, Rome would have run out of gladiators very quickly. Of course, our hero Maximus is in reality Superman, who somehow made his way to ancient Rome before coming to metropolis. It's not enough for Hollywood that Maximus never loses. Not only does he never lose, but he can defeat upwards to 10 men at a time as long as they are obliging enough to approach him one at a time. Maximus can also wrestle off Tigers. Like I said,- Superman.Then things get really ridiculous. The Emperor, who previously ordered Maximus' execution, suddenly decides that Maximus is too popular to kill now. He had no problems trying to execute him amidst his own army where Maximus was tremendously popular, but now he fears the mob of Rome. We keep hearing how the real power lies with the mob so I guess it's understandable that the Emperor fears those bakers, millers, and stonemasons more than Maximus' army. Alas, the poor Emperor Commodus. The most powerful man in the world simply is unable to kill this invincible gladiator Maximus. Like I said, Superman.Finally, the Emperor decides to take things into his own hands. He will kill Maximus himself in a gladiator fight. Never mind that Maximus can take on 10 professional gladiators at a time. The Emperor will take him on. Of course, he gives him a little stab wound to even things up. I like equating things to modern times. So, the president of the United States, unable to rid himself of a dangerous adversary who has somehow become heavyweight champion of the world, decides to challenge the champion in a boxing ring after having administered a drug. This is what this movie would be proposing if it were set in modern times.As I said, I cannot understand why people think this is a great movie. If you believe people were more stupid in the past, then maybe you can accept the pap that this movie is offering as a plot. I personally thought the plot was written for children. And even though I haven't dealt with the historical inaccuracies, believe me when I say they are constant throughout the movie and they are also ludicrous. However, many a movie has managed to achieve excellence, despite historical inaccuracies. Gladiator is not one of them.</fullReview>

Smart, exciting moviemaking all the way, with Scott delivering good direction to the scenes and the rest of the cast being good deliverers to the film (fans of old film stars Reed, Harris and Jacobi will find this a treat).

		<shortDescription>A decent B-grade Peplum turns into an overblown blockbuster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and if you think that "overblown blockbuster" is a pleonasm, wait until you see this movie. Even if it's not completely shabby, the amount of self-indulgent, ham fisted dialogue coupled with the sheer stupidity of the script makes one wonder...Ridley Scott used to be a visionary. Which doesn't really translate in his poor rendition of the ancient Rome. Colors, framework, costumes: the art direction is very weak. The script is so formulaic and falsely clever it's almost insulting. And the editing rarely shines. The action is either boring or gives serious headaches; only one scene really stands out: Maximus (painfully portrayed by a sleepwalking Russel Crowe) leads his enslaved friends to victory by resorting on their old warrior reflexes. Nothing really shines except that scene; the supporting cast is bland (Connie Nielsen) when not irritating (the usually great Joaquin Phoenix gives a really bad performance as the emperor Commodus).But the most hilariously bad moment is the climactic battle: Ridley Scott and the hack who wrote this should be ashamed. The whole movie tries to re-write history (I'm not even calling that revisionism) introducing modern, Christian philosophical and moral values in the story through Maximus' perception. If we trusted the movie, Rome was a beacon in a world of barbarians. This ends up giving the hero the upper hand in a duel against Commodus, avenging his family with the sacrifice of his life. This whole ending, not only ridiculous on screen, is truly aimed at the blood-thirsty audience who needs his fix of "eye-for-an-eye" climax to feel satisfied, like in a good ol' "Death Wish" Bronson flick. Not only this is an historical lie (too bad for a movie that tries so hard to feel "realistic"), but it really misses the mark emotionally as the real demise of the emperor showed true poetic justice, as opposed to the self-righteous, overwrought lines Crowe delivers.As for the "revisionism" complaint, I'm asking you: what if, 2000 years from now, a screenwriter comes up with a WWII epic comic book movie (not unlike a peplum of our times) where Captain America (Maximus) single-handedly defeats Hitler (Commodus)? Well, it *may* turn out good. If Ridley Scott isn't directing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GLADIATOR (2000) **** Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou. Extravagant full-fledged sword and sandal epic from filmmaking genius Ridley Scott takes on the scopic tale of a vengeance seeking Spanish general named Maximus (Crowe in a star-making turn) whose disposition from glorified soldier to slave to eponymous athlete in ancient Rome seeks to avenge the slaughter of his beloved family, his good name and ultimately self-redemption for the betrayal and murder of his mentor Marcus Auerelius (a haggard looking Harris) by his petulantly incestuous son Commoudus (hissably evil Phoenix) and dissuade his sister Lucilla (the divine Nielsen) from emotional imprisonment. Lavish set designs, bold visual effects (check out the Colosseum!), dark and stark cinematography by John Mathieson and Pietro Scalia's razor sharp editing particularly in the arena's carnage dripping bouts with effectively cringing moments of unbridled violence (including one bitchin' chariot fight) that honors its predecessors 'Ben-Hur' and 'Spartacus' well. Sadly Reed's swan song but he gives a noteworthy performance as former gladiator turned slave owner who teaches Mad Maximus the finer skills in kicking ass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From cast to cinematography to wardrobe to sets to effects to just about everything else, "Gladiator" has it all. But, try as it may, the film fails to connect on the human level. What could have been a powerful epic which clearly defined the undercurrents of good and evil responsible the climate of political unrest and upheaval in Rome instead takes a simplistic "good guy" versus "bad guy" approach, gets too involved in it's own grandeur, and substitutes action for story telling with the likely result of a disconnected audience which will not feel the empathy and emotion such a film should command. Nonetheless, it's worth a watch even at 2.5+ hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Braveheart: Redux." Give me the original any day...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally saw "Gladiator" (2000) in the year of its release, and after seeing the movie again last night, my position on the film has not changed. I did not like it three years ago, and I still do not like it. Back then I was not reviewing on a professional basis--in fact, I had just started submitting comment/recommendation reviews on the Internet Movie Database. I gave "Gladiator" a bad comment and moved on. Now I can criticize it a bit deeper."Gladiator" stars Russell Crowe as Maximus, a Roman soldier who conquers in practically any and every battle. Caesar (Richard Harris) likes Maximus, and so he decides to give the throne to him after he dies and not to his immoral and irresponsible son (Joaquin Phoenix, who played Merrill in "Signs," a much better movie).However, when Caesar's plans are revealed to his son, he murders his father and takes his place as Caesar, commanding Maximus to be taken out into the woods to be murdered. However, Maximus, being the great soldier that he is, escapes and flees back home to his wife and child--only to find them burned alive and hanging dead outside the house.Maximus eventually comes into custody and is thrown in a gladiatorial arena, where he becomes the main star, killing and conquering in every battle. Soon he is like a modern day baseball player--fans line up outside the Colosseum just to see him before the battles begin.Soon the new Caesar finds out who the great gladiator really is, and so turmoil begins. The new Caesar's sister (Connie Nielsen) once loved Maximus, so that is thrown in for good measure, too. While we're at it, let's throw in some futuristic battleships, robots and space aliens that Maximus can fight in the sequel, when he comes back from the dead. (And I'm not kidding about the following--a prequel is planned.)The movie is slow, and when it picks up speed it goes nowhere. It seems like a rip-off of "Braveheart" from beginning to end--a soldier's family is murdered and he takes revenge on the man/nation who killed them by fighting. Granted, he has no choice but to fight in "Gladiator," but still...The movie was directed by Ridley Scott, the Englishman who directed "Alien," "Blade Runner" and, among more recent films, "Matchstick Men." He's a talented director with an eye for atmosphere, but his films don't always work because sometimes his atmosphere gets the better of him--like in "Gladiator." The surroundings are dull, bleak and heartless. "Braveheart" had some ounce of beautiful settings, and Mel Gibson used long, wide lens shots of Scotland. Here we just get what we are presented with. And when the camera does pull back to give us the full picture, it's usually packed with very bad CGI effects of Colosseums and such.And Russell Crowe. How did he ever win (and I do mean it when I say "win") an Oscar for this mess? He delivers every line with the same monotone deadness in his voice as thirty minutes earlier in the film. He is and remains one of my least favorite actors, both on and off the screen. And if he wants to beat me up for saying mean things about him (as he usually does to people), he can just come over to my house and try. The greasy-haired baboon.The dialogue in the movie. Oh my! Things are said that you expect to read in a letter from a six-year-old to his/her parents. (I was just waiting to hear, "My family is dead. I am sad.")To be honest, there were a few good moments in "Gladiator." It has some impressive fight scenes, including one with two men fighting while tigers leap out of cages built underneath the sand of the arena floor and lunge for the battling duo. I must say that I came close to recommending the movie at certain times. But then it would slow down its pace again and turn into some sort of large-budget cornball. I understand that many people love this movie. Give me "Braveheart" any day.2.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It strikes me from the readers comments of the IMDB that as many people dislike GLADIATOR as like it. True it`s the sort of story we`ve seen before in several genres where good defeats evil but what`s wrong with that ? It`s well acted with Joaquin Phoenix playing the role of villain the right side of camp , well supported by a bunch of British thespians - Notice how many of the bad guys are played by Americans and good guys by Brits . Don`t see that too often - and Ridley Scott pulls out all the stops to make GLADIATOR a technical triumph , a shame he didn`t win the Oscar for best director , he`ll be hard pushed to make a film as good as this again. And accolades to John Mathieson and Hans Zimmer for photography and music respectively.GLADIATOR is one of three old fashioned Hollywood epics to have won the Oscar for best picture in recent years . After seeing the overrated BRAVEHEART and the truly awful TITANIC and comparing them with true epics like GONE WITH THE WIND , BEN HUR and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA I thought to myself " Alas they don`t make them like they used to ". Then GLADIATOR came along and proved me wrong.As a footnote the DVD release to this film is excellent. If anyone at Columbia pictures is reading this can we please a similar standard of release for Scott`s upcoming DVD of BLACKHAWK DOWN ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 1960s, Steve Reeves would have killed John Drew Barrymore after 80 minutes (the necessary time to tell such an inane story), and "The End" ("Fine" is more appropriate) would have appeared on the screen, as Reeves kissed Myl?ne Demongeot, Chelo Alonso or Scilla Gabel in the hereafter. The production would have cost 1/200 of the "Gladiator" budget, and you would have left the cinema feeling as silly and empty, but not as cheated, as after seeing this "white elephant". Unfortunately, this never-ending melodrama has been hailed as a masterpiece by the lovers of over-amplified sound effects, boringly fake visuals and gratuitous violence; and as in a Roman circus, it has been crowned with awards that make it look worst than it is. They all have shown more inspiration than the filmmakers in tracing a parallel between the Roman empire and the present one. What a shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't waste space listing the plot here, as this has been done a large number of times before me - on to the film, then!Russell Crowe finally gets the attention his acting deserves. He's not exactly the best actor out there, but he is a lot better than a lot of those who command much larger fees...In the part he is very good, brooding and emotionally crippled and thankfully he has few one-liners to deliver.The supporting cast vary from the perfectly cast, Oliver Reed his obvious continuation of heavy drinking actually accentuating his character - Connie Neilson, providing a believable emperors daughter, weary of but part of the general corruption, afraid for her only Son and unsure of her own future - and Tommy Flanagan, the celt slave looking for a cause (I thought that the tribal scars were a nice touch, however he was glassed in a pub fight).Derek Jacobi was not at good as I have come to expect from such as Cadfael but due I imagine more to the weak senatorial scripts that were given. Sorry, but Joachim Phoenix was plain annoying, this is a pity as he obviously can act - just a case of the wrong part for the wrong person. Richard Harris was given some good lines, but little time to grow his character and as an actor, Ralph Moeller is a great bodybuilder...The cinematography is pure Ridley Scott, the action scenes are generally well done but the two swords to head part was patently ridiculous, the Gladius was designed to be a thrusting weapon and was almost never used to slash with, it had neither the edge or the weight to be effective. Another annoyance was the impression that most soldiers in Rome not only forgot their Pilums in the morning, but brought bows instead......The use of the Bow among Roman leigons and the Pretorian guard was virtually non-existant, yet it is overused here. CGI Rome was laughable - not an effective recreation of how things might have looked, rather a set of images that screamed "Look at me - I was done on a computer!". Curious how "The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire" managed to convey a far more realistic interpretation several decades earlier.Unfortunately, whilst this film gives more than passing nods to a number of those that came before it, the patrician politics, themes of betrayal and sacrifice, and even the feel of Gladitorial arenas have been done far better before.In summation, the only two things worth watching this film for (if you have seen the ones that have been given the sincerest form of flattery) are the Fight scenes at the beginning and near the end and the wonderfully orchestrated score.I came, I saw - I did'nt think that much of it.</fullReview>

Such viewers would be perfect public at the Colisseum where the final struggle takes place. The movie is a rather poor remake of "Fall of the Roman Empire", a movie which was not memorable but which had some point to it, for it showed the way in which the Northern blonde people were shamelessly butchered which provoked the reaction which was to seal the fate of Rome. That movie had a more elaborate story and showed how a system can go wrong. There is a worrying trend in these epic remakes such as Gladiator, The Passion of the Christ and to a much lesser extent Troy (Troy is actually quite a good movie) for gratuitous violence and no real message, no real humanity or depth. It seems we have regressed to Roman times. It is almost like we have become blood thirsty and unchristian.</fullReview>

"Gladiator" was so boring and bad that it did not even elicit any unintentional laughs. But you may groan in agony waiting for it all to end. No surprises, no titillation (something we have a right to expect from the decadence of ancient Rome), no effective moral lessons, no revolutionary film making. Fans of extremely violent video games might get a thrill or two, but that's it.

Still, did we have to witness a grinning seven year old boy being trampled ruthlessly by horsemen? Did we have to hear the line "They tell me your son squealed like a girl as he was nailed to the cross, and that your wife moaned like a whore as she was ravaged over... and over... and over again?" Thank you, Ridley Scott.It's sad that people are so casually able to dismiss stomach-churning moments such as these in the film...for what? For a supposed hero's hollow 'vengeance' that may or may not ever come to fruition? For Russell Crowe's rugged (cough) good looks? Whatever the reason, it's bad enough that the average audience continues to have such a fascination with 'bloodlust', but that gratuitous violence towards children (even though fictionalized) now passes as part of the overall entertainment package...what does that say about us as a society?</fullReview>

I should have known better, after all this had happened with the narratives in Legend, 1492.., Black Rain and even in his superior works Alien and Blade Runner(and will happen again, like Peter Pan?). Hope however springs eternal, and with the casting of Derick Jacobi some comparisons with the sublime I, Claudius were inevitably and subconsciously drawn. How desperately in need of those comparisons was this dire cocktail of flashy, confusing gore and risible 'intrigue' performed by a collection of actors who, with a few exceptions, appeared to have recourse to one facial expression to express the gamut of emotions required of them by an infantile, ludicrous and totally implausible script which took 2 1/2 hours to deliver a plot which could have been written on the back of a postage stamp.Are we so easily satisfied with mediocrity that we can praise this ramshackle, gloomy hi-tech affair as being the first 'epic' of the year 2000? Surely not. Even the highpoints of the film; the opening battle scenes and the chariots vs gladiators coliseum fight come nowhere near to matching the virtuoso displays in Saving Private Ryan and Spartacus.For the rest, give me a script instead of computer-generated images which if I want to watch I can do so on one of my son's computer games.Now if Mr Jacobi had been a screenwriter ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>here is a roman classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie moves in the realm of depression and just stays there. Gladiator shows the things that pushed an innocent hero to the point that death seemed like a relief from all that the world has taken from him. Maximus the main protagonist of the movie was portrayed by Russell Crowe in such a talented yet distinctive fashion that you do nothing but bow to the way Maximus handled his trials and tests to come out victorious at the end.Filming took place between January and May of1999 and the locations used were Bourne Woods, near Farnham Surrey in England, Ouarzazate Morocco and Fort Ricasoli Malta.The movie plot is about a loyal Roman General Maximus (Russell Crowe), who is betrayed when the Emperor's son, Commodus, murders his father to become Emperor of Rome himself, and burns down and kills Maximus family. After everything is lost Maximus is reduced to slavery and he having one determination, revenge, rose through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena, all in the hope of getting back at the man who killed his family and Emperor. Based squarely on a pitch by David Franzoni, who worked with Spielberg in Amistad, Ridley Scott was approached to make a movie from Franzoni's original final draft but he had the whole script re-written by John Logan who was the person that added the death of Maximus family, to create a lonely soldier with nothing to lose, but Franzoni was brought back as problems start to erupt in the re-writes, Frazoni did all he could to get the script back to the original draft. More issues sprung up, when Russell Crowe almost caused a total re-write of the script, whenever he asked questions he demanded answers and if the answers were not favourable, the script had to be re-worked.The movie can be said to have drawn plot from two older movies, The Fall of the Roman Empire and Spartacus both of which were done in the 60s. A lot of the plot foundation, like the murder of the emperor by his son who wanted to marry his sister, who (Sister) was in love with a General can be said to be taken from the movie The Fall of the Roman Empire. The gladiator aspect of this movie can be said to have been gotten from the movie Spartacus.Gladiator was a critical and financial success and it won 5 Academy Awards in the 73rd Academy Awards, the awards were Best Picture, Best Actor (Russell Crowe), Best Visual Effects, Best Costume Design and Best sound.Gladiator is a classic movie that gives you the fun to see the Roman Empire as some believe it was, rough and full of politics, here is another shelf nominee.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if Gladiator weren't as weak and banal as it is on it's own right, the fact that it was supposedly done by the very same man who created Blade Runner and Alien would be enough to damn it in all eternity.What an unbelievable loss of filmic quality! What a shamefully predictable plot! What quaint dialogues! What - even that! - poor videogamey visuals! All right: there's patricide, there's revenge, there's lotsa blood. There's even almost incest. But all oh so underscored and looked at in such awe and abomination that it can only be there to cater for a bourgeois (or adolescent, for that matter) need of a thrill, quickly followed by the reestablishment of order. Nothing more. No discussion, no actual leap into the dark. Nothing really unsettling, for the gods will eventually see to it.Not worth one of Sigourney Weaver's gasps or of Harrison Ford's broken nails.Whatever's the matter with Ridley Scott?? Alien shaped all our nightmares afterwards and the future was never the same after Blade runner. And then, Gladiator... There's this very popular phenomenon of director's senility (just take a look at Coppola's Jack or Antonioni's Jenseits der Wolken for the sake of illustration). But then, R.S. isn't THAT old yet, is he...? Can't really fathom it.Due to a very strange paradox, I doubt Glads would ever attract as much attention as it did, were it not done by the great author of Alien and Blade Runner. Whoever would have enjoyed it anyway would enjoy it and forget it. More reasonable people wouldn't be seen dead in the theatre, not even gagged and handcuffed. For one thing, -I- would definitely not be wasting my time writing about it. But, again, justice must take its course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uglier than any pessimist could expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's forget "Gladiator" won the Oscar for the best film: even worse things may happen. As a matter of fact, the movie contains uncountable mistakes and flaws on Roman history and ancient life in general. Some examples follow.The gladiators were almost NEVER killed in the arena. That's clear: they were too important for the show business, and it costed too much money to train a gladiator to have him murdered. Their fights followed strict rules, nothing to do with the absurd slaughters shown in the movie.A Roman Citizen by no means could be made slave, as it happens to Maximus in the movie. If sentenced by the Emperor, he could be killed by anybody, but neither made slave nor tortured. That's the reason why Saint Paul was be-headed and not crucified. And the fact that Maximus uses his long sword (Romans had no long swords) with two hands in a Samurai-like style is just too ridiculous to deserve comments.The Roman army in battle followed a scientific strategy, with tight lines of troops protected by their shields, an established sequence of attacks and retreats, and so on. The battle at the beginning of the movie is an over-confused, poorly photographed brawl. The camp of the Roman Legion was a perfect square, with a strong palisade, and the tents of all ranks were neatly divided inside it. Nothing to do with the messy camping in the forest shown in the film."Gladiator" won an Oscar for the best costumes, too. Well, I think that Oakland Raiders fans wear nicer and more realistic costumes. In particular, the armours and weapons in the movie are unbelievably mistaken: most of them first appeared some 800 years later than the epoch of the story.But let's forget about Roman History, and say that "Gladiator" is either fantasy, or science-fiction, or something like that. Nonetheless, it remains a very ugly movie. The story is boring and utterly predictable. For instance, the whole episode of Maximus' attempted escape can be fore-seen almost second by second. Maximus returns home and finds his house wasted and his family destroyed... a strikingly original idea... perhaps already seen in dozens of western movies! By the way, Maximus goes from Germany to southern Spain (say 1500 miles?), pursued, with no food. How long did this pleasant journey last? Two months? And what about the gangrenous wound, later healed by a fellow gladiator? Come on! And the repeated wanna-be-touching oneiric scene with the hand and the wheat is clumsy and far-fetched.The action scenes are confused and badly filmed. The violence is so excessive to become ridiculous. The script is awful. The cinematography is generally very poor. Large use of close-ups like in a TV-movie, extremely brief choral scenes. Why? Perhaps in order that the viewer doesn't notice the computer tricks? The fight which closes the movie is by far less spectacular than all other arena scenes: I think this is an enormous mistake for an action flick. Something to save in "Gladiator"? The bucks it has made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Completely untrue as far as history is concerned:Marcus Aurelius died from the plague,and he did give his power to his son Commodeus (who did not strangle him,why would he?)On the other hand,Commodeus would have been strangled (in his bath?) but NOT by Maximus.The plot is linear,predictable and owes a lot to "Ben Hur".Forget the Christ and we have a similar pattern: a hero's downfall,his family is killed (thrown in jail in Ben Hur),he falls into a slaves(gladiators) trader's hands.He takes a spectacular revenge on his enemy (Commodeus,here,Messala in "Ben Hur")Outside Wyler's classic,"Gladiator" finds some inspiration in Kubrik's "Spartacus" and LeRoy's "Quo Vadis" too,and even in Delmer Daves'"Demetrius and the gladiators" (1954)All these sword and sandals,except Daves'one,are superior to Ridley Scott's work.Of course,the battle scenes are impressive,thanks to technology ,but it does not make up for the paucity of the dialogue and the simplicism of the screenplay.The "poetic" slow motion ending has been filmed so many times that one wonders why Scott could bother with such a rehash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since when are action movies supposed to be boring? Because boring defines about 90% of this movie, and even the action scenes weren't that great. Ridley Scott has only directed one good movie: Alien. Everything else he has done can eat it.It was a cool concept, but it could have been done much better; cut out half of the talking (the source of the boredom), use STEADY camera work during the action scenes, and don't rip off Hamlet in the end. Of course, then you would need a new scriptwriter, a new director. After all those changes, you would probably have a decent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oofah, where to begin? This movie is BAD. It's a BAD MOVIE. Yet, it won The Best Picture Oscar and has a legion of fans who call it things such as, "epic" and, "a masterpiece". I beg to differ. It's bad. On a good day it might pass for okay. But this is no classic.For one thing, it's dreadfully boring. Now, I'm not bored easily with films. And a long movie is certainly not a problem for me. In fact I LIKE longer films. As long as there is something interesting happening. That isn't the case here.For another thing, the directing is lousy. The opening battle sequence just outside of a forest is HORRIBLY shot, as it is completely incomprehensible. It took me out of the movie immediately. There wasn't anything to draw me back. The "action" scenes at the Coliseum are nothing special, about what you'd expect in terms of modern action scene pacing. The direction is awful here as well. The computer effects are cheesy and obvious.The story is nothing special or even memorable. Lousy pacing doesn't help this fact.The only thing that redeems this movie is the acting of its two leads. Russel Crowe is quite good and believable (though he DID NOT deserve his nomination for Best Actor, much less his win). But Joaquin Phoenix is excellent here and gives his character unexpected depth and feeling, while still remaining a despicable villain. Now THAT'S talent.Too bad it isn't enough to save the film. AVOID.</fullReview>

I think people have been deceived after years of Tarantino worship into thinking that choppy editing makes a movie more intense or edgy or somesuch nonsense. Unfortunately, the problems with this movie extend to Crowe's monotonous acting, the distracting, boring subplots (mostly driven by secretive glances), and the historical inaccuracies.Sorry, but America (and the academy, I'm afraid) was duped by this piece of expensive trash.</fullReview>

The special effects are lame (chariots have engines in them that explode?). If not for Alien I would think less of Ridley Scott, but maybe he needed a couple bucks or something. This is modern film-making at its worst, and one of the early signs of the current mess that is Hollywood. The double disc collectors set now serves as coasters in my room.

I thought the 90s had finally brought movies with such appalling heroic pathos to an end. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Not only does Ridley Scott make usually excellent actors bring forth lines that let "The Phantom Menace" ring like Shakespeare in my ears. He also shows no scruples whatsoever twisting history around entirely and making the Roman Empire look like a benevolent pacifier. All in all, if it weren't for a few corrupt Senators and a megalomaniac young emperor, Rome seems to have had no flaws for Scott whatsoever. Ah, a little genocide here, some imperialism there...the others were all "barbarians" anyway. The only thing that really surprised me was that Russell Crowe was not draped by a flag at the end...oh, wait, that movie was about Rome, not about America, wasn't it? My mistake!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand what all the fuss is about this movie. I mean, was I the only one who noticed how crappy the screenplay was? All right, there were some good special effects, but that's about it.I cannot believe that Gladiator even got a best picture nomination, let alone the oscar. That has to be the biggest travesty ever in oscar history (even bigger than Shakespeare in Love beating out Saving Private Ryan in 1998). I know that Dreamworks had to have at least one best picture nomination, but why didn't they push Almost Famous? It was such a better movie than Gladiator. I think Almost Famous was actually one of the top five movies of the year, and it would have made much more sense if Dreamworks has pushed that movie instead of Gladiator.I guess I'll compromise and say that I don't disagree with Ridley Scott getting a Best Director nomination (only because he got a DGA nomination), and I thought Russell Crowe was pretty good as the Gladiator, so I won't protest his nomination, either. But other than that, Gladiator did not deserve any other major nomination. The most appalling one is best original screenplay. What was the Academy thinking? And what was up with Joaquin Phoenix's nomination? There were so many more deserving supporting roles this year, like Michael Douglas in Traffic and Mark Ruffalo in You Can Count On Me.All I can say is that I've lost all confidence in the Oscars. It's not about the quality of the film anymore, what counts nowadays is the campaign. It's such a shame...........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An astonishingly overrated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie. It got good reviews, it was set in Rome, it seemed like it had everything going for it.But, unfortunately, such was not to be the case.This movie was, quite simply, bad.The plot is pathetic. It's basically a nonsensical mish-mash of supposedly momentous events, padding up the time between Russell Crowe brutally slaughtering his opponents in various inventive and completely unbelievable ways (yes, really, those Roman swords did chop through bone like it was tissue paper, I'll believe that.)The action is, for the most part, just a celebration of the power of the filmmaker to create violence even more brutal (and at the same time, more antiseptic - lots of blood, lots of cutting, no guts) than reality. The true core of the movie isn't character, plot, or even Russell Crowe showing off a few muscles. It's amputated limbs, heads, torsos. The rest of the film is just a pathetic shell around numerous scenes whose only purpose is a celebration of hollywood's antiseptic version of the macabre. Blood, dirt, death. But no guts.The special effects are poor. A few shots of Rome are attempted, but they look like nothing more than CGI drawings with some legions pasted on top. Even the best attempt, an aerial flyover attempting to portray the daily life of a bustling city, is just a quick glance from a strangled camera angle, and gives the impression more of a robotic ant farm than a great, bustling city of the ancient world.Perhaps, one might think, the fight scenes fare better. After all, they are the only reason for the movie's existence. But they don't. Despite being patently unbelievable and absurd, they also manage to be rather poorly shot and boring. There's never any real vitality to them. Somehow, Ridley Scott has managed to turn human brutality into something that looks like nothing more than a special effect, and a poor one at that. The video jerks in a strange, stop-motion filming effect that makes each fight look like it was done in claymation, while the arena, the stadium, the crowd all look somehow smaller than life, phony, unreal.Don't bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My nephew, Matt (10 yrs old), summed up the picture very well when he said as we were leaving - "That Roman Emperor was REALLY whiney". There is a problem inherent to all gladiator movies - people come to see them for the fight sequences and not the plot. Not even Stanley Kubrick could surmount that problem (which, in reality, is a studio problem i.e. the grafting of studio morality, storytelling and themes onto a foreign stock). Thus we have a VERY long movie, full of fight sequences, and when there is no fighting there are certainly people trying to tell us about IMPORTANT themes that appear nowhere else in the story. Then there is that studio morality thing. Rome is not America. Neither is the conflict between Imperialists and Republicans one of freedom (both sides wanted slavery). And, in the end, what is the story about. Nothing but a pathetic and rather far-fetched Hollywood revenge fantasy.I am a fan of director Ridley Scott. He does some wonderful things with candlelit scenes. The action scenes are fun (although the slo-mo/strobing gets tedious over the length of this piece). Also a delight (not to mention an in-joke) having Derek Jacobi. In toto, however, the film is a big disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this movie meant to be a joke ? A parody of what it could have been ? A motion picture that presumes to be (visually) "a Roman Saving Private Ryan" but carefully avoids showing the horrors that were plain in Saving Private Ryan. Somewhere I get the idea that either producer or director must have thought : "Yes great, let him charge into his opponent and hack his head of with one single mighty sweep. But, as we want as many spectators as we can get, let's put a tree between the audience and the guy who gets his head chopped off." So there you are, half the movie embedded in a semblance of violence that pretends to be shocking but isn't in the least. Which is acceptable if you're broadminded enough, after all there's the other half of the movie. Unfortunately the actors (with the exception of the revered Derek Jacobi) must have felt similarly about the "action" scenes, because they try with all their might to "act" their way through the rest of the movie. There's nothing as irritating as an actor being very aware of the fact that he's acting and showing it ! See how good I am ? But even then : the story might be good. Which it isn't. The story of "Gladiator" is a flimsy excuse for a second rate B-movie plot . With excuses to anyone who ever wrote a B-movie plot. Did anyone actually get paid for writing this ? Historically staggeringly incorrect hardly begins to describe it ! Full of dead ends (let's not reveal the "plot") and dead dialogue. May I suggest something ? Don't spend money to see it. If you really have to, wait until some channel puts it on tv and tape it (you don't want to watch it at 4 in the morning anyway, because that will probably be the time they broadcast it...)</fullReview>

Later in the movie happened the climax of the disappointment, the blast of (good old American) morality, when Crowe should have killed the other gladiator but was way too good-hearted. After killing thousands of barbarians and dozens of other gladiators he felt merciful. The rest of the movie was about as boring as "Titanic".

		<fullReview>I thought that overall the movie wasn't very good. I did think Russell Crowe was pretty good, but the rest of the cast was unimpressive. I disagree with some readers that the movie was action filled. The action was short and was frequently dispersed with lengthy talking/dramatic scenes that tried to add to the intrigue and tension but failed. It seemed to me that the movie originally had some scenes that would have helped the flow and were cut out or something. Also, some of the characters were so inconsistent for example, Quintus, (Maximus' second in command [I think]) was his friend in one scene, betraying him in the next, and helped him in the end...what was that? Also, on the battle at the start...they really messed it up. I don't want to sound like a dork but ROMANS DIDN'T USE FIRE ARROWS or any arrows at all for that matter. The Roman army was composed almost entirely infantry. They only used bows when they had cheap auxiliary troops from a territory or something. Remember the spears the infantry had? The thin metal ones? THAT is what they would have used, you see, they THREW those if they had used those spears in hand to hand, they would've gotten wasted hardcore. A weird thing about that is, the cavalry had swords only, now tell me the sense of fighting from horseback with a Roman short sword. They would've used lances. A final argument to that scene is, they wouldn't have brought and set up those siege weapons for an infantry fight. They simply took too long to set up and fired too slowly to be useful. One the other hand, it was kind of cool to see and I thought the production values, as far as the armor and mass amounts of troops were cool. They were entertaining, but they weren't very well researched. Another thing that bothered me was I felt the camera actions throughout the movie kinda spoiled it. The camera was jerky and the speed of it was constantly altered ad nauseum They should've taken some hints from other epic war movies and movies with that sort of action.My final thought is, the movie could've been a lot better, but it's worth watching once. Also, there is NO WAY it equals Braveheart in ANY respect.</fullReview>

I saw this movie on PPV, and I found myself walking in and out of my own living room. This is incredibly boring and dull. The story is unoriginal and uninteresting. Perhaps the action sequences will be saving grace. Perhaps not. The action sequences were choppy and very hard to follow and The opening battle scene is so poorly directed that I did not know what was going on at all. Terrible.The acting was wooden. Russel Crowe was not Oscar winning here at all. Phoenix also was not good here as the evil son. I did not see anyone enjoying their roles here at all. How this won so many Oscars will forever be a mystery to me. Best Picture?! My ass. I wanted the "Gladiator" to die quickly to end my misery. What a waste of my time.The Last Word: Boooooring.

		<shortDescription>Great Cast but way too graphic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With an excellent cast led by Russell Crowe and amazing special effects that really transport you in time to ancient Rome, it is not widely known that this film is really a remake of the 1960's film, "The Fall of the Roman Empire" starring Steven Boyd in Crowe's part, Christopher Plummer in Juaqin Phoenix's role as Commodus , Sophia Loren in Connie Neilson's part as Lucilla and Alec Guinness in Richard Harris's role as Marcus Aurelius.Were it not for the extremely excessive violence, this might have been a great film. But the violence in the arena is so unnecessary graphic it should have had a higher rating. It strives to titillate and shock the viewer in the same sadistic way that the actual games in Rome were meant to do. Granted (and thankfully) there of course is no actual loss of life. But it is way too shocking and not for children at all. Our culture has become too used to excessive and too realistic violence.Were most people to ever see the real thing in either battle or growing up in a rough neighborhood as I did; I doubt they would take it so lightly or be able or willing to view such abuses.One of the few films I've seen in recent years where violence is used to the film's credit was "Saving Private Ryan", where the viewer can experience the sheer insanity of war and the amazing courage of those who fight. A great anti-war film. But all Gladiator accomplishes is to further desensitize the viewer through the film's version of "shock and awe".</fullReview>

Watch them alongside Kurosawa's Seven Samurai and it soon becomes apparent that if you deposited two cameras in a cage full of monkeys, they would make a better artistic job of filmaking than Ridley Scott. The actors are uniformly awful, the CGI effects are overused and unconvincing, the script is turgid and the political message of the whole thing is deeply confused. While the historical inaccuracy of the notion that the Romans had a deep affective investment in domestic ideology is amusing for two minutes, the sheer hackneyed conventionality of it soon becomes direly boring. Most offensive of all, however, is its political charlatanism. Gladiator pretends to be advocating radical republican democracy (think Rousseau), but in fact uses classical republicanism as a screen to peddle the same modern right wing liberal message as every other forgettable American B-movie.The only way the acclaim it has received can be explained is by recourse to the near illiteracy and general ignorance of its "fans".Basically, if you know anything about art, you will hate this film. If you understand 'cool' you will detest it. If you are an uneducated male, who is slightly insecure about his masculinity, or a brainless Crowe worshipper stuck in a teenage lifestyle with nothing better to spend your time on than dusting your collection of his posters, you will probably adore it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Booorring! I had high hopes for this film and I was very disappointed with it. I have been to a lot of movies and I have never, never fallen asleep in a movie theatre before. Not only me but also my friend fell asleep. Ain't that some Sh**, I'm not lying. The fact that it's winning awards and is a possible Oscar candidate makes me ill. Traffic should be the winner in my opinion. I would have left the movie theatre if I knew my friends were being "tortured" too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title of this movie should be "Braveheart Does Rome, And not nearly as Well." If it weren't for Joaquin Phoenix, I'd have never made it to the end of the move.From the beginning of the movie where the beautiful wife and home are faded in, then, to where the wife dies, and until the end, with the fade-in of the beautiful home and wife, it's a copycat of Braveheart. Why so many people raved about this movie, and how Russell Crowe won a best actor Oscar for it (while snubbing Mel for Bravehart) is beyond me.If you've seen Braveheart, you've seen this; and Russell Crowe is no Mel Gibson.One star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that opens the floodgates to what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Gladiator' received numerous awards and has attracted over 2000 largely favourable user comments on IMDb. Although my comments will not be well received by those who regard it as a great film, I believe this is an APPALLING film which should never have been released. A film can be appalling because of bad direction, bad acting, or just plain bad photography - none of these are the problem here. A film can also be appalling because it plagiarises an earlier film too closely without giving any recognition to it, because it is intellectually dishonest, because its contents are antisocial, or because its nature is such that it is highly prejudicial to the film industry as a whole - the last three of these concerns all seem to me to arise with Gladiator. Some IMDb users have expressed concerns about plagiarism - noting its very close structural similarities to 'Braveheart' (1995) and 'Tarkan' (1969), but these are not my concern. When the scenario of a new film is totally different to its predecessor it is hard to justify condemning it for plagiarism.'Gladiator' features exactly the same scenario as the 1964 film 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' which is quite an elegant work that probably deserved to be more successful than it was. But it had one fatal flaw. It was promoted as an historically accurate account of the relatively short historical period when the Roman Empire appears to have undergone a fundamental transformation from an aggressive expansionist would be world empire to a survivalist mode where its main concern became the protection of its existing boundaries. This period, well documented by Gibbon and others, occurred after the death by disease of the stoic Emperor Marcus Aurelius whilst on campaign in A.D. 180. His son Commodus, who had already been co-emperor for three years, assumed full authority at the early age of nineteen with the support of Marcus's trusted advisers, but gradually after four years rule he became increasingly cruel and capricious, showing many signs of insanity, and finally acting in such a way that he was murdered in a palace conspiracy. His successor tried to repair the damage done to the fabric of Roman society but ultimately proved too weak and was murdered in turn, leading to a long period of increasing instability. The highly respected Will Durant was listed as historical consultant for the making of this 1964 film, but his advice was clearly neglected as the film incorrectly showed Marcus rejecting his son as heir to the throne, and his son responding by murdering his father and seizing the throne. Later it showed Commodus killed in the Arena whereas he was in fact drugged and strangled in his palace. Incredibly, this totally fictitious story from the earlier film was repeated in Gladiator. To me this makes the film unacceptable for intellectual dishonesty. We are told it is just a film prepared for entertainment. Fine - BUT ONLY IF IT DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A HISTORICAL FILM. 'The Sign of the Cross', 'Ben Hur', 'Quo Vadis' and 'Caesar and Cleopatra' were promoted as films of literary works not as historical works, and I have no problem with this. But a film has an enormous audience compared with a historical treatise and, if it is thought to be presenting real history, its inaccuracies can be very misleading. Most people who lived through the holocaust have now died and already a concerted campaign, making extensive use of the media to deny that it ever happened, is under way. If public perception of its reality is ever reduced to the status of a largely mythical event, it will severely handicap the chance of humanity learning essential lessons from history. YES, HISTORICAL ACCURACY IS OF IMPORTANCE, certainly in everything except a declared work of fiction.'Gladiator' is also appalling because much of its appeal comes from the graphic killing of one human being by another in the name of sport. The Roman Games started as athletic contests with readings of literature and dramatic presentations, followed quite early by events involving the public punishment and execution of criminals. The latter evolved into gladiatorial contests where criminals who would be useful in the all important Roman armies could redeem themselves; and much later into the staging of public atrocities which sometimes even featured women and children being killed by wild beasts or burned alive. It has taken humanity many hundreds of years to totally reject such 'entertainment' and pogroms of various types still occur in many parts of the world with alarming frequency. The first step towards establishing higher standards is the banning of public executions, but 'Gladiator' makes extensive use of computer generated images which give all the vicarious thrills of watching whilst one person kills another. It also takes a giant step along the slippery slope of virtual reality which could eventually permit viewers to 'experience' actual participation in such events. IS THIS WHAT WE REALLY WANT FROM THE CINEMA? The 1934 Hayes code which crippled the North American film industry for many years resulted from an overwhelming public demand to restrict films that overstepped the bounds of public acceptability. A third reason why 'Gladiator' is an appalling film is that it has pushed the limits of acceptability to the point where there will be demands for some new form of censorship. Today there is more and more emphasis being put on self regulation whether in government or in corporate life. If the film industry cannot face up to its need for some self regulation IT MAY LOSE ITS ARTISTIC FREEDOM AND BE RETURNED TO THE DARK AGES OF EXTERNALLY IMPOSED PRODUCTION 'CODES'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All hail Maximus Acronyms - Romans Unite Before Bullying Insurgent Spanish Heman! (possible spoiler in final paragraph)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lovely film in here about a spoilt brat teenager who unfortunately has tyrannical rule over the Roman Empire. So whereas most sulky boys kick tables and storm off to their room, Commodus Caesar gets to throw those who annoy and humiliate him to digitally enhanced cats. Joaquin Phoenix gives a magnificent performance, camp in the best swords and sandals tradition, throwing childish fits when he doesn't get his way, sporting marvellously gothic eyeliner (Romans vs Goths, you see), scheming elaborate punishments for his big sister, which, for him, unlike the rest of us, who get our hair pulled, can actually, horribly, be realised.It's also nice to see that the hackneyed tide of postmodernism has been stemmed Canute-like, and a complex period in Roman history, with its plagues, revolts, tyrannies and back-room intrigues and murders can be 'crystallised' in a young boy's feeling unloved by his father. Haven't we all felt this melancholy burden at one time or another, the failure to do what is right, honourable and Stoic, when ambition and privilege seem much more immediately rewarding?Add to this the accursed, tragic flaws of incest and worse (the difference between mad tyrant and noble hero must always be expressed in terms of neurotic sexuality and fertility-turned-ascetic renunciation), and you have a truly harassed, 'modern' hero, well supported by a ripe mixture of theatrical greats (Derek Jacobi) and former 60s icons (Oliver Reed, David Hemmings - is this Scott's THE LIMEY?). He gets to watch some champion gladiating too.Of course, a film of this stature, size and scope must inevitably have its longueurs, here an elaborate sub-plot involving Russell Crowe, an inexorable melange of MAD MAX/BRAVEHEART (noble hero turned insane revenger after wife and family slaughtered; the bleak landscapes witnessing vastly scaled pub brawls; the lengthy, dimly lit, self-agonising indoor scenes, as a 'man' debates within himself his 'man'liness and duty; the loaded dichotomy between caricatured, vicious Imperials and unswervingly decent warrior; buddy-buddy development; Godardian, alienating, swelling score) and SPARTACUS (the violent gladiator scenes; the chinned sincerity; the captive peasant taking on the might of the Roman Empire; the structural homophobia).Crowe is a revelation - and reveals a hitherto unmined talent for comedy and parody. Of course, this works because, like Leslie Nielsen, he marshalls a tautly disciplined straight face, but his clenched surliness, his Heston-like intergrity, his attempt to absorb the Stoic precepts of Marcus Aurelius (his scenes with Richard Harris are worthy of that masterpiece oof classical epics, CARRY ON CLEO), his reciting dialogue Abrahams-Zucker-Abrahams would have been proud to have written, are so funny (the scene where he rises off the ground of the auditorium to 'meet' his family is pure comic genius), so expertly pomposity-bursting, so winding up the pretensions of an entire genre, I emerged from the film with great respect for this stunningly versatile, deceptive actor.He couldn't have done it, though, without the help of Ridley Scott, essaying another mass culture in decline, who has bravely exorcised the complexities, ambiguities and enigmas of BLADE RUNNER to create an admirably simplistic epic, to abandon the weight of historical validity in favour of Boys' Own fantasy. It would have been easy with this budget to create a teeming, living, authentic Rome, but Scott the postmodernist recognises the impossibility of this project, and, in an act of avant-garde innovation, hangs his drama on a handful of geometric signifiers, with little relation to any reality beyond the drawing board.There has been an extraordinary , and for me higly promising, strain in modern Hollywood filmmaking (eg TITANIC, THE PHANTOM MENACE), in which the new digital technology is not used to create novel, vast, convincing, strange worlds, but to elucidate the principles of Brechtian epic theatre, to foreground artificiality, implausibility, soullessness, encouraging the audience out of the narrative, to stand back and reflect on issues such as the construction of history, mass spectacle etc. The dreams of the New Wave may finally have come to fruition.Like most films of this type, GLADIATOR is about a hero who is too good for his society, who cannot live in it. But is he? The absence of historical verity in the story set me thinking to about what Scott was trying to say. Because the film is a story about a man who lets his family die, who isn't there for them. This is a curious hero to celebrate, though appropriate in an age where fathers often abandon their families, even to the extent of not paying alimony. After Maximus (Scott must have been a Monty Python fan) sees the charred crucified bodies, the film goes momentarily into dream mode. But does it ever come out of it? This is a story that is full of doubles, strange correspondances, mirror scenes; it thoroughly interrogates the nature of family, and finally reaches a ritual climax in which both sides of the same coin (sons) wipe each other out, like Gothic doppelgangers. Is the whole film Maximus's guilty dream, about guilt, emasculation, eternal torture over failure, the descent into bestiality? Is it a theme of America's guilt over slavery and subsequent race traumas, or a renunciation of them (both whites and blacks are slaves here). Whatever. This is the first great comedy of the millennium.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is bad. Not extremely bad, but bad nonetheless. It was extremely long and boring, seeing as the plot was paper-thin. The characters were dull. I couldn't care less, if Russell Crowe won in the end. I didn't feel sorry for his character at any point in the movie. In fact, by the second hour, I found myself wishing for his immediate death so they'd end the movie. I blame most of the movie's problems on director Ridley Scott. He's a hideous director, and I don't know why everyone keeps confusing him with a good director. During half of the fight scenes and during the battle scene at the beginning, it took the entire scene just to figure out what was happening. You could never tell what was going on. Thus, this movie isn't even good for a few cheap thrills. It isn't good: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie in years...FOR ME TO POOP ON</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface this by saying I'm a fan of most of Ridley Scott's work. Bladerunner is a terrific flick and Alien ain't too shabby, either. Then I saw the trailers for Gladiator and some early reviews(almost exclusively raves) and got excited for a good, well-made film. What I got was the most boring movie I've seen in a theater in quite some time. Initially, I gave the film the benefit of the doubt...a lot of people liked this so it must get interesting sooner or later. About 45 minutes into the film, however, I realized it wasn't going to get any better. I first looked at my watch at that point and proceeded to do so at least every ten minutes thereafter. I hoped the reel would catch fire and save me from watching the last hour but, alas, I had to watch until the end. I probably would've left but I attended the film with my father and we hadn't been to a movie together since T2...what're ya gonna do?.Gladiator was lifeless and unoriginal. The plot was shabby and often laughable, and I honestly believe the folks at MST3K could've had a pretty good time with it. Much of the dialogue was cheesy, the camera work was largely uninspired and every time a computer generated 'roman' backdrop was on screen the characters amidst them were fuzzy and shadowy. At other times Scott included footage to purposely sicken the audience, i.e. the "snot" scene. Did anyone else find that as nasty as I?Another problem with this film as that, despite its epic running time, the plot progression is hasty and incomplete. Maximus goes from general to slave in about 3 scenes(why is he a slave again?) and kills around 7 people as a gladiator before becoming the most popular man in Rome. There's plenty of room for good development within two and a half hours. Instead, Scott pushes Gladiator's sub-par progression only within the brief action scenes(the only interesting scenes in the entire movie...honestly) and offsets them with minutes upon minutes(hours?) of crap that doesn't go anywhere. The raves this movie has received confuse me. Gladiator is the most overrated movie in years.If you're looking for a good movie along the same lines, watch Conan the Barbarian. Gladiator uses roughly the same story line, but Conan is about 3000 times more entertaining. And don't get popcorn before you enter the theater. Believe me, you'll welcome any excuse to get up and stretch your legs before the movie actually concludes.</fullReview>

There a couple of sequences that are well done, but for the most part I expected a great deal more from director Ridley Scott. The opening battle might have been effective if he had used more wide angle shots and distant angles. It would have also helped cover up the fact of how shoddy the special effects were. The CGI used to recreate ancient Rome wasn't that convincing either. The acting is decent, but with poorly and cliche ridden characters like this, it's amazing they got the top drawer talent that they did. The film's biggest downfalls are a poorly written and cardboard script and an ending that is unsatisfying and boring.Like I mentioned before, I just can't understand the praise that this film has gotten.Rating:4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though 'Gladiator' won so many awards and received so many good comments I still believe that the movie was extremely boring!!Ok, let's take things from the beginning. The movie starts out with an energetic battle full of great effects of vivid action that fascinates everyone. But that's the end of the movie for me. The fascination is over. There's nothing more to watch, as in the rest of the film we just have to withstand the blabbering and chaffering of Maximus, Marcus Aurelius, Comudus, Lucilla and the others. All their discussions are so unnecessary and make the film so boring that it's better to just go out of the cinema and return only when the other powerful scene begins- Maximus as a gladiator. 'Gladiator' was created just to impress critics who love history. To the rest of the audience it's just there to offer nothing more than cool visual effects and boredom. I watched the movie twice just to make sure that it was complete rubbish and both times I tried hard not to fall asleep and both times I did not manage! Crowe's performance was not as good as in 'A Beautiful Mind' and did not deserve the oscar. Joaquin Phoenix was alright, but nothing fantastic. Gladiator had a boring plot with a story that was seen in the past so many times and it's time to move away from the revenge and comeback stuff.I would not suggest this movie to anyone and I was taken aback when I saw so many people adoring it. I wondered why there's so much bad taste in people.Gladiator 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boring, boring, boring!!! When this film won Oscar's best picture award, I finally realised that mindless Hollywood entertaiment is all that people want; which made me really sad. This film is no Oscar material at all - it's just another one of those no-brain Hollywood blockbuster action movies. Russell Crowe did nothing more than using his grunts to win his way to the Oscar statuette. Gosh, I even remember being bored to the death by this shallow galore. The colloseum sequences are dry, and Joaquin Phoenix was not threatening enough as a villain. The characters are as flat as cardboxes and as interesting to watch as looking at the thermometer going up. When Commodus said to Maximus (gee, Maximus; what an original name) that he ravished his wife repeatedly, it was a point that the audiences should feel anger. But, instead of me feeling angry towards the bad guy, I let loose with a big, gaping yawn.The victory of Gladiator at the Oscars only shows the current, sorry state of American filmmaking. Pathetic movies disguised with coating candy, like American Pie, Road Trip, and that Tom Green movie. Ridley Scott should stick to making his Alien flicks. So if you want a boring pile of action trash that happens to win Oscars, which it can have Van Damme as it's main lead and it wouldn't matter anyway, go and see Gladiator.(PS: a better alternative would be "Spartacus" which is a way, way better film - trust me on this)</fullReview>

Russell Crowe's performance was fine, satisfactory--as usual, but certainly not particularly inspired or stalwart. He is one of Hollywood's most overrated actors.

		<shortDescription>An overrated mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from Russell Crowe's strong performance, GLADIATOR is a chaotic mess. The editing is jumbled and confused, especially in the Arena scenes. To say this confusion is "realistic" is absurd, since when facing an opponent in the Arena, the most important thing is to remain clearheaded and outmaneuver him if you are to win. The celebrated battle in the forest in the beginning is just a silly attempt to ape the D-Day segment in the similarly overrated SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. As for the supporting performances, the best that can be said is that Richard Harris is dour and Oliver Reed is enjoyably hammy. Joaquin Phoenix is never convincing for a moment as the emperor. His performance would be more at home in a modern high school pageant. The photography resembles a European perfume commercial more than an evocation of ancient times. I wasn't aware the only color available in Rome was gold. For a truly excellent version of the same story, check out Anthony Mann's superb 1964 FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. While both films are based on the same historical characters, GLADIATOR shamelessly "borrows" many plot points from the earlier film, to less effect. Russell Crowe's supporting cast cannot hope to compete with such classic actors as Alec Guiness, Christopher Plummer, James Mason and Sophia Loren in FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. It would also be pointless to compare the directorial style of Anthony Mann, who is without a doubt one of the great American filmmakers of the 50s and 60s, with that of Ridley Scott, who directs like he's making a commercial for GLADIATOR perfume or a music video for a band dressed as ancient Romans. Just compare the finale man to man combat in the Arena in Scott's film with the same scene in Mann's. No comparison.</fullReview>

Boredom from prolonged dialogues and Joaquin Phoenix's acting.Last week I read Paul Newman quit acting after all these years. The reason he explained "I am sick of all these sex and violence in today's movies"I couldn't agree more, why on earth do we HAVE TO watch more and more queer, incest and other sick scenes in today's movies? I exclude films like Flawless or As Good As It Gets from these as they are meant to be made from different perspectives of the life. The story is OPEN. If you hate drag queens don't watch Flawless, simple as that. There's no cheating here. But putting disturbing scenes into an ACTION movie like Gladiator is something else...I think film industry should be based on one major fact: entertainment. It doesn't have to resemble to REAL LIFE. Everything can happen in real life and we do not want to remember every DETAIL of it.Let's face it do we enjoy watching a pervert Emperor who's trying to screw his sister? or a dialogue like "What do you want Maximus, a girl? a boy?"

He is thought by King Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) as the son he should have had. Commodus (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Joaquin Phoenix) is the evil man who kills his own father to become king himself. Unfortunately Maximus was taken by a tradesman and he is given to Proximo (BAFTA nominated Oliver Reed) and trained to become a gladiator. He fights against men and animals in front of some audiences. It's when Commodus witnesses one of the shows that he is reminded that he should kill him. Oliver Reed was the most watchable of the actors, besides Crowe, its a shame he died while filming. Also starring Connie Nielsen as Lucilla, Derek Jacobi as Gracchus, Djimon Hounsou as Juba, David Schofield as Falco, David Hemmings as Cassius and Omid Djalili as Slave Trader. An excellent film from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Alien and Blade Runner director Sir Ridley Scott.
