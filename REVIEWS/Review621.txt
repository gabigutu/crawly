		<shortDescription>A Well-Mounted Mystery With Fine Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1947 mystery-thriller,"The Two Mrs.Carrolls"is considered by many critics to be a tepid,unrealistic film and one of Humphrey Bogart's lesser works. This couldn't be more false. The film contains brilliant performances by Bogart and Barbara Stanwyck,a great deal of eerie suspense,and delicious bits of English humor. The plot of the film is similar to that of Alfred Hitchcock's "Dial M for Murder" and "Suspicion",but has a uniqueness all it's own. It tells the story of Geoffrey Carroll(Bogart),a struggling artist who marries a wealthy woman,Sally(Stanwyck), after his supposed invalid wife dies. Life is normal for them,until Sally begins to feel ill and restless quite often.A doctor says she's suffering from nothing more than a nerve condition,and she believes that's all it is. She is, unfortunately, in for a big surprise.She learns from Geoffrey's precocious,young daughter,Bea(Ann Carter),some things about his previous wife.For starters,she was not an invalid and only got sick the last few weeks of her life.Geoffrey gave her milk at night to make her feel relaxed.This is exactly what he does for Sally.She also learns that a painting of his former wife,called "The Angel of Death",was done while she was sick. Hearing this,Sally comes to the realization that she is Geoffrey's next victim of a well-planned crime.Stanwyck has never been better as a panic-stricken wife,trying to survive her husband's evil doings.Bogart gives a highly underrated performance as a psychopath,who gets brutal when his murder plot doesn't go according to plan.His presence on screen is often frightening.The ending is wonderfully witty and comical.While not in the same league as "The Maltese Falcon"or "Key Largo",this is still a highly entertaining Bogart film,that will not disappoint. I give it a strong 8 1/2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film noir drama gets a boost from Bogart and Stanwyck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This noir thriller has two of the biggest names in Hollywood in the 1940s and they are paired here in an interesting, if not too exciting, film. Humphrey Bogart, for all of the heroic roles during this stage of his career, is cast against type, and Barbara Stanwyck, always the femme fatale, is now a damsel in distress as matters spiral beyond her control as grave danger closes in on her. The role-reversals of the stars works well and the byplay between them is good. They are supported by Alexis Smith, quite stunning as the other woman who comes along to complicate matters for artist Bogart, who is, of course, hopelessly smitten with her. The remaining cast is good, as is Franz Waxman's somber music accompaniment. The camera work is also first-rate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Bogy Overall with two of the best leading ladies of the '40s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film Noir at its best and Bogy better than his best that I've ever seen. Certainly this vehicle gives him play to develop his moods and attitudes which served him so well when it came time for him to work as Captain Queeg in "The Caine Mutiny" (1954). A much more than cameo appearance by Basil Rathbone's Dr. Watson, meaning Nigel Bruce, adds to the country-bumpkin rural nature of the plot. Alexis Smith is elegant while Barbara Stanwyck exudes just the right combination of believability to carry off a difficult role brilliantly. One will readily recognize actress Isobel Elsom from her later, excellent roles in "My Fair Lady" and "Love Is A Many Splendored Thing". This is a Bogart masterpiece which, until after you've seen it, will leave you with a deficient attitude towards Bogart's greatness as one of the most versatile actors Hollywood ever produced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never a dull moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a highly suspenseful, almost Hitchcockian tale, with excellent performances from the stars. Barbara Stanwyck was always excellent in this kind of role; she's better here than in "Sorry, Wrong Number". And Bogart seems truly menacing as the psychotic artist. Also noteworthy is the performance of Ann Carter as Bogart's young daughter. She was a child actress with a very mature and sophisticated quality about her, in fact she reminded me very much of Patty McCormack, who would play the evil Rhoda in "The Bad Seed" several years later. There's never a dull moment in this 99 minute thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning, don't drink this milk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the Humphery Bogart movies I have seen, The Two Mrs Carrolls proved he could make a good, creepy villain.After the death of his first wife by poisoning her with milk he had spiked, Bogie, who plays a psychopathic artist meets another woman and marries her and he intends to do the same with her as he is having an affair with someone else. The second Mrs Carroll gradually gets suspicious of his behaviour and eventually finds out what he did to his first wife and manages to call the police. She refuses to drink a glass of milk he gives her and the police then arrive and he is arrested at the end, keeping calm despite this.Although Bogie only appeared in one horror movie, The Return of Doctor X, The Two Mrs Carrolls certainly has horror elements.Joining Bogie in the cast are Barbara Stanwyck, Dr Watson himself Nigel Bruce (appropiantly as a doctor and a very similar role to Watson too) and Alexis Smith. Excellent parts from all.The Two Mrs Carrolls is a must for all Bogie fans and is certainly worth the ?1.50 I paid for it. Excellent stuff.Rating: 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite bad movies, so bad it's good. A great cast seems to have pulled this baby together in about two days and it's a scream. All of the stars must have owed Warners a film or succumbed to blackmail. It's too bad because it's actually a very neat suspense story starring Humphrey Bogart - without giving anything away, let's just say when he gets a headache, he touches his hand to his head. That's how you know he has a headache. About as organic as a hothouse tomato. Totally worth seeing but not anyone's best work. Watch for the continuity goof with the milk. I can't agree with another poster - I thought Alexis Smith was gorgeous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only saw this from half way through but it was easy to pick the storyline up. Also, this was the first movie I saw Barbara Stanwyck in and she's an amazing actress. Humphrey Bogart gives an amazing performance as a bizarre killer. Bogart plays a artist who's wife dies a mysterious death after he painted her as the Angel Of Death. He marries Sally (Barbara Stanwyck) and as the same strange urge to paint her the angel of death. As bizarre and strange as it may sound, it's very entertaining and most definitely held my attention while I was watching. Even my mother, who doesn't really like Mr. Bogart, sat down and watched it. Although at times you feel Barbara Stanwyck's character is completely hopeless (she doesn't put up any fight, quite weak), that doesn't mean that you don't care about what happens to her. You really do, and you feel a sense of triumph as she grabs the gun. I think the ending would have been much better if she actually put up a fight (how I would love to see Stanwyck kicking Bogart in the groin!! Then punching him before saying a witty line). Just my opinion. I would pay to see that!Anyway, I think The Two Mrs. Carrolls is a very much underrated film. I liked it, it's quite exciting at times. Nice to see Mr. Bogart playing a different role - the villain. I'm getting this on DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Mrs. Carrolls is a fine example of a film that could have been better. There are a number of very good elements in this film, but they serve only to highlight the enormous potential that it had and unfortunately didn't quite live up to.It begins as an odd little thriller, with Bogart's subdued, quiet nature made sinister by some frankly stifling atmospheric music. At first it almost seems as though the film follows a non-linear narrative; we find out later that this is not the case. What it is, however, is a complex and twisting little tale that gradually unravels itself until the climax.One problem is that there is an enormous amount of subtlety employed in its unravelling. In fact I would say there is a little too much subtlety, to the point where the details that are supposed to be underplayed to maximise the mystery and suspense do not seem to be underplayed at all, but rather they appear to have simply been ommitted. It's the same as watching a very badly edited film, where all of a sudden we jump to the next sequence in the story, without any explanation of why, or what has gone on in between. The difference is that in this case, the intermittent gaps are in the story rather than the action.The second little problem is with Bogart's character. He's the centre of this story, a mentally disturbed and jealous painter who, it would appear, murdered his first wife (the first Mrs. Carroll) in order to marry the second, played very well by the beautiful Barbara Stanwyck.But we're not really given any insight into his character until very late in the film. At first he appears to be just like your stereotypical artist; insular, unpleasant, cynical. But we know, or at least assume, that he has actual psychotic tendencies underneath that eccentric, but nonetheless ordinary exterior. We don't really see them though until the final twenty minutes of the film, and Bogart doesn't really get a chance to act until that point either. What this makes for is a thrilling and genuinely frightening conclusion to the film, but a rather dull experience for the rest of the time.That said, this film is worth seeing if only for that last twenty minutes. It's very interesting to see Bogart do insane, as it is to see Stanwyck do helpless damsel, after her stirling work as femme fatale in Wilder's Double Indemnity. And, as with so many good conclusions, it wouldn't actually work without the preceding 80 minutes.So all in all it is a film worth seeing. While there are occasional flaws which stop it from being better, they are definitely, although not overwhelmingly, outstripped by the positive elements of this exciting film-noir. **** / *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This could be the beginning of a beautiful hatred"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to laugh out loud when Bogie made this comment regarding meeting his second wife's former fiancé! The blatant paraphrasing from the last line of Bogie's classic, Casablanca, made 5 years earlier was quite hilarious.This movie falls somewhere in between "Just OK" and "Pretty Good" .. in other words, 6/10. I'm not a huge Bogie fan, so perhaps my grading is a little unfair, although I must admit I like him when he's playing a bad guy or creep (like he does in this movie) rather than his usual good guy roles.Barbara Stanwyck is terrific as always ... I've never seen her be anything other than flawless, regardless of the material.The story of "The Two Mrs. Carrolls" is slightly convoluted or, as other posters have written here, could be due to bad editing -- chunks of the story are left out or just left to our imagination -- we must surmise how we got from point A to point E, while points B, C and D are left out entirely and not even alluded to.Bogie plays an artist who gets inspiration from the woman he loves. When he finds another muse, he has no use for the former inspiration and he kills her. He poisons his first wife with glasses of milk (just like in Hitch's "Suspicion", but I'm not sure which movie came first) after he meets and falls in love with Barbara Stanwyck. During the first wife's period of poisoning/dying, Bogie paints an "Angel of Death" portrait of her.Flash forward two years later ... Bogie and Stanwyck have been married for 18 months and Stanwyck has invited her ex-fiancé and two of his socialite friends (Cecily Latham, played by Alexis Smith, and her mother) to dinner. This is where Bogie utters his funny line about "beginning of a beautiful hatred" regarding meeting his wife's ex-fiancé, and gives us a glimpse into his irrational jealousy. (I think we've seen hints before this point of the flick.) At first, Bogie and Alexis Smith clash horribly, but (cliched as it is) it is only because they are so attracted to one another. Bogie agrees to paint Alexis's portrait and next scene we see the gang at the races with Bogie and Alexis holding hands. At this point we the audience know Stanwyck's days are numbered.Soon thereafter Stanwyck is bed-ridden with a "nervous condition" and Bogie is working on a painting that he won't let anyone see till he's finished. While Bogie is out in town paying off the blackmailing chemist who sold him the drugs that killed the first Mrs. Carroll originally, Stanwyck and Bogie's daughter have a conversation where Stanwyck puts 2 and 2 together. The two sneak into Bogie's studio to look at his painting -- it is Stanwyck as the Angel of Death, with dark sunken eyes and the rib cage of a skeleton; truly a creepy painting.The rest of the movie is better than what it has been up to this point, as some suspense and melodrama finally enter the picture. Bogie sends his daughter off to the train station with the house-maid, and comes back to kill Stanwyck. OK, enough spoiling; I'll leave something to those who haven't seen it yet.Conclusion to my review: Decent enough, almost primarily due to Barbara Stanwyck. Worth watching if you can catch it on TCM and TiVo it and watch it at your leisure. Otherwise, not really worth going out of your way for, unless you're a huge Stanwyck or Bogie fan. (I'm the former!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice early little thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a rather enjoyable movie that is nothing too impressive but is a good watch nevertheless.The movie begins slow and dull because it's mostly just so formulaic. From the beginning on it isn't clear which approach the movie picks and what the movie is all about. Really no thriller elements in the first halve, just some formulaic drama and romance. Only halve way through the movie the movie starts to become interesting when the thriller elements of the movie start to appear in to the story. The movie is more thriller than it's film-noir really, which might be a surprising thing, considering the time the year was made in. So yes, in a way the movie is quite original, despite being formulaic. It has a typical thriller build up that builds up that leads to the unavoidable ending. The movie has some good genre moments, which mostly works out due to the fine cast and suitable atmosphere of the movie.How often do we get to see Humphrey Bogart in the role of a psycho really? That is quite awesome! The supporting cast is also one to die for. Barbara Stanwyck was one of THE leading ladies at the time and Alexis Smith was also quite popular. Nigel Bruce, who everyone knows as THE Dr. Watson from the Sherlock Holmes movies starring Basil Rathbone, also plays a quite amusing small role in the movie.Despite its genre clichés, this is still a rather well made movie. It's effectively directed and the story flows well, despite being quite silly at times. It's an above average movie due to how professionally it's made and how well the actors handle the script and its more silly (clichés) and unbelievable moments. Perfectly watchable movie, especially for the Bogart fans, who want to see him in a role that is different.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Two Mrs Carrolls" is good; not great....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoever claimed "The Two Mrs Carrolls" was Bogie at his worst in terms of movie making is nuts; Bogie's worst film is either "Swing Your Lady" or "The Return of Doctor X." Them films were horrid and I can barely sit through them.. I found "Carrolls" quite interesting and somewhat freaky...I do admit, as far as explaining Bogie's character (Geofrey Carroll) with being mentally ill, the story is vague there... Their really is no reason or explanation as to why he tires of his wife / wives and decides to kill them off one by one after painting a morbid portrait of them....Anyway, regardless of what critics think of this film effort from 1947, I think Bogie, Stanwyck, Alexis Smith and Nigel Bruce made a good cast and crew... Even the young Ann Carter was good as Bogie's daughter 'Beatrice' in the movie....I have noticed that the excellent network TCM rarely ever shows this picture...... I myself had to wait for over a year to finally record and obtain it for my collection here recently.... I rate the film a 7 out of a possible 10 points...... I never hand out 10s, either..... 9 is usually my top digit number given..... Cheerio....MR.BILL Raleigh</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart is as loony as can be and a murderer, but lots of fun to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason to watch this film is because Bogart and Stanwyck are starring in it. Bogie practices his full-screen nutty facial expressions that later became famous in "The Treasure of Sierra Madre" and "The Caine Mutiny". Stanwyck recreates her "horrified-I'm about to be murdered looks" from "Sorry Wrong Number". The plot is pretty hokey and transparent but, like I said, it is fun to see great actors having fun, and it looks like they did on this film. I would bet that this movie was filmed in a few weeks time. I thought that Bogie's daughter would be the one to expose her Dad but she only gave clues to Stanwyck that caused her to be suspicious. As mentioned on the review the "milk out the window" later became "milk all over the sill and floor" for Bogie to realize that his poison milk was exposed to his wife. I saw this on TCM and there were satellite problems or something but only small parts were skipped. This movie, like so many Hollywood plots, has the "good guy" boyfriend that the wife should have married who comes to the rescue. What is funny is that in "real life" there is no way that Stanwyck would have married creepy Bogart and not the debonair, handsome Englishman that she was engaged to prior to Bogie. Of course, "real life" movies are not always good box office or much fun to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Two Mrs. Carrolls" is the second screen pairing of Humphrey Bogart and Alexis Smith, and oddly, it's Smith's character who's the 'other woman' in both films. It occurred the first time in 1945's "Conflict", but in that picture, it was Bogey's character who did the pursuing, while here, it's Cecily Latham (Smith) who intrudes on Geoffrey Carroll's marriage to the second Mrs. Carroll of the title. By that time though, Sally Morton (Barbara Stanwyck) had already been the 'other woman' to the first Mrs.C., who we only know by the 'Angel of Death' painting. Taking a chapter from "Bluebeard", Bogey's character is an artist who paints his victims before they succumb to a spiked milk cocktail.It's never made clear how chemist Blagdon (Barry Bernard) figures out that Mr. Carroll is the customer who signs for his prescriptions as Fleming. But if he was that sharp, he should also have concluded that if Carroll was deranged enough to kill his first wife by poisoning, then knocking off a druggist wouldn't be much of a stretch. Too bad, he turned the screws just a little too tight for his own good.Nigel Bruce is quite adequate depicting a country doctor who looks in on the Carroll's, you might call his performance right as rain. It's Dr. Tuttle's single minded obsession with an Ashton burglar and a Yorkshire strangler that gives Mr.C the idea for his farewell plans for wife number two. If only he'd have cut the phone line a minute sooner.Perhaps the surprise performance in this tale belongs to the actress portraying daughter Bea, an unusually precocious Ann Carter. Watching her, it was almost impossible to believe that a child could converse with the language she used. It was somewhat irritating though to see how compliant she was with every single idea her father advanced, especially going away to school. I think she could have done some damage once the fireworks started.Bogart and Stanwyck are genuinely competent in their roles; Stanwyck in particular turning things up a notch when it becomes clear that she could wind up a murder victim. The pair had generally good chemistry together, and seemed to be a better match than the intruder Cecily might have been with Mr. Carroll. Chalk that up to a fine performance by Alexis Smith, as this viewer found it hard to warm up to her character. Bogart fans might have some fun comparing his performance here against his similar character in the aforementioned "Conflict", a film which for my two cents is the stronger of the two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two Mrs. Carrolls, The (1947) ** 1/2 (out of 4) A psychotic husband (Humphrey Bogart) murders his wife so that he can run off with his new squeeze (Barbara Stanwyck) but a few years later he sets his eyes on a new woman (Alexis Smith) so he has another woman to get rid of first. This is a pretty interesting film that was made in 1945, the same year that Bogart made CONFLICT, which was a fine where he killed his wife to try and get her sister who just happened to be played by Smith. Both films are very much alike so it's no shock that Warner decided to keep this movie on the shelf for two years. This here is certainly the lesser of the two films for a couple reasons. For starters, both Stanwyck and Bogart seem to be out of their comfort zone as I never really bought either one in their roles. Both have prove to be great actors but I couldn't help but be somewhat disappointed because neither come off overly well. Bogart does the better of the two as he at least manages to play the psychotic part well but he doesn't come off overly well as the brilliant painter. Not for a second did I buy him as this painter and I also didn't buy Stanwyck in her role. Perhaps this type of character was just too soft for her. Smith, on the other hand, nearly steals the film with her good performance and we get Nigel Bruce playing a drunken doctor and this role will certainly remind you of Watson. I think the biggest problem with the film is its screenplay, which is all over the place. The movie runs 99-minutes but we never really get to know any of the characters or the reasons that Bogart is so crazy. We never meet his first wife, we never really see his relationship build with Stanwyck and there's no good reason for him to want to kill her for this new woman. Everything just seems to happen but without reason. The ending is quite effective as the film turns pure horror and manages to get a few good sequences. The final bit coming down the stairs, which I won't ruin, is pure gold with the line said. I really wanted to like this movie a lot more than I actually did but in the end the screenplay just isn't good enough to make it a winner. CONFLICT, while flawed, was much better and pretty much dealt with the same story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Couldn't they get something better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Mrs. Carrolls was one of a handful of motion pictures done by Warner Brothers which were released to the Armed Forces overseas first and then to the general public. Saratoga Trunk was another. As if our fighting men didn't have enough to contend with.I disagree and even more importantly Humphrey Bogart disagrees with another reviewer who said this was Bogart's worst film. Bogart reserved that honor for Swing Your Lady. But you would think that in a once only teaming with him and Barbara Stanwyck they would have given him a better property. For instance I could easily see Stanwyck playing Mary Astor's part in The Maltese Falcon. But the Brothers Warner thought otherwise.By the way either before or after Stanwyck did a film at Warners, Christmas in Connecticut an infinitely better film.Bogart here is a psychopathic painter whose modus operandi is woo 'em, wed 'em, paint 'em and kill 'em. He's done that with one wife and Stanwyck is wife two. He's now got his eye on Alexis Smith and Stanwyck is being slowly poisoned.What bothered me most about this is that there seems no reasons for Bogart's psychosis. Hopefully someone who might have seen the original play by Martin Vale could inform us if that was something left out in the movie.If not, then it's a bad movie taken from a bad play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not one of Bogart's best, but it has its good points</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although credits are top-draw, production values are very moderate. Peter Godfrey's direction is also a mite disappointing. Neither he nor screenplay writer Thomas Job have made much attempt to open up the stage play. Instant information dialogue is put across with a disconcerting lack of subtlety in both writing and delivery. Ann Carter's unrealistically precocious child and Nigel Bruce's blustering, stereotyped doctor are the worst offenders. Bogart himself delivers another of his very capable studies in psychopathology. Barbara Stanwyck is also cast strictly to type, but she too comes across effectively. Both she and Bogart give seemingly effortless portrayals as they both have parts they can play standing on their heads. Alexis Smith makes a strong impression in an unsympathetic part. On the other hand, Patrick O'Moore makes a wet, colorless hero. In the support cast, Anita Bolster (looking rather like Margaret Hamilton) gives an audience-pleasing portrait of a cynical servant. Godfrey himself does a brief and amusing cameo as a race-track con man. Barry Bernard registers as the blackmailing Blagdon, while Isobel Elsom delivers her usual capable rendition of a high society lady. Godfrey's direction is at its best in the climax with the camera tracking across the room with Bogart as he makes his preparations. It must be admitted that Godfrey sees the action from a cinematic rather than a stage audiences' point-of-view, but his approach is often unimaginatively routine. All the same, certain sequences do have power (the murder, the climax, the discovery of the portrait), but thanks as much to deft film editing and atmospheric photography by Peverell Marley (who lights Miss Stanwyck most attractively) as anything else. Stanwyck is also most attractively costumed and made up. Alert music scoring effectively mirrors every cue in the dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Bluebeard' meets 'The Picture of Dorian Gray', in this miscast Bogie vehicle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it was released in 1947, one reviewer called 'The Two Mrs. Carrolls', a "dreadful adaptation of a derivative stage play." In part, that pretty much sums it up. It did very poorly at the box office despite starring Humphrey Bogart, who was totally miscast as an artist bent on doing in successive wives, a la Bluebeard. There were also hints of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray', when he paints portraits of both wives as an 'Angel of Death' , before poisoning the first and almost poisoning a second. There is very little mystery here because it's established at the get go that Bogart as Geoffrey Carroll, the psychopathic artist, has already murdered his first wife and plans to do in his second, Sally, played rather perfunctorily by Barbara Stanwyck. The only thing we're waiting for is how Geoffrey intends to bump off Sally and how she manages to avoid becoming his victim. The biggest problem with the script is that Geoffrey is such an unsavory character and has no charm. Good thrillers have murderers with a human face. Here, perhaps because of when the original source material was written (as a play in 1935), often the bad guy intentionally is drawn as thoroughly detestable. Fortunately, in the 1930s, certain talented novelists began to buck that trend (such as Raymond Chandler and James M. Cain) and by the 40s, some superior noirs were produced ('Double Indemnity' for example, which featured the charming killer, Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray). Here, Bogart has little to do, except act surly through most of the narrative. A savvy killer will make ordinary folk feel comfortable, so they're unable to suspect he's up to no good. But good old Geoffrey can hardly contain his contempt when he's introduced to Sally's ex, 'Penny' and his friends, the Lathams, at the luncheon gathering. One just wonders what Geoffrey's 'problem' is overall. Is he a creepy misogynist or simply someone who is desperate to maintain his 'lap of luxury' lifestyle at any cost? One thing is for sure: he doesn't know how to handle himself very well, when dealing with blackmailers. How is it that control freak Geoffrey is unable to keep the weak chemist, Blagdon, in check? And then Mr. Carroll has to resort to murdering him, when I'm sure there's a whole paper trail, linking the mad artist, to the purchases of all that poison he's been pouring into his dear wife Sally's milk! Alexis Smith who plays the cold, steely Cecily, probably gives the best performance in the film. But what exactly does she see in the mega- creepy Geoffrey, that she wants to go to bed with him? (of course we never see that--but it's implied!). As for Sally--when she learns definitively that Geoffrey intends to do her in, after seeing her own 'Angel of Death' portrait, why does she dither around so much, that it gives Geoffrey time to get back home? It appears we're asked to accept the idea that Mrs. Carroll is so devastated by her husband's betrayal, that she becomes despondent and paralyzed, that she can't bring herself to get out of that house right away! During most of the film, Stanwyck plays Sally has a bland, goody two- shoes, who merely shows up as Bogie's proverbial punching back. More enigmatic is the child actress, Ann Carter, who is eerily good as the precocious daughter. Has she been corrupted by her demented father? In the end, I believe she ends up undamaged, despite what's she's been put through by the creepy father.'The Two Mrs. Carrolls' manages to remain only mildly interesting. There's an ordinary story here that chugs along, but there's virtually no suspense and Bogart is oh so wrong for the part. If you have nothing to do on a dreary, rainy Saturday, then by all means, take a look. But this shouldn't even be on your next hundred list, to break out of your DVD rack, or select from your almost filled DVR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart plays Bluebeard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vacationing in rainy Scotland, marriage-minded Barbara Stanwyck (as Sally Morton) enjoys her passionate two-week affair with painter Humphrey Bogart (as Geoffrey Carroll). When she accidentally discovers Mr. Bogart is a married man, Ms. Stanwyck is beside herself. Bogart claims his wife is an invalid, but Stanwyck ends the relationship. Back in London, Bogart sends cute blonde daughter Ann Carter (as Beatrice "Bea" Carroll) away to school and presides over his wife's untimely expiration...Two years later, the widower Bogart has married Stanwyck. She is happy. But, Bogart is grumpy because he has trouble painting. His mood improves when beautiful Alexis Smith (as Cecily Latham) enters the picture. Though Stanwyck and Bogart proved capable in distressed damsel and disturbed psycho roles, they seem to smart for the roles herein. Helping most are precocious young Carter (who is also much to intelligent for the script) and Nigel Bruce as an inept doctor with a fondness for alcohol.******* The Two Mrs. Carrolls (3/4/47) Peter Godfrey ~ Barbara Stanwyck, Humphrey Bogart, Ann Carter, Alexis Smith</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a single sympathetic character in the bunch. Disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, first of all, a well made, well mounted, and well cast film. It even has Franz Waxman's music, which is fine indeed.I found difficulty enjoying this film however because none of the characters are sympathetic except the surly housekeeper who is endearing because she IS insolent. Very odd.Bogart's character, Geoffrey Carroll, comes off as a cad from the get-go which wouldn't necessarily have been so bad if it weren't also clear from the start of the film that he was hell-bent on murdering his first wife. He wasn't suffering in the marriage, he was evidently just a rotten person. Hard to find any sympathy there.Daughter Bea is devoted to her father in a way that seems very unnatural; she is indeed a peculiar child. Perhaps we should have seen more of the first Mrs Carroll's marriage (relationship) so we could have better understood Bea. I dunno... She seems one step away from being The Bad Seed, IMHO. No sympathy there...The supporting characters, with the exception of the aforementioned housekeeper, are either dull as dishwater (Penny), despicable (Cecily), snobbish (Cecily's mother) or incompetent (the Doctor).The chemist who blackmails Carroll is decidedly heinous and, while entertaining, is also highly unlikable. But he's supposed to be.Finally, Sally, Carroll's second wife, doesn't have much to recommend herself and there is little reason to care whether she lives or dies. Oh sure, she showed some spine when she initially rejects Carroll when she finds out he's already married, but the film skips what should have been key scenes between Carroll and Sally where they reconcile after the death of Carroll's first wife. I'd have liked to see him sweet talk Sally into marriage now that the first wife was so conveniently out of the picture...In addition, Sally is pretty dumb. It's clear to us, the audience, that Cecily and Carroll have a spark between them from their initial introduction (there's a fine line between love and contempt!). But Sally chooses to ignore Cecily's rather obvious plays for her man (irresponsible) and even keeps her former fiancé Penny around all the time as a family friend (sorry, that doesn't work too well in real life).Despite good breeding, Sally shows bad judgment and appears to be boringly complacent. She doesn't have much personality; I mean, what does she DO with her days? She's a character that is sketched pretty poorly and I don't fault Stanwyck at all; I fault the writing. Sally isn't the least bit sympathetic (except for her predicament and that's purely mechanical; a sheer function of the narrative).In a good Noir, the characters have flaws &amp; fall prey to circumstances that get out of control often due to their own personal failings. These people aren't just flawed, however, they are damned annoying.Finally, the motivation for Carroll's murderous tendencies are never made very clear. Sure, some people are just *born* bad, and that's a fact of life. However, it would have made the film better if we, the audience, had been given a bit more background on Carroll and what drove him to commit murder in the first place. What's his philosophy? All we get is one scene between Carroll &amp; Cecily where she lures him with a new, carefree life with her in sunny South America and him stroking his brow like a simmering maniac (the bells! the bells!) saying that "this was what he always wanted..." Verrrry shallow.Or is a commentary about artists in general? That they're selfish, immoral, lazy? Looking for hand-outs from rich patrons? Willing to trade up (even through murder) when a better opportunity comes along? What RUBBISH! Enjoy this movie for what it is, but don't expect it to compare with Hitchcock's "Suspicion" which also deals with a (potentially) murderous spouse &amp; deadly glasses of warm milk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, Bogart and Stanwyck, two of noir's biggest icons in the same movie! This can't fail to thrill....You'd think. Think again.Hard to believe anybody thought this overcooked potboiler was a good vehicle for two of Hollywood's biggest stars. No wonder they kept it on the shelf for two years. None of the story makes much sense, and you keep waiting for a surprising twist, but it never comes. Sort of Bluebeard meets Dorian Gray, with some Gaslight touches thrown in. If only they'd given it the full Gothic treatment it sort of might have worked. As a suburban murder drama it doesn't cut the mustard. Predictable from start to the ludicrous finish, in which Bogart goes way over the top. And Stanwyck as a whimpering housewife? Dear oh dear.Avoid;There are better ways to waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quickly: I am a rabid Bogart fan since I first saw "Casablanca" at age 12. I have now collected every film he appeared in except for two shorts and "A Devil With Women" (1930), which seems to be eternally lost. this has taken 43 years. So, with my Bona Fides intact: Famously, Bogart said that the worst film he was ever in was "Swing Your Lady". Objectively true, though he was quite good in it. My vote would be "The Return of Dr. X", a bad movie and he is painfully unhappy in it.But without a doubt, the worst Bogie ever was in a film is in "TTMCs" Barbera Stanwyck (not surprisingly) and Alexis Smith steal it. He is just wrong for it and his star power evidently caused the Director to let him have a loose reign. Even the best have a stinker now and then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It seems for all of the slams it gets, lots of films borrowed from it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You could say that "Dragonwyck", "Secret Beyond the Door", and even Stanwyck's own "Sorry Wrong Number" all had elements of this film in them. Yes, I know Dragonwyck and Conflict were released before this film, but "Two Mrs Carrolls" was actually filmed in 1945 and just sat on the shelf at WB for two years.Stanwyck plays Sally Morton, a woman who has a whirlwind courtship with artist Geoffrey Carroll (Humphrey Bogart), until she finds a letter from Mrs. Carroll. Geoffrey then tells her that though he and his wife have been married ten years that his wife has been an invalid since the birth of their daughter. But Sally will have nothing to do with busting up a home.One great device of this film is that you never see the first Mrs. Carroll. You just see Bogey and the daughter coming in and out of her room. Geoffrey's mind turns to murder, and he is even painting his wife as "The Angel of Death". He signs for some dangerous chemicals at the pharmacist's and you see him going into his wife's room holding her milk, but looking like he is carrying a hand grenade.Next thing you know it is two years later plus some time, because it is mentioned that the first Mrs. Carroll has been dead that long. Sally is now married to Geoffrey, who is complaining that he can no longer paint, that he is mentally blocked. And then he meets the wealthy Cecily Latham (Alexis Smith) who wants her portrait painted. She shamelessly flirts with Geoffrey, stealing him right out from under Sally's clueless nose. Geoffrey wants to leave Sally for Cecily - and her money - plus that chemist he bought the poison from years ago? He's hanging around and blackmailing Geoffrey, who is hardly wealthy.The next thing you know, Sally isn't feeling too well, being told by her doctor to stay in bed. Then through casual conversation with Geoffrey's daughter - with whom she has a good relationship - some interesting facts about the first Mrs. Carroll come to light. When Sally convinces the daughter to let her into the locked room where Geoffrey is painting, what they find shocks them both.Although the idea of Bogart playing an artist seems silly at first, you don't see him that much as an artist - although Jack Warner wanted him to wear a beret and a smock which Bogart had the power by that time to veto. Stanwyck is great as a woman who finds out her dream marriage is a nightmare and Bogart's slide into insanity is artfully done. I do have to ask Cecily - and all homewreckers for that matter - if you can get him to leave his wife this time, won't it be all the easier for some other woman to do it down the line? The bloom won't stay on your rose forever! And now I turn to the daughter. She really is a necessary character. Her interaction with Bogart all through the movie and their good relationship brings out the humanity in Bogart's character, and she innocently relays information to Stanwyck's character that she could not have easily gotten any other way. The only weird part is how she seems to be eternally eight. She does not age over the three year period that this film takes place.In summary you have a great cast in a moody film set in a dark creepy English mansion. The housekeeper is a smart mouth from the word go, Nigel Bruce plays a doctor who is also a lush, and Patrick Moore as Stanwyck's old boyfriend has the patience of a saint. Unfortunately he has the sex appeal of one too. I'd recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Is A Charm.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A decent thriller about Humphrey Bogart, serial uxoricide.It's as if the writers had looked carefully at the great scene in Hitchock's "Notorious" in which Cary Grant is carrying a glass of poisoned milk upstairs to knock off his wife, then they built an entire movie around that idea.The notion is that Bogart, a portrait artist (!) falls in love with a woman long enough to gain inspiration from her. He marries her. When his work begins to flag, he falls for another woman who inspires him and knocks off his present wife.Actually he does it only once with the connivance of a pharmacist or, since this all takes place on a convincing sound stage reproduction of England, a "chemist" rather than a pharmacist. The chemist who has provided the unnamed poison decides to blackmail Bogart. That was a very bad idea on his part unless he enjoyed having his brains being beaten out with a marble pestle.I enjoyed that studio-bound England, by the way. Splendid rainstorms hefty with wind. Bogart and current wife Barbara Stanwyck live in a very comfortable country estate in Ashton, kept up by a sour maid, played by Anita Sharp-Bolster. I swear she never played anything other than witches and crabby servants with names like Hattie Quimp.Bogart and Stanwyck are two professionals and they are up to par in their delivery. Nigel Bruce is on hand to play Doctor Watson again. And then there's little Ann Carter, who was the imaginative little girl Amy in "Curse of the Cat People." It's taken from a play and not really opened up except for some second-unit shooting but it's an acceptable thriller and worth catching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart at his most Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We saw this last night on TCM. Overall it was very good thanks to Mr. Bogart at his evil best. Haven't seen him this sinister since 'The Return of Dr. X' a film I actually liked in spite of the criticisms. Yes, he had played many gangsters, none as psychotic as this character IMO. Barbara Stanwyck is always good, here I don't feel she was given much to do, it was really Bogart's film. Alexis Smith was also well cast as the femme fatale bad girl out to seduce and steal Mr. Carroll (Bogart) from his current life. Nigel Bruce was also in the cast acting pretty much the way he always does...like his bumbling absent minded Dr. Watson. He seems that way in just about every role, not that he doesn't do it well. Actress Ann Carter (The Curse of the Cat People) was also note worthy as Mr. Carroll's daughter who seemed to be 12 going on 40. The part the painting of his two wives played in the story was chilling as was their appearance. Haven't seen a scarier portrait since Dorian Gray's final look. The story reminded much of an earlier film 'Suspicion' with 'Gary Grant, especially the role a glass of milk played in the story. There is one line by Mr. Bogart that's reminiscent of another famous line he once said in 'Casablanca', "Geoffrey Carroll: Y'know, I have the strangest feeling that this is the beginning of a beautiful hatred". 'TTMC' had a Hitchcockian feel to the story..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Off The Shelf And Into The Warm Milk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two ways to look at this film, the performers and the script. Warner Brothers made the film in 1945, and waited 2 years to release it. There are reasons for that including Bogart being cast as an mentally ill artist is not the normal role for him. While he does get a tough guy type of murder he does late in the movie, in this one he plays an artist who is not a smart as his usual self. Barbara Stanwyck is Sally, Geoffrey's (Bogies) second wife. He poisons his first wife with spiked warm milk and she never appears in the film. Ann Carter plays her young daughter Beatrice, who is rather precious and a bit of too grown up acting for a 9 year old (her age) when this was filmed. She is sort of detached, yet attached to her father (Bogie) and seems to show no emotion when her mom dies, which is kind of creepy. Her scenes with Bogart are strange as it is rare for him to do scenes with a juvenile. Bogart has painted a portrait of the first wife, as an angel of death, who he killed after meeting Sally. His inspiration is apparently his plan to murder her. So logically he is working on a painting of Sally. He meets Cecily (Alexis Smith) and starts an affair with her. Amazingly Sally suspects the affair but since he is starting the process of poisoning her, she is a bit helpless to do anything about it.Barry Bernard plays Horace, a chemist who is providing the poison being used for the murder. Then as he puts 2 and 2 together, he starts blackmailing the artist who is not starving and his wife Sally is loaded so he has money, hers.From here, there is suspense, as we are left wondering if Sally is going to stop her own impending murder. Beatrice (the daughter) becomes the most valuable source of information for Sally as she get to see her portrait and learns he is next.It's not top Bogart but the ladies in this have some claws. At the end, when the law catches up, they are offered a glass of warm milk. That is why this one is a bit warm but worth a look anyhow.</fullReview>

They get married but then she gets suspicions that he may have poisoned his first wife to marry her. This grows when he becomes attracted to Cecily (Alexis Smith). It all leads to a finale on a dark and stormy night.First the good things about this. The script is not bad--there are plenty of cute lines. Stanwyck is wonderful in her role. The movie LOOKS beautiful and Smith is lovely. However Bogart is seriously miscast in this. Even worse he knows it and the panic in his face is uncomfortable to watch. The movie moves slowly too. And the finale is WAY over the top to a ridiculous degree. It was unintentionally hilarious! I actually broke out laughing at the overdone melodramatics that were on screen. This was shot in 1945 but held back from release (for good reason) for two years. This was a serious misstep for Stanwyck and Bogart but it didn't affect their careers too much. Almost worth seeing for the hilarious ending. Almost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Please, King Of The Underworld makes this seem like Casablanca. You have another first tier actor, Stanwyck, at the top with Bogie. A hidden treat is the caustic house servant who resembles Margret Hamilton and I don't mean just physically. Bogie plays a homicidal social climbing painter whose paintings, when they near completion, signal that deadly glass of milk for his subject. Stanwyck does a decent job here without the histrionics of Sorry, Wrong Number. Only at the very end does she lose it and your living room will be filled with people yelling directions to save her life. The writing I enjoyed with a blackmailing pharmacist biting off more than he could chew. The main flaw of the movie, that will grate upon your nerves, is a foreshadowing of Network with the precocious little girl bantering with intellectuality and verbiage more suited to a fifty year old erudite lady. It is unintentionally funny when she over-pronounces giant words for her size; you can tell the poor child had it drilled into her head by the director. There is a tipsy quack of a doctor that Bogie uses liberally with the before woman and with Stanwyck, making sure he is nice and crocked, oblivious to what he is up to. The movie moves quite well, opening with Bogie disposing of the little girl's mother as her portrait is finished. The camera lingers upon the glass of milk being taken into her sickbed.Many people will be put off by Bogie as a painter, I thought he pulled it off fairly well. Alexis Smith, the woman he is grooming, no pun intended, to be after Stanwyck steals the movie with some very scathing, trenchant dialog basically eviscerating everyone, including Bogie, with biting sarcastic contempt. Later, she lectures the doctor on how one's self fulfillment should never bet detoured by little things like other people. You will just loathe her; this is the reason the movie belongs in your collection but, admittedly, at the periphery. Three excellent performances with the maid servant providing comic relief with acid directed at pretty much everybody. The final painting, while not having Dorian Gray's horrific unveiling, is still quite disturbing. Freudianism was quite vogue and you get the adumbration that Bogie's social climbing is subordinated to his need to paint his victims before he kills them for the feeling of power it gives him. When Stanwyck makes the mistake of telling him he isn't strong enough to do something, watch his outrage and eruption. There is a strong undercurrent of Freudian Thanatos about Bogie's character with all the Death Imagery in his paintings of current targets.The ending has been attacked as he is taken away babbling like Swanson in Sunset Boulevard. It really does have plenty of suspense that builds the length of the movie. Bogie struggles a bit with the Norman Bates' demands of the role but I thought he did fairly well. The last fifteen minutes are quite intense and well done. The naturalistic imagery of the powerful wind and rain storm paralleling Bogie's loss of all control, shot at night, inside the Gothic house is worth owning this movie for. If you are an Alexis Smith fan, like I am, she really will surprise you with her dominating role in this obscure movie. It is Casablanca? No, but commensurately, it also is not Battle Circus either.

		<fullReview>Viewed at 2013 Los Angeles Film Noir festival image1.jpeg The Two Mrs. Carrolls" (1947) features a most improbable Humphrey Bogart as a talented but mentally disturbed painter (if you can buy that -- who makes a practice of painting portraits of his wives, as the Angel of Death and then knocking them off ? in England, no less. With Bogie delivering his lines in unadulterated "Casablancanese", even in this genteel English environment, it looks like he's playing in a different flick than the rest of the cast, but who cares, when the lady he wants to murder is Barabara Stanwyck, as the surviving Mrs. Carroll!Far from a classic, but one for the books as perhaps the least known of all Bogart flicks ? and rightfully so. You'll never see it on TCM, but Humphrey does chew up the scenery when he starts freaking out?(No one ever pulled one over on J. C. Dobbs). One of the extra delights of this film is the alluring A-list actress Alexis Smith, who tends to steal the show in the scenes where she appears and openly puts the make on Bogie in front of her high society mother and flustered wife Stanwyck. This one will make you loosen your critical straightjacket if you have it on. Redefines the classification "camp classic".</fullReview>

Art Lovers lament that there don't seem to be many Da Vincis and Michaelangelos splashing paint on canvas nowadays. THE TWO MRS.

God told Saint Joan (in one of His mysterious ways) to have a child predator with scores of kills as lead general of her army. Adolph Hitler and John Wayne Gacy are among a plethora of later historical figures who were frustrated painters at heart. Artist Geoffrey Carroll (Humphrey Bogart) runs into all kinds of resistance and red tape before he even can get to the would-be third Mrs. Carroll.

The plot and actors are OK, but I thought the big winner here was Edith Head. Her gowns and even the lounge wear is stunning in this movie. There is an attempt to portray the good girl in white and the bad girl (Alexis Smith) in black. Hats off to the hair and lighting guys too, Barbara Stanwyck is beautiful throughout. Bogarts' sudden headaches get ridiculous after awhile. The plot point I had the most trouble with is that the daughter only seems to go to school when dad needs to off a wife, yet she talks like a Rhodes Scholar. This movie will hold your attention, it just doesn't completely satisfy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Two Mrs. Carrolls is directed by Peter Godfrey and adapted to the screen by Thomas Job from the Martin Vale play. It stars Humphrey Bogart, Barbara Stanwyck, Alexis Smith, Nigel Bruce, Ann Carter and Patrick O'Moore. Music is by Franz Waxman and cinematography by Peverell Marley. Completed in 1945 but not released till 1947, The Two Mrs. Carrolls is one of those films that has an abundance of stories to match the abundance of divisive reviews. Various biographers and cinema writers tell a different story about stuff like what Bogart and Stanwyck thought of the movie, why they did it and so on. It's now hard to know exactly what the truth is anymore! So what about the film on its own terms then? Undeniably the critics of the time were right to point out the similarity of The Two Mrs. Carrolls to such fine movies of the time like Gaslight, Suspicion and Rebecca, in fact the delayed release is thought to be because of Gaslight's success in 1944, while there's even a slice of Dorian Gray about it as well. Having these massively popular films as benchmarks has kind of crippled "Carrolls" reputation, because quite frankly it's not close to being in the same league. However, if one can judge it on its own terms, this is very good Gothic thriller entertainment. Plot is essentially Sally Morton Carroll (Stanwyck) as a newly wedded wife who comes to realise her husband, Geoffrey (Bogart), is not the charming loving man she thought he was. He's the tortured artist type, who needs his muse to be kinked to produce his best work, thus the thriller conventions do proceed as Sally unearths dark truths and becomes a woman in peril. Various colourful characters are added to the mix; Smith's head turning sex bomb, Bruce's alcoholic doctor, Moore's lovelorn ex boyfriend and Carter's sprightly young daughter. The Carroll house is filled with many Gothic textures, marking it out as place ripe for dark deeds and the unfurling of sinister secrets. Godfrey, though guilty of letting the pace sag all too often, does insert some great mood accentuating scenes. Episodes with the fearsome paintings strike a chilly chord, a raging storm unloading as the curtains billow has the requisite haunting feel, and Geoffrey finally going over the edge produces a superb crash ? bang ? wallop scene. Marley's photography is suitably shadowy via lighting techniques, and Waxman provides a typically genre compliant musical score. On the acting front there's not a great deal to write home about, Stanwyck isn't stretched beyond being just professional, and as committed as Bogart is, he's an odd choice for this type of role. Bruce is typecast as another Dr. Watson character, while Smith is badly underused. The latter a shame as she leaves a favourable mark slinking about like a leopard, in fact it's probably no coincidence that she shows up late in the film wearing a leopard skin scarf! All told it's a little draggy in places and often shows its stage origins, but when it hits Gothic stride it's worthy of viewing investment. And yes, even if Bogart doing Bluebeard isn't the right fit. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart and Barbara Stanwyck excel in THE TWO MRS. CARROLLS. The plot is clichéd and has been done to greater effect in REBECCA (the idea of a tormented second wife); in SUSPICION (the poisoned milk); and in DRAGONWYCK (the drawn out death of a wife). But there is enough variation here to keep it interesting. And the acting of both stars keeps it entertaining, right up till the end. But there are a few problems with the film. In the beginning, Stanwyck's lack of screen time is a drawback. After the racetrack sequence, she gets to repeat herself in one scene after another while her character is bedridden. But we do know that Stanwyck would not take a part if the script didn't call for something truly exciting to perform. And the last thirty or forty minutes, the show picks up considerable speed when the character she plays starts to realize a sweet-faced husband (Bogart) may very well be trying to kill her. Watch for the scene where she throws the milk out the window.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing film that had potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More often than not, my favorite Humphrey Bogart films are those in which he does not play a gangster. And, although he's the bad guy here, he's not gangster. Yet, this is hardly one of my favorite Bogart films. I can't put my finger on it, but he just doesn't seem right for this part, particularly through the first half of the film. And, that the setting is England makes it even more out of place for Humphrey Bogart. If you want to know just how wrong he was for this film -- watch his acting when he discovers his wife didn't drink the milk...reminiscent of the overacting one sees in old silent films.The overall plot is pretty decent. Bogart kills off his first wife (whom you never see) when he falls in love with Barbara Stanwyck, whom he then marries. Then he falls in love with Alexis Smith, and he begins poisoning Stanwyck, as well. Through an odd series of coincidences (believable nonetheless), it dawns on her that he may be poisoning her as well. And, every once in a while, there's some pretty catty dialog which spices up the story. The trouble is that the first half of the movie just doesn't build the suspense in the way that is needed...in fact, there is no suspense. I found myself thinking -- if only Hitchcock had directed! Stanwyck is very good here...as usual...clearly overshadowing Bogart. Alexis Smith as the other woman does well, but is totally unlikable. It's rather sad to see Nigel Bruce as the doctor; he's reduced to same bumbler that he was in the Sherlock Holmes films. Patrick O'Moore is rather good as the other man in love with Stanwyck.I thought it odd that I had never seen this Bogart film. Now I know why -- it's not what it could have been...and mostly because of him. I'm not saying not to watch it. It's watchable. But I doubt it will go on your list of films to watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gothic atmosphere and mood highlight this ultimately mediocre and tepid try at suspense and terror. The two stars are competent, although Bogart is miscast and seems to be forcing it and is especially unbelievable during the finale.The wonderful little girl softens the beast within, but that contrasted with the psychotic painter is to subtle and unbelievable to be truly effective. Some of the contrivances are incoherent and not fully consistent enough to sustain the suspenseful mood. The last act is the most disappointing and seems to rush things along rather than build the required terror and trepidation. The final few lines of dialog are ridiculous and tacked on for viewer closure.Watchable and offbeat enough to recommend, just not up to the standards of the participants.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, this film is not Bogart's worst, by any means. If you don't believe me, go watch "Knock on Any Door". However, I will accept that Bogart is mis-cast as a passionate and successful painter. Too many other iconic roles for me to buy this one. But, he gives it the old college try, and it would have been OK, if you'd never seen him before. Barbara Stanwyck was beautiful and talented, and that showed here. Alexis Smith did steal the show in the scenes in which she appeared. And as far as Ann Carter as the daughter, well, I've known a lot of precocious children, in fact was one, and I do not see the fault in her role (The criticism was generally based on the writing, rather than her acting) Just because you never happen to see the character act childish, doesn't mean that she never did. Anyway this is a pretty good "old" movie, not classic, but entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Psychological Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never heard of this movie until recently...and I love both Bogie and Stanwyck! So, I ordered a copy from the Warner Bros Archive collection and I loved it! This superb, little suspense yarn has Bogie as the deranged Geoffrey Carroll...and for a mentally disturbed psycho, I must say I thought Bogie did an outstanding job! I had never really seen him in that kind of role before, as he usually always played a gangster-tough guy or a private detective-hero. Boy, he really held it together until the end too...when things finally started falling apart for him.Barbara Stanwyck also was very "real" and engaging...as always! Even though I've never really considered her that pretty, I've always thought she was a superb actress! However, I thought in this movie she was very attractive, and you truly felt for her. Alexis Smith also was awesome as the scheming, vindictive mistress (or should we say next "project" for our psychotic little artist ;-) ) of Bogie.Although some might think the plot somewhat predictable...it's not always! It does leave you thinking..."Maybe I'm wrong?" throughout, and the suspense as well as Bogie's slow but sure mental collapse is chilling and riveting! Awesome plot, awesome actors, and awesome performances!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Substandard work by Bogie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen this years ago, and remembered it as scary, but this time around it seemed obvious.Humphrey Bogart overacts as a mentally disturbed, conniving, serial-marrying artist who's being blackmailed by his druggist. How could Bogie have accepted a hack role like this only five years after the sublime "Casablanca"? This 1947 film has an overdone soundtrack that triple-underlines every dramatic moment, as if the viewer is a dunce. Barbara Stanwyck's performance seems less exaggerated than some of her peers', and the icily beautiful Alexis Smith does well as a predatory blonde. Perhaps as is typical of movies of the era, the child actor in the film seems almost eerily mature -- a woman stuffed into a girl's body. (When I looked Ann Carter up on Wikipedia I learned that "in her best roles, she is a vulnerable child trapped in a hostile adult world.") This film has intermittent interest but hasn't aged well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Bogart Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's been a lively debate here as to whether "The Two Mrs. Carrolls" qualifies as the worst movie Humphry Bogart ever made. I have to agree -- although I haven't seen Bogart's own choice, "Swing Your Lady." The tale of an artist-cum-homicidal maniac who keeps bumping off his wives whenever a new love comes along is a trove of clichés. The performances aren't bad -- Bogart is suitably nutty, Stanwyck is cloyingly sweet, Alexis Smith is icily elegant -- given the inane dialogue they're forced to utter. I was surprised that one contributor here voted for "The Return of Dr. X" as Bogart's worst performance. I couldn't disagree more. Bogart was saddled with that film as punishment for grappling verbally with Jack Warner and gave a brilliantly campy performance as a zombie medico. Made a B chiller well worth watching. But there was no way he could save "The Two Mrs. Carrols" and I'm not sure if he even he tried.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Two Mrs Carrolls stands as lost treasure to some film collectors, and others as something to pass up on.With two of the biggest names now known as legends with Humphrey Bogart and Barbara Stanwyck, it is not their best work but something different than what you would perhaps guess them to be in together.Bogie played nearly every role possible, but what keeps this movie shining is how he plays a psychopath villain. For a film noir movie, this one stands out more than most roles Bogie had in his film noir. Playing a psychopath that kills off his first wife to marry a new girl, while of course painting her as "The Angel of Death" and now after the marriage he wants to repeat the crime.For Bogie fans, this is a must have if you already own most of his works. For others, you may or may not enjoy the film as it's not a classic, but still a good movie nonetheless.</fullReview>

The child actress and Veronica Lake lookalike steals every scene she's in and it is a shame that she never wnet on to adult stardom. She was probably born twenty years too late or early considering that she probably had a better life out of the spotlight. The film itself could have done with her steadiness much as was done in the Last Turn of the Screw (The innocents) where Deborah Kerr downplayed her role and did not suffer quivering lips like Bogart does throughout the movie. The biggest problem is that the scenes don't seem to meld cohesively or forcefully enough to create lasting tension. Alexis Smith never looked less beautiful or alluring on screen and you wonder why Bogie would bother to kill Stanwyck for this femme fatale(less).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to make a bad movie with Humphrey Bogart and Barbara Stanwyck, but they certainly accomplished it here. It must have been hard on Bogart and Stanwyck, too. Bogart's playing a psychopath here, only you can't really see it to begin with. And the cutting didn't help any either. He's in love with her in Scotland, then he's back with his first wife who is dying, (according to their little girl) then she's dead, he's married to Stanwyck and there's another woman on the scene. I knew nothing about this movie when I watched it, and I'm ashamed to tell you how long it took me to figure out that he was a nutbucket. I just thought it was an extremely bad movie. Not that I consider it normal to go around killing people, but you are led to believe that he is just in love with Stanwyck. It's a really stupid plot, too. You have to sign the poison book in England to get the unnamed poison, and he not only does that, he apparently signs his real name. I guess that should have been the clue that this guy is not operating on all cylinders.I score this higher than I probably should have, but I find it hard to score a Bogart/Stanwyck film below a 5, just because they were on the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Milk - It Does a Bogie Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart plays an artist who poisons his first wife to be with Barbara Stanwyck. But after pretty young Alexis Smith enters the picture he decides to bump off Barbara too. Not bad but not great thriller was filmed in 1945 and laid on the shelf for two years before release. That's never a good sign. Still, I enjoyed it for the most part. Stanwyck and Smith were fine. This is often cited as one of Bogart's worst starring roles. It's not what I would call one of his best but I really didn't think he was bad. A lot of the faults with the film can be attributed to director Peter Godfrey, who only got A-list projects due to his friendship with Stanwyck. His direction is mostly lifeless and he doesn't get the best performances from his actors. He's not suited to direct suspense pictures for sure.Bogart's daughter is one of those movie kids who speaks and acts like an adult. It's supposed to be endearing but I found it creepy and off-putting. She is played by Ann Carter, a young actress who impressed me in the great Val Lewton movie "The Curse of the Cat People." There is one scene where she breaks down crying after Stanwyck collapses that you see this was a talented young actress and the director is most likely to blame for her otherwise robotic performance.Another problem is the "other man" played by Patrick O'Moore. In movies like this where the leading lady married a scoundrel of some kind, there always had to be another man waiting in the wings who loved her. Usually it was a man who knew her first but she chose the new guy over him. He exists so that the audience will feel happy at the end knowing our heroine won't be alone. The problem is that O'Moore is very much a stuffy Brit character and is a poor consolation prize. I didn't care for his character or actually all of Stanwyck's hoity-toity rich friends. Best line is Bogie's play on his famous Casablanca line: "I have a feeling this is going to be the beginning of a beautiful hatred."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** It's interesting to watch Humphrey Bogart playing of all thing a whacked out and homicidal artist who needs to tap into, if you can make out what the heck he's talking about, the life force of his victims in order to bring out his artistic talents.Meeting Sally Morton, Barbara Stanwyck, while doing some shopping in London American artist Geoffery Carroll, Humphery Bogart, falls head over heels for her. Later on a fishing trip in Scotland Geoffery proposes marriage to Sally it's then when she finds out, when a letter falls out of Geoffrey's jacket, that there's actually a Mrs Carroll who's living with Geoffery in London.Geoffery back home with his sick wife, he told Sally that she's an invalid, and young daughter Bea, Ann Carter, is seen giving her a glass of milk, off camera, and in the next scene it's two years later and he's now living with Sally in Ashton as man and wife. It's obvious that the first Mrs. Carroll was dead and also her death was the result of that glass f milk that Geoffery gave her.An ill-tempered and nasty guy still Geoffery's great talent as an artist attracted classy Cecily Latham and her mother, Alexis smith &amp; Isobel Elsom, to his and Sally's mansion to have the grouchy Amerian paint a portrait of her. Acting very unsocial to both her and her mother Geoffery nevertheless accepts to do the portrait and eventually falls in love with Cecily.Problems start to pile up on Geoffery with Cecily both madly in love with the neurotic nut-case and also wanting him to drop his wife and take off on a sea cruise with her to South America. Even more pressing on Geoffery's disturbed mind is him being blackmailed by London pharmacist Horace Blagdon, Barry Bernard, who prescribed the poison that he used two years ago to murder his first wife.Using the excuse that he's going to London, some 40 miles away, to enroll little Bea into an exclusive girls school Geoffery get's to see Blagdon about the blackmail money that he's demanding from him with the crazed Geoffery bashing his head in instead killing the blackmailer. Rushing back to Ashton Geoffery is late for a party that Cecily together with her mother and family friends are attending.With the party now over and everyone leaving it's now up to Geoffery to finish Sally off and complete his masterpiece, an awful and horrific portrait of Sally that he's secretly painting, by giving Sally a final glass of spiked milk that would put her to sleep and out of her miseries forever. But something went terribly, for Geoffery, wrong with his demented artists master plan; Sally had already found out about it.Embressing final sequence with Humphrey Bogart as Geoffery Carroll going completely bananas as he tries to do in poor and sick Sally who's locked in her bedroom trying to call the police. Flying through the upstairs window like Tarzan of the Apes Geoffery was so ridicules that it had to take all the talent that Barbara Stanwyck had as an actress to keep her from cracking up and at the same acting as if she's absolutely terrified of him.It may have been better for Geoffery to be shot and killed at the end of the movie so we wouldn't have to hear his totally unbalanced monologue, as he's being taken away, and instead die with some dignity instead but that was not to be. As Geoffery is being taken into custody by the cops he meekly tries to get them to have a drink a drink of the spiked milk that he prepared for his wife Sally!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cliché-ridden Gothic suspense gets atmospheric workout...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The wind rages, bells chime, lightning flashes, shadows flit everywhere, and Franz Waxman's background score gives a shot in the arm to the gloomy melodramatic proceedings. Unfortunately, the script never gives HUMPHREY BOGART and BARBARA STANWYCK enough strong material to work with, although they both do professional jobs.Warner Bros. always knew how to give lots of atmosphere to Gothic tales (THE UNSUSPECTED, CRY WOLF) and this is no exception. The trouble is the stage play this was based on has about every cliché one could wish for in a story of this sort...the suspicious wife, the poisoned glass of milk, the stern housekeeper, the windows that never stop rattling.If you stay with it, the last twenty minutes give you some satisfying moments of suspense and some tense moments for the victimized wife. Bogart and Stanwyck make an interesting team and it's a shame the script couldn't afford them better opportunities to show their talent. As it is, Bogart does well enough with a crazed glint in his eyes and a feverish mopping of his brow, while Stanwyck builds to hysteria about as well as any actress is able to do. She looks so glamorous throughout that's it hard to see why Bogart is so anxious to ditch her for another woman, played with icy charm by ALEXIS SMITH.Certainly not worth going out of your way to see, but Bogart and Stanwyck fans should at least get some satisfaction of seeing them get melodramatic with each other in those final scenes. Little ANN CARTER, with her uncanny adult poise in a child's body, is almost a dead ringer for Patty McCormack who went on to play the malignant child in THE BAD SEED. Carter seemed a talented child, but whatever happened to her?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will attempt to refrain from the non-stop spoilers which pass for "comments" in some of the other entries for this film. It is a real curiosity-piece and a very odd duck; a cranked-out women's gothic melodrama B-picture with A-list actors, and it is embarrassing to see them run through this material. Possibly it is an indirect commentary on the turmoil and impending doom of the studio-system in 1947. The music and sound-effects are crashing, intrusive and amateurish; the lighting is fairly flat; the story is totally cliched and feels like it came out of some third-rate monthly women's magazine. But it is the acting which is interesting ? because it is totally inexplicable; what Bogart, Alexis Smith, and particularly the little girl are doing is just wildly stylized, bordering on surrealistic and archetypal; while at the same time Stanwyck is being completely her usual grounded self, and turns in a workman-like performance very typical of her at the time, thus putting her totally at odds with the rest of the cast. She is really the only reason to see it; Bogart fans are likely to be extremely disappointed, and wonder what in the heck is going on. Odd to think that he had just done `Big Sleep', and was about to knock out `Dark Passage', `Sierra Madre', and `Key Largo'.</fullReview>

In a way, I thought Miss Stanwyck was using this film as a dress rehearsal for her Oscar nominated performance in the following year for "Sorry, Wrong Number."Ann Carter stars as Bea, Bogart's daughter from his first marriage. The child is precocious. She sounds like a 40 year old rather than a child of 8 or 9 which she is supposed to be.Nigel Bruce is somewhat effective as the doctor to Stanwyck who loves his "occasional" drink and obsessive talking about the burglar-strangler on the loose.The heavy rain and dark atmosphere adds to eeriness of the production. Problem is that the plot can be figured out in about 10 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that is very much overlooked by most Bogart fans, not because of his acting, but the story line may have been great in 1947, but is not very thrilling today. Humphrey Bogart,(Geoffrey Carroll),"Dead End",'37, plays a struggling artist and also a man who loves the ladies. Barbara Stanwyk,(Sally Morton Carroll), "Sorry,Wrong Number",'48 plays the wife and begins to become very uncomfortable living with her husband. Geoffrey hands Sally a drink of milk before going to bed and she gets all upset and throws the milk out a stain glassed window. Alexis Smith,(Cecily Latham),"The Eternal Sea",'55 gets herself involved with Geoffrey and they have fun as told in the days of 1947 with no sleeping in bed together was allowed. Geoffrey works on a painting of his wife and has it under lock and key and eventually she opens the door and finds a great big surprise. Even Nigel Bruce (Dr. Tuttle), "Dressed to Kill",'46 appears in the picture and gives a great supporting role as the family doctor. If you are a Bogart fan, you will want to see his performance and especially his facial expressions, something like the "Caine Mutiny"54.</fullReview>

I agree that the plot is kind of silly, but I actually enjoyed the film despite this and liked that the film was willing to take risks. Therefore, I think I enjoyed it a little more than Maltin, but not much. Bogart definitely plays against type-casting, as he's a crazy husband who murders his wife in order to wed another! Yes, I know this sounds a lot like a cheesy soap opera or an episode of Jerry Springer. BUT, despite this it is engaging. It actually seemed believable at times thanks to interesting writing. However, there are a few dumb moments that prevent this film from being better. In particular, when Barbara Stanwyck is about to be killed, she just stands there like an idiot--even though SHE is the one with the gun. And, like a cliché, he hits her and takes it away. Any character that dumb deserves to be killed. If she had just plugged him, the film would have earned at least a 7!</fullReview>

I haven't seen every Bogart film ever made(he made 75 feature films &amp; I have a lot of his films from all 3 periods of his career)from what I have seen if I was a betting man I would have to say that this has got to be his worst movie of all time.

I wouldn't waste my time on this one &amp; I do have this but I hardly watch it I'll watch "Dead Reckoning" or "Dark Passage" instead.

		<fullReview>Bogey plays a tortured artist(!) who needs to kill every wife once she serves no artistic inspirational purpose to him anymore. It sounds far-fetched and isn't exactly the most credible motive for murder, but I've seen worse. Stanwyck plays his crooked-nosed second wife, who eventually gets bombarded by clues that Bogey's first wife was poisoned and that he has the same in store for her. Stanwyck gets about a zillion clues - enough circumstantial evidence to convict O.J. Simpson in front of a sex-starved black female jury - yet she still has doubts. Ah, love... Eventually common sense prevails and she doesn't drink that forbidding-looking glass of milk that Bogey is so keen on serving his wives. She is saved by her ex-beau in the last minute. We also have here Bogey's daughter from the first marriage; this girl is given dialog that would make a forty year-old woman sound too adult. We are supposed to believe that this girl's coolness regarding all the goings-on, as well as her articulate manners and speech, are a result of her not socializing with other kids! The girl's character is sometimes so over-the-top that it becomes unintentionally comical. Filmed in rather nice black&amp;white. The dialog in the opening scenes is on a dime-novel level.
