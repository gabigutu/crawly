		<shortDescription>Gut-Wrenching Tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Period pieces don't often serve as the backdrops for horror, which is actually a real shame. Consider The Witch, a story about a banished Puritan family trying to sustain itself on the edge of an ominous forest inhabited by a gruesome witch. The faithful representation of one of the most creepy time periods in American history makes all the difference here. The family's dealings with the supernatural terror in the woods push their spiritual and physical endurance to the breaking point. Robert Eggers pulls no punches and makes no apologies in this film. The Witch's scenes are steeped in primal dread, and each actor makes the audience feel the seams come apart as paranoia and mistrust begin to take their toll. While Game of Thrones alumni Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie offer brilliantly raw performances as the family's mother and father, it's the film's younger actors?Harvey Scrimshaw and Anya Taylor-Joy?who really shine. Scrimshaw captures the nuanced turmoil of being an adolescent male in a strictly religious family. As the oldest daughter who is blamed for the witch's malevolent deeds against the family, Anya Taylor-Joy shows a surprising amount of risk and range in her performance. The film swings for the fences on all fronts. The performances are explosive, the tension is gut-wrenching, and the settings are nightmarish. To the horror films of 2015, the gauntlet has officially been thrown down. ?Alex Springer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as psychological horror gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel like I can't come up with the right words to describe this incredible movie, but I'll try. The lingering atmosphere is done incredibly well from the beginning, helped along by a combination of a tense score and the use of extended periods of silence. The acting is bang-on and you don't know when or how it is going to end. The movie doesn't have 'twists' exactly, but the way it is written keeps you guessing constantly. And I personally loved the ending. Though the potential is there to use a more standard approach, The Witch however opts to go down a more subtle avenue, leading to the true nature of religious persecution that is on full display here. Additionally, elements of the story have been taken from historical documents, adding another layer of grimness. The supernatural elements are obviously up for discussion, but that these tales were written centuries ago somehow adds more to this disturbing film.The film is set in 1630, in New England, America. A Puritan family is banished from town for their beliefs (or it at least seems this way, perhaps based on real events). They are forced to move to a farm that feels like it is on the edge of the world, as from the opening the woods that line the farm are presented in ominous fashion, almost creating a character that could serve as the scariest element of the film. What exactly goes on in there? Why can't the children venture inside? Suddenly, without warning, tragedy strikes. The family clings to their faith to prevent them from starving as their crops die; with nothing they can do to prevent it.The period is an appropriate choice given how humans treated each other centuries ago, and an ideal setting for a horror tale. Some conversations require a little more attention, as the characters speak in 'ye olde English' which takes a little getting used to, but it adds another layer of mystery as the family is struck by more inexplicable hardships, causing them to become wary of each other, which in turn leaves them in a increasingly vulnerable state. I can't say I is scared, but I do know that I is gripping the armrests pretty hard for most of the film. Hell, they manage to make a scene where a man is hunting a rabbit seem tense and creepy! Additionally, this is not for inattentive viewers; I could see clock-watching all around me. The incredible camera-work almost reminds me of Paul Thomas Anderson in There Will Be Blood, with many long takes, often slowly panning or zooming in. There is also a focus on facial close-ups reminiscent of Bergman, all of which is a feast to watch on an IMAX screen. The score matches this camera-work almost to perfection, while there is often a lengthy silence between dialogue to contrast the tense music. It also must be mentioned that the child actors really shine, out-doing their older counterparts.This really is my sort of horror film. No jump-scares, convincing acting and a focus on a dark, foreboding atmosphere rather than the grotesque and bloody. This is another of those films I would label as a psychological thriller, as the supernatural horrors are kept almost completely out of view as we witness the downfall of a family who are all affected, turning on each other as their faith is truly tested.This film couldn't have catered to my interests more; I can't recommend it to everybody, but if you go in with no preconceived notions you'll be in for a tasty, if not nasty surprise. The suspense is almost unparalleled among recent films, and the 'horror' genre conventions are cleverly subverted to deliver a film that is better than 'It Follows' while being a completely different film. In addition to all this, there is much to take in thematically if you are so inclined? Hell, I'd love to see this again to do just that.www.epilepticmoondancer.net</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Calvinist terrors abound in this fraught "folk tale"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Witch" charts a family of Calvinist dissenters in colonial America who are exiled from their community and homestead at the edge of an ominous forest. When the infant child of the family disappears inexplicably, a chain of increasingly bizarre events lead to claims of witchcraft and sorcery that implode the family.Based on the plot summary, much about "The Witch" seems fairly predictable, and that's because it is. Robert Eggers makes no bones about reality or superstition here; this is, as it is branded, a "New England folktale" through and through. It's also allegorical on some levels, and is about an English family's failure to conquer the vast American frontier. Regardless of how it is read, the film's surface plays out like classic accounts of witchcraft and superstition that pervaded Puritan Calvinism in the seventeenth century.What director Eggers does here is weave a taut and unsettling narrative through a series of meditative visuals and haunting encounters with evil--some have said not much happens in the film, and they're right--but is that the point of such a tale? The story is mediated through phenomenal performances that are the real emotional center of the film, while rare but fantastical occurrences with the supernatural jar the audience as much they do the family.Eggers' direction is remarkable, and the cinematography consistently captures the gloom of a New England winter; close-ups show the younger children engaging with their ominous farm goat, while pans of characters venturing into the woods create a legitimate sense of danger--and that is another of the film's prevailing themes. In the film, the threat of danger lurks in all matter, be it in the natural environment, in doctrine, or the horrifying corporeal locus where the two meet.Overall, "The Witch" is a surprising and moody entry in the horror genre for 2016; it is not only recalling classicism in its period setting and narrative, but also in its cinematic approach to storytelling. It is old-fashioned in just about every way, but is no less masterful at creeping into the skin as insidiously as evil does within the family. We feel their terror, their desperation, and their yearning for absolution; and that is what makes the film such an effective mood piece. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Know what you're getting into!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start, just so you know who's actually writing the review. Young fellow here, didn't watch any 'classics' horror movies but I do enjoy horror movies in general as long as they are not just gore type of movies. I'd say my favorite horror movies are The Ring and The Conjuring.So, past that to The Witch. I'd start by saying the movie was not what the trailer lead me to believe. This is not as much about scary moments or jump scare and more about a family coping with a lost child, and the movie trying to build suspense and just make the viewer feel uncomfortable. Because of this, I can see why some people will see it as really really slow with not much happening.Some PLUSES for me: - Anya Taylor-Joy (the older daughter) is amazing in this movie and I also think Ralph Ineson (the father) did a good job. - the score is really really good, there are periods of intense silence and periods of creepy music at just the right times to build tension - the cinematography with nice wide shots combined with the score works really well in most momentsFor the MINUSES: - I felt like the other child's acting was pretty bad and over the top and just took me out of the movie in most scenes where they are the focus (thankfully there were not THAT many) - a bit too slow of a pacing during the first half even for my tasteSo, just like I said in the title, KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO. If you go and expect your typical horror movie with jump scares and a hidden 'baddie' slowly revealing itself along the movie in scary scenes, THIS IS NOT IT. This is mostly a family drama that tries to build suspense and make the viewer feel uneasy.On a side note, I caught this on a premiere showing with a theatre half full and the occasional comments, coughs and even laughter from some 'individuals' took me out of some moments. If you do want to watch this in the cinemas, I would recommend waiting and going way past premieres and on a awkward day / time so you have the cinema close to empty. Or, if you have a sweet setup at home with a good sound system, I would just watch it at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summary:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a story set in the early colonial period of New England. It has the authenticity of a well-researched historical drama, up to and including dialogue delivered in a period accent and vocabulary (softened a bit so that it's easy to understand). Instead of drawing on historical events, though, it draws on historical folklore -- it's the story of witchcraft afflicting a family, such as might have been told at the time.The characters are a very believable, ordinary family, with the sorts of tensions and problems you'd expect from people living a hard and substantially isolated life after being exiled from the local colonial town. They also have period Calvinist attitudes, and the storytelling doesn't present an outsider's view of this or offer a modern commentary, but instead it just displays these attitudes and tells a story from the characters' standpoint.Their reliance on period folklore means that it doesn't strictly follow modern horror movie tropes, either. It has the slow build of a modern psychological horror/thriller as well as the standard formula where tragedies start from tragic flaws, but the traditions it's drawing on depend on a Calvinist's conception of flaws, and treat witchcraft as a horrible, well-understood occurrence rather than a shocking supernatural surprise. This story applies these perspectives.It's very well done in terms of writing, acting, and other aspects of execution, so it might have cross-over appeal to fans of horror, folklore, or straight period drama from colonial America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Atmosphere, Great Sound, Different Kind of Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found "The Witch" to be a generally unnerving film, and one which--though I would not place it in the pantheon of scariest flicks I've ever seen--had some moments that I'll not easily forget.The atmosphere Eggers creates alone is enough to wrench serious dread from scenes other directors would be otherwise unable to make even remarkable. The score, too, helps cull this dark tone and adds life to a film that can be borderline tedious.That being said, "The Witch" is not for everyone. It is strange, slow but steady, gruesome at points, and almost un-watchable at others. There are two sides to this film; one which I had hoped the director would stick to concerning the family and their struggle with religion and isolation; and another which plays as an undercurrent to most of the film and then takes charge in the end. Sadly, it is this second side which keeps me from giving the film a better score, and that ultimately hurts the film in the very final scene.Overall, I enjoyed "The Witch" and its originality. Eggers has achieved a film that, for all its low-budget and independent film background, feels richer and better made than many horror entries of late. Should you decide to see it, a word of caution: do not expect a fast-paced movie full of jump scares and creepy crawlies emerging left and right. As the opening credits remind the audience, this is a folktale. One that does not shy away from exploring the real dark places.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Top Ten Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best part about The Witch, besides the acting, is the dichotomy between drama and what is actually a surprisingly fast paced and accessible horror movie (with few genre clichés.) The film could be looked at as two separate stories heavily intertwined: the supernatural horror of the woods vs the very real terror of violence erupting within the family, and amazingly this is all done seamlessly, missing no beats and never seeming to give up one for the other. In that way, The Witch has the elegance of a clever children's story (A New England Folk Tale to be precise) with the intensity of a melodrama. This would never have worked if the cast didn't kill every role, but luckily for us they did; they murdered those roles.I don't think I've ever actually seen a movie during which people, in the middle of a crowd, screamed. The Witch did that. The Witch made people scream and gasp so loud the whole room heard and it did other things too: it told an engrossing, intelligent story. There are minor "complaints" I may have that keep it from being 10/10 (the shots don't carry the film as much as the writing,) but really this is a horror film that could easily make a top ten list. It's just good fun (and the ending is great... don't bash the ending... people are bashing the ending but I don't know why... it's really a perfect ending...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazingly awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the reviews here and hearing about the surprising success of this film, I was eager to watch it. I love plots involving history pieces as well as the possible paranormal. But as I started watching this movie, I found myself praying that there was just a slow build. Unfortunately, I found myself hoping for that up until the very end. The characters were annoying at best. The various elements and ideas introduced to move the plot along seemed to be only minimally explored. The two worst characters in my opinion, were the twins who, from the beginning, gave off an air that they could be evil. Yet when it is confirmed that they had been talking to the devil via a farm animal, the directors/writers still somehow maintained their characters as innocent children. The sporadic intense sequences seemed more tragic than spooky. And the ending was completely insane. A girl watches her whole family get murdered and is scared half to death then instantly decides that she wants to join a coven of naked floating women? Really? I was extremely disappointed in this film and even more in the misleading reviews on this site. I even double checked to make sure that I had watched the same film as those reviewing. So now I am just wondering if I can have those 2 hours of my life back...?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If the 17th Century could make a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If people from the 17th Century could make a film about their deepest darkest horrors - it would look a lot like this movie! The Witch engrosses you in the time and place of its setting, it's a family drama, a horror and a folk tale. All interwoven together into a macabre ode of the times when people were frightened of the primeval darkness of the forests and the inexplicable twists of their wretched fates. Intense and gripping from the very beginning. With some of the most amazing acting I've seen by the youngest cast members. Fantastic movie for horror fans and a masterful period piece. I would recommend it highly to horror fans and fans of history and good cinema in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A con job by A24; SPOILERS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yep, this studio suckered us into believing this was a slow-burn horror movie that would sit alongside Rosemary's Baby in the horror canon. I assure you, this movie won't even be discussed a year from now. This was a no-burn drama with pretty visuals, good acting, no story, and dialogue that was 60% unintelligible. Pure style over substance. I see a lot of reviews babbling on about religious/feminist symbolism blah blah blah. Problem is none of this matters without story and character. So much great indie horror that never gets a wide theatrical release (Starry Eyes, Babadook, V/H/S, Excision I could of course go on and on) and Hollywood gives us this. I am boycotting all future Robert Eggers movies as he was complicit in this scam. But what do he and the studio care? By the time bad word of mouth sinks this movie and it leaves the theaters after week 2, they will be depositing their 20mil in the bank. Spoiler Alert: As to the plot, it is as follows. A sexy witch in the woods scares this family in a cabin and they go mad and mostly kill each other (maybe because of Calvinism and misogyny and stuff). Then a bunch of witches float in the final scene. Shortly thereafter the movie ended, and someone yelled "refund". I went home mad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unnerving, surreal descent into religious paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WITCH is, in a word, unsettling. Horror films don't normally have an effect on me, much less scare me, but this one was unnerving in a very palpable way. It's about a Puritan family who are banished from their village for an unspecified religious offense, and subsequently move to a location bordering a forest. While there, repeated misfortune and isolation create the perfect storm of religious paranoia over whether one or more of them are possessed by the devil. What THE WITCH masterfully does is to create this tense atmosphere and maintain it over nearly the entire length of the film. Whether it be odd/surreal imagery, slow and deliberate camera-work, or an eerie score reminiscent of Ligeti's "Atmospheres" (used in Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY), all of it is used to brilliant effect and should be capable of rattling even the most seasoned viewer, especially if they have a religious background/upbringing (as I did). In fact, I sensed a lot of Kubrick here; not just 2001, but also THE SHINING. Not surprisingly, they share some thematic elements. The performances were also pitch perfect and very believable for the characters the actors played and, although this might prove hard to get by for some, they speak in period-authentic language/accents. Ultimately, the film is rather ambiguous as to whether or not the events occur in the manner you see them, but that's the beauty of it: like religion itself, THE WITCH is open to interpretation. And as such, it establishes itself (in my opinion) as one of the best horror films of the last 10 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait, what's going on?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer for this film is intense,scary,and thrilling. I was more than excited to see this on the big screen. Thinking back now I'm pretty sure there was a misrepresentation of dialogue in the trailer. No big deal,right? Wrong! I do not understand their English tongue. I had to focus all the will power I have in my body to catch enough of it to make a comprehensible sentence. Even with all that concentration I may have caught about 50% out what was said. Meanwhile, my friend in the movie theater must of thought I was really into it because he kept looking over and asking what was going on. With a title of Witch I kind of expected to see a movie with a witch in it. Wait for it..... there's a bunny, there's a goat, there's even a hot chick in a cabin in the woods, but sadly there no Witch.Let's talk a little bit about the family bickering. Have you ever seen Area 407? At some point in the near future you kind of just want everyone to die and the movie would just end. That would have been a good story... At least a better story than whatever the heck that was. Prayers, yelling, prayers, bickering, prayers, screaming. By the end I was praying that God would just end the movie. Multiple points in the movie the screen would go black in-between scenes and every time I was hoping to see the end credits. I would gather up all my stuff just to have to see more. Unfortunately the end couldn't have come soon enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What shall I saith to thee!! First I barely understood what they were saying. The beginning had some potential, was the daughter a witch? Did the twins do something? Then somewhere in between all this nonsense, the black goat was the evil entity, for a lack of a better word. I don't know if the producer, director or writer took too much acid before finishing the movie. There is really no words to describe what I just watched. All I know is if I could bleach out my eyes, and my brain I would. When I looked at the reviews here at IMDb, and the trailer, I thought well this could be a good horror movie. WRONG in every sense of the word. Those who gave it positive reviews were taking the same acid that the producer, director and writer took. I have so wasted an hour and half of my life, that I can NEVER get back. IF you decide to watch this after reading my warning, watch it at your own risk.</fullReview>

Find another title (heck, go back and re-watch an old favourite) rather than waste your time. Not sure why this gets the praise it has received. Very slow and obvious plot. Some terrible acting (save for perhaps the lead character daughter who in spite of her performance cannot save this film). Ridiculous dialog. Saving graces were the soundtrack and atmosphere (wherein a creepy film should have been quite was to bring forward).

		<fullReview>Hahaha!My friends wanted to get a good scare, and as the Conjuring 2 wasn't out yet, this film was used as substitute. It was a very bad mistake.Things happen at such a slow pace that interest wanes long before 10 minutes is past. You fall asleep and wake up expecting to find the film done and realized it has only been two minutes.... and that is when you start cursing. Why this film is classified as horror the audience will never understand. It is not scary! Half the time the main character stares at a candle flame or some object or another while the camera does a close up on their face, and that is their way of building tension. And then nothing happens. The other half of the film involves everybody praying as if there is a million dollars on offer for the guy who prays the most.Redeeming qualities are found in the pure absurdity of the situation/characters. There is this teenage boy who looks at the breast of this girl who works for his family, has he even hit puberty yet???? And then the mother getting pecked by the scarecrow on the nipple thinks she is breastfeeding a child... HAHAHA!Avoid this guys... well it was funny sometimes</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For start, if you are looking for something like the Blair Witch Project or anything that has an unsteady camera and 'lost footage', this is not the film for you.If you are looking for something gory and jump out of your seat scary, this isn't the film for you.This is a film that sets a eerie mood, similar to "The Shining". We have a Puritan Family banished from their plantation and forcing them out into the world on their own.Set in 1630, this film uses the same dialect of the time, and the beliefs are the same. If you are someone who struggles with religion, this movie also may not be something of interest to you. This film delves into the loss of faith, both figuratively and literally, as a series of events unfold.It is interesting to see the family's journey on how they descend into their fates, and you are left wondering and questioning many things: A sign of a very well written film.WARNING: If you are hard of hearing, I would highly recommend you wait until this film is available on DVD with captioning. The actors all have accents and even I had trouble understanding what they were saying (add to that the way they spoke in that time period).The Witch to me, is a brilliantly shot (natural lighting and using a different aspect ratio to get the sense of isolation), well acted and fascinatingly told. It is a simple story that leaves a big impact, if you are looking for an eerie, haunting film that will make you think. If you are looking for something to scare you and gross you out, you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

In fact Plan 9 From Outer Space was much more enjoyable to watch. The first 15 minutes was quite good but after that it was all downhill. The lack of suspense and aimless direction had me bored out of my brain. I was hoping by the end of the film that there would be a good old witch burning at the stake to liven things up a bit. But not even that would have saved this drivel. This film was shown at one cinema in Melbourne. Now I can understand why.

		<fullReview>Look I May be no expert on movies but I have been a film fan for years and this is on of the worst films that I have seen period and I gave this film every chance in the freaking world this is a movie that was made for Christians by Christians and it is very authentic to how people spoke in the 1600s and the acting is not that bad the actress who plays the oldest daughter turns in a fine performance here as a girl who does not wish to be as religious as her family. This film is boring from the beginning there is absolutely nothing scary about it all this film is about from what I can tell is that you can not give in to the devil no matter who you are god always has your back if you pray all of your problems will go away and if your family is evil lock them up in a horse stall and let them die because apparently there evil and you are not. All and all I say going to this movie is a waste of however much money you end up paying for it I swear I wanted to throw popcorn at the screen not to mention I wanted a big time refund as well look if you like these kind of films fine I am not telling not to go to the film if you like these kinds of films but I do not like these kinds of films and I would advise you not to go to this film it's a waste it really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Really VVitchbored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie made me more afraid of religion than VVitchcraft. I asked a question of my friends today at work, and I did receive some good answers. I asked, summed up: since I don't believe in magic, witchcraft or other things associated with witches, I wonder how really the Salem witch trials went down. I did receive some sad and definitely gruesome answers, but in a logical sense. Exactly what I was looking for and what I believe in. Now, this movie is pure fiction, but it was absolutely amazing on how well they recreated life before the American Revolution. The dialogue, cinematography, sets, acting, clothing, accents?all outstanding. Plus the minimal special effects and clever mood made this a must-see for real horror buffs.Now, that said?to see a second time? Or more accurately, is it worthy of repeat viewings? Not for me. Still, I would recommend it for people who want to get back to the root of evil in horror movies.Basically, it's Christian man vs. Christian men and who's the better Christian. The men, and village prevail, and the man (with his large family in tow) are banished. Surprisingly, the one man is able to build a large house, barn(s,) fields, crops and get livestock in fairly no time. Also, in no time, their youngest gets snatched into the nearby woods and the search is on! (Not really ? we only hear of a search for their baby that they pretty much give up on instantly.) From there, it's paranoia and fear, not to mention concerns about eating into the winter, for the family. As real and authentic as the movie sounded and looked, a ton of the time I found it hard to understand what they were saying. Luckily, they were always praying or scared of God or the demonic possessions, so it was easy to tell what the context was. Despite not believing in voodoo, black magic, spells and the like, it was refreshing not to see yet another ghost, haunted and/or found footage horror movie. Way to go, Hollywood?I am sincerely proud you can think outside the cash box. ***Final thoughts: Though, that would've been awesome to see a found footage movie set in the 1630s. It probably would've been more realistic than most found footage movies set in/around today's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what I call a good movie. But it is not for everyone. After seeing the trailer, lots of people thought they get a horror spectacle. I'll never understand why, because the trailer itself is very slow, just like the whole movie.The movies has a slow pace but its still intense. And it will only feel intense if you give in and not wait for action and speed. This movie is no Hollywood spectacle.The movie feels like a depiction of real life. No stupid jokes and exaggerated action scenes. Slow and calm dialogues. I liked the way the witch was enacted too. I am happy to see that she is not shown as a crazy woman jumping around eating toads.On the other side, I wished there would have been a deeper insight into the witches thoughts.So... go and see if you want more than silly Hollywood witches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a waste...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was truly awful. The story, well, lets be honest, what story? A family was exiled from their village. They're living alone in the wilderness. The baby gets snatched (presumably by a witch? you never really know). The son goes out into the woods he gets snatched but given back and dies an odd death. They accuse the oldest daughter of being a witch. She accuses the twins of being witches because they talk to "Black Phillip" one of the families goats. The twins die, the dad dies, the mom dies. The daughter is the only one left. She starts hearing Black Phillip speak. She walks into the woods naked and joins a group of other women dancing naked around a fire. The end. What...did...I...just...watch. Up until the ending credits I was still waiting for the story to get good. That never happened. There was nothing scary about this, nothing psychological. It was boring plain and simple.The worst part of the movie was having to listen to the truly awful dialect. You can't replace "the" with "thee" and call it colonial English. It just doesn't work that way. Part way through the movie I just started to read subtitles because it was more bearable to read it then to hear it. The costumes, location, and cinematic were on par with The Village. Nothing fancy, nothing good. I heard people say it was on the same level as Crimson Peak. I don't know what movie those people watched but it was certainly not up to that caliber. I really have nothing good or positive to say about this. I wish I could have that time of my life back to watch a better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No spoilers here ... just that I sure do wish I had those two hours back. I could've used that time to do something much more pleasant ... like maybe getting a root canal. The setting was working well enough, and I really feel that it could've been pretty creepy, had they only spent the time working on a half-way decent script. The film was so disconnected that I found it exhausting just trying to make excuses for the poorly written characters. It was one of those films where you really couldn't care less who lived and who died; as a matter of fact, in the end you find yourself rooting for evil to prevail. In the trailer, when they warned you that it felt as though you were seeing things that you weren't supposed to see ... I now understand what they meant by that. I just wish I would've heeded their warning and chose not to see it. Well, that's about it ... it was a real turd. Made Plan 9 From Outer Space seem cerebral and/or thought provoking. Peace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Witch is a period piece in Horror disguise. There was no suspense, no tension, no fear, no nothing. It had so much nothing that there wasn't even any color. People call it a "slow burner" but in reality, it just fizzles out. A movie that relies on dialogue should make more of an effort to have said dialogue understandable. Maybe if I knew what they were saying more than 50% of the time it might be a better film. Even when you could tell they were speaking English, the mumbling was hard to get past. The whole movie is spent waiting for the end because it felt like it was building to something but that something never came. Awful movie was awfully boring. Gahbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a person who loves period pieces and your more out of the normal movies, however The Witch is in my opinion one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The acting was good. The period clothing,mannerisms and speech was commendable. The plot however was greatly lacking. It is suggested that this is a horrifying, terrifying thriller. In my personal opinion this movie should have been labeled as a suspense because that is all it offered, watching and waiting for something horrifying and terrifyingly to happen, which never comes. I was greatly disappointed. I feel that so much more could have been done that would have made this movie so much better. The story in itself is a very tempting and drawing subject. The execution of the story was just absolutely terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can not believe that anybody in their right mind would rate this movie 10/10. the producers must have paid off a small town to rate this, because they already knew how awful this would be. I watched 20 minutes of this "horror" and decided that this should lead to my first review on IMDb. reason for this is mostly because the trailer actually looks quite cool and the IMDb rating was around 6.5 at the time and this alone would make people spend money on this movie. I am NOT English or American but I have seen enough movies to understand English without subtitles. with that being said I didn't understand half the dialogues in this movie and that is enough to completely loose your interest. If you ignore that and think what the hell it's a horror movie and I'm just gonna watch it for the gore, then you will be disappointed because it doesn't even have that. all in all this is the worst movie i have seen in a long time. I couldn't write any spoilers because I had to get this movie out of my mind so fast that I really don't remember any details other than a pare of naked boobs... I hope that by writing this I can save just 1 person from loosing 1 hour and 20 minutes of their life and hard earned money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am constantly confused by people who highly praise films which are simply poor. I think critics are particularly known for doing this but the general public are also guilty of it. It is almost like hipsters who try to like things that most people don't so they can look or sound different to everyone else and I'm getting sick of it. Rotten tomatoes has rated this film with a 90, a goddamn 90! Another good example to compare this with is Babadook which is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time but it was awarded 98! Am I going crazy or is it me who fails to realise how good or bad a movie is? I understand that people have differing tastes but there has to be a limit. The Witch has good ideas running through it but they are poorly executed. The majority of the time I felt like I was waiting for something to actually happen. People explain this as being tension, I explain it as being boring and underwhelming. Not once was I scared or felt tense. When something did actually happen it just wan't done very well. The acting wasn't as bad as in Babadook but it was certainly questionable. There were moments where I had to cringe at how bad the acting was. I could really tell I was watching a film rather than believing the story and characters it involved.This was the type of film which certainly had the possibility of being great but due to choice of actors, choice of director and the unexciting plot it failed miserably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should not be marketed as a horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1 star may seem harsh on a film that critics seem to be praising like crazy. After reading reviews like "one of the best horror movies in decades"...I gotta say, it is NOT a horror film. It is a dark family drama with a supernatural underlying story.The music is great. The acting is great. The movie was incredibly boring for what we were planning on seeing. It is being mis-marketed as some incredibly frightening horror film, but it is a snoozefest if you go in expecting this to be scary. The film opens with a bang....but then drags and drags with no real terror...just a family going insane due to religion and isolation. Think of it more along the lines of a slightly eerie Drama, better categorized with the likes of Cape Fear (NOT a horror film) or Straw Dogs. If Blockbusters were still around...this movie would have no business being in the horror section. It should be categorized as a Drama. Period. Horror films sell tickets, whereas indy dramas do not. This marketing ploy is a trick to fill their pockets. But, it IS NOT a horror movie. If you think you are going to see some terrifying horror movie, you will be extremely disappointed as I was.1 star from me since I was bored out of my mind after being so hyped up to actually see a decent HORROR film in theaters. If this was shown to me back in school when we studied the Puritan days (you all remember reading the Crucible, I'm sure), I would have been entertained and would have enjoyed it. But, due to how to movie was marketed, I went with horror buff friends who are all stoked to see what was supposedly " the scariest horror film in decades." Since it calls itself a horror film, I am gong to rate it as if it were one. As a horror film, this movie is terrible. As a Drama, that'd be another review entirely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm shocked after having such a huge interest in watching The Witch (2015) and seeing what I was expecting to see expose itself to be a complete cluster of crap. All the reviews talking about how great of a film it is makes me wonder how much those people were paid to post those lies, this film is complete garbage. After I watched the movie I went home to sleep so I could think on the film properly though I did post a quick few words on my profile in WoodBangers.com when I had instant remarks to it stating that others had watched that garbage too; though it was worded a bit meaner.The Witch (2015) had some fair ideas for a film, the acting for the most part was really good; the script was fairly well too. A few other items were basically done well like the location for the shoot, but? The background sound effects and music "OMG!, what was wrong with the person that done that?" This is one of the items which killed the film, and of course another item was the script mid-way through as they had lost track of the story and were looking for a way to close the film. I've not heard a real human that watched this film say anything good about it, and I'm very let down after all the hyped lies thrown around in marketing to pitch this as such a great film. Horrible film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over rated low budget so called HORRO film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would be lying if I said this movie was great. I went to watch it yesterday in the cinema and was really looking forward to it with very very high expectations after seeing the trailer and the high ratings of IMDb and RottenTomatoes. The title simply misrepresents the movie. I was extremely disappointed at the end of the film simply because it didn't deliver what it was supposed to deliver, HORROR. I only saw the WITCH on two or three occasions throughout the film and didn't feel any witchcraft or dark magic whatsoever. Over all, without going into much details, it felt that the film was all over the place and going in many different directions that did not lead to nowhere. The script in my opinion was not the right one for this movie, it just builds up the suspense and makes one feel hyper endlessly without any jump scares and it lacked the element of surprise which you would expect in a horror film. The storyline misleads the audience to something unfinished and the chain of events do not make sense at all. I did not understand what happened to the two children and why they were screaming and when they were bewitched and by who. Also, I did not quite get what the goat's or the rabbit's role in the film, they just appear and disappear and the goat stood once which I was expecting it at that moment to transform to the real witch so we get to hear what she has to say, but unfortunately, it didn't happen and it only attacked the man and killed him, very simple and straightforward. Any goat can attack and kill a man you don't need to go to the cinema to watch it lol. Finally, I think the people who over rated this film should review their taste or at least be truthful what they saw. There was nothing to like about this film unfortunately and it is just a waste of time I must say. I know what a horror film should look and sound like, and if this film is rated 7.4/10 on IMDb, and Silent Hill is rated 6.6/10, then you must know that there is a clear issue in this regard and it makes you ask the question, who is really managing the ratings and how do they do it?I hope I have been fair in my judgement regarding this movie as I feel I am only telling the truth about how disappointed I am.Thank you</fullReview>

There is nothing thrilling, psychological, horrific, disturbing, or scary about this movie.There is nothing to figure out, like you'd expect in a psychological thriller. There is nothing that plays mind games on you. Just pure, boring, dull dialog.If you go into this expecting anything other than simply watching people live a long time ago, don't go. If you'd like to see a family simply existing, with about 4 minutes worth of witch related (not full blown witch scenes either) content, go see this.Playing Oregon Trail back in the day was scarier and more psychologically thrilling than this movie.

If you are a horror movie fan like me, and by that I mean real horror, the kind that gives you the creeps, then I advise you to pass on this one. Because honestly there is absolutely nothing horror-like about The Witch. To resume the movie in short it is very simple, people speak the old English in a way that you want to punch them in the face after fifteen minutes, there is about 0% suspense or anything worth mentioning, it's a complete waste of your time. But if you like that kind of crap movies, with on top of that half of the movie religion bullshit, with no action at all, then you might like The Witch. The actors are so-so, it's obvious those ones will never win any prizes with their acting skills, let that be said. Anyways, shame on me that I have been fooled by the ratings again.

		<shortDescription>fails is every possible way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In our house there are two films we use an in-joke references to all things terrible.. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 and Angel Dog.. and now... The Witch.Fist of all it fails as a horror film. A horror film only has one job.. to be scary.. There is nothing remotely scary or even slightly spooky about the whole film. There are a few gross moments but nothing that remotely concerns the viewer.The family have no redeeming qualities so there is little reason to empathise with them. They are a pair of religious nuts who have been banished because they are too nutty for the other religious nuts to live with.The setting is nice and there is a good opportunity to build some suspense about the wood they live under... which is never taken.One of the biggest problems with the show is a technical one. The sound mix is horrible.. The score is ridiculously loud and jarring (irritating rather than spooky) and the voice channel is really low. This is compounded by the fact that the actors barely pronounce their dialogue in a coherent manner. I appreciate they are trying to recreate old dialects but there is no excuse for the muttering they deliver. In order to hear anything you need the volume way above normal and the the horrible score will kick and shake the windows. Seriously.. we had to rewind a few times just to hear what had been said and shrugged a few times.There is one good point.. Harvey Scrimshaw who plays Caleb does a really good job.. the others are very forgettable.I was ready to turn if off with 30 mins ready to go but the wife insisted we have come this far and should push on. After all the ending might justify this bore fest.As for the ending.. please let there be a good ending.. fat chance. This makes no sense what so ever.. the twins vanish.. the nice girl who has just watched her whole family die decides to join the devil and go wondering naked through the woods. Really...I can only assume those who are rating this more than 2 stars got the film mixed up with something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, boring boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER!I was optimistic before watching this, its been rated quite highly on most sites, but after watching it i was disappointed. Firstly, i must say the filming of this was really good, everything was set up great, but it lacked the follow up from the suspense the camera angles and sounds created. The language used in this was sometimes difficult to understand what was being said, as one point, the mother was in the house after mourning her child who had just died, and i literally could not understand a word she said for about 20 seconds. There's a goat 'Black Philip' and the twin children 'speak' to him. I found this a little creepy, but didn't really make much sense - i mean as to why the family had him, why they were talking to him, and why they didn't tell anyone exactly what he was saying. Fast forward, and it turns out the goat is the devil.... i thought this was really strange, it made no real sense, along with the rest of the film!Overall this film is quite boring, and the story line doesn't make sense at all. Things don't add up, or lead on properly, so when you think of an outcome for a certain event, you can almost guarantee it will not be that. There were some good elements to this film as i mentioned, the filming of it; and there were a few jumpy bits, but nothing that really scared me or questioned anything further. The only question i had after i finished this film was 'What on earth was that all about?' I had to look online to see what the story line even was, and what key events meant within the film. It was a mega anti-climax. I wouldn't waste my time watching this again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to drive people insane with guilt and fear? (A detailed manual)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>((Disclaimer: Contains all sorts of spoilers))Ever wondered where all those wretched creatures who lived solitary lives centuries ago at the edge of towns or deep in the woods came from? All the lonely (and dangerously insane) people known as witches and wizards, were nothing but the stray teenagers, or the stray housewives, driven totally insane by the accumulating sensations of guilt and fear encouraged by the morbid interpretations of the "Gospel of Love" which were common only a few centuries ago. Or so claims this wonderful marvel of psychoanalysis. social criticism, and cinematic excellence.Witch is neither your average boogieman flick, nor the latest trick in survival horror, where the beast (in this case dear Ol'Georgie himself) hunts the hapless victims one by one. It is a much bigger offering than that; an art movie that mastered all the commercial tricks of survival horror, and hid within them a potent social message. The movie's controlling idea is simple: The prevailing human desire to seek reassurance from a higher power can easily be twisted by ignorance, superstition, psychological insecurities and a horrendous misinterpretation of religion into a culture of self-flogging that nurtures guilt and fear until they become invincible beasts, then lets them lose on the mind to devour it whole. The result of this scary process is a flock of pariahs, known by the fancy, superstitious name of "witches" who live on the peripheries of society, devoid of any means of compassion, stripped of all sanity and civility, living in a world of morbid fantasies and diseased hallucinations in which they are left defenseless to their auto-cannibalistic minds that devour their sanity. The movie camera never assumes, for a second, that the supernatural aspect of the story (AKA the devil and his incarnations) doesn't exist except in the disintegrating minds of the story characters. The devil does show up on the screen, and so does the "familiars" (animal incarnation of witches). A witch does transform herself into a pretty maiden for our horrified entertainment purposes, and all that is candy for the eyes of the cinema goers. Yet, it is all clear that what you see is but the truth as seen from the diseased minds of the characters, and not the truth as it is. We are given a glimpse of what goes inside those guilty and ignorant superstitious minds, how the truth is perceived from their eyes. Through the hungry eyes of a depraved teenager who craves any female form(not excluding his sister's), we see how an ugly old hag could seem like a beauty, and her promise of a kiss (his very first kiss!) could be both irresistibly sweet, and revoltingly disgusting. And how the whole sexual experience afterwards (his very first) can be enough to drive him insane with joys he couldn't understand (and she kissed me, and went down, and then my bowels..oh, sweet Jesus take me in your lap, HAHAHA!) can drive him insane, feverish and howling until his little heart bursts.We see the old and dry wife on the verge of menopause, unable to contain the effects of her grief for her lost son, her alienation from her homeland, her suffering in a new unforgiving world, and her fear of competition from her blossoming daughter who had just seen the first signs of puberty. How she ends up a victim of self-mutilating thoughts and actions (the suckling craw scene is a masterpiece)We see the pious father, scared like hell from life (aka sin) and avoiding it whenever he can, escaping society whenever possible, flogging himself all the time and feeding his torturous, well-hidden feelings of unworthiness, xenophobia, and fear of a world much more powerful than he is, a world waiting for him, with its horrible evils, at every corner. No matter how hard he tries to vent off his anger on the farm animals or the logs of wood, no matter how far he tries to escape, no matter how he prays and cries and stuffs sand into his mouth to atone for his real and imaginary sins, his guilt and fear won't let him be, until he drives himself, and everyone around him(including the family goat), totally insane.And above all, we have the most rational of all, the young girl who is trying , patiently , to keep her rationality, and save her innocence in a family that had gone completely bonkers. They are always accusing her and themselves of being worthless products of sin, frightening incarnates of evil, and fuel-to-be for everlasting hell. She watches them descend to madness, one by one, losing a little part of her mind every time; until she gradually and very believably, reaches the inevitable moment where she sheds off the last shred of civility and rationality, and runs amok into the woods, welcoming her ascent into the dizzy heights of absolute insanity. We all know what she would look like in a few decades. We have seen one just like her who had spend her life in the woods, nurturing her insane thoughts, becoming diseased, disfigured, ill fed, turning into a frightening form of serial-killer and baby snatcher. The movie has shown us her life, and her face. We have seen, and fully known, the witch. We have also , through the movie , seen and known evil, which is a form of insanity whose seeds are sown by ignorance and watered by guilt and fear.A great movie. It had done exactly what another movie, "The Village" has failed to do more than 10 years ago. It had delivered a very touching message about ignorance, about how guilt, fear and xenophobia have the power to corrupt and destroy the mind and the heart,especially under the effect of misinterpreted religion. How the Christian "Gospel of Love" (or the Muslim "message of peace", if you wish) can turn into the voice of the Devil himself.-- tomsuthblack@gmail.com --</fullReview>

I felt like watching a documentary, but with the downside that I did not learn anything at all. The movie lack of dynamic and it wasn't interesting. Is really sad to see good actors with such a huge potential to be used in this kind of movies. I respect people that believe that this is interesting or good because of their culture or their education, but with all due respect.. The movie was pretty lame.

		<fullReview>I really looked forward to this having seen the trailer. But Hollywood is the master of making great trailers. I was expecting 'something different' as multiple reviews promised but only received disappointment. The movies is one unrelenting exploration of misery. There is no horror, no creepiness, unless you consider a rabbit scary. It is one long slow decent into wretchedness which would be fine if it billed itself as a drama but if you're expecting any kind of thrills or scares or even suspense or tension then look elsewhere. It's a tale of hardship and suffering and left me feeling gloomy with no redeeming counterbalance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More depressing than scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch is about a family in 1630s New England are exiled from their village and go and live alone in a wooded area and area that has a Witch very close by. One by one the children are either taken or possessed by the evil spirits that surround them. This is a very difficult film to watch. Not because it's scary ( it Isn't ) but because the language and vocabulary spoken is of the period . It's also full of religious speak which grates after a while. I've read some glowing reviews of this film yet I didn't get it all. Call me old fashioned but I want my horror movies to be scary , this was just darkly depressing. The one good thing I can say about The Witch is that it looks great. The cinematography is first class and authentic . Shame about the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

It was just flat boring dry and I have no idea how some people think this movie is so great. I literally fell asleep halfway through. Save you time, money and brain cells and skip this ridiculous movie. I love history and quality films but this was just not it. The only good part about this entire movie was the ending. Sadly it went off as soon as we found out she was the witch. Complete and utter waste of time.It does not compare at all to suspenseful horror greats, like Rosemary's Baby or even Blair Witch.

		<shortDescription>Excellent Supernatural Psychodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure whether or not this should be billed as a horror movie. But then again I'm not Christian and it can well be horrifying for a devout Christian. I would call it more... unsettling? Creepy? The director certainly did a great job at the setting and the mood of the story. You can clearly understand why the family was under so much psychological stress. First, they are running low on food. Then they have no one to turn to if things go wrong. They were dealing with the father's lies and hypocrisies and pride. The young son and daughter are struggling with puberty. And most importantly there are evil forces in the woods that seem hell bent on messing with them (to put it lightly).I'm not saying they're not at fault. All of them had their own little flaws which contributed to their ultimate fates. Katherine was a bereaved and an unhappy woman because she never wanted to leave England and the plantation in the first place. She left anyway we can presume out of respect for her husband's authority, but inwardly resented the choice. She stopped trusting her daughter after Thomasin became associated with Samuel's disappearance. To her, at least, her son's disappearance can only be due to either malice or negligence on her daughter's part. It was not surprising that she eventually turned on Thomasin after the deaths of her two sons and the goring of her husband (did she ever found out the twins were missing? I forget). And then, since she has some good (but not valid) reasons to think her daughter probably has a hand in the deaths of two of her children, you can almost understand why she wanted to kill their murderer.William was prideful and "principled" to a fault and would not swallow his dignity to allow his family to live in the relative security of the plantation. His actions exiled his family and he foolishly thought he could make it in the wilderness. And then when his wife asked him to return (they have many good reasons at this point, including the lack of food! And plus there are supernatural forces that want to, again, mess with them). He proclaims perfect religious observance and lords that over the judges in the plantation and THEN we discover that he's lied and stole from his wife to do what he thought was right, then tacitly allowed his son to lie to his wife too, and allowed Thomasin to take the blame for the theft (if only for a little while). While he seems to be a loving man, he's also a deeply flawed one. You could still see how much he loved his daughter even to the end, even if he expressed it very imperfectly.And Thomasin, well, she's not the perfect daughter and it was clear the witches were conspiring to recruit her all along, but I can hardly blame her by the end. She was blameless for Samuel's abduction. It was not negligence in the conventional sense because she was up against a witch; there's no way she could have stopped the witch; she whisked him away without making one sound then disappeared! She was not involved in Caleb's death either, although you could see why her parents would think so. She's also linked to the twin's hysteria. Given this it's not surprising that her parents turned on her. But on the other hand she is mostly blameless through all of this, except for the cruel prank she played on Mercy in the beginning. Her turn to the devil was just a logical next step for her. She has nothing left. Her family has betrayed her and she was forced to kill her mother in self defense. She could never have made it to the plantation; even if she could there's no telling what they could have done to her. She had nowhere to turn at that point. Her final scene, her "you all think I'm evil and betrayed me so I might as well own it", was the most tragic of all.The film is an excellent look at how terrifying living away from society can be, how nature is harsh and unforgiving, and what fear/paranoia can drive a person to do (a mother trying to kill her own daughter anyone?). You can feel their stress and their fears and you understand why they're acting jumpy and irrational. They were trying desperately to keep it together in the face of starvation and supernatural evils trying to wreck their lives, but in the end destroyed each other through paranoia and some truly astounding (but understandable) leaps in logic. The movie itself didn't scare me in the conventional sense. What was scary is that while I don't morally support any of the characters, if I were as religious as they are, and had this happen to me, I might well have made the same mistakes. The terror is in how wrong things can go for ultimately loving and decent people, how your one character flaw can REALLY mess you up in difficult situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice period Folk Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-- Before I review I need to clarify a few things -- I am a person that loves rich old folktales (I loved the "Beowulf &amp; Grendel movie 2005"). I personally believe that the tale should take the time it needs to take with no rush. If its told correctly, it is not always about what they say, its more about what they don't say. I also wholeheartedly cheer for the more natural pagan way of life.That being said - I found this to be a very interesting &amp; immersive tale. The general feeling of the period and the acting in my opinion(IMO) was very good. The tale for me seemed to had a life of its own, with subtleties being included as if it had a tale within the tale, this was very well done.The intensity and delight for me was the clear set idea of showing how being involved in a family (or society) that is based on religious fanaticism can very easily lead to extreme Xenophobia and self-righteous accusations of others to the point of downright violence for the "cause" so to speak. This was very well portrayed in this movie IMO. (history also shows us this type of behavior with the Salem witch trials between February 1692 and May 1693)Although from the start I will admit I had no real like for the family, so if I was supposed to eventually fear for their safety well it just never happened. I am glad that I watched this movie alone so my moments of hearty laughter at certain delicate points did not disturb any other people that may have been watching in a theater setting.The ending for me was very joyous and uplifting. Overall well done :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coffin loads of atmosphere and dread</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The past couple of years have offered up some very interesting horror flicks that defy genre conventions. Movies like The Babadook and It Follows continue to haunt me at the back of my mind whenever I think about them, like now... This year we have another frightfully good one - The Witch. Like the previous luminous examples, Robert Eggers' debut film focuses on themes rather than on the usual tropes and plot to drive the story. It is a marvel of minimalism and a wonder of unnerving terror. Eggers' meticulous construction of historical details is spellbinding and he even goes to the extent of having the entire cast utter King James English. The Puritan world of Christianity is the disquieting battlefield and the sweet family stands no chance. It almost feels like the story of Job in which God has deserted them and lets the devil play with them like dolls. The drab cinematography is immaculately precise, every frame carefully thought out. Above every aspect of filmmaking, Eggers got the difficult ominous tone spot-on. The sense of dread is so overwhelming and enveloping that you can't breathe. 5 minutes will feel like 10 minutes - usually when I say this I mean it negatively, but not with The Witch. The film has coffin-loads of atmosphere, and the horror is so real that it borders on pure torment.</fullReview>

It's the kind of movie that would shut up anyone who wants to sit around complaining about how broken Hollywood is. That being said, it's not for everyone. If you're expecting a conventional horror it's not that at all. I loved, loved, loved the ending. Was absolutely not expecting it. Basically the movie's concept is this: what if the Holy Roller crazies who flip out about the Devil constantly were actually onto something? The result is this movie.

		<fullReview>When I think of witches, I think of Halloween and Harry Potter. I remember cartoons on TV about plucky young girls casting spells and saving the day, before speeding away on a broomstick. Excitement, fun and melodrama. I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too! My point is that witches no longer frighten us. Homicidal maniacs and evil spirits tend to terrorise the protagonists of horror films today, while the witch is considered so harmless she appears almost exclusively in stories that we tell to children. The original meaning of witches, and the sinister source from which they were thought to take their magical abilities, has largely been forgotten.The Witch succeeds as a horror movie, because instead of attempting to modernise the witch, Roger Eggers' debut film reminds us of what witches once signified to people ? and of how very real they seemed.The year is 1630. William and Katherine are devout Puritans who have recently emigrated to New England with their five children. Living alone on the outskirts a vast wood, they want to find the kingdom of God. When their infant son vanishes one day, the parents are distraught. They pray. They repent of their sins. But the family has unwittingly entered the domain of a witch, and evil closes in around them.The fascinating thing about The Witch is that most of the story and the dialogue is taken directly from 17th century documents and reports, meaning that people claimed to have actually witnessed the horrifying things that we see on screen. The film's events unfold to chilling music, with such a matter-of-factness and at such a steady pace that the overall effect is not only one of dread, but of mounting despair. On his knees in the rain, William pleads with God to save his children. But just like that, due to no obvious fault of their own, God has forsaken the family.Immersed in the tense, haunting world of the film, I found myself suddenly understanding the hysteria that once surrounded witches a lot better. The family disintegrates, because of the belief that witches are not born, but created when a human being pledges themselves to the devil in exchange for power. They begin to suspect that one of their own could have become a witch. Fear ultimately conquers love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the more interesting horror films in recent years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slow-burn horror movie about a Puritan family in 17th century New England trying to survive their harsh life in the wilderness while battling their own demons as well as dealing with the threat of a creepy witch in the nearby woods. It's certainly a great-looking movie with an authentic period feel. The performances are all excellent. Two of the biggest complaints I've read are that (a) it's boring and (b) the witch is real and not just a metaphor or something like some would prefer. To the first complaint I would say that those people should stick with their found footage garbage. To the second complaint, which is coming primarily from certain types of critics, I say I'm glad the witch is real. I understand the power of suggestion and I value psychological horror as much as the next person, but it seems like the majority of movies made about witches, particularly about them during this period, have been unsubtle studies of persecution and superstition. That's all well and good, and interesting in its own way, but this is scary because the threat is real and you know it's real the whole film. Yes the family is at each other's throats and the bulk of the tension and drama comes from that, but the witch and who she serves are also a big part of the film and provide some of the most terrifying scenes. It's not a perfect movie by any means but I give it props for trying to do something different than the glut of banal exorcism, slasher, found footage, torture porn, and poltergeist movies that fill the horror field nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfect movie to watch in the darkness, alone past 3 AM.This movie is filmed in a disturbing pace, pretty closed to what it might have been, to be conquering a wild land in those days (1630)I think nothing is left to random. The scenery is powerful, it could portrait any HP Lovecraft tale. The characters are believable, actors well directed. They all look, talk and act in a far distant culture, that sets you really in other world of possibilities, knowing for true that the forces involved in the development of the movie were just undisputed. You know, science came after and a there's a thick layer of ignorance still now about a lot of matters. But in that solitude ? in the awakening of America ? I found myself watching my back, for my home's little cracks in the middle of the night. That is good for a movie experience of this kind.There's several episodes of primal darkness, even apparently superfluous games hiding beneath the cover of innocence. The tension is well managed. I think anybody looking for a cheap scary movie wont keep up the mood of the movie, lacking of bombastic effects. But the fans of raw horror wont run out of amazement. This movie is to be taken seriously, without being pretentious. Being said that, the title may not help for being so obvious.I cant wait to see another movie like this, I wish a sequel !!.. that's hard to follow...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great psychological thriller that sets itself apart from the mainstream jump-scare horror films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Witch" is one of the most bizarre and disturbing coming-of-age movies I've ever seen. It's definitely not "Sixteen Candles" or "Pretty in Pink." The characters in those films may have their share of problems, but they're nothing in comparison to the ones the family members in "The Witch" are dealing with! In 1630 New England, panic and despair envelops a farmer (Ralph Ineson), his wife (Kate Dickie) and four of their children when youngest son Samuel suddenly vanishes. The family blames Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), the oldest daughter who was watching the boy at the time of his disappearance. With suspicion and paranoia mounting, twin siblings Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson) suspect Thomasin of witchcraft, testing the clan's faith, loyalty and love to one another in "The Witch."There are so many different viewpoints you can watch the movie from. Christians might see it as either blasphemous or cautionary. Satanists consider it be an encouragement for people to look outside the box of conventional religious beliefs. Others will see it as just a modern folk tale warning of unhealthy family dynamics and the dangers of isolationism and paranoia.Is it a cautionary tale warning of the dangers of playing with the occult and Satanism? Does the movie encourage audiences to explore life outside the "confines" of Christian religions? Is it warning us to always question our beliefs and not just follow the herd? Honestly, it could be any of these. As a Christian, I find the ambiguity in the message of "The Witch" to be slightly dangerous for those not grounded in their own faith. You're led to believe one thing through three-quarters of the film, even if the family members are extremely fanatic. Suddenly, the direction we're traveling in seems to switch gears."The Witch" is rated R for disturbing violent content and graphic nudity. Much of the nudity is shadowed, blurred, or an old lady. I'm not defending it, just further explaining. Some of it is of oldest daughter Anya Taylor-Joy. She is underage in the film, even though in real life she's now 20. None of it is meant to be sexual in any way. "The Witch" is a great psychological thriller that sets itself apart from the mainstream jump-scare horror films we're getting right now. It's a thinking man's fright fest that leaves viewers pondering what it's all about. Great acting, authentic-looking sets and wardrobe, and real shooting locations make everything feel even more authentic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Witch is a beautifully helmed ghastly take on black magic straight from folklore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst witchcraft is a topic still quilted under dubious clouds, the story Robert Eggers weaves is no less than the work of a genius. There is excruciating dread imbibed in his way of storytelling that makes it one of a kind. Eggers maintains a regular pace throughout the flick to milk our fears without going into the shoddy territory. We feast on some high quality filmmaking.The topic of witches has rarely ever touched such a tangible and lucid style of direction. You haven't experienced a disquiet quite like this before, and gore that throws you into fits of anxiety! Acts of witchcraft create a metaphor which is quite clamorous if you really pay heed. You cannot help but feel helpless, cannot stop feeling sorry for the characters entailed, by silently wishing them goodwill. But alas! this is one of the darkest movies ever made. So, if you have a feeble heart just be prepared mentally and you can bear the imminent.The Witch isn't exactly your average horror flick that tries to scare you with disappearing-appearing acts, or by messing around with the cameras, or via zooming in or zooming out effects. Au contraire, it is one of those purest forms of horror that is allowed to gradually develop in you, as you scale its frames right from the very beginning. Very engaging stuff that will leave you traumatized with abominable witch acts! You cannot help but marvel at the way Eggers captures his gorgeous frames. The serenity of the woods that he arrests in his frames icing it with a harrowing music in the background is beyond comparison. Captivating landscapes and natural shots that he takes make the movie a visual entertainer. You can almost read the tranquility of the woods through his endearing screens.The casting has been done brilliantly. Screenplay is smitten with Shakespearean English which some might find hard to understand. Music is very grim but just about perfect for a horror movie. The Witch is a well manufactured affair that Robert Eggers manages to conjoin with his rad direction and writing style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had hoped for more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the beginning of filmmaking Hollywood has struggled to deal with the subject of witches. In recent decades they have mostly just been used as a source for light humour and even children's films. Films like 'Practical Magic' and of course the 'Harry Potter' series have taken a mostly harmless attitude towards the subject, and the audiences have seemed satisfied. I am currently watching season three of 'American Horror Story' titled 'Coven'. Going into it I had pictured (and hoped for) quite a dark overall theme. Unfortunately what I have found is again a lighter approach, and I would have to say I'm not overly enjoying it. So when I heard there was a film coming out titled 'The Witch', which seemed from the trailers to have a very dark approach taken, I was excited. Did it live up to my expectations? Sort of.I left 'The Witch' with a sort of "Meh" feeling, despite having enjoyed it for the most part. Frankly, I had hoped for more. I was aware this wasn't going to be your standard type of horror film with jump scares left, right and centre. An atmospheric horror is fine by me and something I often enjoy more than the alternative. But for me the atmosphere wasn't really having an affect either. It didn't help the dialogue was nothing short of exhausting to listen to and take meaning from. For me that element unfortunately took away from what the film was trying to achieve. It had to be there, it's simply unfortunate.There was a little bit of a mystery element surrounding things, which was probably the aspect I enjoyed most about the film. That may have lead a little to the "Meh" feeling I got too though, as I felt the mystery never really came to much. The acting was superb, it would have to be said, and that side of things did a terrific job in covering up what could otherwise be considered a very slow-burning story at times. After the film I was left to ask myself a question. Are witches a potentially scary film subject? I'm yet to be convinced they are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cerebral horror film - takes you to another time....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect from such polarized reviews. However, I enjoyed this movie. You will need to watch it in closed caption unless you have the ears of a bat or are used to pilgrim-speak. You instantly feel for this family as they are thrust out of their community and thrown into isolation (echoes of The Village). They pray thanks for their meager scraps of bread at dinner and do the best they can while slowly descending into madness (echoes of The Shining). Could be witchcraft, could be the poison corn, could be cabin fever - you will need to watch it to find out. As the story builds, the family begins to fall apart and turn on one another, as they think the eldest daughter to be a witch. However, we learn it is not all in their minds, as Caleb has an "encounter" with a beautiful witch that the daughter is unaware even exists. This eventually leads to the boys dementia and demise as the evil destroys him from the inside out (echoes of The Exorcist).The family descends further into madness. Not only are they struggling in the wilderness, they now no longer can trust one another. The scene where Thomasine's own mother spits hateful accusations at her is heartbreaking.For those of you complaining about all of the religious talk - DUH - they were Puritans! This was a great movie, but left me feeling uneasy afterward, and quite somber. But if you are a horror movie aficionado, you should see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are you on the fence about whether to download, buy on DVD or go out and see this movie? Let me save you some time:DON'T!! It is a terrible waste of your time.It seems these days all I do is write reviews trashing movies. If a movie is good, then great, no need to come here and try and help my fellow users warning them to avoid it like the plague.But in the case of the truly terrible movies which somehow have decent enough reviews and ratings to sucker me in, that I then watch and wish I could get the 2 hours of my life back I feel COMPELLED to come here and give them bad reviews in the hope of convincing others NOT to waste their time.This is just a train wreck. Thick garbled accents, no real horror or thrills, and a cast so small that at the 45 minute mark you really have to wonder where this is going (nowhere is the answer).Slow, dreary, dull and boring. I cannot warn you away from all the 10/10 review enough. This is the biggest waste of your time in recent years and if you want something about Salem and witches, then watch any version of the Crucible instead of this trash.Sometimes you wonder who is writing these reviews, and who could possibly watch a slow and tedious plodding movie like this and go "Oh hell yeah, that is a 10/10, I'm going on IMDb to tell everyone".I suspect they are either part of the studio, or their friends or family must have been involved in making this trash. Within 6 months no one will ever remember this movie. It adds NOTHING to the genre, and delivers what could only be described as the slowest possible 90 minutes in front of a screen I have spent in recent weeks.I love horror, I love a good creepy thriller. I HATED this movie.</fullReview>

"Deliciously" stunning imagery, superb casting and an authentic piece of art.I know a movie is good whenever I come to IMDb immediately after watching to read the reviews. This one of course was no exception. I'm stunned though to see others giving it a 1 out of 10 or to say that it wasn't a "horror" movie. This was truly frightening from the get go without relying on jump scares. My only critique is to say that the dialogue was a bit difficult to understand.

		<fullReview>heard allot about the movie and saw the 7-star rating on IMDb, but yet again IMDb rating are just as reliable as an old condom. What is wrong with people who have rated so highly for this movie? I mean come one people should have higher standard. This movie was not scary at all, instead it was just gruesome and pathetic. First scene starts off with a family banished from a town then poor banished family settles on a open land surrounded by creepy trees. First the youngest baby disappears, kidnapped by the old naked witch just to turned into baby paste (YES BABY WAS GRINDED DOWN IN A MORTAR WITH A LARGE PASTEL, DISGUSTING!!!) then she puts on the baby paste all over herself. Next well scenes of day to day life of the banished family with scenes of incest little brother who is horny for his older sister (YES LITTLE BRO KEEPS PEEKING DOWN HIS SISTERS SHIRT!!!! WTF!!!!!). After they have given up on search for the baby, the incest little bro didn't give up and ended up going with his sister into the woods to look for the baby only to have himself lost in the woods. The sister finds her way back home meanwhile the little bro finds the witches lair or den or nest whatever you want to call it. Witch changed herself into a steaming hot chick, little bro getting all turned on gets seduced by the witch (predictable much?). anyway father goes looking for the boy but does find him however during some night the sister finds the little bro naked around the farms fence. Of course the boy is all crazy and dying coz he is cursed, after that the entire family (didn't mentioned the youngest twin bro and sis coz they are just annoying) accuse the older sister of being a witch. Well of course she isn't a witch but after few weird ass scenes of little bro suffocating and spitting blood he dies. Father then goes all crazy and boxes all the kids into a sheep pen because he thinks they are cursed and witches. Well middle of the night for some odd reason the witch (naked showing her old old old disgusting ass) comes into the little shed and I guess eating the sheep that was in it with the kids screaming in fear. The Father wakes up in the morning to find that entire shed and livestock destroyed and dead except the older sister, then started screaming and going crazy only to be impaled by the sheep's horns, ergo dies just like that. Mother who was in bad shape losing the youngest baby and then the oldest son and getting her boobs pecked by a crow (which was a disgusting scene btw) tries to kill the only surviving daughter because she also thinks that she is a witch. The daughter in order to save herself kills the mother (SELF DEFENSE!!!!!), after crying and moaning, poor girl all devastated cries herself to sleep in her house. When she wakes up, having nothing left calls on the devil, after a little chat and making her take her clothes off, gives her a book and guides her to a witch orgy in the middle of the forest (what's with the nakedness?) then all the witches including herself started to float and that's the end of the movie. So that's about it, the whole movie is written in one paragraph so don't bother wasting your time watching it. You are better off watching the conjuring which is far better movie and very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think its a well crafted effort.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember reading the 'official entertainment review' of this movie after it had come out. It was panned by the critics. I went to see it just to see what they were complaining about and I found a film that was original in every sense. The characterizations were a bit strong but maybe thats the way people were back then. Nobody can say for sure since nobody is alive from that time period. I thought that somewhere in the film they could have found some way to explain why they used two 'v's' to make the word 'witch.' The reason being that the word 'witch' came from Scandinavia in the form of the word "vvitch" meaning "sorcerer" (usually a male person as posed to a female person) which has a more powerful evil connotation that the commonly used western term 'witch.' The origins of the term are darker and imply greater evil than a 'witch.' Anyway-the film was gritty in an interesting and different way and I think the film attempted to convey the darker connotation of the concept of a 'sorcerer.' Not a film to watch alone at night. Effective horror- something that you don't see very often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not often I get completely duped and screwed by IMDb ratings, but the 6.8 (especially for a horror film) led me to buy this movie before even first watching (save your judgment, I buy movies all the time before watching and due to a decent amount of research and a pretty good intuition with movies, I rarely get burned). But this movie is an exception. I see many people writing positive reviews applauding the movies "psychological horror", and I'm really at a loss as to what they're talking about. I look for only a few things in horror movies (I'm an avid fan), A: Logical and interesting story B: at least decent acting C: some feelings of being scared, unsettled, disturbed, something....this movie severely lacked in the most important one....C. Where was I supposed to be scared? Sure, there was some atmospheric tension with some decent score to accompany, but it lacked severely in anything visual...and after all, it IS a film. I like when a movie makes my mind wreak havoc, but my mind can't MAKE the movie. And if it's supposed to be ALL psychological, well, it just didn't do anything for me. Might I also add, visual does NOT mean gore. I cannot stand movies that lean on gross out gore. Some of my favorites include The Conjuring, The Babadook, The Exorcist, Cube, Sinister, and The Thing. Idk, overall pretty disappointed after reading generally positive reviews and seeing positive ratings. Not a HORRIBLE movie, but I wouldn't exactly recommend it. 4/10.</fullReview>

It focuses on little things, that have a big impact on storytelling. The film is slow, it shows little by little through its 90 minutes, and it is this what makes it so great. You are scared, it's intense, you want to know more, even if more means getting chills down your spine. And the filmmakers know how to reveal the 'more'.This isn't some 'BOO! HA, GOT YOU GOOD' scare jump crap Hollywood produces these days. It rather relies on the unknown.Acting is great, so is the music, which in some part of the film really creeps the f*ck out of the viewer, the setting and the plot are great.Definitely one of better horror movies in recent years, I would recommend it to everyone who is fed up with modern typical 'horror' films that are made by the same old scare jump recipe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Disturbing than "Scary"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a good directorial debut. The Witch is a solid film by Robert Eggers. Set in colonial times in America, the story is one of a family that is exiled from a village. The family chooses to settle near the woods in which many strange things occur, the first being the disappearance of the baby of the family.The eldest daughter of the family is cautious when it comes to the woods, but that doesn't mean she can't get good fun out of teasing her little sister that she is the infamous witch of the woods. This little sister and her twin brother take this jest too seriously, and eventually inform their parents of this incident. That being said, supernatural forces are at play among the family at the core of the movie, and tensions are raised and the family members are against each other as possible demons.Some may find trouble keeping up with the Old English used in the film, but it seems easy enough to understand when you compare it to Shakespeare's works (even with modern adaptations such as Whedon's "Much Ado About Nothing"). The person who uses this type of the language the most is the father, William, played by Ralph Ineson. Ineson steals the show even when the audience cannot fully comprehend what he is saying (it is easy to get the general idea though). His performance is probably one of the best aspects of this film, other than the lack of great color variety that truly sets the mood for this film.In terms of "horror" films, this movie does not produce many jump scares, and is instead just disturbing in content, making it comparable to films like The Shining or perhaps Rosemary's Baby. With the family accusing each other, elements of The Thing also come into play. A solid film when it comes to technicality and the horror genre in general, but it could have used a bit more story and more clarification about the demons at play in this film.3.0/4.0</fullReview>

IT'S A SHAME HE DIDN'T USE THIS BLACKOUT TECHNIQUE FOR THE ENTIRE 92 MINUTES AND DO US ALL A HUGE FAVOUR !!!!! I am a believer in closely following the work of promising new writer/directors, but I'm afraid I will not be viewing any more or Mr Eggers work ... as this film was Truly APPALLING AS A HORROR !!! Back in 1982 there was a far less clever &amp; cultured horror called "Superstition (aka The Witch)"..... WHICH IS INFINITELY MORE ENTERTAINING AND IS A REAL HORROR FILM!!!

		<fullReview>When you leave the theater in stunned silence, I think the film did its job. The Witch is the next low budget horror film to reach the theaters this year, and it's easily the best. The film rarely ever relies on jump scares to get your head spinning as the core of this film's brilliance lies with its haunting imagery and eerie score. It's hard for an audience of this day and age to get into a period piece set in the 17th century without any big name actors or action elements. And I have to admit that I wasn't sure I wanted to see a film like this, especially with its horror elements. But my eyes were pealed from beginning to end. I wouldn't say anything about the story shocked me or had me confused, but the imagery, score, and uncompromising nature to Robert Egger's direction left me breathless. Within 10 minutes I was looking at the screen and whispering to myself "why would you go there?", "Don't do that!", or "come on, really?". Not because I thought it was poor story- telling, but because I was so invested as to what these characters were doing.With that said, I don't think this film is for everyone. It's brutal, harshly relentless, and utterly disturbing. The characters use all 17th century dialogue and the cinematography sets this grey and ominous tone. The imagery from beginning to end will stick in your head as it has done with me. But that's the way horror films should be. I wouldn't say it's more a psychological thriller because there are plenty of terrifying moments, but it is more for the 'Under the Skin' crowd than it is for people who love 'The Conjuring'. Even in its harsh moments, I was always invested and I can't deny the quality of the writing, directing, and acting all around. This is how you make a horror film.+Terrifying imagery+Egger's direction+Invested from beginning to end-Sometimes the dialogue is difficult to follow7.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I am that very witch. When I sleep my spirit slips away from...my body and dances naked with The Devil. "Wow, this was the biggest disappointment of the year. After reading some laudable messages and the rather misleading recommendations on certain websites, I thought I was ready for again another original horror that, unlike most in this genre, doesn't have an overused subject. In retrospect I really wondered where the horror started in this story. Yes, the language used in that time terrified me. That's for sure. I understood absolutely nothing and I was glad that subtitles were provided. Is it the religious devotion in those days that scares you? I would call it religious insanity. As soon as something happens, those arms go up to the sky and that all-encompassing divinity is called on for help. Or is there really something pernicious in that dark forest, causing this poor farming family to be overwhelmed by adversities?What if they'd called "The VVitch" a historic drama? Probably my opinion would be slightly milder (and probably I wouldn't have watched it anyway). But calling this horror, is a gross deception for many. In my view this movie shows the misconceptions and misinterpretations that were commonplace at that time. A bad harvest, another setback or an unexplained illness caused those simple and unknowing souls to wail and pray to the almighty. An era in which superstition and fear of the unknown thrived. Is that what this simple peasant family made insane? Such madness, that even the black goat in the family was regarded as the source of all evil? For me it's just a historical, psychological drama. It's as simple as that.As mentioned earlier, the entire film is drenched in Old English. I can imagine that historians and linguists go all lyrical about it and get overexcited about it (I can see them sitting there already all slobbery). I tried to understand a tiny bit of it. As a result it required my complete attention mostly. I can believe that the mise en scene of the whole, looked accurate and authentic. The house-holding, the way they dress and the way of living were shown brilliantly and very well cared for. Likewise, the acting and dramatics. Especially the young actors were excellent and gave it a unique character. I can imagine that finding such good, young actors, isn't easy. Their hard work, while seeking a perfect cast, paid of.Nope guys. This is far from being a horror. Or hearing yet another prayer gives you the chills. I like subtle films in the horror genre. It isn't necessary for me that it's all bloody and gory. But I'm afraid I've missed the subtlety of "The VVitch" somehow. The marketing department of the publisher probably realized suddenly that the label horror sounds sexier and more commercial than the ordinary label drama. Let alone they would even mention it's a historical costume film. Not that this is an insignificant genre, but the target audience is more limited in my opinion. In terms of atmosphere and film technology it's unparalleled. But I'm just allergic to deception on a large scale. A bit like religion itself, isn't it? Lets pray for that for once ...PS. I've seen the trailer afterwards. Now I understand why film-goers thought this would be horror. More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe this just caught me on the wrong day or the wrong time of day or maybe I have become addicted to involving stories and action in my old age. To be generous, I might describe the pace of this film as measured and the atrocious accents and fake old speak as authentic, but then again....Unfortunately for me I took against father and son immediately and wanted them dead. There was a certain air of foreboding despite the drawn out gobbledegook at the start so I thought maybe loose a couple from this desperately self obsessed family quickly and then the rest will be up against it. Then bring in a witch or two and we will be rolling, but no...I reckon the film makers had the fantastic and sublime ending sorted and then messed about to stick something in front of it but possibly I'm being unfair, I wouldn't know. I just liked the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor dialog throughout the entire film. Ultimately to save you wasting 2 hours of your life as I did, a baby gets stolen and mashed up to be used as some kind of anti age cream, then a boy, after regularly perving on his sisters breasts, goes in the woods and gets seduced by an older woman and then returns home naked and ridden with herpes. He then dies and, what can only be described as a twisted family domestic, the rest of the family blames each other. The mother then gets her breasts sucked off by a rather large crow, a goat kills the father, the daughter and mother try to kill each other with the daughter succeeding, and then the daughter takes the advice of a goat that had just murdered her father and becomes a nudist deep in the forest with several other psychotic women. The end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie kind of slow ,but a good horror movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt this was a good movie,good acting,visuals,etc,I loved the atmosphere and setting of it more than anything.Was a bit slow but that's what makes it more brooding.The only thing I didn't really like about it is the religious subtext in this movie,I mean I know this is just a movie,and I know its set in that period so it makes sense,but for most religious people today this is a true story.If you look on Wikipedia there is actually a section in the description of the movie for religious people to chime in.I feel that this kind of movie especially since it's popular further perpetuates religion,it keeps religion unjustifiable,most normal sane people would see this movie and say those religious people are nuts,but for religious people what happened at the end is justifiable because they really are battling an evil Witch and an actual devil,and that is very dangerous and sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't expect your pathetic, desperate, cheap jump-scares. This is a horror movie that you have to experience slowly. And LOL at people disliking the movie because of its slow pacing. It wasn't even that slow for me. And that's what a movie like this should be like. Slowly creeping up on you. The overall tone and ambiance of the film is amazing. I love the eerie atmosphere followed by dark, thought out cinematography and directing. Followed by really intense acting. I loved that they showed the witch, letting the threat become real to the audience quickly but in a very subtle way. This movie knows what kind of movie it is, It's dark and artistic without being too pretentious. And I love those kinds of movies. The ending bit reminded me of Bergman, where it's really abruptly presented. A little predictable, but the movie keeps it short and sweet. Very subtly made, creepy, eerie, chilling, and intense. Overall, this is the best horror movie I've seen. And I'm definitely recommending this to someone that expects more from a movie than cheap jump-scares and a serial killer hacking up a high school W*ore. Your opinions are bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't always write reviews, but when I do, I either loved it or hated it so much that I just had to write something about it. I urge all of you who are reading this to just give this movie a chance; it will make you think about all sorts of things (religion, film-making, family, 17th century, corns?) while taking you on a roller-coaster ride of emotions and scares. This movie is so unique and hard-hitting with its haunting atmosphere, its creepy music and its approach to acting, it will just leave you mesmerized, terrified, confused and down right in awe. The fact that this is Robert Eggers' first full-length movie just blows my mind. What solid craftsmanship. What an amazing experience. The less you know about this movie, the better, so I'll keep this short. Just close all the lights, crank up the volume and let this movie drag you to the depths of hell =)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was not until I had finished this movie that I remembered the tiny village of Las Paules in the Spanish Pyrenees where I had lived a few years ago. There, in the year 1593, twenty eight women were accused of and hung for witchcraft, almost exactly a hundred years before the infamous Salem Witch Trials. I would have judged The Witch to be a solid, rather unusual and very slow horror flick, but because of this ?personal" connection to the theme of the film I decided to spent some more time thinking about it in greater detail.First of all, I think The Witch is a very well produced movie. According to IMDb, director Robert Eggers most often works as a Production Designer and a Costume Designer, and it shows in the dedication to detail. Here and there, that attention to apparel was almost a bit overdone, which would have turned the movie into a hipster thing, but ultimately, it was well balanced and congruent to the story. Everything has a strong feeling of craftsmanship. The acting is down to earth, accents are thick, the sets look as if a group of Amish had just finished them. In my book, this evokes a pretty neat impression of seventeenth century New England. Which helps in diving into the story.A father of four is banished from a puritan plantation because of quarrels with the local church. He decides to take his family into the wilderness that lies beyond the high palisades of the plantation village, to find a place where they can live according to their own set of beliefs. Unfortunately, everything goes haywire.Eggers decides to give us one of the most gruesome moments of the film ? the kidnapping, murder and ?processing" of the youngest child ? right in the beginning. Then he cuts back to the everyday life of the family on their secluded parcel. This is odd, but interesting. What will be problematic for some is that from this point on, the movie has the pace of a slow art house film. Not much scary stuff is happening. The treeline next to the family's home and the dense forest are used in a very effective visual manner to create an atmosphere of general creepiness. Other than that, the only scary attempts come from some off screen rustling of leaves and branches, which seems to indicate that the family is stalked by something. This is repeated several times and felt like a rather cheap scare to me.There are hints at some sexual tensions between the family members, with some of them entering puberty or adulthood. Those surging feelings are obviously conflicting with the puritan mindset of the head of the family. Issues of poverty and morale are introduced, as the father needs to sell his wife's heirloom for some corn. As he doesn't disclose his actions even when the wife suspects their daughter of theft, questions of honesty and loyalty are thrown in. Tensions rise from scene to scene. At this point, the movie seems more like a study of the problems and constraints that puritan settlers were facing while trying to domesticate the wilderness around them.When Caleb, the oldest son, get's lost in the woods and stumbles on the doorstep of the very witch that kidnapped his baby brother, things start to completely disintegrate for the family. While accusing each other of making deals with Satan, William the father makes some desperate yet destitute attempts to restore order and keep his remaining family alive. He ultimately fails due to the fact that he is facing Satan himself, who has been infiltrating their lives in the form of a black goat.As the dust settles, the only person alive is Thomasin, the eldest daughter. In a unfathomable moment, she decides to give herself to Satan and to join the wild esbat in the depths of the forest. This depiction of witchcraft as something evil will probably not make this film very popular amongst certain women's groups, since the perception of what a witch is or was has dramatically changed in the last century. Robert Eggers obviously did not try to be politically correct, instead he created a visual representation of the superstitions and nightmares of our ancestors, and with this, he succeeded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>family conflicts sway around the darkest corners of the eerie Puritan psyche.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slaughter, repressed sexuality, scarcity and family conflicts sway around the darkest corners of the eerie Puritan psyche.The Witch strikingly approaches the genre with its psychological horror and theatrical touch that stands out from the current flood of threadbare horror flicks.The Puritans were a group of English Reformed Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries who sought to "purify" the Church of England from all Roman Catholic practices, maintaining that the Church of England was only partially reformed. The British newcomers plundered and enslaved Native-American tribes from the North-easterly region. Their religious strictness led them to hold a series of trials that deliberately condemned innocents lives, a bleak period of the American history known as The Salem Witch Trials.The film puts the viewer in the middle of a trial with a vague background: A clash of religious beliefs between the extreme austere father, William, against stern community leaders. Ostracised from the village, the scraggy farmer is compelled to take his dispirited family to homestead nearby wilderness, on the back of beyond. The forest adds up a claustrophobic sense to the scenery that almost engulfs the ramshackle dwelling and its residents who will gradually descent into hysteria and madness.The intricate art of shocking audiences does not solely rely on paranormal creatures but on the set-up of the unknown. American film director, Robert Eggers, seems to majestically grasp the formula with ease by combining bleak Christian fanaticism with a grim distorted reality at full-bore .Slaughter, repressed sexuality, dearth and family conflicts sway around the darkest corners of the eerie Puritan psyche. The denial of religious dogmas coupled with family conflicts takes the experience over plot, imbuing viewers with uneasiness and sheer dread. The film doesn't limit itself to delivering visceral bits, which undeniably build up dreadful peaks, but are far away from playing a key role. Furthermore, the use of negative space and the unsettling soundtrack devoid of cliché-ridden rising crescendos grippingly evokes a disquieting atmosphere, in which a cascading series of ghastly events unfold.The blurred line between reality and wicked fantasy are masterfully drawn in order to not only frighten audiences with abhorrent takes, but also outlines aspects beyond witchcraft and bigotry: The retrograde narrow-mindedness that ruled over Christian farming communities, which are categorised for its stark repression on any form of self-expression. Thomasin, the eldest daughter, is the embodiment of the paradigm-breaking spirit that opposes preconceived ideas, which once posed as unquestionable truths.The end falls short in causing any unexpected reactions, however, it is a satisfactory cathartic conclusion of a flawless piece of art that is The Witch. Unfortunately, for its verbose framework, the film might dismay audiences that are yearning for unpredictable jumpscares, but most certainly, will enthral those who are in urge to plunge into an unique sombre experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible movie, not a horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Positives: decent acting (hence the 2 stars).Negatives: everything else! Senseless paper-thin story; no character build up; pacing (i am all for a slow pacing in a good movie which is mainly to build up something, but this movie doesn't build or really goes anywhere and that at a very very slow pace); badly lite scenes - even the day-scenes (to make everything more dreary i guess); a music score that tries to build up tension where there is none; etcetera, etcetera...Some reviewers see in this movie a time-piece story about a religious 17th century family having to deal with being outcast into nature and being faced with sexual tension with kids entering adulthood...others see a story about a young girl who wants to break with her puritan family to become a free spirited woman...duh, i think these reviewers saw a different movie or read it as a series of symbolic scenes...sorry to say but this flick is no Stanley Kubrick "2001, a space odyssey"!Conclusion: not worthy of your money or time, the only thing you are left with after seeing this movie is what the f*** was that all about! If you want to see a decent psychological horror check out: The Haunting (1963), The Shining (1980) or Jacob's ladder (1990).One thing i learned: apparently a 17th century male could build on his own with little or no tools a fancy 2 story house with brick fireplace + annex shed in the course of a few weeks in the middle of nowhere - eat your heart out all you survival diehards...i would have thought it was easier to just travel to another town/community..tss what a load of BS this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superstition and abandonment mar family's lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw The Witch on Blu Ray rather than cinema as felt that the cinema's public setting would ruin a film which relied heavily on the right atmosphere in order to effectively tell the story. I was right. For this film, you need silence. It is silence which lends this film its menace, rather than showy special effects. The Witch is set in the New World of the Puritan fathers. The main family of this film are mother and father, eldest daughter, younger brother, twins and a baby, newly born. Having been cast out of their puritan community for going against the community's teachings, in some way, the father takes his family to leave on the edge of a dark wood. He builds enclosures for goats and sets about growing corn to feed his family. His family pray regularly and look to God for forgiveness of their sins regularly. They are in all senses of the phrase, God Fearing people. Within this close and claustrophobic environment, tensions start to mount. The youngest member of the family disappears and is thought to be stolen by a creature in the woods who is seen as using the child for its nefarious ends. The baby is not seen again and with no idea of what happened to him. All this leads to the mother of the family (Katie Dickie, fresh from Game of Thrones) crying and accusing family members, mostly the eldest girl (Thomasina - played by Anya Taylor-Joy) of theft of a silver cup. Then there is the eldest boy, Caleb and his father going hunting in the woods looking for venison. They find a hare which is not killed and lose their dog in the process. More lies to the mother about the nature of their trip. Thomasina is ordered to clean her brother's clothes at the river on the edge of the wood. She does this and notices her younger brother taking a interest in her body. The twins join them and start joking about there being a witch in the woods. Thomsina holds the little girl down stating that she is the witch and she has made a pact with the devil etc. More upset and shouting. Naturally, things go from bad to worse. Caleb goes into the forest with his sister to find the family dog and she loses the only horse they have and Caleb finds the family dog dead with its entrails hanging out. He also discovers the woodland house of the 'witch', a seemingly young, beautiful woman who kisses him and 'bewitches' him. Thomasina discovers him after a terrible night and he is naked and feverish. He babbles deliriously, then dies. In that moment, Thomasina is accused of being a witch by the twins, however, she also tells them that the family's black billy-goat - called Black Philip has been talking to the twins. Their father locks all of them in the goat shed whilst he buries his son and considers going back to the plantation /community for help. It is at this point, after much slow burn and build up that the film gains a greater pace. The mother 'sees' her precious dead children returned to her and 'breastfeeds' her lost baby. Unbeknown to her, a raven pecks at her breast, leaving it bloodied. The father then wakes up and goes to see how the children in the goat shed are. He finds the goat shed destroyed and the black goat running wild. The black goat then goads him repeatedly and painfully and he dies. Then the mother accuses Thomasina of sin and tries to kill her. Thomasina then kills her mother by stabbing. There is nothing left in the farm for Thomasina. Her father is dead, her mother dead, her brother has died of fever (presumably) and its not known what has happened to the twins. It is at this point, that it is likely that Thomasina will die too of hunger, exposure or madness. Thomasina withdraws to the goat shed following Black Philip. She asks Black Philip to speak to her as he did to the twins. Almost at the point of giving up, Black Philip answers and tells her how to get the things she wants - in this case the taste of butter (being properly fed) and a pretty dress (being a Puritan, wearing pretty dresses was considered vain and sinful). Black Philip tells her to remove her clothing (a bit of a cliché) and sign the book offered (presumably, offering her soul to the devil in exchange for a better life - again a cliché). He also helps her to sign it. This is at the point where the film enters superstitious nonsense territory. I shall not disclose any more of that as it belongs to the realms of nonsense in the vein of Denis Wheatley Hammer House of Horror film. It is the only part of the film which let it down, unfortunately.If you watch this film as an attempt to portray witchcraft in a realistic light, I wouldn't bother. You ain't going to find that here. As a fictional account in which superstition, isolation and religious mania can play havoc with the mind, it excels in that nicely. Lots of symbolism abounds in this film, from ravens, goats, hares and the use of colour within the forest (the 'witch' has a red cloak). Much of the symbolism is about suppressed lust having no outlet within a religious household. The presence of the 'witch' as an older woman naked and milking one of the goats is loaded with metaphor and symbolism. It is not a particularly horrific film. There are some shocks and surprises but nothing really jumpy, just a slow burn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it that separates a good film from a bad one? Certainly not budget (or lack of), not even acting talent. Not necessarily a cohesive story. Generally speaking, it is down to individual taste. With horror, gore and special effects can be added to the list of things that don't really matter ? it is, I suppose, a translation of convincing mood, of atmosphere, of fear. I say all this because 'The Witch' has received widespread acclaim, yet is almost the polar opposite of successful horror films of modern times.This concentrates on the ascension (or descension?) of young Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) into a witch. Beginning with the exile of a family of six (Shortly ? if briefly to become seven) to a farm beside a secluded forest. The head of the family William (Ralph Ineson) does his best to provide for them, but lacks skill as a hunter and is surrounded by mysteriously failing crops. Whilst in the care of Thomasin, the new baby vanishes ? her older brother Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw) also disappears only to return in a state of possession, and the two remaining youngest, Jonas and Mercy, display increasingly frightening behaviour. It seems an unexplained and tragic series of coincidences mars Thomasin, but as things transpire, events seem pre-ordained by the legendary Black Philip.As a glut of unexplained circumstances occur that disposes of her family, Thomasin wanders in a trance, into the forest where she comes across a haven of naked witches who, after completing a ritual of dance movement around a blazing fire, physically rise and ascend into the trees. Laughing, Thomasin joins them.The acting in this is extraordinary throughout, even from the youngest members of William's family. Occasionally, the olde-world dialogue spoken with thick, regional accents, is hard to make out. And we only see a witch once in close-up. A seductive, long-haired woman emerges from a cottage deep in the forest and appears to seduce young Caleb (there is also an incident where her coven break into the barn when Thomasin has been imprisoned by her father, and drink the blood of the animals, but this is shrouded in darkness).It has been suggested by a handful of reviewers that this could be a kind of loose prequel to 'The Blair Witch Project (1999)', which, if you forget the change in location, is an interesting possibility ? if you want it to be. Any connection is, I think, entirely unintentional.This is a leisurely-paced, stunningly shot psychological horror in which a family's worst fears actually become a distinct possibility. It won't please everyone, although it did well commercially and received well deserved critical acclaim.</fullReview>

It's extremely slow, but worth watching for the excellent and unique atmosphere the director managed to create. The language and locations help that too. No stupid jump scares in this one, just a good old classic horror. The plot is based on folklore tales and for me it was secondary to the enjoyment of the film - just put your brains in neutral, don't try to find any sense in was is happening and you'll enjoy it.The cinematography, although rather "static", was simply breathtaking. It reminded me of BARRY LYNDON (1975) and COME AND SEE (1985). I don't know what equipment and techniques they used, but the result is excellent.</fullReview>

I thought the characters' were pretty solid. It was interesting watching how the parents, whether they believed it or not, use religion as a herding factor for their family.The film does not necessarily focus on a witch really but more on the family sort of turning on each other. I want to describe it best as possible without revealing much but it is as that one description says. Disturbing and creepy. Oh and the ending kind of sucks and ruined it so if that's important to you, then be wary but if you can look past it the film itself is pretty good imo. Slow paced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails miserably</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the life of me I can't understand why they chose to market this movie as a horror movie. The tone in the trailer does not for one bit match the tone of the movie. No wonder a lot of people call this movie boring if they went in with high expectations after having seen the trailer.The rookie director makes one huge mistake after the first 15 minutes or so of the movie when he shows that the witch is indeed real. Had he not done so the witch might have worked as, say, an allegory of religious hysteria or coming of age. But no, the witch is real and there's no room left for ambiguity.But the major flaw of this movie is that it simply isn't scary, the one defining characteristic of a horror movie. The pacing is glacial. And a slow horror movie is fine if you're building to some payoff. But no, the movie sort of trundles along without any real excitement. When we do get nearer to the end there are two climactic moments that weren't scary, but funny, I assume unintentionally so. The main character's little brother has what seems like an epiphany on his death bed which was so over the top it almost felt campy. And when her two twin siblings freak out and accuse her of being a witch, forget how to pray, and fall to the floor, they had me laughing out loud. The movie is well made. The cinematography is excellent, the sound and music is good too. As is the acting. It's just a shame that it was not scary and fails miserably as a horror movie.</fullReview>

If I were to fix the films problems, then The Witch could have been a fantastic Horror film instead of being a let down that it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The mood of the film felt very real and true to the time period. The set dressing and wardrobe design was spot on. The choice of camera was perfect using an Arri Alexa Plus with minimal colour grading made for a perfect raw touch and gave the film gritty feel. I felt myself needing a shower afterwards...The eerie building score and the unnerving long wide takes made you feel like you were watching something you shouldn't be. There are parts of the movie that are violent, gory and quite sick as well as unsettling. If you're hoping to get a film like the Conjuring. You'll be disappointed. Don't be mistaken. This is not a monster movie. This is a movie about faith and a families struggle during one of the most depressing and hard times in American history.The protagonist; Thomasin played by Anya Taylor-Joy is the daughter of a farmer, the plot revolves around her as she and her family believe there is something in the woods causing their family's hardship. Things slowly collapse on her and the family as their morals and faith are tested. The one problem I had with the film was that Anya Taylor-Joy's character didn't have much depth and I didn't feel like they showed enough of her personality, and focused too much on what the other family members were doing. I felt because the family's life was so depressing and uneventful, I wasn't worried about what was going to happen to them. This made the events that unfold in the 3rd act less impacting. (Mild Spoiler Alert!!)The ending was predictable and I felt like they should have created some kind of psychological twist or plot change that could have made up for the monotone story line. It felt a lot like M. Night Shyamalans "The Village" but without the twist...Overall a good movie that could have been great..</fullReview>

The Witch is a very serious minded production and pays meticulous sense to detail from the sets, to wardrobe and to dialogue. It also has the right tone, psychology and atmosphere to deliver the creepiness and horror. The crumbling family dynamic is also a pivotal part of what makes this film relate able to audiences and have them encompassed in the story as well. Performances and direction are real strong and while The Witch may not suite all tastes, it is a solid and original horror story that delivers and one that I have grown fond of and truly appreciate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Making his directorial debut, Robert Eggers set out to create a horror film that evokes fear in the most bizarre and diabolical ways. The Witch does not resort to jump scares to put the "scary" in "scary movie". Instead, The Witch relies on a dark atmosphere, haunting imagery, the subject of religion and the consequences of sinning to pull emotions from the darkest depths of your soul. The Witch starts as a seventeenth century family is thrown from their homes, leaving no choice but to make homestead distant from all civilization. When their newborn baby vanishes, madness begins to pin the family against each other all while something lurks in the very woods surrounding them.This movie does just about everything right when it comes to a great horror film. Ominous visuals with very tense camera-work involving long shots and quick cuts helping the extremely unsettling aesthetic created. Impressive and convincing acting from all of the cast, especially all the children who actually out perform the adults involved. Mark Korven delivers a spectacularly chilling soundtrack which adds to the already eerie setting presented. The plot itself is like a scary tale you are told as a child around a campfire, and keeps you up that night leaving you thinking whether if something like this could really happen.The Witch is certainly a distinct movie that might introduce you to elements you have never seen before. When it comes to horror films, The Witch has definitely taken the cake for best of 2016 yet, and I don't really see any upcoming major threats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The VVitcth - Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate Morden day audience when it comes to horror.I saw "The VVitch'' back in early March and I thought it was decent, but I didn't understand what all the fuss was all about. Yeah, it looked nice and it had a chilling atmosphere but that's the only thing I got from it. Well, to be fair, I think I was the only one that I liked this movie compared to my friends and family, as they thought the movie was terrible. I liked the movie but I thought it was kind of slow, I was a bit confused at times and the movie didn't stick with me after it was done. If I was reviewing this back in March, I would probably give this movie a 3/5.But after re-watching the film, I actually liked it even more and there was a lot of things that I can't believe I missed on my first viewing. I don't know how to explain it, but I had this uncomfortable feeling from watching this that I never experience the first time. This is a horror movie that exceeds in film making, it's freaky score and it's gloomy atmosphere that really made this film a true horror.This is a great psychological horror film that can really get under the your skin. I started to notice little details that really made this movie freaking scary when you understand the meaning of it. This doesn't have any stupid jump scars that deflates tension or just any horror movie tropes that we've seen million times already, but that's nowhere to be seen in the ''The VVitch''.THANK GOODNESS!Oh and the cinematography is this movie is just flawless. I'm starting to notice a trend in indie horror movies today - With the shots being perfectly set up and the very little use of light that really adds to the atmosphere to this film.Thank you Robert Eggers for your brilliant direction and movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent period creepy as fruck story of a time when this stuff was believable done in a way to make you give it the time of day. All the characters are played impeccably and believably, as much as we know anything about the reality of the period, I totally believe it was exactly like this. The outside scenes seem all to be shot at dusk or dawn and have that disturbing non sunlight vibe to it, again completely intended I'm sure. Great to see a movie commit so solidly to an idea. No I don't believe in witches but for the duration of this movie they had me give it the benefit of the doubt. Now if you'll excuse me I have to have a restless few hours sleep before I get the benefit of sunlight to wash away the fear. Well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What went we out in this wilderness to find</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first viewing I really didn't know what to make of this movie. I thought perhaps that it was an attempt at an art house horror film. Some of the scenes made me think of the art of John Atkinson Grimshaw and others of Fuseli. Almost at times too disturbing to look at, and too disturbing to look away. The story is of some mad fairy tale, as if puritan America had be somehow correct in their witch-madness and crones haunted the woods in search of babies in which they might steal for their unholy rituals.I had to watch it again.The second time I realized that it was not really an attempt at an art house horror film, but rather beautiful in itself as a piece of art. It lacks compassion however and views the harshness of life as the horror itself as this family comes apart in the situation they find themselves. They really are good people, for their time at least, and they try to love each other as their fantasy of life-- where good conquers evil-- erodes over the course of a few weeks. A Stylized fairy tale with no clear moral, though exceptional photography and acting. My biggest criticism would be the black-outs that the director uses to change certain scenes. They are quite long. That is a pretty petty complaint and really not worthy of this beautiful, yet disturbing film that has long lingered in my thoughts well after the final credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Fear a Witch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The full title is, The Witch: A New England Folktale. Like Grimm's fairy tales, American folklore has taken revisions over the centuries to become a palatable collection of juvenile life lessons. Anyone who has read the original versions of these stories knows how brutal, horrifying, and far removed they are from our current values. As much as I would not condone reading original classic witch tales to a small child, they do contain much deeper implications and ideas than the simple "Don't tell lies" that are gleaned from modern revisions. What's fascinating about The Witch is how familiar the setting and story is, without a single cliché or moment of prediction to speak of. The evil that was feared in 17th Century Puritan America has been so eclipsed by the human horrors of The Salem Witch Trials, that we have forgotten what it was to fear a witch.We know these characters only by their Christian names. William removes his family from their Colonial settlement due to an incompatibility of faith. The colony of Puritans isn't Christian enough. With his wife, Katherine, William takes his 4 children into the wilds of the Northeast. Airs of The Crucible envelope the setting. Common pronouns are replaced with "thines" and "thous". Dialogue is delivered as if quoted from Shakespeare or the Bible itself. In the past, this oral dynamic has always sounded ardently rehearsed. Somehow, it's natural here. Considering William's rigorous faith, you might expect him to be an overbearingly shrewd father. He is in fact a loving and good man of his time; often a pushover. Katherine is the more fearsome parent, with a shrill voice and gaunt pointed face. While they do live in hardship, this is a good family. Once Fall deadens the colors and greys the skies, things begin to take a disturbing turn.Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie play the parents without an exaggeration of the material. Remarkable still are the actors portraying their children. Harvey Scrimshaw plays William's 10-year- old son, Caleb, as natural as can be imagined. The dramatic beats of a horror movie come with taxing climactic moments and Scrimshaw acts beyond his years. Anya Taylor-Joy plays the eldest daughter Thomasin; a doe-eyed blonde beauty who plays the most relatable character of the flock. The dynamic between Caleb and Thompsin has notes of innocent sexual tension. Their secluded life leaves a great deal of new feelings that can't be addressed due to their customs. These feelings lead to foreign temptations that are preyed upon by the timeless evil beyond the trees. The greatest achievement of this film is how faithful it is to its setting and story, while keeping enough behind the veil to become engrossing. The tale feels as old as any, drawing from universal fears and motivations. How it draws you in, keeping you tied to the victims and their perspective while keeping the evil at arm's length, shows a discipline of craft that greatly compliments the material. Much like vampires, witches have been trivialized and diluted by film into something superficially attractive and entertainingly evil. As with Noseferatu, seeing a witch living a damnable existence of ugliness is much more appropriate. If they're ever beautiful, they won't be for long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure(itanical) horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Witches have always been the source of myriad emotions - and that in this, our enlightened age, the 21st century. 'The Witch' (stylized as The VVitch) is more of a fable - almost a surreal catechism from the 17th century. It is not, of course, something that judders your bones and causes you to jump out of your seat. Rather, the atmosphere puts us back in the New England of the Puritans. Would you question God and if you do, well you have pledged your allegiance to the devil is the circumstance in which we find ourselves.Robert Eggers remarks that the film was made to be a Puritans nightmare, something directly out of the mind of a 17th century New England-er. And such a nightmare, given its time would have to be purely inherited. We are treated to how this nightmare is inherited as well, with a father-son sequence that isn't about bees and birds but more about how humans are born and bred in sin and redemption is a distant dream. Never are we allowed to distance ourselves from the fact that the family who's life we are deposited into do not exactly have a happy life of living off their produce. William, the head of the family,banished from the plantation where he lived and farmed with his then pregnant wife, sons and daughters builds a modest farm at the edge of the woods. The rest of the story is designed to be and works as a beautiful bed time horror story.Before we get to the actors, I would be remiss if I did not mention that Robert Eggers is first and foremost a production designer, someone who believes in and I quote 'if I got asked for dirty green curtains, I gave them the best dirty green curtains they'd get'. The proof of course is the clawing natural light photography, faithful production design, costumes and imagery. His sense of design extends and is shared by his team in researching New England Puritan history and most of the dialogue helps in the time travel we are subject to. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke and composer Mark Korven lend beautifully atmospheric imagery and background score so much so that at a certain point in the tension, silence has already etched a melody in our minds.The cast in the meanwhile almost seem as committed to the movie as the Vatican was to killing off women of wisdom in the middle ages. Ralph Ineson, Anya Taylor-Joy, Kate Dickie, Harvey Scrimshaw, Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson comprise the entire cast save a couple of supporting actors. Not only does keeping a small circle of actors the main cast pay off in terms of keeping us engrossed to their fate, it also shows us the darkness that descends on them. The actors are almost fiercely committed to the movie, mouthing their 'thou''s and 'thy''s with such casual conviction that we are sucked into the soul of their plight. Anya and Kate Dickie in particular, and it should come as no surprise, are brilliant in their characters.Without going into too many details, 'The VVitch' if it were necessary to be described in comparison would be in the same coven as 'The Shining'. Moody, atmospheric, generative and degenerative, the images flicker across the retinas like out of a crystal ball that has told you the future, murky and realistic at the same time. When a cold dreary sky is offset by a thick brownish grey wood, when the wind blows across a reinforced barn roof and howls down the chimney, when the rising full moon is blurred by the cast of a shadowy fear - 'The Witch' wins you over in the chills it sends down your spine. It is not to be missed - a classic concocted in genius fashion in the masterful hands of Robert Eggers, Jarin Blaschke and Mark Korven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers: This movie is f***ing fantastic. Ten seconds in and we've got an awesome premise: Puritan family banished to the woods, and they're not alone. That's right. There's a f***ing witch. This movie is slow burn in tone only. I was sitting on the edge of my seat at every moment. Right off the bat this movie assures you it's not pulling any punches. In a unsettling, subtle, brutal scene, the baby is kidnapped, and this is just about five minutes in. But does this movie leave it to your imagination what happened? F*** no. The witch killed that baby and crushed it up into mush *see title for my reaction*. From there we watch in terrified awe as the family is ripped apart (literally and metaphorically) from inside and out as it tries to defend itself from the forces of the devil. It's pulse pounding, fantastically shot, perfectly paced, and exquisitely acted. I would have said more, but I ran out of adequate descriptors. Regarding the reviews that say this movie isn't scary: as a horror movie veteran, I can't f***ing sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've tracked this movie for a long time. I had really high hopes for it and today I've finally watched it. Well, what can I say...it did not disappoint. I watched it at night with lights off while wearing headphones, and I was genuinely scared at times and I've found myself turning around checking what's behind me. Some good chills right there. I love the fact that there were almost no jump scares. Overall, this movie has almost none horror clichés and that's what makes it so good. At first I thought that this movie is going to be artsy and pretentious, but nope - you immediately get sucked into it's atmosphere. The dialogue and the performances really work towards building a solid authentic feel. Horror elements are mostly given through acting, giving it more of a psychological thriller feel. But the mystery is definitely out there. I don't want to go into spoilers, so I'll just sum it up: it's a low budget gem and it's damn good for what it is. It's simple but intriguing, slow but captivating, and it will most likely leave you stunned for quite some time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first ever review on IMDb. I watch movies most evenings with horror being the genre of choice. After missing this film at the cinema i was really looking forward to seeing this film at home. Having watched the trailer and read the customer reviews i really had high expectations. Sadly, the film was a complete let down.Where do i start? Well the acting was terrible, i just couldn't feel anything for the characters. The dialogue was hard to follow and understand? Or was that just me? The picture quality was poor, i shelled out over ?4 for the HD rental. Now i understand the basic idea of the film. Family banished out of community to live near the forest where a witch lives. Child gets taken by witch...... As i said, i love a good horror film, particularly a good supernatural or psychological horror. But this film bored me!! Nothing happened!! I was fidgeting in my comfortable armchair. Still nothing happened!! Either i totally misunderstood the whole film and completely misunderstood the reviews? Maybe i need to watch it again? Not a chance!!On to the next film i guess</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film might not be for everyone, but if you can get past the weird accents (which I have to think the filmmakers put an awful lot of time into developing) the Witch works. My suggestion is not to watch this as a traditional horror film in the sense of scary spooks jumping out, but as a case study into societal norms of Puritan womanhood in an increasingly modern world. Yes, the Witch has a feminist resonance to it. I even think the use of two V's in the title instead of a W allude to this. If you're not sure to what I'm referring, I suggest reading up on the goddess Venus and her connotations.In this light, the Witch makes a lot more sense and deserves all 4 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The VVitch, not the witch project.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand why people don't like this movie. If you don't get it, go watch horror movies that don't involve Hollywood themes. Many independent and foreign films offer aspects of an open mind, which can lead you in the right direction. If you're looking for the next Blair Witch Project, then look elsewhere.This film can hold a candle to the greatest, not like Braveheart or the Gladiator, but more like the Piano. It takes an understanding of the time period and classic witchcraft to follow this epic film. That being said, this movie was spectacular, it has a feel of what could or would have happened. It's not some cheesy jump scare or gory Hollywood slasher, it is a true art form horror. This movie had me on the edge from the beginning. I've watched a lot of artistic horror films and this one is a real masterpiece. I am honored to know that films like this are still being made. I would have added more nudity and gore, but it holds its own and doesn't really need my suggestion. When I thought it was over, they stacked more, and that little bit was even better. All of the parts played were riveting especially Anya Taylor-Joy; which left me breathless and begging for a longer run. Wonderful work! I absolutely loved this film, please make more like this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Decent movie. I would recommend watching it with subtitles and headphones though because the screeching violin and howling gospel turned me off so bad. It gets really loud and annoying in one scene, and then the next they're mumbling in old English. I was watching this in the middle of the night, because that's how I roll when I wanna watch "horror" or "suspense thriller" films. Big freaking mistake. I had to spend most of the movie turning the volume down when the screeching score was too loud and the turn it up when they starting talking again. Ruined the whole experience, and at some point I couldn't stop laughing because it was so ridiculous. I know its supposed to build up tension and suspense, but the howling ladies just got awkward after a while. The film itself was beautifully shot, but overall it was about 20-30 minutes of the movie that was actually worth my time. I like a few scenes, but most of it was either ruined by mumbling actors or howling gospel. My favorite scene was probably the black goat, because I kept remembering funny moments from playing Goat Simulator. 6/10 - because of the Lucifer scene and naked humping ladies singing ooga booga in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Witch" is a movie that starts with promise but ends up a chore to sit through. With each development of the plot it doesn't feel like you are in the hands of somebody who knows what they're doing, who's leading you from one twist or surprise to another. In fact, nothing in the movie is really surprising, or shocking, and it's not in the least scary.The filmmaker went to a lot of trouble to get the actors speaking and sounding right, and looking right. But aside from that, it's a frustrating experience, because nothing really comes of anything. You expect something but don't really get anything.There is one scene I didn't like, that made me feel for the actor involved. A young boy is made to appear naked in front of an older girl. If you are a pedophile, don't get excited: you can't really see anything, but don't you wonder about how they filmed such a thing? How did the boy feel about being made to do that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Witch (8/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch is set in New England during the early European settlement period of America in the 1600's. The dialogue of the film was too written well considering the dialect people spoke back then. At one point the English subtitles had to be turned on just to properly follow some of the things the characters were saying. The characters with the tough script really pulled off this horror film with high emotions and uncertainty of faith, something obviously very important to people back then. The atmosphere of the film was very hopeless right from the get-go creating uneasiness and a somber mood. The film steadily gets better and more disturbing, leaving the viewer mystified to many different aspects of the story-line. The Witch is very much a psychological horror building up to the climax, which had a fantastic pay-off. The ending is very chilling with a couple memorable scenes and bits of dialogue. The Witch, in my opinion, is a highly recommended film and it's also shown by many positive reviews surrounding it.</fullReview>

Between the Older English dialogue and the inconsistent volume of the actors' voices it was difficult to understand what was being said, if at all.

This feels like a movie that should have around a 4.5 rating.I don't mind that the movie was slow paced but you have to make the slow pace count with an occasional creepy scene, something that makes the audience uncomfortable or something.I give it a 3 out of 10 and feel like they should have rated this PG-13 as it is only barely R and there is absolutely nothing even slightly scary.

		<shortDescription>Unnerving supernatural thriller with something more clever in mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the past several decades, horror fans have grown fond of horror classics such as slashers, psychological thrillers, and supernatural thrillers dealing with characters batting against paranormal entities. Only a hand of full films of the genre are successful at balancing both cohesive character and plot development while carrying on an effective scare factor, even fewer achieve this feat as effective as this thriller directed by first-time filmmaker Robert Eggers. Rather than driving audiences into to straight-forward scare fest, this film centering on witchcraft as the primary antagonist, focuses on the eerie atmosphere and construction of the plot leading up to its shocking twist in the finale. The film is set during the 1630s, decades prior to the Salem Witch Trials, a period of prosecutions and executions of men and women who were accused of witchcraft. It follows William (played by Ralph Ineson) and Catherine (played by Kate Dickle), a devout Christian couple living in a isolated countryside of New England who value leading their five children into their following with God. When their infant son Samuel mysteriously vanishes and the crops began to deteriorate, the family begins to suspect one of them is cursed with witchcraft. As their fears and suspicions mount, the family find their lives terrorized by the demonic force.This film is not the horror thriller many people come to expect, and instead has something more unique in mind rather than blowing up in your face with jump scares and sight scares that's become a common tool in many other films of this category. Relying heavily on visceral storytelling and character development, the film conveys it's scares by building up suspense through hints without feeling the need to fully reveal the occurrences but the aftermath of how the family is affected by witchcraft. When it's all done, the most of the scares come not from what the viewers know but what they don't know, along with an eerie, hair-raising music score by Mark Korven and a few shots of grim imagery. For most of the time, it's quite effective. Now the film moves at a fairly slow pace which is enough to bore those who lack patience, but in the end what results is creepy and intensely thought- provoking experience filled with engrossing performances by Ralph Enison, Kate Dickie, and Anya Taylor-Joy who plays the eldest daughter. Even the younger children make advantage of their time to shine. As Christianity and witchcraft play prominent roles in the story, the film moves in profound directions that demands you for questions. The biggest mistake this film makes is assuming you have expert knowledge on witchcraft. Though the film succeeds on provoking thoughts in viewers, it occasionally falls victim into convoluted elements raft are either confusing or overly ambiguous, maybe both. There are plenty of scenes you leave scratching heads. At the same time, there is plenty of shock and creepiness, particularly the ending. The Witch is both a creepy and deeply visceral experience uprooted by an intelligent direction by Robert Eggers. Though it has some flaws, this film works at a fairly solid level and by the next decade, has a fair potential of going down as a cult classic. It is a unique experience that values more thought-provoking themes than typical jump scares, and by the end, it's a thriller that demands for your attention, even if it doesn't attract those looking for a straight forward scare fest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very grim and unsettling horror flick...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this one in the theater a few months ago and, while VERY impressed, was just too damn busy at the time to muster up a review for it so I figured I'd give it another watch upon a good ol' home media release before I added in my two cents. Lately, here and there, some very decent horror flicks seem to have been slipping through the Marvel-saturated Hollywood sewer system of wider theatrical releases and I gotta say, I really f*cking loved "The Witch"! Maybe a demand is growing. Hell, I'm game. Give me a reason to go to the theater and I'll f*cking bite.So, we're back in New England, circa 1630, where a family is banished from their plantation for their kooky, ultra religious bullsh*t and are carted out into the woods to start anew, ensconced in gloomy, righteous solitude. Right off the bat, their baby is swiped by an evil forest-dwelling hag and more run-ins with sinister presences ensue - showing that the family's devout, god-fearing lifestyle is no match for one of the evilest f*cking goats and rabbits you'll ever see...Make no mistake about it, "The Witch" is pretty slow and for the most part might as well be in another language, given the thick dialect taken straight from legit sources (diaries, letters, etc...), so if you're a stickler for knowing precisely what's being said at all times in a movie you'll want to have your English subs on. Frankly, I didn't really see it as being too crucial to the comprehension of the story since a good portion of the dialog seems to be just quoting scripture while the rest is intelligible enough, I'd say. The authentic period vernacular is the icing on the cake, however, of what makes "The Witch" a very unsettling flick. Bleak tones and eerie, evil moodiness on top of infanticide, devil goats, apple regurgitation, pedophilic witches and zero hackneyed jump scares! This movie is full of uncomfortable sh*t. The acting is phenomenal across the board. Remembering and reciting all of the f*cking "doth hath's" and "hither's" while actually putting forth an intensive performance is f*cking grandiose, if you ask me. All believable performances that really 'strike' you if you're like me and are disturbed by deeply religious jargon - most notably, when a dying child is 'ascended into Christ's loving embrace'... Yeesh. If you're hankering for something creepy and a bit f*cked up that won't insult your intelligence with clichés, check out "The Witch"! I look forward to director Robert Eggers' take on "Nosferatu".More horror reviews @ http://swinesewage.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What It Lacks in Originality is Made Up for in Tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One needs only look over my ratings and reviews to see that I watch a lot of horror, from classics to modern, from the lowest budget indies to Hollywood mainstream, I'm always on the quest for a great horror experience. It's interesting to me when Hollywood releases what is, truly, a great horror film and the responses to it. The "general public" will gush about how scary the movie is, but these same people enjoy garbage films like THE PURGE. On the other hand, the horror hipsters will go out of their way to bash it just because it's popular. Yet these same people will rally around bland, uninspired movies like STARRY EYES just because every other horror hipster said it was great.I believe that I try my very best to judge movies on their own merits, no matter what the budget or hype going into it. That can be hard, of course, because expectation alters perception. In THE WITCH, I firmly believe that Hollywood has released a horror film that may not be a "classic", but is just as thoughtful and intelligent as anything indie horror is doing right now. The horror in this movie works on so many levels, yet one would be hard pressed to point to many "scary scenes". Indeed, many of the complaints I have seen are the typical "not scary" nonsense that haunt any intelligent horror film. Yes, there are no jump scares, not really any terrifying monsters, no gore and few creep out scenes, yet the tension is palpable and I found myself hanging on the edge of my seat. I am not going to throw out the "slow burn" phase because I don't really think this qualifies, but indeed it is a movie about the simmering tension of fears and terror, rather than outright hitting you with any fright.On one level this is a film about the terrors of oppressive religion. The family is outcast by their Puritan society at the beginning and left to flounder in the wilderness because of religious belief. Indeed, the family's daily life is a litany of catechism and prayer. As many a film has explored before this, when the stuff hits the fan, this religion becomes the very thing that makes it so easy to tear them apart. What begins as childless implications of witchcraft become quite real accusations. A family that spends every minute of every day together is found to believe that perhaps their children could be witches, an idea with no logical sense but believable to those terrified of the devil and touch of sin. Indeed, I found myself saying to my wife about halfway through this movie that their religion was far scarier to me than any witch.On another level, we have a terror of a decaying family, another subject mined often in horror, but well done here. Left to band together after being outcast by their society, the family quickly falls apart after losing their infant youngest. The loss of that child begins to unravel this family. The mom falls apart, the father starts hiding things from her, the children turn on each other, the mom starts to despise her daughter for her part in the child's loss. This family that began as such a tight unit are suddenly their own worst enemies, which of course makes it easy for them to become ripe for the witch's picking.We, also, get a heavy dose of the occult terror. Yes, there really is a witch, though only seen in a few scenes. I liked that she felt like a modern Baba Yaga, a real witch of the woods out of some Grimm fairy tale. Then, there's Black Phillip, a goat who may or may not be the living impersonation of the devil. All of the satanic goings on culminate in a great finale that feels at home alongside Rob Zombie's LORDS OF SALEM.Another terror seen here is creepy children, using the young twins as unsettling little monsters. At first they are merely annoying, then that lingering creepiness settles in with their possibly evil little nursery rhymes. Much like the real Salem witch trials, it is these children who ultimately start throwing out the accusations that destroy so many lives. It is rare that a first time director is capable of making so many things work so well, all at one time, all while creating a film that is stark and sublime in it's evil beauty as well. What's keeping this from being a higher rating, for me personally, is that so much of this felt done before. That's to be somewhat expected in the horror genre where just about everything has been done before, but in this case it all felt familiar quite often. There are elements of THE CRUCIBLE, THE SHINING, THE INNOCENTS, and other horror classics. At no time does this feel like a re-tread of anything, but it also didn't feel like I was watching some ground- breaking original either. That makes it all the more impressive for me that Eggers was able to make such a haunting film that will stick with you for awhile.I'll leave with one more comment about the language, which is spot on for the era, in syntax, lexicon and accent. We are listening to people from the 1600s speak to each other. That seems to bother a lot of people in reviews and message boards. I would guess that these people never read Shakespeare, Marlowe or Hawthorne, or any other classic literature. I'm not going to stand on my intellectual soapbox and call people stupid for not being able to understand it. I do get that a viewer who is being challenged by the language is not able to be impacted as much by the story, but I also think that it is a good thing that our art is still able to reflect our history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religious Madness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally was able to catch this film On-Demand last evening. Since it did not play in my town--as most types of these films NEVER do--I waited patiently for its availability. "The Witch" is a tale set in New England around 1630. A Puritan family has been banished from their local town because it seems the father was teaching religion that was in direct conflict with what was widely believed in this area. The family ventures out into the wilderness to restart their lives. Little do they know of the horror that waits.I have read many other IMDb reviews and I can see how this film can be loved AND how it can be hated. Several scenes seemed incomplete. There are incidences that just do not make sense, i.e. the abduction of the baby by the Witch. Why did they not search for the child? Who was the Witch? Did she really exist? It is only until much later in the film that (I think) someone references the baby was taken by a wolf. I am still puzzled over the final scene, which I will not reveal.I thought the acting was superb; however, I will say (again) that when you do a period piece with heavy British brogue, I just wish closed captioning was available. I had so much trouble understanding what was being said that it actually took my attention away from what was happening on screen. Anya Taylor-Joy is remarkable in her portrayal of the oldest daughter, Thomasin. Ralph Ineson plays the father, William very effectively, while Kate Dickie (who plays the mother, Katherine) proves she can wail with the best of them. The music and cinematography were both exceptional. Director Robert Eggers seems to know his way about the camera!While this movie was billed as "horror," to me it is simply a tale about what religion and all its trappings can do to even the strongest of minds. There is some real tension here, and it was very refreshing to see a horror movie that was actually character driven.Rated "R" for violence and nudity--and NONE of it graphic--"The Witch" is definitely a cut above most movies of its kind. However, I will caution any potential viewer to be aware of the pace and the accents. The movie is a little slow, and I've already stated what I felt about the heavy British brogues. Still, I would recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Typically, I struggle to watch human television picture shows, as the flicker rate, though imperceptible to humans, is not properly synchronized for dog eyes, and makes for a choppy picture. Anyway, I made an exception for this film. There were people, rabbits, horses, other dogs, goats, and many sounds. I liked watching the dog. I found the dialogue difficult to follow, not just because my comprehension of spoken English is limited to about 12 words, nor the archaic mode of the language used was hard to interpret, but because I think the audio was mixed poorly or whatever. Look, I'm a dog, and a mongrel at that. I have no idea about this sort of thing, but the voice tracks or what have you should not be tinny and muffled. The one goat gores the one man towards the end, after a bird eats a part of the one lady. The dog dies maybe? The little babbling humans vanish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is an OK horror movie with some gems and some apparent flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this movie after reading some terrific reviews and praises that it received. In the past, I have enjoyed slow-burn horror movies such as "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Anti-Christ" tremendously, and "The Witch" appears to be in the same league. However, after watching this movie several times, I cannot help but feel like it leaves much to be desired. Overall, is it a terrific movie? I do not think so. It is enjoyable but not that great. I really wanted to like this movie but I simply cannot. Allow me to explain myself (mild spoilers ahead so please continue at your own risk).First of all, let me discuss the PROS. + The female lead Thomasin is the brightest gem of the movie. The actress did a fantastic job portraying a na?ve, pure, struggling yet strong and loving teenage daughter. I could not help but feel pity and sympathetic for her and the situations that she was pulled into. In my opinion, any actress that can provoke such a feeling from the audience deserves praise. + The twins Jonas and Mercy are also well-acted. They did exactly what they were supposed to do: be an annoying and hellish pair. I felt very uneasy whenever they delivered their lines or sang their Satanic songs. They create some pretty strong hatred in me right off the bat. Again, in my opinion, this is terrific because it shows that the actors know what they are doing by invoking the right emotion response from the audience. Now, I will discuss the CONS. + The choice of speech: this movie suffers from poor choice of speech/dialects. The director chooses to use Old English in this movie to give it a more realistic feel. I think this is fine in itself. However, I feel like this choice has backfired. And the actors' talking manner does not help either. They sound incoherent and some of their conversations just do not flow well. More on this later. A lot of the dialogues are very hard to understand. I had to turn on the subtitles and I still had problems following some of what they are trying to say. First, I thought maybe the problem was because I was not a native speaker but then, I found out that even native speakers had trouble understanding the speech in this movie.+ The mother: this character, in my opinion, is a failed attempt and really impaired the experience. Early on, the audience know that she is in pain due to the mysterious disappearance of her infant child. The audience are supposed to feel sorry for her and sympathize with her behaviors. However, I doubt anyone could pity her because she had very little character- development. All she does in this movie is be unreasonable, grieve, and complain in a high-pitched voice. Her speech is also incoherent because she 1) speaks too fast, 2) jumps from one point to another without using any conjunction, and 3) ends her sentences abruptly. I find her voice and character to be increasingly irritating upon repeated viewings. + The pace: for a horror movie, this movie lacks scare scenes. While I do appreciate how the director took time to deliver some good unnerving scenes, this movie is too slow and fails to keep the audience anticipated. It has almost no scary moments until the very end. And even then, the scenes are not that scary except for one or two of them (the crow being the best scene of the entire movie, in my opinion). I firmly believe that a few more scary moments and a less slow pace would help the movie tremendously. In summary, this movie is decent. It is in no way a mindless average horror movie, but it is not that great either. I give it a 6/10. PS: Sorry for any bad English in my review.</fullReview>

I can't believe that people living this kind of existence would have fallen victim to such nonsense. Why the children only? Why just this family? Why and how would some "witch" be living in the middle of no where all by herself? All this is just a bit too convenient. If every evil sibling thought became such a reality, imagine what would happen in the world. The acting is pretty good. The filming is first rate. The backdrop is also very compelling. But believing all this nonsense is just not in the cards for people who have to live so close to the land. Honestly, I couldn't watch it to the end. Just too much convenience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not really a cult film but more about the horrors of religion than the horror of witches or devils. The film feels artsy and tried to put to much into one movie with little to no explanation. At the end you are left with multiple explanations to the same story and that makes the whole thing just confusing.The story starts of with a family getting banished from a town and in hindsight this scene was to short and should have made a better build up from where they were coming from. Arriving at the place they were banished to the baby disappears and that point in the movie kept me puzzling the whole movie thru. In my mind that was just to impossible to phantom and made me think this must be a dream or hallucination or something.I got more of these feelings throughout the film but a lot of other elements in this film were handled pretty well. The actors all performed well in difficult roles to play, especially with having to adapt to the time period.Also the production value was high and the director was dedicated to tell his story in his way.This movie gets better if you know some of the back story which unfortunately isn't in this movie.I still think its a movie you should see but it counts a lot on interpretation from your side.If this would have been less in the movie I think it would be a better watch for a broader audience.The movie is filled with a lot of tension and the dark tones of the movie often intensifies that,they took a bold approach and I like that,also,the goat was really scary.The actress playing the oldest daughter was good and I'm curious to see in which movie she will be next and also the next project of the director.Recommend it, but under the terms I mentioned before.Your choice.</fullReview>

This movie had no plot, unintelligible dialogue delivery spoken in 'ye old English',had sporadic inclusion of people praying while screaming and finally ended on a note where the director decided to blame a black goat for everything.Yes, turning a farm animal into Lucifer in the last 10 minutes of the movie and pinning every odd and ridiculous scene onto the sudden existence of Satan in a tiny house outside of New England was the only way the director had to end this insanely slow paced movie.( At one point had to forward a scene for 5 minutes and yet nothing happened or changed ) I would suggest that you avoid this movie at all costs or recommend it to someone you truly despise.

The trailer was misguiding, making you feel as if it would be a suspenseful and horrific mix of witch craft, fear and panic. It was nothing of the sort. For those who think it's a great take on America's historical dark magic period and depiction of terror and religious unraveling, that is all a farce. This movie is really not deep enough to be confused for 'art' or cinematic genius. It was deplorable - stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailer makes this film out to be scarier than it actually is. There are hardly any jump-scare moments, the "climax" of the film, is actually very anti-climactic in my opinion, and... not to spoil too much, but the movie is more about how the presence of the witch tears a family apart, rather than the actual witch itself.In New England, a family is cast out from their plantation community for being too "prideful" - it is unclear what exactly their crime is, but it's something along the lines of they are being too devout for their own good. And you can see it as the film develops, the family is extremely Christian... and unfortunately, it is out there, in the woods, that bad things start to happen to them, nothing that even their prayers can save them from. The entire dialogue is in an older form of English (I believe this was set sometime in the 16th century?), which some may find hard to understand. I certainly did at times, but it's very interesting and adds to the "creepiness" of the film, and if you're a history buff, adds a little grain of authenticity to the tale. However, as a horror movie, it doesn't deliver as how it's marketed to be. Maybe this could pass as a historical drama, or a thriller, but at the same time not really. There were a few moments of great acting, and other moments that were just plain laughable. Overall, this movie was kind of creepy, but was certainly not scary. The plot was anti-climactic and the trailer hyped it up way more than it deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautiful cinematography and solid actors in a convincing period setting that ultimately largely fails to deliver on the goods, being neither a true psychological nor graphic horror film. Rather, I would characterize it as a Gothic Horror and if that's your bag, you'll enjoy it. The premise seems promising but the story is built around a few scattered supposedly eerie scenes that compose a rather fragmented attempt at a haunting tale involving a family that somehow gets mixed up with Satan AND a witch that resides in a Hansel &amp; Gretel like hovel. As usual in Hollywood, the witch in the woods ( title character? ) is pretty hot with ample cleavage draped in a crimson velvet cape drawing stark contrast to the dour emaciated matriarch of the family who kills most of her day sobbing . " Hey there Little Red Riding Hood, you sure are looking good " ... at any rate, the devil, sporting a buccaneer outfit, sends the lead character of teen-aged Thomasina ( title character ? ), upon signing a devilish compact, into the forest to cavort with other nude nubile wenches in some sort of initiation into witch world where our story ends ... or does it, see Witch II for further adventures. This is a visually compelling presentation heavy with atmosphere that lacks substantive support, hardly a classic of the genre . The broadly favorable critical and popular reception is perhaps indicative of how starved we are for truly satisfying horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really great horror films doesn't come around too often. I read a little about The Witch for about a year ago and was immediately interested in the story. It seemed so simple and disturbing, a British family in the 17th century that has traveled to America in hope of finding happiness and success. Not agreeing with the local church, they leave the village they've been living in, to move out to the country and build their own house. Once they are settled in, strange things begin to happen and it seems that someone in the family is more than a human being. Relatively unknown actors and a feature film debut for director Robert Eggers.Witches on film have been portrayed before, like The Blair Witch Project. It is something disturbing and brutal about witches, especially if you think about our own history here in Sweden where we for a long time burned women believed to be witches. The Witch is a drama horror film that doesn't rush its introduction. A lot of the story is created from the mood and the music. Instead of telling the story and explaining things through dialogue, Eggers lets the music and the cinematography speak for themselves. Sometimes the camera sweeps around the forest with creepy music playing in the background. Also religion plays a big part in the film. God and the belief in him, is always there and gets even worse when the family thinks they've been cursed. To make it even more realistic and believable, the dialogue is written in old English taken directly from old real writings from the same time. That is if we are to believe the credits.Witches on film have been portrayed before, like The Blair Witch Project.

		<fullReview>Before watching this movie I happened to watch "Rosemary's Baby" and I found it to be the perfect horror movie. Not the cheap jump scary type but the type that will make you writhe inside and haunt your dreams. THIS was that type of a movie. There were no cheapness in the movie. The movie knew what it was and if you like jump-scares and gore. Avoid this or make up your mindset to watch this.After all that, you might be wondering why the 7 star rating, because I didn't enjoy it entirely. I am not saying it is not good but probably, I wanted more. Let's discuss pros and cons, keep in mind, it is from my personal view-point.PROS- Acting wise, Anya was on point. She was very believable as the helpless girl in a strange time. Ralph Ineson, I loved his voice. I loved how he played a father with flaws. Dickie as the weeping mother with high superstitions and always irritated with Thomasin was nice. The cinematography was awesome. It completely captured the darkness of a time fueled by superstitions. I will give kudos to the director for choosing to make a horror film which is extremely difficult considering how horror movies are made nowadays.CONS- The child actors playing Caleb and the twins didn't have the acting to pull off their characters. Probably they should have been given lesser screen time. I wanted more of the witch or at-least a back story as to how the lore of the witch had started. Not an origin story but a 15-minute intro couldn't have hurt. The goat totally put me off. I tried to be serious when I saw the goat but I accept it. Goats are my weakness.All in all. It is a fresh inclusion to the horror genre and other horror movie directors can take notes from it. If you want to watch this movie, trust me, watch it alone. You will enjoy it. DON'T eat anything before or while watching it. You may have urges to puke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a horror movie without much substance or much tension really. What makes it stand out though is the atmosphere and the cinematography. How it just doesn't try to go into that generic Hollywood horror flick genre direction. However this needed to take the rawness to another level. Because it felt like the director was holding back in certain areas and lacked the gut-wrenching moments that it needed. The trailer made this movie seem more terrifying than it really is. I think going in a more art-house direction with more surreal elements would have really benefited this film. It's like the director had one foot in and one foot out when it came to making a genuinely raw film. This movie tries to give the audience an illusion of suspense and tension. Despite there being few haunting imagery, when it comes to this movie as a whole it comes off lacking when it comes to making it a engraving experience. Overall, it had potential to be a really haunting and visceral experience but faltered. Instead it just came off as a bleak and nihilistic movie.3.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly this movie was so terrible it's hard to describe. I am a horror nut, I love horror movies of all kinds from old creature features to modern scifi alien movies. But, in order to love them, they have to be in some way.. actually.. good. This movie did not deliver on it's high promises of "outstanding acting" and it certainly did not live up to it's hype of being "the best horror movie in years" or "a cinematic masterpiece". Frankly the thing that kept me from walking out of the theater on this one was the fact that I literally fell asleep. I have never fallen asleep during a movie before, it was a terrible experience. For a moment I thought, maybe I missed some good stuff, but with the reassurance of my friends who watched the movie while i passed out from boredom, I worried a little less about what amazing cinematic marvels i may have missed. Now, I didn't want to go solely on my friend's feelings, perhaps we were the only ones in the theater who disliked it. Well, that too was proved to be.. an incredible experience. With the last... Terrible. Shot of the movie, which was made to be dramatic and horrifying, half of the audience erupted in laughter while the other half, such as myself, sat in awe of what i was watching, in complete disbelief that someone wrote that down in a script and other people went "this is good." When the movie switched to credits, the room was taken over by a universally spoken "okay then." as people got up to leave. People literally said "okay then." in an un-amused, annoyed, and utterly disappointed manner.This is without a doubt one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. It wasn't in the least bit entertaining, which is really the worst thing a movie can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not horrific or mysterious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A truly dull film that pretentious people will try to make out it's something special, it's not. Slow, uninspiring with no mystery or horror. Be prepared for a drawn out talky film that offers very little, with an ending that's just out of sink with the film. The action builds so slowly that there is no growing or unsettling fear you feel bored, it never seems real at all until and doesn't get you by the throat. A poor first effort by the director/writer. Ultimately it is an overrated bore that suffers from the same flaws as other similar horror films: we've seen all of this already. Only for people who like dull drivel, this is an afront to The Shining and in no way similar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the films where the trailer is rather better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to say much about this film beyond that the trailer misrepresented it. We were expecting a scary movie. It isn't. At all. For that dishonesty, it really deserves one out of ten.But, as a period piece and a reasonably well done depiction of an isolated family falling victim to their silly superstitions, it is a better prospect altogether.I don't understand why people didn't understand the dialogue - unless they aren't native English speakers. It was simple stuff, a tad King James Bible-ish, and no-doubt fairly authentic for the period in which the film is set.Oh, before I forget. Letting the screen go blank, for several seconds, every few minutes is a trick which went out of fashion in the 1920s. It doesn't achieve anything nowadays.I read a comment which said that people who mark this film down obviously don't know anything about the horror genre. I suggest, instead, that the people who know nothing of the horror genre are those who made the film.Perhaps three from ten is overly generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat tense at times, but not truly horrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was not the best in this genre or style. It was not slasher-graphic, so if that's what draws you, skip this one. It was tense without being really frightening. I feel that the movie tried to build terror and suspense, but I watched this around 8am after a good nights sleep and had to back up a couple times because I dozed off. It seems to want to be a more sophisticated horror flick, but did not provide enough chills for my taste. The imagery was also dark at times...which can be pretty spooky if the action and characters are detailed enough for you to still see what's going on. Lastly, I found the language (pilgrim-speak?) more difficult to follow than say...Shakespeare or Homer. Keep your subtitles on and pay close attention!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for a laugh and little else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always kind of hilarious when they try to do a movie making witches out to be monsters. They tend to be either ridiculous slasher pieces or goofy fantasies of people who, either way, don't understand that witches do exist and they're victims of a lot of massive and extremely unfair persecution.And here we come to this movie, which tries a different take by presenting a period piece of a Puritan family, beset upon by what we are to believe is a witch. Oh dearie me, how hilarious this is from the get-go. We've got all the stereotypes here, and it's pretty embarrassing. But the most embarrassing part is the fact that the script is incoherently-composed, and the acting is either dialed up to 11 or sleepwalking.It is nothing short of amazing, and definitely worthy of praise, that the cast could even deliver the ponderous, dense lines as well as they did, though. Especially given that the direction was not particularly great, with extremely questionable choices on photography, blocking, and focus.But what really ended up the most questionable of all was: what was this film trying to say exactly? Who was this film even for? I find it hard to imagine that anyone would actually enjoy it except as a goof in October, when they're in the mood for a "scary movie", but not too close to Halloween because it's just not good enough for a special occasion. It's not even really scary, it's just something to watch because it's supposed to be in that genre.None of the family is remotely sympathetic or likable. They all come off as idiots or phoning it in, until the time comes for their Oscar bid, at which point they turn it up to a ridiculous level of ham. They also do incredibly stupid things, like stacking a precariously steep, narrow wall of firewood, ignoring giant animals that realistically they would know are dangerous and should be handled carefully, and naturally -- as with all films of this type -- turning on each other at the slightest hint of danger or threat. Because nothing helps people survive being set upon by supernatural threats by attacking...each other...instead of trying to come together to meet the danger or running away.So I'm not exactly sure what movie some of these crazy praise-filled gushers are on about, but it wasn't The Witch. It's so incoherent, you can't even really be sure if you should be offended at the stupid and clunky misappropriation of the titular term. Who knows what was going through the mind of the writer-director?I will be kind and say that this might have worked much better as a short film, perhaps half an hour at most. At the very least, the feature-length film is not as self-indulgently long as some I've seen (at about 90 minutes), so even if you're as unimpressed as I was, it doesn't overstay its welcome as horribly as some of its type.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to start? I'm actually struggling to find the words to describe how dire this film truly is. I'm still not sure if it was just boring or actually annoying.Certainly the soundtrack was annoying, with inappropriately placed orchestral stabs, random mumblings etcThe audio was terrible too. The dialogue was so incomprehensible I actually turned the subtitles on.The pace was catatonic. The lighting and colour were all over the shop, with long (seemingly endless) silences and lengthy fades to black for no apparent reason whatsoever.And now it's all over I still couldn't describe the plot - I'm not even sure there actually was a witch in the movie, or just a bunch of hysterical, hallucinating people in a remote cabin.Absolutely the worst film I've seen so far this year. But hey, I suffered through it so you don't have to. I'm sure there are hundreds of better uses for an hour and a half of your life. Maybe clean the oven or defrost your freezer. It will be a better use of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well made horror gem marred by its horrible message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first time I ever gave a well made movie a vote of 2 due to its horrible message about faith, family and for its satanic undertone.One point is given for its well-researched, written, directed and acted film. The production value and cinematography are excellent for an indie movie. I applaud the director's effort to stay true to his vision, and perhaps somewhere in there, was a genuine attempt to create a contemporary horror inspired by 'folk tales, fairy tales and true accounts of witch craft' as stated by the pre-credit scene. The director himself has said he wanted to create a horror tale that befitted his home in New England.The second point is given for the cast's amazing acting, especially Anya Taylor-Joy. She was a revelation to behold, captivating and hypnotizing just like Natalie Portman was in Leon The Professional.The movie felt like what it would be like if 'The Blair Witch Project' had been directed by Terrence Malick. However, unlike Malick's overarching theme of enlightenment or spiritualism via Nature and its ties with humanity, Egger's The Witch feels like the Bizarro of Superman. The Witch is like an evil doppelganger of Malick's movies, where faith, family unity and nature itself are constantly doubted, inherently flawed and imbued with the propensity towards Evil. SPOILERS The animals, forest and weather in the movie are means by which the Devil himself tears the family apart.The witch craft and hex scenes are truly disturbing and the overall tone of the movie made me feel sick. And I grew up watching horror movies for over three decades.At the end when all the children are dead, the parents murdered and the baby boy slaughtered, we found the surviving daughter, Thomasin, actually converted to wicca and joined the coven. The very coven, whose member has attacked, abducted, molested and murdered her family. Some critics said the movie was about feminism and its fight against patriarchy. But when The Satanic Temple praised its message about women liberation and satanic spirituality, is that actually a positive message? Would you equate feminism = satanic worship? Is Wicca = Satanism?There are some horrific scenes in the movies that are disturbing on a visual, aural and intrinsic levels.The ending also finds our young protagonist joining the coven, flying towards the moon naked and filled with ecstasy. All of these after signing her name on the book of the damned as she was tempted by Black Phillip. It was also revealed that the production house of the movie, A24, collaborated with The Satanic Temple in Detroit to promote the movie by setting up advance screening. The production house might have thought this was a smart marketing strategy to promote the movie. The director, Robert Eggers, might have not intended a feminist read into the movie or even to make his film a satanic propaganda. Regardless of what their true motivations were, I find this movie thoroughly irresponsible in its depiction of nature worship, feminism and psychological traumas.Could we believe that the award-winning level of fastidiousness and filmmaking skills of the director (and the studio) be complemented by such massive disregards for spiritualism. Is the nightmarish and downright anti-social message of the movie simply an ill-considered side effect of the director's attempt to shock and awe his audience.However you want to cut this cake - I'd say for the love of everything that is good and holy in the world - stay away from watching this ill conceived movie.It's not only sacrilegious towards religion, but towards life and nature itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After just reviewing The Invitation and praising it's use of building tension, it saddens me that The Witch failed to do that. It's a very long slow story of an exiled family forced to live in the woods. The twins are PURE evil and the old English accent had me reaching for the mute button after 10 minutes.The parts that actually contained any sign of a witch were the only bits that made me perk up. There were some actually shocking and gruesome bits with the Witch involved however they were so rare and sparse it hardly deserves to be called a story about witches at all. I had such high hopes for this but was majorly let down. I wouldn't watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical Realism, Suspense and Disappointing Excuse for a Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my wife's choice for our movie entertainment this weekend which was surprising since suspense has not been a traditional choice of hers if at all. I think that the historical realism as regards costume, setting and language was what baited her in. Those characteristics were available in abundance but they certainly didn't save the story. In fact the language was as much a detriment as a bonus. You end up trying to figure out what is being said more than following the plot which for this movie might be a good thing. Suspense was mostly characterized by spooky music with zero action to accompany it and depressing sets/scenery. You come away thinking that 17th century colonial life is gray, cloudy and dismal. The plot is characterized by a couple of gruesome actions that are barely related to each other and do nothing to build much of a story line. I felt like I was watching short stories from "Creepy" magazine that the writer tried to tie together but didn't quite succeed. The historicity disclaimer at the end, telling us that the movie was based on period records and dialogs, were poor attempts to document and pretentiously justify a shambling, depressing fantasy whose finale is a talking goat and chanting naked women floating around a bonfire (which are not DOCUMENTED as ever actually happening in any source I know of). When the credits came up my wife looked at me and said, "Really?". Apparently, to many, this bit of pretentiousness is meat to the large number of people who have jumped on the bandwagon of the even more pretentious Cannes Film reviewers that thought this was a good movie. I mean c'mon, did you really enjoy this dog?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great things about this movie are: - The acting. From the children to the parents, the acting was great, the dialogue is very believable.- The script. It's a good story all around, maybe could have been expanded slightly but it was still good.- The setting/visuals. The time it was set, and the location on the edge of the woods makes for a great horror movie.One of the only problems with this movie is that it shouldn't really have been labeled a horror... although I'm not quite sure what would be a more accurate genre. Something psychological. Like "The Shining", but with much less of the scary/creepy visuals. (there are still some) It's more about a family's mental breakdown.The other problem I had was that yes, it is a little hard to understand the characters sometimes. The dad is the worst. I had trouble in the beginning but if you devote a little more of your attention to what they're saying it should help.My advice is, don't go in to it thinking you're seeing a run of the mill horror movie where your heart is pounding, wondering when the next jump scare is going to be. There's few, if any. (depending on how easily startled you are). Go in thinking you're going to see a well put together movie, with some psychological elements to it.I was thinking about giving it an 8 because the acting, setting, and dialogue really blew me away, but, I gave it a 7 because I felt the ending could have been slightly better.</fullReview>

The subtle classic "witch" symbolism will probably pass the iphone brigade by, their loss. It is certainly a film that demands your attention but pays it back ten-fold and buy the end the tension is ratcheted so high you'll only notice you haven't taken a breath for the last 5 mins once the credits roll. Certainly a film that will be watched more than once, probably in Europe as I can't see the American market enjoying this, it will probably be received the same way as any film with subtitles. All in all a fantastic, original film with more originality than so many other films with 10 times the budget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very disappointing to say the least. I went into about a half full theater with decent expectations from all the good reviews I had read beforehand. Let me start by saying there is some good in this film. The attention to detail for the period it takes place in is very evident. Also, the acting was decent in my opinion. However, this should not be considered a horror film. There is nothing scary about it! There is some tension build up, but it never goes anywhere. This film is more about a family drama than anything else. When it ended, I had the same reaction as nearly everyone in the theater, which was "Wait, that's it"? No one in the crowd looked pleased, and I heard multiple verbal outbursts from people saying "What the eff did I just watch" or "Wow what a waste of my time" etc. I mean people were very visually angry with the film. Even the guy at the popcorn stand asked me what movie I had seen, and when I said "The Witch", he asked if I thought it sucked too. I see some of the people that have reviewed this film on here who claim that it's for intellectuals and that it has a deeper message and such. Let me just say that that's a bunch of nonsense because I think you're reaching for something that isn't there. If you wanna watch a period piece with a "deeper meaning" then go watch a documentary or put on the history channel. If you actually want to be entertained, then by no means should you watch this film! It's a waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Were the witch sold as a period drama with creepy elements I might have looked more kindly upon it. But since it was sold as "the most terrifying film of the year" all I found was disappointment. The film throws a scary scene featuring "The Witch" at us in the first ten minutes but after that it builds(if you can call it that) unsuccessfully for over an hour. the first thirty minutes the audience accepts as necessary to build suspense and flesh out the characters but one boring scene after the next has the people bored and unamused. Now keep in mind I'm not the kind of person who requires instant gratification in film. The babadook is my favourite horror film in years. The Witch is not that film. Several times we expect something scary to finally happen only to be greeted by a rabbit. This film felt like it was edited in the 70s and is choppy at best. It also ends more times than LOTR with each fade to black making us hope that it's finally over. This film is well acted but that's about it. It's hilariously unscary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Witch was the film I was anticipating most out of all the films slated to be released in 2016. I can not think of a word that means beyond disappointed.There are many possibilities in the first act that tease subjects the film could go on to explore in-depth. Instead they all lead to dead ends. In a way, the entire film is a tease of bigger ideas that are traded in for a cliché horror ending.A film like The Witch can choose to be ambiguous or it can give the audience a sense of satisfaction. The Witch tries to do both and in doing this, the ending betrays everything that came before it. Casual audiences may be somewhat satisfied as the end credits begin to roll. However, those of us who love films that demand multiple viewings will feel cheated or, even worse, indifferent. The writer/director takes away any sense of lingering mystery, he takes away any want or need we may have had to watch the film again. It's like watching a painter dump a bucket of water all over a painting we just watched them meticulously paint for hours. It all seems like a complete waste. And it is.The trailers for The Witch are more frightening than the film itself. However, The Witch's biggest sin is how forgettable it all is in the end. And that is unforgivable.</fullReview>

I bought the tickets. What a big mistake! I genuinely believe this movie was made to propagate satanism. Soon after the movie started, I began to feel uneasy. Hints of incestuous desires, grotesque nudity, morally corrupt young kids, betrayals among parents and kids, hopelessness of faith, the powerless God, kids and parents turning on each other, genocide, child sex, you name it. And you don't even want to know how the movie ends! The story seems to be a confusing mix of Hansel and Gretel, Salem Witch Hunt, and The Shining. I felt like throwing up from the moral filth of the movie. Sick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly I went into this expecting a slow horror. However I must say the acting was really good and so was the camera work but as a movie it's not a a slow horror movie leading to an amazing pay off instead it's a very boring movie about a family getting upset and doing typical family things around that time. I know that sounds dumb but the moment I seen the first thing causing the family to start their drama I knew immediately where the film was going and since I knew it was boring the entire time. If you found this movie exciting at all I would wonder if you ever learned or studied the salem witch trials because this is a typical "family reacts to witch activity" Usually for slow movies you need something to keep you intrigued some mystery or just something compelling which this film does not have. No intrigue, no mystery, no horror, no suspense, typical characters. This is kind of how I would some it up if this were a history channel special film, it would be an amazing film it would get an 8 out of 10 from me, however it is a Hollywood title playing in theaters. I payed a lot of money for my siblings and I to watch a higher quality history channel salem witch trials movie. In my opinion there are much better slower horror movies, here are some examples-Kill List -I Saw The Devil -Gone Girl -Seven I know those last two aren't exactly horror or really "slow" but they are not fast either and much, much more worth your time then The Witch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend and I were drawn to this film by the remarkably high reviews. We sat in the semi- packed theatre and were ready to be dazzled. By the end, I was surprised this film made it to theatres and I wished I would had left with the other audience members who walked out half way through. I will start with the positives. The acting was very good. You could tell each actor was thoroughly into their roles. Also the cinematography was beautiful. Some of the shots of the characters walking in the forest stand out the most in my mind. Apart from that it was a horrid mess. The characters speak in this form of old English that is barely understandable. This film needs subtitles desperately. Get ready to be completely disoriented by this films plot. Lots of things happen and they will never be explained or addressed (like a certain scene involving a crow or the kissing scene). The biggest problem I found with this movie is that it is boring. The big 'payoffs' in the plot are dull and left me more confused. The film's ending could have been much stronger if the witches were more developed as characters. Instead you are left with an ending that feels duct taped to the rest of the film. It feels really out of place and is a little too sci fi channel "B-movie" in my opinion. Wait until this film hits free TV before you watch it. Not worth the money for admission unless you are paying to take a nap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there was one scene, early on in the film, of incredible terror, the balance of the film was entirely predictable, difficult artistically, and thematically set us back nearly 500 years in vilifying women and witches/ wiccans. While true to the hysterics of the time over anything the recent English immigrants could not understand and therefore labeled as evil, (the dense woods, disobedient women, breasts, etc.) artistically this film is a mess. Let's start with the overuse of blank screens for long seconds (minutes?) of time. This may have been intended to build suspense, especially with the use of fraught vocal music in the soundtrack, but it is used far too often, and the screen is kept blank too long, followed by- nothing! Apparently in this film, it's the equivalent of dropping a screen on stage while the actors change places or costumes. It could have been employed once or twice to great effect if the blank screen didn't last as long, (the viewer on my left mumbled "WTF?!" at the second or third use of this) and if it was followed by a surprise or shock to the viewer. Then there's the dialogue: approximately 25% of it, especially early in the film, is indecipherable and at different volumes. The elder son, Caleb, has a different (Cockney) accent than the rest of the family. OK, the Puritans were creepy in their singular devotion to The Bible, and living in and adapting to the apparently always dreary New England was a bit much for their imaginations. But why must women be portrayed always as The Shrew, The Temptress, or the Agent of Satan? I give this film 2 stars for its novel attempt to depict the life of early Puritan settlers in their uneducated, superstitious and hysterical ways. Otherwise, in all, I was mightily disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Guess Drama Films count as Horror Films Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To those looking for some good scares, don't look to this film. A family drama is what it actually is. Don't be fooled by the reviews calling it the greatest horror film of the year, of the decade, and so on. To even call this a horror film is beyond me. Undoubtedly, this film is visually appealing, with great cinematography and acting, but the film meanders for the entirety of its runtime, constantly fooling the audience into thinking something scary will actually happen--but no. This is style over substance, and the director seems to have fooled himself into thinking that this could suffice for a full length feature. Save your time, save your money. Not even worth a rent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deceptive Previews and an Aggravating Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see The Witch based on the intriguing previews, plus the high user and critic ratings on IMDb. What did anyone find the least bit redeeming in this wretched film?Based on the previews I was expecting a frightening, exciting, tense movie about, oh I don't know, a witch!?!? Instead I was subjected to 90 minutes of a family's extreme religious superstition tearing them apart. OK, that's not necessarily bad for subject matter, but since everyone speaks in different accents and variations of 17th century English (ye, thee, thou, whilst, etc.) at wildly varying volume levels, I probably missed a good 40-50% of what was said. But what upset me the most was how the film existed in the world of plausibility for the majority of the time and then suddenly shifted into fantasy and the supernatural. Far too many WTF moments that I would have to spoil to enumerate. But just when you think you are dealing with the effects of religious extremism and how it can poison a person's mind, suddenly you get slammed with images of pure folklore fantasy and all you can do is scratch your head and wonder what the heck is going on. It's been a long time since a film has made me want to walk out in disgust.I give The Witch two stars because of the acting performances. The cast had some horrible material to work with but they did a wonderful job of expressing their emotions, fears and doubts about each other's faith. Somehow they spoke the lines they were given effectively as well. In the end they couldn't rise above the material, though, including the fact that like so many movies today, the filmmakers had no idea how or when the story should come to an end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrifically Enchanting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch, following a family upon their move into the wilderness of 1630s New England, is the debut feature film from director Robert Eggers who embeds the project with an essence of horror not often seen. While many audiences are busy looking for, or even lazily just waiting for, big jumps and stingers for their scares like most modern movies of the genre, they are missing the creepy details that truly push a slow burn like this film into horror. It's so realistically done that you worry that it shouldn't be happening, and are likewise worried of the consequences for the family.The ensemble cast is first and foremost in bringing this story to life. The acting is just incredible. You can see heavy breath leaving the body. You can see the confusion in their eyes. You can see evil determination and quiet despair. Each actor has a moment of triumph where their talent alone is on display, and these scenes hit like a goat to the gut. What makes it even more impressive is that more than half of the main cast is made up of child actors that pull these feats from who knows where. They are eerily effective in a way that, at one point, I questioned whether one of the children was actually an adult acting through motion capture. It was not the case. The acting is just that intense and believable.Other points and aspects of the film also make you question everything you're seeing. Has any of this story been real? Is what is happening in this story being imagined? There's a sense of ambiguity that, instead of making things more comfortable because it's probably just an old-timey urban legend, actually makes you more hesitant to step further into darkness because it could very well be real. While those horrific voices help make up a vivid and powerful score by Mark Koven, could these chants actually be coming from nearby evil as well? The forest, already a naturally dangerous place, is left open to become a supernatural place of folklore where any animal you encounter could be something more and the tall trees creep in close to overcome you.It's a masterful choice to shoot this film in more of a full frame aspect ration, which makes its presentation alone feel old and classic, purposefully dated to a time long since experienced. At the same time, it subconsciously makes the film about a tight-knit family go completely claustrophobic and uncomfortable, even when outdoors. It's isolating. The camera is used like a lullaby, going back and forth between sweeps across plains and utter stillness until it trances you into the unknown. There is depth and uneasiness in every frame, and bewilderment after every turn. Takes that last longer than expected leave you to breathe during these down times, but there really is no downtime when you're numbed into a sense of wonder.All of this culminates into a film that floats into a state of euphoria, capturing an emotion that you may not have known was even there before. It's a witch film unlike any witch film you've seen, taken seriously and realistically, but with a climate of dread. It's a slice of life film, really, albeit a slice of an alternative life. As familiar in storybooks as it might be today, these were the absolute thoughts and stories passed around by those who lived during the time, the stories that many thought to be real. The Witch is the definition of the American witch mythology, portrayed in its purest state of horrific enchantment.</fullReview>

More of a thinking persons horror/thriller that plays out well in the atmosphere created. Even with the moderately short running time of just over an hour and a half, though, this movie seems to drag on quite a bit and may turn off casual moviegoers. Don't let that stop you from seeing a well rounded film that comes at a time where the more gore the better is the norm.Overall worth a watch but I am slightly unsure what all the media attention was all about. I believe if it were not for this, then many would not have even known about this flick. Being supported by the Satanic Church was odd but effective for the media to jump on.</fullReview>

Shivers just imagining the ego of the "auteur" of this crap. Let's be brief: First, we have again here one of those movies in which ALL the characters are unsympathetic. That means you don't give a damn. Second, What's the point of trying to imagine how people spoke in 17th Century?? One thing is sure: Shakespeare will be contorting in his grave just hearing this pseudo-dialog. Only we can thank the "auteur" he didn't deliver in iambic verses. Third, that horrible, horrible, horrible music!! Yeah, I get it, guys. You're just trying to achieve certain uneasiness by means of dissonance. Only, this isn't just uneasiness. This is horrible noise makes your ears bleed!! Fourth, the boredom. Trying to make art?? Thou shall not bore the audience!! And last, not least, critics ignorance and disorientation.

The kids are annoying as hell and the movie is boring in many ways and the way that the baby disappears at the early beginning of the film is laughable at best or even the way that people die and comeback.

		<shortDescription>The Witch sells itself on something it barely does</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch is a movie that can be explained as "alright". The Witch can be quite immersive at times, but it became apparent that the director had an idea that he strayed away from at some points. It seemed like some scenes were literally added to show some imagery that added absolutely nothing to film at all. That being said, some of the scenes in this movie were disgusting and unnerving in the best way possible. Some scenes felt out of place and kind of pointless, like the siblings bickering for seemingly no reason other than to take up time. It almost felt like this should have been time used for character progression because honestly when the characters died I found myself not really caring. The film kind of went out of its way to explain everything to you and there's nothing inherently wrong with that, but when something isn't blatantly explained or shown to you when everything else was(specifically the scene when the dog died vs. when the two children were stolen by the witch at the end), it adds a disconnect in the story telling and makes me wonder why they would go out of their way to show a dead dog but not the two dead children which were the reason why the girl's parents thought she was a witch to begin with. These issues resonated with me enough to probably not give it another watch because I'll become irritated with the lack of attention to the story that this film relies on to stay remotely interesting. If more things were to happen in this movie I would probably give it a higher score but honestly not much happens and when things to happen it seems like they're just happening for the sake of happening, so I found myself not really caring about the sister scaring the little girl by the river for literally no reason. I found myself wondering why she did that the whole movie because it just screwed her over in the long run. Also, why was the goat decided to be the devil? It seemed like that was kind of random. They didn't mention that the entire movie but for some reason at the end it was the devil. When did the children talk to the goat? Like once or twice maybe. Overall, the movie sold itself on the aspect of imagery and I can say that the aspect that movie made itself so keen on showing you were one of the least prevalent things throughout the bulk of the movie. The awesome scenes only slightly outweighed the misguided story telling of literally nothing happening throughout this movie. 6/10</fullReview>

How this group manages to build (let alone maintain) a farm is beyond me: these folks lack Common Sense in great abundance. The script (for lack of a better word) is rivaled only by the direction in terms of amateurishness. (The single scene worthy of note: a long shot of a robed figure moving through the forest cradling a newborn baby.) Perhaps it's the lack of Perspective that hurts THE WITCH: it's never really clear if the filmmaker is wagging a finger at the gullible who persist to this day in believing in Gods or Goddesses or if he's just a Fright Film fan taking his turn at bat(...), and it's this unevenness that make THE WITCH just another dreary bit of business.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was based on the collection of a series of the real events that takes place in the 17th century New England. The story of a farmer family who came across the ocean, but now lives on the edge of the forest after denied permission to build a house in a village. When the newborn baby disappears in a thin air, the family begins to experience the mysterious events. Without a clue about the happenings, the evil force begins to possess them while the unity of the family is tested.Wow, finally a wonderful horror-psychological-thriller. Usually horror films are the worst kind compared with other genres, because most of them overly rely on the sudden sound/noise and gore. But there are many awesome horror films I had liked which were better story than the graphical presentation, like this one. So I love good narration than those try to scare me with make-ups, stunts and sound mixings.It was a limited cast film, sets in a beautiful remote place and the language was awesome that perfectly suits for the horror theme like this. Everyone's performance was brilliant. It is just a one million dollar film and the entire film was shot within a month. The records are not matter when the writing and the direction were top notch. Especially for a first timer it was a remarkable achievement.A simple plot, developed greatly and the suspense was the highlight. Yet viewers expect more explanation, but I'm happy for what it is and it should not go deeper than that which might spoil its unique flavour. Not just horror film fans, everyone should try it if they're capable to handle the slow narration. Finally, like usual, here I won't ask for a sequel, because it'll make an amazing one off film than the dozens of crappy follow ups.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crafting the witching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two movies at work here (see also the title). One is about placing us in a remote place and time, New England in the 1600s when it was uncharted wilderness, giving us a presence in a life outside maps. A family has been ostracized and comes to live in a remote farm at the edge of the woods. Dread here comes from knowing we are on an edge of the world and no one will be coming for help.And then we have another kind of presence as you might guess, lurking in the woods and circling from afar. The apparitions are scarce, which seems to have put some viewers off, but are harrowing when they came so we stay the duration until the next one. The first one in particular is so well timed and ghastly; we know right away this will be a world without mercy, without cuteness about evil.They made it overall, this is worth watching, it creeps. The difference is all in the first kind of presence that ushers us in a world of human frailty. There are all kinds of ways to explore that edge, only one of which is the notion that evil is being hallucinated, reality cursed by belief in a narrative about evil powers. The forest as playground for chance havoc transformed in the traumatized mind. The filmmakers toy with as much in the scene with the kids becoming possessed by the sight of possession, then snapping out of it. And it's of course in Thomasin giving herself over to delicious madness, levitating out of mind that witnessed what it did. I would have liked to see a Herzog version, even more knowingly centered in shedding knowledge to give us mind levitation, from his days when he was still a shaman of the craft of seeing. Or this with a lusher camera that listens for the night. We don't altogether escape movie- ism here and this kind of film more than others needs to reach us primal, although it must be an uphill struggle. Was Blairwitch the last time our viewer defenses could be witched away?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Witch' isn't your conventional horror film. It isn't particularly scary or gory, but it is eerie and atmospheric. The film certainly has some positives - it is very well made and it does build up tension nicely, especially towards the end. It is, however, ultimately let down by some major flaws.The first being some of the acting. Generally speaking, it's okay, but some of the younger ones are guilty of overacting in a few scenes. UK viewers may also struggle to engage with Ralph Ineson's character, given his distinctive voice which is heard in many British TV adverts. All I could think of when he spoke was Dacia cars. 'The Witch' is also very, very slow to get going. The first half of the film is on the verge of becoming boring - there's very little tension and scares are few and far between, but it does pick up.Overall, I thought 'The Witch' was okay, but it could have been a lot better. It is unique in its approach, placing a greater emphasis on the dialogue and content rather than simply the gore and scares like a lot of other horror movies. A decent but flawed horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Witch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch is one of those horror films which are interesting even from before reaching the fantastic part. The portrait of the pitiless rural life in 17th century feels genuinely realistic. The settings, costumes and even the language itself evoke a time which was simple, but full of anachronistic rules which might seem irrational nowadays, even though they were the basis itself of social order back then. In fact, The Witch made me comprehend how absolute faith can impart an unmistakable reality to many things we might classify as "superstitions". It's very simple... if the belief in God is so strong, everything else must be true: witches, demons, pacts with Satan, etc. That's not a new lesson, but The Witch portrays it quite well, supported by excellent works from actors who face their difficult roles with absolute conviction while generating an absolutely credible family dynamic with each other. Ralph Ineson doesn't portray patriarch William as a religious tyrant, but a decent and comprehensive man whose occasionally catastrophic decisions aren't due to malice, but his sincere Christian faith. Kate Dickie perfectly expresses a wide variety of feelings, something which shouldn't have been easy because she's crying almost every time her character appears. And the young actors Anya Taylor-Joy, Harvey Scrimshaw, Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson bring extraordinary performances, carrying the weight of the drama with total conviction, without hesitating once. I have already talked pretty much about the performances and the historical fidelity; but, where's the horror? To be honest, The Witch tends to be more a family drama and historical thriller than a traditional horror film; fortunately, that didn't avoid it from creating various disturbing scenes and a tense mystery which generates more anguish than any contemporary cliché (however, it unfortunately employed the "killing the dog to prove the gravity of the situation" stereotype; of all the clichés, it only employed the one I dislike the most). As for the ending... I'm not sure what to think. Sure, after 90 minutes of paranoia and uncertainty, a shocking ending was needed, but I might have preferred a bit of ambiguity to leave us thinking, instead of such a specific conclusion. Nevertheless, I liked The Witch pretty much, mainly due to its precise handling of emotions and intense narrative, which don't allow even the slightest glimpse of boredom despite the parsimonious rhythm. The Witch is "old school" not only due to its historical period, but also because of its comprehension of suggestion as the genuine origin of horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The WitchThe key to surviving in a Puritan society was accusing as many people of witchcraft as you could.Unfortunately, any accusation of necromancy in this horror movie would fall directly on relatives.Excommunicated from their New England colony, William (Ralph Ineson), his wife (Kate Dickie), their eldest Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) and her siblings relocate to an isolated homestead adjacent to a forest.When the newborn and the eldest son disappear and the family's goat starts speaking to the children, rumours of sorcery start circulating with Thomasin as the prime suspect.An unnerving but authentic look at family life in 17th century, this multi-layered slow-burner embodies the dialect, dress and superstitions of the pious of those paranoid times. Meanwhile, the subversive script is supplemented by haunting imagery, restrained direction and notable performances.Mind you, any demon ordering you to dance naked in the woods is probably recording it from the bushes.

		<fullReview>Having read the reviews and looked at the cover of the box, I got more than I had hoped for. Atmosphere, period language and beliefs, with more than credible prowess by all the cast. Although, the goat seemed to be a prima donna according to the trivia section. This film hits hard and goes back to Wheatleys Devil rides out and digs further in time. The characters are strong, and beautifully played. The creation of atmosphere be it with the camera work, editing, effects, and score are a great success in giving you the whole experience of being back in the 1630's, facing a cruel existence, for some god knows why reason. This must have driven the sane, God fearing, hardy but naive settlers to the limits of insanity. The contemporary writings of the time are chilling.Hey presto for a finish add suspense, great acting, and the overall production channel, you get a truly chilling film of great quality.UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE.....Why oh why did you have to go base on us, leaving with this cheesy image in mind. Make your own directors cut at the appropriate point and you have a great film.Otherwise forgive the last minute...it's really not what the film is about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Photography - Stunningly well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm reviewing this only 28 minutes into it and I have paused many a time to absorb the imagery. The director is either a master photographer or has one at his disposal. With period pieces such as this setting the mood is all important. Given the nature of the plot a dark foreboding presence is requisite. The scenes of somber candle lit interiors and rustic exteriors in the earliest of north American colonial life eclipse what Stanley Kubrick did in Barry Lyndon. Exceptional high production values. I will follow the work of these film makers. I tried to but failed making this part of my 2015 Tiff package - I was sad I could not include it in my film list. Given this successful accomplishment further works will no doubt be shown in larger festival venues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterful example of mood and chills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forgoing the jump scare and gore tactics that have inhabited and tarnished the horror genre over the last decade, first time filmmaker Robert Eggers has with his old English folktale The Witch (a film Jordan nominated as his most anticipated of the year) created an utterly unnerving and moody piece of horror filmmaking that whilst won't have audiences covering their eyes, will most certainly have them squirming in their seats and feeling incredibly uneasy during and after proceedings.Tinged with the religious zealously and witch fearing pandemonium that infested the landscape in which The Witch is based in, Eggers has created something refreshingly unique with his picture, from the Ye Olde English dialogue which itself is based on writings of the day, through to the atmospheric capturing of its countryside and regardless of genre, The Witch is undoubtedly one of the most effective films in some time concerning its ability to draw the viewer into its particular mood, which in this case is pure palpable dread from its first frame through to its last horrific hoorah.Centering this period tale almost exclusively within the confines of a Puritan Family's lowly farm, after their fatherly patriarch William (played effectively by Ralph Ineson) is excommunicated by a local plantation community and the family is banished to the edges of woods that are quite possibly haunted by a witch or witches, Eggers manages to draw out scene after scene of tension riddled family and spiritual dramas that are expertly crafted and effectively played out by its actors.Showcasing skills as a writer and director, The Witch also signals Eggers ability with actors and in particular young performers with both Anya Taylor-Joy and Harvey Scrimshaw as well-meaning brother and sister Thomasin and Caleb respectively delivering above average turns for actors of their age and tasked with delivering hefty material, The Witch finds itself in safe hands whenever these two teenagers take center stage. It must also be noted that Eggers shows himself a deft hand with animals as well, Black Phillip the goat and a seemingly nefarious bunny rabbit hold their own in this not for the faint of heart experience.Not a film for those that have become accustomed to their horror in the form of cheap Hollywood knockoffs and anthologies that have lasted long after their use by dates, The Witch may not be perfect horror but it's about as close as your likely to get in today's climate and based on this memorable and disquieting experience (who or what exactly is the titular witch?), Eggers is a filmmaker that could well be the savior of modern day horror, not a bad feat by a director on debut.4 thirsty crows out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody Recruit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am surprised to read that this has an "awesome look", with details "as exact as it was back then". Being Robert Eggers an art director and costume designer, one of the things that struck me is that the wardrobe looked as if coming directly from a tailor shop or laundry (starch included), that it was not aged as much as needed, and that it looked too clean for working peasants (especially for the father who was the farmer). And to say that things looked "exactly" as they did in the 17th century is a silly sacrilege, a most fitting word for the occasion, when one decides to write a few lines about a motion picture that narrates a folk tale dealing with religion, and loaded with terror elements. I think that if writer-director Eggers had circumscribed his screenplay to folklore with its natural horror edges (a bit in the line of the wonderful 2000 Czech film "Kytice"), "The VVitch" would have been a better movie. There is also a more realistic approach to the tale, within the frame of a psychological drama with supernatural elements (in the line of the fine 1961 production "The Innocents"): superstition and religious belief erodes the basis of an English family that has migrated to North America, and the story slowly builds to tragedy. But Eggers fell into the traps of tired formulas of new American horror films, including omnipresent music, false build-ups of tension through music and sound (as if a tsunami were coming!) that lead to nothing for dramatic purposes, evil represented by a botox-ridden woman with low cleavage, a bit of pedophilia, and silly special effects ?the ending is the best example, from the moment the main character takes her bloodstained dress off and sits at the family table, to the gratuitous final witch dance and ascent. In the end it seems a bloody, stupid way to recruit a new witch: was that entire massacre necessary to add a new girl to the coven? Let's hope that next time Robert Eggers decides to make things simpler, asks someone else to write the script, and a composer that knows when to stop, for Eggers shows a good hand for directing actors, and a good eye for composition and framing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jesus this movie was just so fvcking boring! There were so many times when I nearly fell asleep. I could barely pay attention to the film because I tried so hard not to sleep. Many times the camera would just stay on the actors and the actors wouldn't do or say anything. Also, you cannot watch this film without subtitles. It is IMPOSSIBLE to understand what these people were saying without subtitles. The British accent and words like "thou", "thee", "thy", "art", etc.Close to the end of the film, the mother and father are dead, Caleb is also dead, two dead goats, and the twin kids were gone. The movie never explains what exactly happened to the twin kids. Thomasin was being accused of being a witch by her mother the whole time and after all of her family members died, the black goat turned into this man and Thomasin decided to become a witch. Why would she want to join the witches? Thomasin acted like she didn't care that much about the fact that her family just died.Some scenes did get my attention and at the end of the film when Thomasin was entering the woods in the dark completely naked, she had a nice ass.Overall, this movie does not deserve a 91% on Rotten Tomatoes. If you are planning on watching this film, make sure to drink some coffee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsettling horror. Smartly creepy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An English farmer and head of devout Christian family, William (Ralph Ineson), in fear of banishment from the 1630 church, leaves a colonial plantation and begins homesteading a remote plot of land at the edge of the New England wilderness. Wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), slow to complain, fears something evil lives in the nearby woods. Daughter Thomasin (Anay Taylor-Joy) plays peek-a-boo with a little brother that mysteriously disappears. In order to keep a little distance from two younger siblings, she jokingly claims to be a witch. Crops begin to fail, domestic animals become unruly and one of the remaining children seems to be possessed by a malevolent spirit. Paranoia sets in as members of the family truly believe Thomasin is guilty of witchcraft. Their faith has been attacked and will be tested. Why have they been forsaken? Is it evil living among them or something lurking in the woods? This movie could curdle Stephen King's blood. The fluctuation of music is haunting; various scenes will cramp your knuckles and the atmosphere is perfectly creepy. The wordiness adds mystery to the desperation of the characters. Cinematography is eerie. Kudos to director Robert Eggers.The cast includes: Harvey Scrimshaw, Ellie Grainger, Lucas Dawson, Sarah Stephens and Vivien Moore.

However, any background music while appropriate for some scenes was found in others...I kept thinking the wheel would fall off the wagon, for one. Something that was funny was how the father kept chopping wood, while everything else feel apart. How quickly he accused his children of being witches and then changed his mind?? It was really a mess. Oh and moments of no sound and black screen. The was more that once I thought the theater stopped playing the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prepare for a SERIOUS creep-out out...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Getting right into it, this movie will give you the creeps at some point: if not many points. This is also one of those movies that has a bit of a slow build up. However, it is ALL necessary. For whatever reason, now-a-days people just want all things RIGHT NOW and in a hurry. Give me action! Give me gruesome! Give me the feels... but in order to hit you right between the kisser just right, there needs to be some ground work laid. This movie does that. The other challenge is the period which this movie takes place: 1630. Not the most exciting nor technological times. What this movie does quickly is establish main characters and jumps right into plot. It lets you know that this movie is focusing just on this family. While there's mention of other people, you don't really care. The few main characters all add something good to this gumbo.The art direction and cinematography are brilliant in setting tone, mood, direction and capturing the essence of the suspense, struggle and mysteries that seemingly plague this family. And then... there's that creep factor. On a scale of 1-10, I'd easily give this movie an 8 for 3 reasons. #1. This movie is based off of written accounts. Whaaaaaat?? #2. This is one of those movies that uses kids in that RIGHT way to slap you with effect. #3. This is not your cute little Bewitched or Sabrina the Teenage witch kind of stuff. This is the kind of witch you had nightmares about and made you not want to go back to sleep, ever.The only reason I give this a 7 and not higher is because it lacks some depth and isn't quite unique, but is an original "witch" movie in my opinion. The Witch kind of reminds me of The Village and Wicker Man, but better than both combined and multiplied by 5. The build up isn't for everyone as mentioned above, but may take a bit to get through. Additionally, I'm not the reviewer to give out that covenant 10 or even 9 very easily. But, this movie does have a lot going for it and worth the watch if you want a good creep-out or horror movie. There's A LOT worse out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horror Tale that Plays 'Peek-a-BOO" with the Audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ominous Folk-Tale of Oppression and Religious Fundamentalism causing Madness. Set in the Early 1600's on the Eve of the Salem Witch Trials, there are Puritan Communities seeking refuge from Persecution that came to America and began to Persecute.First Time Director Eggers has an Attention to Detail in the Production Design that makes this Seem as though it was Filmed On-Sight in Real Time as it was happening, even to the Questionable Decision to have His Characters Speak in "Thee and Thou" Style.While this may have been an Ode to Believability it might have Alienated Non-Eggheads and Isolated an Audience that could have Benefited from His Message.That one Glaring Flaw aside, everything else the Director puts On Screen is Captivating. The Acting is Superb, the Costumes and the Damp and Dreary Motif is Meticulously Melodramatic, harking back to the Hammer and Corman Horror Films of 1960's with New Millennium Concerns and Sensibilities.The Film Plays "Peek-A-Boo" with the Audience as it is Never Clear what is Real and what is a Psychotic Break and Hallucinatory. In the End it Remains Unclear.What is Crystal is that this is an Indie-Experiment that is Artistically Crafted and Sharply Philosophical about the Dangers Lurking about to This Day. Ignorance, Zealotry, and Madness resulting from Evil that did not Remain in the 1600's.Televangelist Pat Robertson in (1991)..."The Feminist agenda is not about equal rights for women. It is about a Socialist, anti-family Political movement that encourages Women to leave their Husbands, kill their Children, practice Witchcraft, destroy Capitalism and become Lesbians."In 2016 just turn on the TV or Surf the Internet for more Evidence that this Film has as much to say about Today as it does about 1630.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We will conquer this wilderness. It will not consume us.""Creepy little folk tale constructed with slow-burning passion and slack atmosphere. There's something to be said for director Eggers' attention to period details and the way he builds terror via conventions and subversions. Much like others have said, an easy way to sell this is to describe it as mashing together equal parts The Crucible, The Shining, and just a smattering of Blair Witch's atmosphere and A Field in England, oddly enough.Cast really shines through, special props to gravel-voiced, six- packed Ralph Ineson of Game of Thrones notoriety, and newcomer Anya Taylor-Joy, who brings a sense of strangled fright to her leading performance. The script, combined with the Olde Englishe accents, proved a little hard to understand at times. The music overplayed its hand way too early for my taste, but it got more restrained later on in the film. The final scene is going to haunt me as I sleep later on.Definitely see this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corruption of the Puritans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching "The Witch", I felt that the movie had a deeper meaning that many people might not have been able to see. Much like "The Babadook", which highlighted the feelings of guilt and loss, "The Witch" showcased the effects of corruption. Each member of this devote religious family are all seduced by the Devil in different forms. Mercy and Jonas, the twins are the first to be corrupted.The two bring devastation and misery to their family by unknowingly inviting the Devil into their lives. In the form of Black Philip, the demon manages to befriend the youngest members of the family and uses their naivety and innocence against them, using them as pawns in his efforts to destroy this family. Next Caleb, the eldest boy is seduced by his own lust. Soon to be coming into his adolescence, Caleb begins to have an interest in girls, which is established when he constantly finds his eyes are drawn to his sisters chest. However, when he is confronted in the wood by a beautiful woman, he is awe stricken and can't help but give into temptation. After suffering the loss of her two children, it doesn't take much for the mother Katherine to willingly denounce her faith in the name of children. Seeing the faces of her deceased children brings her to her knees, and the need to be with them clouds her judgement and she gives herself over to the Devil. In stark contrast, the father William is the only member of his family to completely ward off all temptation and stands with his faith. Everyday he tries his best to provide for his family and does what her thinks is best to keep them safe, even if those means are somewhat drastic. In the end, he is confronted by Black Philip and is impaled by his horns and crushed to death by the firewood he had spent so long collecting for his family. And finally we have Thomasin, who's journey to the powers of evil is long and devastating. Left with nothing, no family, livelihood or faith, she comes to the devil on her knees asking for help. After removing her cloths, leaving behind all sense of vanity, conventions and her religion, she leaves her home and ventures into the forest under the guidance of the devil. There, she joins a coven of witches, chanting around a roaring bonfire, and there, she receives the first taste of power in her life and lifts into the air becoming that which she feared the most. A Witch. Though this mightn't have been the most polished and pristine evaluation, this was my personal interpretation of what the film was trying to establish. "The Witch" was truly an experience and a film that, I hope will become a staple in the horror genre.</fullReview>

This film has one of the best endings I have ever seen in a horror genre film, it made me want to watch the entire movie over again. I absolutely loved this film.

		<shortDescription>A solid horror movie (without jump scares!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch is one of those rare horror films that pop up every few years, which are genuinely well-crafted pieces of work. One illustration of this is that it does not rely on jump scares like most horror films. Instead it relies on an increasing sense of dread to create its horror, combined with strange and unsettling imagery.The film looks great. The colours are dull, and the New England forest setting is bleak and desolate. Perfect for a horror film set in the 15th century. The film's sound is also a standout, in particular the music. I don't know what the composition of instruments was, but it fitted the film perfectly. (One thing I found annoying however, was the dialogue, which in parts was difficult to understand.)Unfortunately the story lets The Witch down. Even though I didn't watch the trailer or know much about the film, I was unsurprised by what occurred in the film, from about 1/3 into it. I find predictable stories, especially in horror films, boring to watch. Fortunately the execution of the story in The Witch is great, but it doesn't quite mitigate this problem.In terms of casting, I think the stand-out here is Harvey Scrimshaw, who plays a young boy called Caleb. He has several key scenes and he nails every one of them. The other is Ralph Ineson as William, who seems a shoe-in for a Game of Thrones role at some point.Overall, I recommend this to any horror film fan -- you will definitely enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful experience and it gets the simple yet important things right. But not so much as a scary horror thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror is a genre that has a defined scope which is governed by certain rules based on society's understanding of how ghosts/demons/spirits/'witches' etc function. While believers treat it as a social drama, others do so as a fantasy. So it is very important for the makers to have enough clarity on who their target audience are. In the recent times the makers have mostly catered to the latter audience dealing these stories as fantasies where these unnatural forces have the capability to control the technology (read 'Unfriended' or 'The Ring' series) which is fun to watch sometimes when done good.'The Witch' goes back to the roots of orthodox methodology of film making in horror genre which is thus far so overdone that it is difficult to present in a way that attracts audience attention. Director Robert Eggers does overcome this challenge with a tight script, suitable cast and going to a period (mid 17th century) when witches and witch hunting is still a norm in that part of the world. Right from the first frame, it draws you into that period, into their family, into their beliefs, into their conflicts. Once the connect is established, it plays around with its smart twists, whodunit mystery and creepy background score where you are forced to invest your emotions but not sure where.William (Ralph Ineson) is a righteous believer in spreading the Holy word and that is the purpose of his arrival in America with the pilgrims. He feels cheated and confronts the society when he finds a changed agenda which gets him banished from the village along with his family comprising of his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), elder daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), young twins and a toddler. When they settle in a plain near the forest, things go south when their toddler disappears from the hands of Thomasin followed by Caleb's abduction in the forest. When Caleb dies, each family member starts blaming each other and that builds up a certain disgust and mistrust among themselves leading to painful confrontations.It takes a while to settle into and start understanding the period diaglogue, but that adds a little freshness into an otherwise simple story. There is also a huge variation in the character arcs and their performances - for example Kate Dickie plays a depressing character who goes all melodramatic, while Harvey Scrimshaw and Ralph Ineson gives a textbook stage performance. The twins are cute and high-spirited while Anya Taylor-Joy gives a rather subtle contemporary performance. Though the background score gets a little intrusive at the beginning, it settles down well and starts being effective and plays an important role along the way. The whodunit thread may not be a driving factor, but it adds to the mix of things. There could have been more scary thrills to give it a bit more mass appeal and some scenes could have been squeezed a bit more to generate the necessary edginess.A beautiful experience and it gets the simple yet important things right. But not so much as a scary horror thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband and I are massive fans of scary movies and also big fans of horror movies set in England or olden times. This movie was hailed as one of the best horrors of recent years in some of the reviews I read so I was excited to watch it. It was, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Boring plot which didn't really make much sense or have a point, terrible acting and annoying, completely unlikable characters and a barely audible script. The only saving grace was that it was only 1.5 hours long rather than the 2.5 hours which most films seem to be nowadays. By the end of the film we were so frustrated to have wasted our evening on such a disappointing pile of rubbish. If you want to spend 1.5 hours struggling to understand a word anyone is saying, waiting for anything remotely scary to happen and praying that the characters all die very soon then watch this. If you want a movie that's intelligent, scary and interesting then don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely review movies, in fact my last review was 9 years ago on IMDb on another account. I watch a lot of movies, so many movies that I am generally more forgiving to a bad plot, bad CGI's, slow moving non coherent movies than the average movie watcher. This movie was so bad though that I immediately threw myself on the computer to write this review and warn, yes warn potential viewers to steer clear of this movie.The pace, the pace of this movie is so slow that at times I thought it was going in reverse. The horror, or lack thereof. Not phsycological, no jump scares, no nothing. In fact, halfways through the movie I almost fell asleep, of boredom (really). The story, what story? Movies normally build towards something, even if the pace is slow you can bare with it since it will lead to something, the sum being greater than the whole and whatever. However, his movie had none of those elements. It just went on and one and on, about, nothing essentially.I am upset that I will never get that 1h and 30 something minutes back of my life, time i could have spent watching my beard grown in the mirror, or count the hairs on my legs, or just stare at a random wall.Actors were all great, they were, however scripting, editing, storywise and so on, the movie is a straight to VHS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the horror movie genre and I was excited to see this. The whole '1630s New England' thing and witchcraft interested me, but I knew I would be thoroughly disappointed from about 45 minutes into the movie. The movie falls flat miserably and has very slow pacing with no pay- off. The acting was very mediocre at best. The only noteworthy performance was Anya Taylor-Joy, but obviously that wasn't enough. The actual writing had no ambition and I feel like the director took too many conservative options with the story just to be safe. This resulted in no significant set-pieces to happen to create tension or any kind of suspension or mystery. My biggest con is the non- existent soundtrack. A fundamental element of the horror genre is the gripping soundtrack but this movie just didn't have any. Because of this, many parts between segments were just stagnant. Cinematography was poor as well. They could've done a good job at capturing the wickedness of the forest, but they showed no ambition at doing that.Overall, an extremely lacklustre and unambitious movie. Considering this is 6.8 which is very good for a horror movie - this, according to me, is highly overrated.FINAL IMDb RATING: 1/10 - AVOID</fullReview>

This is the problem with reviews...95% are lies. THIS is the truth. A majority of us claim this rubbish show is 1 - 3. THAT is the true movie rating.Judge for yourself and take the time to read the real reviews.

		<shortDescription>A cut above a lot of other modern horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A God fearing family manages to end up banished from their village in 17th Century New England. They decide to set up cabin and ranch at the edge of a truly spooky forest. Their troubles are only beginning when their adorable newborn son Samuel disappears without a trace. And a lot of the blame is laid at the feet of the teen aged daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy).We never ever see very much of the title character in this effort by writer &amp; director Robert Eggers. He chooses to parcel out his true horror rather carefully, instead focusing on creating a mood and atmosphere that is absolutely stifling. His film is somber, serious, and even depressing. It's definitely not for all tastes. It sets a tone in a sequence approximately eight minutes in, involving Samuel. This will cause "The Witch" to lose some viewers, for sure, but all I can say in Eggers' defense is that he spares us the goriest details.Eggers was inspired by a variety of folklore, fairy tales (I can certainly see a "Hansel &amp; Gretel" influence), and records of settlers during this time in North American history. His *very* literate dialogue is often taken from these records. The dialogue and its delivery is therefore highly antiquated, so that's one other thing that some viewers might not care for. But it's refreshing that Eggers takes such a careful, measured approach to telling a tale that could be referred to as "slow burn" horror. The look for this picture is perfect; its drab visuals are very suitable to the story being told. But don't worry; there is some gore here and there.The performances are incredibly sincere and intense. Taylor-Joy has tremendous appeal in the lead role. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie are superb as the parents. Harvey Scrimshaw delivers a mature performance as the son Caleb. Bathsheba Garnett has such a creepy presence in her seconds of screen time as the true form of the Witch. And the goat Black Phillip manages to be quite the character too, especially towards the end.Overall, an interesting fable open to some interpretation, with many themes and questions of faith throughout.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been reading a lot of reviews about how you get chilled to your bone while seeing this movie.. and that it's understated yet you feel the evil in the movie. None of that is true. It's a movie about an exiled family living near the woods.. A family that worries about being damned if dead. Their religious overkill is what gets them killed eventually. It's about a weak human who blames another woman/girl for "seducing" her own brother and father. But that was how women were treated in the past, blamed for everything automatically. This film is simply about losing the child that invokes the weakness in the adults. It's not even remotely scary, it does not have any horror (except maybe couple of minutes). It's a well done period movie, including the language. But that's it.</fullReview>

Acting is okay and the storyline is intriguing, but the lack of anything more exciting will keep you bored out of your mind for the majority of the film, which unfortunately is very hard to follow as the entire thing is in old English speech. I had high hopes for this film after reading some of the reviews that scored it so highly. However, was left disappointed.

		<fullReview>"The Witch" is not your usual horror, it's much solemn and morbid, yet true-to-nature interpretation of the grim era. Admittedly, this might not mesh well for those seeking a higher pace horror, and it's quite understandable with the peculiar premise, but it has an intense atmosphere and cripplingly disturbing moments.A family is banished to a faraway land with little prospect. In there, they find that danger lurks outside their farm and also within their family. Props for the actors, including the children, who manage to create a timely sense of the period. It's not the same medieval type movie, first and foremost it's unapologetically dark.The tension arrives as this family is constantly dealing with daily pressure with not all members having the same footing. It escalates into real threat as the occult talk is seeping into their minds. The eerie soundtracks add to this effect, it just brings a feeling of dread and uncomfortable air.However, this presentation can present a couple of problems, one being it might alienate audience. The accent and slow burn are not for everyone, also it doesn't have a hook like more mainstream The Conjuring with clear narrative as it plays with a lot of analogies and the philosophy of the time."The Witch" is a polarizing horror with the peculiar and slow theme, however it definitely succeeds on what it sets to do, presenting an entirely dreadful experience in the woods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastically immersive experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any film which scares Stephen King (which this one reportedly did) has got to be worth a look- and this one is so rewarding in ways that most horror films just aren't these days. Most horror films, especially ones with as much publicity as this one, are reliant on the usual mix of jump-scares and over the top gore with not much substance at their core other than a bit of exhilarating blood-splattering fun. This film draws you into its world brilliantly through simple and effective devices like dim candlelight, claustrophobic rooms and thoroughly believable acting. It builds wonderfully and each of the horrific and eerie moments come at just the right time and aren't overdone. You become entrenched in the world of a small farm house by a big spooky woods through the eyes of the religious fervour and fears of an ordinary family in 1630. It is mesmerising, hypnotic and eerily thrilling and the faithfulness of the research done by its creators to portray the time as historically accurate is impressive. This is a film that I believe will be regarded as a classic in years to come, much in the vein of films like The Wicker Man. It is a timeless horror that will resound as much in ten or twenty years as it would have done twenty years ago. The essential elements of good filmmaking and horror story are all accounted for here. I heavily recommend this film to anyone interested in horror, history or drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are others reviewing "The Witch" very harshly, giving the film one star. Many of the descriptions of the film are from viewers that have apparently never ventured from the realm of the typical jump- scare fest, or are deeply religious, which is typical of today. It was a near-perfect incarnation of a specific horror theme that, unfortunately, no longer really resonates with most people.The Witch is not for those who become easily distracted, or those who expect everything in a film to end as expected. The Witch is for those who enjoy horror as it was made when one would visit a theater to see a movie, before the advent of the VHS. It is also for those who are practitioners of Pagan, Hermetic, Magick, or traditional Witchcraft beliefs. The film shows the tribulations of a family in a way that drives the viewer to feel that the Evil is in fact not evil, but revolutionary and cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start, I love horror movies...usually. I was looking forward to this movie simply because it looked somewhat creepy. First off, this may be a nit-picky criticism, but the accents in the movie were very frustrating and hard to follow. I know they were meant to be settlers from England, but the "thee, thy, thou, hither, etc" really got tiring. Secondly the acting was decent, although the mother and two youngest kids were extremely annoying. The two youngest siblings were bratty and whiny. The mother was either crying or whining the entire time. The rest of the cast was actually tolerable. The father did a great job. The story was somewhat interesting, although very predictable. I'm glad I finally saw it, just to get it out of my system. Although I don't plan on ever seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wanted a Second viewing - was amazed - re-wrote my review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing The Witch the first time I compared it unfavorably to the Shining and found it lacking some structure, expecting a psychological meta-narrative outside of the horror genre and outside the idea of witches in general. I wrote a review not really praising it but finding the film interesting. The film stuck with me, however.I then read "The Witches: Salem, 1692" by Stacy Schiff which is an historical account of the much later trials (that we are all vaguely aware of, but whose details I for one was unfamiliar with). It also contains some of the material and texture that the filmmaker was employing in writing his film. Reading the book actually made me want to watch the film again and evaluate it on it's own merits, not some half-baked expectations of my own. I saw it again and was amazed. I found the film to be powerful, extraordinarily disturbing, dense with period texture and a real horror masterpiece. The psychological narrative was not some modern re-imagining of a mindset plagued by superstition, but an historical reconstruction of an authentic, period world-view which was dramatically and brilliantly played-out - it is eerily effective. I was sad it came to an end - I wanted to see and feel more of the experience the film provides.I am delighted to have been so wrong about such an amazing film and able to enjoy it again, for the first time! I highly recommend this utterly unique film experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They get points for historical accuracy and characters, but lose points for, just about everything else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember back when we first started seeing trailers for "The Witch" or as it called itself, "The VVitch" (yeah, I still don't get the double V thing), and it actually looked terrifying. The trailers made this look genuinely scary, and as the film got closer, we started getting more hype in the form of reviews saying that this is "the most shocking movie you'll see" and "it feels like something we shouldn't be watching" and so on and so forth. It seemed like the closer this movie got, the more hype it received. Unfortunately, the film itself does not live up to said hype, not by a long shot.So, what's the story? In the early colonial days of America, a Puritan family is exiled from their town for religious reasons and forced to live near a forest. The family soon learn that the forest is home to a coven of witches that are conspiring to tear the family apart, which causes paranoia and finger-pointing among the family, particularly towards their eldest daughter, Thomasin (I think that's how you spell it). Now, if there's one thing that I have to give the movie credit for, it's the characters. Other than Thomasin and the twins, who are both unlikable and annoying, respectively, I found myself getting attached to this family. They didn't seem like cookie-cutter horror protagonists, but rather real people with real struggles. The father in particular was a complex character, one I wound up feeling sorry for. The movie also does a good job at trying to realistically represent the time period, even down to the dialogue, which sounds very old- fashioned and unfamiliar compared to modern English. Sadly, this is where the merits of the film stop. The fact of the matter is, the film works fine as a period drama but as a horror movie, not so much. The titular witches are barely ever on screen and when they DO make an appearance, they don't really do much. We don't know of their motivation, their origins, or really anything about them other than the fact that they're crazy flying naked women doing weird stuff. Of course, because of this, the movie has a noticeable lack of scares. It has a few creepy moments and disturbing scenes (including a very tasteless attempt at shock early on when the witches kidnap and kill the infant son of the family), but no real scares. All of this, um, non-action ultimately leads to nothing really special as the ending is disappointing and sort've out of nowhere. So here's what happens: the father locks his remaining children in the barn as he believes them to be involved with the witches. Somehow, a witch enters the barn in the middle of the night and runs off with the twins. The dad finds out, gets gored by the goat (more on him later), the mother goes nuts so Thomasin stabs her, and then later finds out that the goat is the Devil, very quickly signs her soul away to him, becomes a witch, floats into the air, the end. Yeah, it's THAT kind of movie. You know, I feel like this film would have worked better if there really WASN'T anything supernatural going on, and the family's belief system and paranoia were all that were tearing them apart, but when you try to still play up that angle while at the same time revealing that there really are witches doing bad things, it doesn't really work as well, especially when you have critics and audiences talking about the "paranoia of the times" and "rethinking your religion." I admit, the belief system of the early Puritans was questionable, but in the universe of the movie, when the things they're afraid of actually exist and pose a genuine threat, doesn't that kind of justify the paranoia a bit? This movie appears to send mixed messages. There's also another aspect of this movie that bugs me, and I've seen it quite a lot in these types of movies lately: the absence of God. The movie quite clearly establishes that the Devil is real, but he can't exist without God too, so why is he just mysteriously absent? These "demon" and "witch" type films lately give credence to the existence of the demonic, but for whatever reason leave God out (prayers and exorcisms don't work "just because", or Divine intervention seems almost nonexistent). As a Christian, this kinda bothers me. That's why I like movies like "The Rite" or even the original "The Exorcist" that showed the threat the forces of Satan pose while also acknowledging that the power of God can beat them. Okay, enough of my ranting, time to wrap up. "The Witch" is a film that doesn't work because it tries to be too many things at once: a period drama, a commentary on 17th century beliefs, a tale about family bonds, AND a horror movie. With all of these different genres thrown in together, what you have is a disjointed mess of a film that does some things really well, such as drama and character development, but other things like horror and a clear message, it falls flat on. This leaves us with a movie that should have worked and should have left me disturbed and emotionally shaken, but ultimately just left me disappointed and wanting back the money I spent on the ticket!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, not liking this boring POS does not make me stupid. I don't usually watch fast paced horror movies, with rapid cut scenes and multiple plot twists.I am quite happy to watch slow paced films - if they have an interesting story arc. This didn't.A family of religious whack-jobs are dumped out of the safety of the camp of even more religious nuts. They try to carve out an existence on their own. It doesn't go well for them. Stuff (duh! censorship!) happens.People die. The family disintegrates. The attractive teenage daughter survives long enough to get her kit off and walk naked through the woods to a coven of naked witches. End credits.And that's pretty much it. They speak in that annoying English/New England puritan "thou" and "thee" syntax.Oh and there's a witch lurking in the background. Which is unsurprising, as the film is called "The Witch." This film redefined boring for me. It unfolded at a snails pace. The only story arc was the obviously inevitable disintegration of the family. Throw in some hints of incestuous rumblings, some twisting bodies ala Regan in The Exorcist, a smattering of Denis Wheatley horned devil-demon, and some questionable teenage nudity and that's pretty much it.Don't fall for The Emperor's New Clothes angle that some people are trying to sell. Liking this film is NOT an indication that you are possessed of some form of superior intelligence. It's boring predictable twaddle, and you should do yourself a favor and avoid it.</fullReview>

I think I'll go with "strange Christian drama with the elements of pure boredom". Yup, that's it. This is a story of a very dysfunctional family who basically don't even know why they decided to live together. They just don't like each others (parents hate their children, children hate other children and animals hate their owners). And they live secluded because other villagers hate them all. Well, at least a brother enjoys watching under his sister's shirt - you can consider that as some liking. They pray when they are alone, or together, during dinners, when walking... OK, so they pray a lot. And they live close to the woods. Sometimes it gets dark outside. And it can be very cloudy. Maybe a little too cloudy and mysterious? And whose footprints are these? Are you scared yet? Yeah, me too. If I have to pick one scene that really stands out, then it has to be the moment when the kid gets lucky with hot Red Riding Hood. Well, I can only guess that, but he was nude in the next scene, so... Right on, my man! At least, the ending was pointless and laughable. Oh, right, that's not a good thing. Nevertheless, I decided to give it 2 stars. Why? Because I'm a generous guy. Go watch It Follows or As Above So Below if you want some recent descent horror movie. Leave The Witch where it belongs - with Hansel and Gretel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding true horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the best new horror film in several years. From the beginning, the film establishes an unrelentingly bleak and oppressive tone and barely lets up. It has some of the most upsetting and terrifying moments I can recall in a film. The cinematography is Oscar-caliber, and the soundtrack and sound design are top-notch. It kept me in a constant state of dread for its entire runtime.You need to watch this in the dark and in complete silence. You cannot talk through this film. It requires complete immersion.I'm very confused by the 1-star reviews I'm seeing. I can only conclude that these people do not have much of an attention span, or don't have much of a horror palate. Or, they've been conditioned to expect cheap scares like the scary face moment in Insidious. The Witch doesn't rely on jump moments, and to me that's a great thing. In the horror movie canon, I can think of a few jump scares that feel earned and really enhance the scene, but they are a small minority of the total. Some good ones would include the monster reveal in The Descent or the alien jumping out in the access tunnel in Alien. Most jump scares aren't like that. They're in the film to create fake tension. Unfortunately, I believe many moviegoers have come to expect the rush of adrenaline that comes with a jump scare and have come to associate this with the horror experience.I would urge the people giving it 1 star to watch a lot more horror films and try to really gain some knowledge about the genre, and then come back and watch this one again. As a horror aficionado, this was top-notch, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the Blair Witch to The Witch...a hipster crapfest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yep folks exactly that! I had heard a great deal about this new, little flick that could, a good vibe and positive word of mouth response and feedback...the darling movie at Sundance...So naturally, I went in to see it with some interest and some hopeful, albeit modest, expectations. After all this time of the year treats it's movie going audiences to a plethora of toxic cinematic garbage. Case in point "Deadpool", nothing more than a pedestrian cinematic mediocrity, sits at the top of the crap pile. So in order to avoid Ryan Reynolds at all costs and his painful mimicking impression at being edgy and original, I went for "The Witch" as somekind of anti-dote...And instead of anything remotely original, visionary or at least entertaining, I was treated to a overwrought, self-important, self-congratulatory, lazy and underwhelming turd of a movie! Interesting cast, gorgeous cinematography...the rest...forgettable, disposable and utterly inconsequential. You know, it is very easy to pick on big budget or genre movies and to bring them down and pounce on them. But indie movies have somehow gotten a pass over the years, because of this fake aura of authenticity they seem to carry whenever they come out of a film festival, like Sundance for example. Not this time. Nope, not at all. "The Witch" plain sucks...badly...and unfortunately in the process reminds me of "The Blair Witch Project" another fetid piece of putrefaction, which gives me vivid migraines to this very day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I trusted the reviews on this one and, boy was that trust misplaced!! The movie has a slow start and accelerates to a ho hum "are you serious /that's it??" ending. Although technically well done, the minimal story line doesn't do justice to the skill of the actors, director or crew; We've got dead end segments of "why bother" scenes and then there's the annoyingly low volume lines spoken too quietly and with heavy accents to the point the film needs subtitles. Not a scary film if you're and adult, but there are a couple of unexpected scenes that may startle a person of any age. Those very rare scenes are well done, but way too few. Finally, there's the curious, and repeated incestuous stare by little brother character to his big sister's cleavage. Big Sis, played by young hottie Anya Taylor-Joy, makes the film a must see for any dirty old sinner ?male or female and sadly, that's about the only reason to see "The Witch"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>75 Minutes of Non-Developing Exposition for an Unsatisfying End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why "The Witch" is supposed to be so "critically acclaimed". Amateur critics don't count. Won 5 awards... 4 were from people that live in their parents' basement and run awards nobody ever heard of and one was from Sundance, if that tells you anything about from where this acclaim is coming. Granted, a film doesn't need awards or recognition from major groups to be good (the reviews I most trust come from some cynical film fans on the YouTube), or even come from a major studio. But I think some people view these "outsider" type films as being instantly high art and great films just because they're not some "cold, materialistic ad space" or some other stereotype of major production films.I don't want to say it was bad really... the acting was good and the idea was good, it was even well shot for what it was. The problem was the writing/directing with one of the poorest executions I have seen in a long time.Without spoiling the film, there's a lot I can say. They try too many angles at once for the story and don't really develop any of them. This, I wouldn't even classify as horror, though luckily it did stay away from the modern "horror" tropes of not being horrific at all and relying on cheap gore or "jump-scares". If anything, it was more like a suspense film... but with all the suspense removed.The whole thing is one long build up, touching on all these details very superficially and not developing them until the last 10 minutes. Actually, about half-way through, there's a scene that makes you think: "finally, the exposition is over". Then it immediately ends that rising drama to go back into more exposition. They should have picked an angle or one underlying cause for the drama and developed it. But this goes on until the final 10 or 15 minutes of the film where the story just sort of hits a brick wall at 5 miles per hour. "Wait, that was it? I sat through all of this for that?".It is a shame that such good acting and shooting had to go to waste on basically zero story development. The only thing horrifying about this film is how positive the reviews seem to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not scary nor entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK I went into the theater with high hopes of a terrifying tense film that will disturb the crap out of you. Good reviews also were a key thing to this expectation. I walked out of the theater well... disappointed. It will not scare you or even entertain you. There are many horror movies that don't scare you but can still be a good time to watch. This isn't any of those. I have to get it credit, for its incredible dialogue, and how it's shot. Based on the time this takes place, they did a great job on making it appear as though it is in that time. The dialogue is the same as well. But the plot is confusing, you will eventually get lost. It's not really a horror movie until the final 15 minutes. The rest is just a boring story of a family surviving for the winter. This film is so dead with zero tensity. It is hard to keep up and even get what, who, or why anything is. The ending is especially bad, you wait 90 minutes for something exciting to happen but nothing does. Just skip it. It will disappoint you. Waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cinematography and the acting are amazing! Truly amazing. The sets, costuming, and props are magnificent. If you are a filmmaker, this flick is worth your time. You can tell that they are going for subtlety in the story, and it ends up being too subtle. Split between dramatic family dynamics, and the fear of a witch in the woods, the threads for tension are found and abandoned too quickly to give you a real thrill. It feels like they got written into a corner, so they take a left turn at the end of the 3rd act of the film, abruptly tying up "loose ends" subsequently leaving you with a "twist" that is so outside the scope of the world that has been created that it isn't even fun or shocking. It ends up feeling like you sat through a long period drama, and then got rushed through to the end without getting any impact. They talked about wanting the set and the props and all of the production design to be its own character, and unfortunately that does not come through. Yes, it is a beautiful and authentic backdrop, but it doesn't do much in the way of putting you deeper in the story. It's just a pretty set. I wanted my blood to curdle, I wanted to be creeped out, I wanted to feel like there was an air of mystery somewhere with a big reveal. Unfortunately this film has none of that. I've never seen such a flat story told with such stunning visuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hire a linguist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure what the point of this movie was. You never really find out exactly what happened. You're sort of left wondering what the point of the last 92 minutes was.The main problem with this movie was that they tried (and failed) to write it in an older dialect of English and failed miserably, because, despite being filmed in Toronto which has at least 2 universities offering a linguistics program, they failed to ask a linguist how to speak the English properly.They used the word "thou/thee/thy/thine" as opposed to "you/your/yours" throughout the movie. The first problem with this is that this movie is happening after the Brits invading North America. The term "thou" died before this. The second problem with this is that they used the term incorrectly. The word "thou" is the singular second person pronoun, whereas "you" was the plural second person pronoun, or the singular polite second person. If you speak French, the word "thou" is the equivalent of the word "tu" and the word "you" is the equivalent of the word "vous". At one point, William says to his children, "All of thee stop that!" and even a week later I am still cringing. Other wrong parts, is that for some reason, we assume the first settlers must have spoken present-day British English (even though there is no "one" British English), when in reality, North American English, specifically Canadian English is, is more like Old English than any dialect of British English. One major part of this was the the characters took part in the deletion of h's and coda r's. Do you know how we know the first Brits to come to North America pronounced all the r's and h's? Because we in North America still pronounce all our r's and h's. What, did these people think Brits had stopped pronouncing r's and h's long before they came to North America and that somehow the sounds reappeared in North American English? The other problem is they went all Shakespearean style in their talking. Shakespeare not only happened 200 years before the time of this movie, but it was written in poetic prose meant to be like candy to the ears and did not reflect how people actually spoke. How would you feel if people 500 years from now looked at our poetry and assumed we all talked in ridiculous rhymes like that? The whole movie was an ear sore. Next time either hire a linguist, or just talk normally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where's the horror? This movie had all of elements you would want in a great horror movie, except there was no horror. The music was chilling. The cinematography was strong in most cases, though it was hard to distinguish exactly what you were looking at. The dialogue could use subtitles, as these accents, whether fake or real, are uttered in such a glib manner that you'll have a tough time understanding. Oh, and the prayers. Someone is saying a prayer every five minutes in this movie. I thought I was at a Jimmy Swaggart prayer-a-thon. But that's not the biggest problem. This movie sets you up with suspense, chilling music, and some interesting imagery, AND DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WITH IT. Think of this as M. Night's worst movie except with no attempt to scare you. Watch it on NetFlix....not even the tiniest bit scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly this is not a horror it's more of a drama. There's nothing creepy, scary or horrific about it. These days it seems anything can qualify as a horror as long as it has some loud out of tune strings or choirs in the soundtrack..The film does have some good acting and cinematography though and also manages to create a fairly unsettled atmosphere throughout but overall this will not be enough to keep most people watching.This should never of been a film imo. I think it would have worked a lot better as a short, it just felt too slow with little payoff at the end.If you're expecting this to be about witches or a horror I would give it a miss, if you enjoy slow burn family dramas with a bit of mystery involved you might like it. I definitely wouldn't recommend watching it at a cinema though.</fullReview>

This movie has some decent cinematography and acting, but at the end of the day, its just boring and a roller-coaster ride of things happening that just don't make sense. The largest scare tactic the movie constantly turns to is something being there and then not, suddenly appearing or just flat out leading you to an assumption based on a series events. Its just boring. Couple that with an emphasis on old world speak (i get it, you want to give it a period feel, but Jesus this movie was hard to follow at times with this distant and forgotten vocabulary and dialect) and you have a real snoozer. keep your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow tale of the dissolution of a family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts with the banishment of a guy from a colony in America because he was too religious. What an asshole he must have been. Therefore he leaves with his entire family of wife and three children and a babe - plus several goats - to make a life of his own in an isolated cabin. When children start dying in mysterious circumstances, the family starts to break apart, while accusations and fear of witchcraft fly uncontrolled.I loved this part of the story and I liked that the pace is slow and uncomfortable. Nothing really happens other than see backward people do backward things and then suffering for it, but the acting is good, the pain is transmitted well and you kind of understand how they get to where they're getting.The part that I didn't like is that with all the setup, they had to introduce a few scenes with "the witch", which was absolutely superfluous. If they would have shown no witches and kept the viewer guessing, the impact would have been greater, I believe. Also, with a supernatural cause for everything the writer/director denies the viewer the choice of believing in God's salvation, in the possibility of controlling the situation by ordinary folk or of any hope for the ending. It's just like "Bambi meets Godzilla", the outcome is pretty much set. Add a slow pace to this and I am sure people will be upset of how nothing happens and when it does is inconsequential. Other than this one - important - detail, I liked the movie.Therefore I urge you to tweak the story in your heads when you watch the film. Consider all witchy things hallucinations of the people involved. Then you will find some meaning in the whole thing.P.S. for some reason I couldn't stop thinking of the video for KillSonik - Slaughterhouse, so that may have thrown me off a bit, too :)</fullReview>

The final half hour just dragged and went by very slow in comparison. It's hard to understand what the actors are saying so that doesn't help, but beyond that, it just wasn't a good movie. This is one of the lowest scores I've given. The only reason it doesn't get a 1 is because it tried so a 4 is for effort and some effective suspense. Don't get your hopes up.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully presented box full of nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So last night I saw The VVitch: A New-England Folktale. I was very excited to see this movie, having been swept up by the hype that preceded it, and, in all fairness, the trailer looked honestly promising. But perhaps because of these high expectations I was a bit let down. The psychological horror is decent, but the film is never really terrifying. Based on script alone, the movie doesn't deserve much more than a pass. Beneath all the period costumes and baroque language is a rather plain ? and sometimes even downright badly written ? story. But because, thankfully, a movie is made of more than just script, I was able to enjoy the other things it had to offer. One has to praise Mark Korven's chilling score (I could swear the violin pizzicati on the track Caleb's Seduction imitate a witch's cackle), the animal acting (arguably better than the human acting), and Jarin Blaschke's clever cinematography, which doesn't only create a genuinely creepy atmosphere thanks to its consistent palate of grays and use of natural light, but also uses a rather unusual 1.66:1 aspect ratio, a very subtle change that makes the shots more claustrophobic and gives the audience the queasy feeling that something isn't quite right. The research behind the movie is also noteworthy; the dialogue is based on writings from the period, making it pretty close to what real 17th century New England dialogue must have sounded like (there was even some well-informed accent coaching going on), and the period clothes and settings are very convincing (although its nerve-wrecking how the protagonist's braid remains un-tussled through wind and rain). Even the witchery depicted is historically accurate: a shunning of society and convention to connect with a raw primeval force of nature, rather than with the supernatural Satan, which is Western filmmaking's usual take on devil-worship. Anyway, if you like unusual flicks, period films and psychological horror, you should check it out. If you're a fan of fast-paced blood and gore, not so much.</fullReview>

Yes the cinematography is great. And yes, it has a really good creepy soundtrack. But not much happens in the movie! It's boring. Me and my friends had to keep making jokes to maintain our attention. The movie tries so hard to build suspense, but when the suspense ultimately has no pay off, it undermines the stakes of the movie. And you know, as nonreligious viewers we're just not all that frightened by goats, devils, and witchcraft. You have to try really hard to make that scary. And I'm told there's plenty of people that think this movie is really scary. But I don't see it.But what really does the movie in, is the fact that it has an unsatisfying ending. You can see it coming from miles away, and there isn't much of a pay off or a twist. And that's a shame, because everyone involved delivers a stellar performance.Ultimately though, The Witch fails to deliver.</fullReview>

It has a very good premise, settings are good, and overall tone was nice, as well as acting by all involved. But the thing that disappointed me was not the very clear narrative. I love when horror movies plays with you straight, like "The Conjuring" or (my favorite ever) "The Exorcist", but "The VVitch" is another type of horror film. It doesn't show you things straight, and i'm not sure that i understood the ending well. I messes with you, but at the end it doesn't have this "punch line", it's more like a mystery movie then a really horror film.Overall, "The VVitch" is OK movie, not a mainstream horror picture by any means, so if you like to watch some good creepy horror movie alone by in the late night, it will do it's job in terms of overall tone, but as a horror movie it's a miss. Still, OK movie but not a horror movie experience i was looking for.</fullReview>

A baby is abducted and further strife ensues while everyone prays for deliverance from evil.

Everyone knows that a witch becomes most powerful when she reaches puberty in folktales.. I mean why don't you smack us over the head with it...Next thing is that it's not scary like at all... I was really hoping for a good fright and was disappointed...All in all, the movie was good. Cinematography was great and the story line was well developed and focused.

It was also beautifully filmed, had a great score, and the casting was spot-on as well.The family was a typical "Calvinist (aka Reformed Christian)" family and if one understands Calvinism before watching the film, one will get a great deal more out of it I believe.Please note, I am NOT a Calvinist and consider Calvinism to be almost entirely unBiblical.I even asked my own children to watch this movie and afterwards we had a wonderful discussion and Bible study as the film deals with a great many spiritual issues and is a perfect film to discuss afterwards.One of the things that has always bugged me about many so-called "spiritual" movies is that they show Christians getting "possessed" when such is literally impossible. This movie did not do that and I truly appreciated such. Instead it showed devilish attacks and the like, but not actual "possession", at least not until and unless a character actually desired such, which is Biblically accurate.Overall I simply feel this is a marvelous film, historically realistic, Biblically accurate, and worthy of being viewed.Thank you for taking the time to read this review and may God's perfect will always be done in your life, no matter the cost,Author Repen T.

		<shortDescription>I ? think I understand it. I just didn't like it much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read that renowned horror author Brian Keene criticized the popular audience backlash against 2015's "The Witch," saying that "90 percent of the people in the theater ? will be too stupid to understand" it. Well, maybe I am among the stupid 90 percent. I'd name this movie as the most disappointing horror film in recent memory, and I'd rate it a 2 out of 10.I ? think I understand it. I just didn't like it much. It is alternately boring and sad. It is boring far more often than it is sad. When it is sad, it isn't the cathartic, meaningful, artistic "sad." It's just kind of a grimace-inducing downer. There are problems with pacing, tension and story structure. The movie only gets interesting during its closing several minutes.These problems, however, are overshadowed by the movie's biggest flaw ? most of the (literal) Puritans populating this period story are so unlikable that you'd care little about what happens to them. They are verbosely, tiresomely God-obsessed. I myself might strike a deal with the devil if he'd silence the two creepy tots, and maybe the shrewish, hysterically shrill mother (Kate Dickie), too. He wouldn't have to kill them or anything ? muting them would suffice.Yes, the film does succeed somewhat in establishing mood and tone. But the result is still nothing to write home about. This isn't "It Follows" (2014).The film has two things going for it. One, as other reviewers have noted, it achieves authenticity quite well. The sets, costumes and dialogue were so meticulously developed that I actually did believe we were in 17th Century New England. Two, Anya-Taylor Joy wonderfully performs the role of young Tomasina.Those two things do not redeem the film, however. I'd skip this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Movie Since The Shining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well some movies are a bit more haunting than others. The Witch is a Period Piece set in 1630's New England, American. It centers around family who moves out into the woods and suspects that there is a Witch that wants to hurt them. I'm just coming out honest that this movie is a 2016 Masterpiece in Psychological Horror. Let's start off with the acting.The Acting is amazing and each character fits their roles very well. There is also a lot of character development between the characters. The Mother played by Kate Dickie is the more sad character and you feel for her in her scenes. The two children played by Lucas Dawson and Ellie Grainger do very well for what they are given and are not that annoying as some other children in other horror movies. The Other Male Child played by Harvey Scrimshaw is amazing also for what he is given and really becomes his character later in the movie. Finally the two best characters were the father played by Ralph Ineson and the Oldest Child played by Anya Taylor-Joy are both fantastic characters and please watch out for them I bet there gonna be in some major titles soon (Anya Taylor-Joy is gonna be 2016's "Morgan").The Cinematography is top notch! Easily each and every shot in the film could be in a Art Museum. That's because there is a lot colors and depth to each and every shot which something we don't see in most films today. There are a lot of color schemes of Gray which work for what it is and is likable.Now the best part of the film is how scary it is? Umm... This Movie may just be the scariest movie ever made! There are tons of scenes with tension and lots of disturbing scenes (which I will not spoiler) throughout the film's run time. It also gives some time to think in between the disturbing scenes. Surprise! There is absolutely no Jump Scares in the film, the Film uses horrifying sounds, and disturbing images to scare the viewer to the bone. Also the Film oozes Atmosphere and tone which the tone feels like we really are watching something real and we shouldn't be watching it!In Conclusion, The Witch is a 21th Century Masterpiece and is my Favorite Film of the year. So do yourself a favor and go out, rent (or better yet buy) this Movie, Watch the movie with some friends, and live deliciously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death by Goat ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie certainly did receive a lot of love; 90% on Rotten Tomatoes. I found it quite a depressing story, where a family, banished from their community in pioneer America move out on their own to an isolated area and seem to be under constant threat of starvation. To make matters worse, they've moved into a witch's territory. Bad luck. So one way or the other, you know they're in deep s**t. This dysfunctional family of seven doesn't last very long, although they manage to partake in a lot of grief and infighting before their demise. I don't like seeing little kids getting yelled at and winding up dead. . . Oh yeah! And there's a killer goat, who also talks! Sheesh! The atmosphere, imagery and acting are all well done, but there really isn't enough of a story to make the film very intriguing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes before seeing this film but I was greatly disappointed. I thought it mite just take a creepy disturbing approach but it couldn't even do that right, which was a shame cause there was real potential for this movie. The extremely slow paced movie was made more unwatchable by the over the top vocabulary the cast used, I know they had to make it seem old but I couldn't understand what they were saying half the time. The only positives from the movie for me were the music did suit the atmosphere very well and the acting of the lead girl was quite good. Don't let the rating fool you, I advise giving this one a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the average horror/occult film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As of writing this I can think of many, many horror films that are coming out lately: Conjuring, Insidious, Sinister, The Possession, Babadook, and numerous exorcism based films. They all tend to be quite similar: jump scares, freaky imagery, etc. Well The Witch is not at all like these films.The film is set about 400 years ago in a very religious and puritanical world. A man and his family are banished from a community and set up a small farm on the edge of a forest. Eventually supernatural problems occur...Now don't think that it will be like the other horror films I listed. This film is slower and doesn't really feature anything too out there like spider-walking little girls or red-faced demons. Nonetheless it is quite thrilling for a horror fan who appreciates something different. And I don't think this is too much of a spoiler but this isn't a film where the protagonists can just shout about the power of Christ to make the antagonists run away. So it's refreshing in that way.Technically the film is very well made. The acting is good, the scenery is believable and you really get the feeling that it is historically accurate.I recommend it but do realize that it's a divisive film seemingly; some say its really scary (including Stephen King) and some say its so boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Likes : Well after viewing this film i can say all hype over nothing , what i mean by that is that that this film was advertised as being scary &amp; generally frighting well not at all. Yes there are some good point about this film the acting is pretty solid using a Shakespearian language in speaking along with its authentic costume design for the period this film is set in , the mood of the film is bad , but my god this film is so flawed in story scripting Dislikes : First mistake is the beginning of the film you see a family in a country for some unknown reason which is not explained they are cast out of the village to live in exile in the wildness which set not back story for the film so you just throw in to a film with not direction.Now the film is meant to be scary yet there is hardy anything happening apart from a baby that goes missing in a mysterious way , strange woman in the wood of a temptress witch that it , you get three moment in the film that were meant to be frighting &amp; psychological its just fails is so many way to be frighting. The pacing of this film seriously with not much going on seriously was enough to put you a sleep , this film had potential too be so much better with a more darker story instead its just a mediocre horror that trys to hard to be frighting by with hardly anything happening this is a very poor story in a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The VVitch' is a creepy and atmospheric psychological horror movie. Although there are no "hard" scares, certain scenes will haunt you long after the closing credits have run. The tension and horror only works in the context of people who are entirely convinced that Satan is real and striving every minute to trip innocents up with their own carnal urges, even in the most mundane, everyday situations. Due to the movie's use of authentic period dialogue, spoken in English/New England accents, sometimes mumbled or whispered and further hampered by the iffy enunciation by child actors, you have to pay close attention to follow the thrust of the dialogue in certain scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating and Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the earliest settlers to America were religious fanatics - The Puritans - who believed in strict, joyless adherence to their principles. One byproduct of this strictness was the growing belief that the Devil, through Witches, would possess the pure in order to lead them to wicked ways. This fanatical belief in witches led to the famous Salem Witch Trials of the late 1690's.Director/Writer Robert Eggers, then, asked the question in his film THE WITCH - "What if these fables and folk stories of witches were, in fact, true"? The result is a fascinating and disturbing film that doesn't flinch in showing the supposed results of Witchcraft.Is it a good film...not really. It's a little too slow and the Olde Engish language used is tough to follow (lots of "thee's" and "thou's") and, ultimately, the tale of a Puritan family's unraveling at the hands of the Witch is, as I have stated earlier, fascinating and disturbing to watch, but is it entertaining? Not really.Is it a bad film...definitely not. It is a strongly made film by writer/director Eggers who is better know as a Production Designer and it shows, as the production values are strong and consistent, but the plot is weak (there really isn't a plot, except that the Witch is tormenting the family) and none of the family is particularly easy to root for.So, do I recommend this film? Ultimately, I don't think so. I've used the words fascinating and disturbing quite a bit in this review and that is what this movie is...but entertaining? For me "fascinating and disturbing" does not equal entertaining, in this case.6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I kind of liked it -- but wouldn't recommend it for the average moviegoer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a well-done independent film ... but it's definitely not for everyone.Think of it like a critically acclaimed, low-budget foreign-language drama or art film ... if you'd normally go see a movie like that, then I'd recommend seeing it. Otherwise, this might not be the right movie for you.There were more than a few people who walked out on the movie in my showing - probably because they were expecting a more traditional "hollywood" style / mass-appeal movie, not Shakespearean-like dialog in a limited 17th century setting. I'd say that's 90% of the movie.Outside of that -- I kind of liked it after I let go of my expectations. It's dark, well acted and, even if the dialog is nearly impossible to understand, quite atmospheric in terms of a period piece.It's basically about a fundamentalist religious family that starts to experience misfortune when they separate from their settlement. Mentally, they can only understand the world in terms of being sinners and that fate is the will of God --- or is due to one of the kids becoming a "witch" by siding with Satan.Yes - there is a supernatural element going on - but don't expect to see as much as it as you'd get in a traditional horror / scare movie.Again - if good acting, atmosphere and foreign language or art-type films are something that would interest you -- then you have the right mindset and I'd say definitely it out. Everyone else -- I warned you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hmmm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It could be said that the point of this film is that the nature of evil is nature itself, as much of what happens could be explained, with today's knowledge and science, to be natural phenomena caused by the poor living conditions in the raw nature, but to this God-fearing farming family in 1630s New England, the unknown and unexplained was thought to be sorcery and witchcraft, as they slowly begin to suspect one of their three surviving kids may be a witch, possessed by spirits, following the death of their middle child.But it could also be said this film, and all of its grey-hued frames, should have been released in independent/ art house cinemas, because I don't think general audiences will go for such a slow burning (perhaps a bit too slow, at times) Gothic, folk horror. Images of injured and dead animals, and dying and dead kids, were extremely difficult to watch, I had to look away a couple of times. Quite a few (maybe 8 to 10 of the 40-odd) audience members left during the film, and there was a mass exodus when the credits began. Within 30 seconds of the film ending, I was the only one remaining, the only one who stayed through the closing credits.This has at least two endings, when the screen goes black for several seconds. The first time, another scene eventually follows. The second time, the closing credits eventually begin, which, as formulaic of a criticism as this may be, made this final scene feel tacked on.While the film got under my skin, to be sure, I'm not sure could recommend this, or ever watch it again. This film also reminds me of the tone of 1971's, The Blood On Satan's Claw, another Gothic horror I enjoyed, but probably couldn't watch again. The shot of witch in red coming out of the dilapidated cabin toward the boy was beautifully eerie, and reminded me of some visual Jean Rollin might have done in the early 1970s.I must give credit both to Ralph Ineson who, as the father, is excellent, and to writer/ director Robert Eggers for putting out such an uncompromisingly bleak horror film, not watered down for the PG13 crowd, but again, some of the images were too difficult to watch, even for a horror film fan like myself. Being a speaker of a multitude of languages, the use of Old English didn't bother me, but I can also understand why it put off a lot of reviewers.If this was screened at Sundance in January 2015, that means it must have been filmed in 2014 (at least, if not earlier than that) so why was it not released until February 2016?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie based on the reviews I read. I was GREATLY disappointed. I am a huge fan of the horror/suspense genre. I love "time period" movies. This one did that justice but as far as this being a non stop thriller; it missed it's mark! Never once was I scared. I had to finish it, kind of like a bad car accident; You just can't look away. There is neither suspense or horror in this movie. It is "time period" accurate but hard to follow without closed captioning. The acting was good; the writing wasn't! The voices are incredibly low and hard to hear but the music was super loud. Again, you need closed captioning because it is all in Old English. Truly a waste of five dollars on Amazon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I was cursed. I had to have been because that was one painful experience. I must've been bewitched into even watching this drivel. I don't know what I liked less: the constant yelling, the old English or the backwardness of the family.Just to bring you up to speed real quick: It's 17th century America and a family has just been banished from a colony due to their particular practice of the Gospel. Not long after settling in their new digs the baby is stolen away by what is presumably a witch. From that point on a lot of yelling, praying and insanity ensues.I couldn't understand them much of the time due to the accents, the speech and the volume. And remember, it's the 17th century which means no electricity--so be prepared for darkness to ruin some scenes. I know that the Salem Witch Trials were real but this movie just made a mockery of it all. The more the family doubled down on prayer the more psychotic they became. I don't know if this movie was about the frailty of faith and prayer or the power of witchcraft. Give me the good ol' green witch on a broomstick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artsy flick trying to mesh horror and psychology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, this is not what the trailer wants to make you believe it is, namely an enjoyable horror movie. It is an extremely slow, convoluted attempt to mesh conventional horror with a psychological study on 17th-century belief in witchcraft. Everything that happens is balanced so that it can be interpreted either way, which is probably fascinating to admirers of modern (degenerate) art. However, the movie makers didn't dare to carry this approach to the very end. The finale settles the movie on the supernatural side in a half-hearted attempt to offer some kind of rationalization.The plot and action are extremely fragmentary and devoid of logical connections; I don't know whether this stems from an attempt at surrealism or if it is aimed to capture the disconnected structure of popular imagination concerning witchcraft (and the way witch processes were carried out). Anyway, the film's broken structure, extremely slow progress, illogical behavior and lack of characters development shall frustrate any viewer not interested in artsy flicks.On the plus side, if you are patient, intellectually bent and interested in history, this is a very original, atmospheric approach to the witchcraft topic with nice visuals, good acting, lots of research, some impressive scenes and a refreshing immersion in a different age and culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was waiting for this one. I had heard so many rave reviews about it and really was looking forward to something fresh and new. However, the premise that is there in the synopsis(so no spoiler) about the family turning on each other is the oldest tale in the book! There is nothing 'chilling' or unexpected about it. In fact, it would have been more surprising had the family banded together to fight the 'evil'. It would also have give the story some much needed action! Now, I am not a lover of pure action gore only. I understand and enjoy the slow burn that leaves a lot of questions unanswered. This tale, though, doesn't have any questions, nor does it burn - at all. It is, however, shot quite beautifully. There are some jump scares and some unsettling gore (unsettling I say - for the uninitiated). The end is predictable and boring. Disappointed! :(</fullReview>

From the first few scenes it caries with it an intensifying dread, rarely if ever letting up. If you're looking for a slasher or creature feature, steer clear. This is a deep, dread building, slow burn, void of cheap jump scares.I could be mistaken, but I believe this is writer/director Robert Egger's feature length debut, and holy s**t does he deliver. He mentioned in an interview spending at least 3 yrs on the script, crafting dialogue directly from puritan American period sources as well as first hand "accounts" and myths. Boy, did he deliver. Believe me, this is a director to look out for.Special shout out to the casting director and actors. They pulled some unique and fresh talent. Everyone was on A-game. Specifically Anya Taylor-Joy whom I guarantee will be a household name in the next few years. She was standout.I could go on but I'll spare you. This film is so refreshing in a genre that seems to be lacking innovation and falling back on paint-by-numbers story telling. Prepare to watch a family be ripped apart by their fears, both spiritually and emotionally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slowly terrifying and disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To put it simply, Robert Eggers delivers a terrorizing horror in the form of 'The Witch'. Do not go into this film expecting cheesy jump scares and scary apparitions. This one does not do that. Instead, 'The Witch' delivers a slow terror, unnerving, and mentally exhausting horror. The constant questioning of what is happening leaves the audience uneasy and when this film finally starts to pick up, it consistently bludgeons the audience with eerie terror. Some dislikes I did have, however, were that the old English is sometimes hard to follow and it can be found as being slow at some parts but it is all part of the style that Eggers is delivering his haunting moments. This is another Indie win for the creative horror category. I would place it among the ranks of last years creative beast that was 'It Follows'. Check this film out and try to keep your sanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My kind of movie! Horror with a deep theme! Not the Conjuuring OK!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see why many people misjudged this film. For me it falls into a list of films that include a base theme while telling a story. Apocalypto it was fear, Revenant was about forgiveness, Remember was about revenge. For me the VVitch was about temptation and evil. All of these stories strongly connect with good acting by your characters, especially the character you begin to relate to. In the VVitch the eldest daughter Thomason is the focus. As the story progresses we can relate to her. The puritan lifestyle pretty much sucks. It's a hard life riddled with guilt and tedium. As she begins to realize the evil out in the woods she is drawn to it. The director gives us very shocking glimpses of this evil to let us know it is real but the witches are not the focus of the story. As an audience we want to see more even the brief images we see are ghastly. We want to see more just like our protagonist. Beautifully filmed, well acted with good themes this movie is not a monster movie. It certainly isn't shallow entertainment and it had me thinking the next day. My kind of film. Loved it although I know it's not for everyone especially the douchebags who gave it a 1 thru 5 stars probably gave London has Fallen a 9!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Good work with the contemporary music with violins and sad tones. Made by instrument that really sounds that it would come from the time of the story. Realistic scenes and even so very terrifying. The music and soundtrack makes the story and the subpoena horrific. Creeping upon you.... scaring me in a old, great way. Two worlds crosses and leaves the viewer in a realistic sensation of the strict holy life within "God Jehova" and the existence of evil; these two things just collide and creates the horror itself. The realistic and authentic pace and situations that clashes is more than enough to give this motion picture its atmosphere and message to the viewer. Even the language is old English and gives the film an even deeper touch of a authentic storyline.The entire living of a family being banned for religion in the 17th century is very well depicted, in language, picture and social considerations. A tragedy strikes the family and throughout the movie it is highly entertaining to hear how the family is speaking off and to each other,and also how a piece of time could in total be about survival, crops and religion.Some moments and surroundings of the production and the age which the story takes place in makes me think of another horror movie where a witch terrorizes the good; Warlock. Slowly evil is being shown through several signs within the crops and the family... slowly.... slowly it is coming...... High class horror and mystery movie!What brings down the rating from being terrific is the time in the middle of the movie to the impact of the witch. It could have been a lot more sights of the witch earlier and bringing more evil to the table in its pure existence. Another thing speaking of the negative sides is the more usual way of ending horror movies these days; evil prevails and win. That is just boring and wrong.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Very well made. Authentic and real. The picture and screen writing is plain and simple better than good, showing the cold weather and the harsh living. Sound effects and the music creates a frame in the mystery and the haunting horror in a fantastic way! The research of the religious Christianity and differences between Jehovas Witnesses and "ordinary" Christianity is well done. Give depth to the movie. - The actors : Great work showing the 17th century and how people lived by then.... the speech, the religious boundaries and the cold living for crops. Good acting is giving the story a really good sense. - The story : Good old fashioned.... good versus evil... a witch searching for more evil to spread around. Simple and straight forward little piece of art here in the storyline. - Entertainment : Had a good time watching this. All elements in this movie is giving viewing pleasure. - Age : 15. Scary and horrific.7,0 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment. 6 Nice production. Good movie.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The witch is a slow burn. It isn't filled with spooks and scares, but instead relies on an atmosphere of constant tension created by the Gray and barren landscape and its subtle yet foreboding string instrument score. This is the work of an up and coming great director who seems to understand directing much better than just about any horror director as of late. The camera stays pretty still the entire movie. There are no tracking shots, no 10 minute one-take scenes, and besides a scene in the beginning with the family leaving Jamestown colony, I cannot recall the camera moving much at all. This lack of movement helps emphasize the isolation that the family must be feeling throughout the entirety of this movie. Now most people I assume won't enjoy this movie at all. Nothing is spelled out for the audience(even the dialogue is accurate to the time- period, so it is not easy to understand, especially with their heavy accents). The "witch" itself is never given a concrete form , which I'm sure will also frustrate people, and the ending is very ambiguous and maybe even anticlimactic, but for me it worked. This is a film that begs to be seen multiple times and dissected. From the family members each mirroring one of the deadly sins, to the fact that this movie may or may not have unreliable narrator syndrome, the witch is a s=dense film. Besides some minor pacing issues and some bad choices when it comes to background/ off screen noise, this movie is a near perfect period piece horror film. A solid 9/10 and the movie to beat in 2016</fullReview>

The eerie atmosphere is evident right from the get go and is maintained throughout the film with camera shots/music etc. So very well done visually. The acting is also brilliant. I often find that child actors can be a little cringey in horror movies but in this case they outdid the older actors.However, I felt that each time there could have been potential for a really scary moment - whether that be a jump scare or something gory etc, it fell flat. It was definitely advertised as a horror and although it was filmed in a very creepy way which helped add to the tension, I felt it did not reach its potential and the trailer was actually quite misleading. I was also very disappointed with the ending, which was rather anticlimactic. So all in all, maybe not the first film I'd recommend spending your money going to see but it was entertaining nonetheless!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yesterday I went and watched this movie expecting it to be a really scary movie. That was my first mistake. If I wouldn't of gone into the movie expecting it to be scary, I'd give this movie a 6. This movie was not necessarily scary, it was mainly about the story line. The story line however was just OK. It's a traditional "old-time" witch story. My least favorite part was the ending. The ending seemed predictable and is what disappointed me the most. I guess you can expect this in a witch movie. The actors did a good job, and I liked the way the director made the characters look. Other than that, the director should of added a few scarier moments and make an ending that will forever be remembered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I select movies based on having at least an IMDb score of 6.5 or above. This movie was rated 6.9, so I rented it. I won't talk about it to give anything away, but I will say it was a huge waste of time and not worth watching.The speaking was sometimes hard to understand, and the plot never really came together. The acting wasn't bad, but again, the writing was.Hated just about the entire movie. Did I get 10 lines yet? I'm just trying to pass along to others that it isn't worth the time. It reminded me of another bad movie, Cold Mountain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're looking for scares look elsewhere, as this bore will deliver drama not horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came into this film with high expectations. Im not sure why, but i did, i must say i was disappointed. On the plus side the visual style is fantastic, the acting is great and the "concept" is a good one as well. It builds slowly and does make you think. The dialogue was great and some moments were a bit creepy. The story carries itself more like a drama than like a horror, and the main character does an excellent job at being portrayed as victim/ whatever else it is she is. My biggest complain comes from the slow build up, it is too slow before we see any actual horror. I am a big believer in psychological scares, no need for gore and actual violence to shock and terrify an audience, however this film did not deliver by slowly dragging itself in a boring slow paced drama masqueraded as a horror. The film functions more as a period piece, and at times i could not understand the dialogue. the ending was not clear and to be frank i noticed multiple opportunities that could have been used to frighten the viewers but were sorely dismissed. At times the film is misleading and the lack of clarity is what bothered me most. Its as if the entire film is building up to this dark reveal that ends up a mere shade of pale grey. The film is good and deserves to be seen, not as a horror but as a drama. If you're looking for scares look elsewhere, if you're a fan of film then you'll enjoy the cinematography and eerie chilly visuals. Thats about it. Final Grade, C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People Booed In The Theater After It Was Over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd never before in my life heard people in a movie theater boo after seeing a movie, until today. The place was packed, and people kept piling in after the trailers had started, so I thought perhaps the word-of-mouth was pretty good, and that it boded well for a positive movie-going experience. I'd heard it was slow going, which wasn't a problem, as sometimes, you need more time and measured pacing to set up a good story, but wasn't the issue at all.It was like watching The Blair Witch all over again. An hour and a half of ridiculously overblown drama capped off by nothing happening until the last few minutes. At no point during the whole affair was I horrified, unsettled or disturbed by what I was seeing, nor was I impressed by what I was seeing on the screen. I admit to jumping once, after the father was gored by the goat, but honestly, much like the Spanish Inquisition, no one expects a goat to suddenly come at you.It just seemed like such a waste. The acting was top notch, both the children and the adults, who all beautifully portrayed the severity of their situations. The cinematography was stark, yet gorgeous, and the premise alone was enticing enough to make me plunk down money for a ticket. But the metaphor of earthly woes being blamed on God's judgment/punishment and witchcraft fell absolutely flat, as did the drama of family turning on one another when the chips are down -even in this time period when superstition was high and such things were a common occurrence. By the end, the plot had made no sense and even when something finally "happened", the journey was not worth the destination.After the round of booing and the lights had come up, as the audience piled out, I heard declarations of how stupid the movie was and how disappointed people were, and I couldn't have agreed with them more. What a complete and utter waste of what was, on its face, a compelling premise. It's rare for me to walk out of a movie theater feeling cheated of my money, but honestly, that's exactly what I felt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very scary or suspenseful - we were disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We enjoyed the preview and looked forward to seeing this movie. Got our tickets, snacks, and good seats. The movie opened and set the stage quickly, and overall was well-paced. The cinematography was good, but scene cuts were rough at times. It was a good look at the rough lives of early settlers in New England and the difficulties in staying alive and raising a family outside the (relative) protection of a large settlement.We hoped to enjoy a suspenseful, scary, non-slasher movie. Didn't deliver on what we wanted. We expected dramatic tension and suspense, and were disappointed. We were hoping for 'edge of your seat' and 'jumping out of your skin', but experienced neither.</fullReview>

Attire &amp; score was on point. Some "WTF" moments in the beginning that had you wanting to see what was to transpire..but...It just kind of left me feeling flat from the middle towards the end. The premise was good &amp; it had so much potential to be great, but I left feeling 'meh...I just didn't see any solid, fluidity to the story and the ending came just when I thought it might start getting good...Basically, it just lacked a solid story. Instead there were a bunch of great beginnings, and that was that. The dialect I understand was spoken to the time period, but the way they spoke it, with accents and pace, made it somewhat difficult to understand and decipher at first. It was hard to keep up with what they were saying, which got to be annoying. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more had I found this movie on Netflix or Redbox, with subtitles &amp; lower expectations. While it's not an awful movie, I don't see the 7.8 rating it had at the time I saw it. I give it a solid 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A future horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This ain't no Hocus Pocus kids! Witches aren't usually the first port of call when coming up with horror film ideas. They work well with family film's like Nicholas Roeg's surreal adaptation of Roald Dhal's The Witches but can cackling old women with pointy hats and broomsticks scare grown adults? After seeing Robert Egger's striking debut, the answer would seem to be a resounding yes. The Witch is the best horror film since Kill List and is sure to become a future horror classic. I like to think of myself as a hardened horror movie nut but The Witch did actually manage to scare me, more so than the recent It Follows and The Babadook.It's a fairytale for adults and Robert Egger goes down alleys as dark as a film can get. Within the first five or ten minutes, I could tell that I'd be in for a stunning ride as we're treated to some seriously nightmarish imagery involving a naked old woman smothering herself in the blood of a baby, accompanied by a screeching score which is sure to give you the shivers. Terrifying sequences like this appear sporadically through the film so it never feels overdone, it just adds to the mounting tension in each scene until it explodes into the most wonderfully indulgent finale.A lot of films set in medieval times can be a bit trying. A Field in England and Black Death both felt like the setting let the film down by getting bogged down in confusing olde worlde Shakespearean-esque language. However, The Witch is never anything more than compelling throughout. The sole focus of the film is the family and all the parts are acted beautifully by the relatively unknown cast. The audience becomes incredibly involved and invested in the characters so you care about what's going to happen to them. There's a sense of dread in every scene but you're never quite sure about what's going to happen next which makes for unpredictable and absorbing viewing.I can't talk about The Witch without mentioning just how gorgeous the film looks. You could pretty much take any shot and hang it up for display in a gallery because it's just beautiful to look at. The eerie shots of the deep wood reminded me of Lars Von Trier's equally unsettling, Antichrist, however The Witch has a more fantastical quality to the images which adds to the Brothers Grimm fairytale kind of vibe. There isn't a second in the film's tight 90 minute running time where a shot doesn't ooze atmosphere. It's so refreshing to get a horror film which doesn't rely on a few seconds of gore to shock the audience, but actually takes it time to conjure up genuinely frightening images. There's stuff in this film which won't leave my head for a long time after viewing it.Equally as atmospheric as the imagery is the sound. I can't think of a more striking score or sound design since The Shining and it helps a lot to generate such an unsettling atmosphere. The exceedingly creepy dissonant violins and loud chants build scenes up to a shattering intensity where I found myself holding my breath. In fact, the whole film has such a strange and unnerving quality to it. It feels like you're watching something you shouldn't. It's no wonder that the film's even been endorsed by the Satanic Temple itself with the Temple's spokesperson calling it "a trans-formative Satanic experience." The Witch has to be my favourite film of the year and one of my favourite horror films full stop. I found it absolutely captivating and full of tension from beginning to end. It's pretty much as perfect as horror can get and exudes the quality of a classic chiller from the 60's. Robert Eggers is definitely going to be a director to look out for in the future. He's proved to critics that the horror genre is alive and well and can still genuinely scare the hell out of people. The Witch is a sensational experience for the eyes and ears, it's cinema at its finest. It is a delicious masterpiece of horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every now and again a movie comes along that for some reason, becomes a huge bandwagon and everyone hops on it. You read &amp; see all the hype &amp; buzz. You see all little award symbols on the movie poster (Sundance Best Movie blah blah, etc.). Then when you finally get around to seeing it you're like "Huh? What? THIS is what all the hype was about?"The Witch is one of these films. Based on the trailer and the reviews I already knew what I was getting into with this movie. But since I watched it online for free - I didn't care too much. The accents made it possible to miss 50% of the dialogue. The brother staring at his sisters breasts; huh?The goat is the devil; is it? What?An apple comes out of the boys mouth; huh?A voice talks to the girl at the end; cant understand one word it says because of the low volume and accentGirl walks into woods and see's naked woman floating up into the sky; so what? Now she's a witch? She likes this? Or is it against her will? Huh?I think many people saw this film and thought it was terrible, but they wanted to be part of the "cool, hip crowd" so they lie and say how awesome it is and scary. Trust me; it's not.The movie was a big waste of time. If you must see it, see it for free. DO NOT spend money on this thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Weird. This movie was definitely weird, and that in itself is not necessarily bad. Weird can be okay. I found this movie to be weird, unique, disturbing, interesting, and creepy. Not scary, more creepy. The good parts about this movie was the scenery, the acting, the uniqueness (no clichés in *this* film), and the time period (mid 1600's). The absolute worst part of this film was that I couldn't understand most of it. I didn't understand most (and that means over 50%) of the sentences. I wanted subtitles. I'm reading from others that the dialogue was a wee bit hard to understand. Ya' THINK? That's kind of like saying a cannon fired on a ship gives a few splinters. Anyway, I understood about 20% of the dialogue. The second worst thing was that it didn't tie things together. SPOILER ALERT (kind of): I waited for the end to tell me who the witch really was, what did she do, was the teenage girl insane (that would have been a better ending in my opinion), why did the mother hallucinate, was anyone really evil, what happened to Caleb in the cave, what happened to the twins, etc. etc. The third worst element was the over dramatized scenes for effect -- he gets gutted, she gets strangled, he upchucks a bloody apple, she gets the knife, he gets shot in the eye (but later, no blood!), she gets hen-pecked, the boy has a 1950 haircut... my WORD! And the ending was just silly to me. A talking goat? At that point, I wondered if the film was realistic and someone lost their mind. Nope. Sheer silly fantasy. This may be my failing in that I was expecting realism from a fantastical film. But the dark mood, the cinematography, and the imagery haunted me. The acting was superb. Also, the paranoia, suspicion, and mistrust that existed in a family who loved each other was done well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a Movie about Faith, not a Witch (You've been warned!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch is one of those films where heading into the movie you sort of need to know what you are getting into. This IS NOT a movie about a witch, it's about a family's faith being tested and the fallout that follows...all the while a witch lurks in the woods nearby.The Witch is being touted as a movie with pure, unrelenting dread. While that is the case at times, the atmosphere dwindles during the many times the characters repent. And they repent an awful, awful lot. I understand that the movie is about a family's faith being torn apart from within, but the movie's 'entertainment value' dips during some of those scenes. The tension is killed the moment they start bickering and doubting one another. It's just as one might expect, however, the Devil (evil) is a whisper in your ear which creates doubt with one's faith. And that is just what The Witch is, it's a whisper of evil. There are swift, small build ups that tease there is evil afoot, but just when you expect something sinister to occur, nothing. The hare, the goat, the raven (all heavy symbolism of Satanism) are all present. But they are used ineffectively half the time that they feel like child's play (literally at times) rather than signs of their forthcoming damnation.I really wanted to like this movie more than I actually did and that's a pity. A case can be made that the hype got the best of me, but I was just as hyped (if not more) for It Follows and The Babadook and those two turned out to be some of the best horror movies of the decade. The Witch did have moments of tension and trepidation, but when the time came for the payoff it simply wasn't sufficient enough to justify the many teases of evil.</fullReview>

There are glaciers in Iceland that are melting faster than this piece of Salem pig swill. Unless you have studied Ye Olde English, you will struggle to understand the actors, and as I did pick up every third word (and I am English born) Subtitles would have been helpful.The acting however is actually quite good, and the lead actor is from The Office in the UK. Very odd, as I kept on wondering when David Brent was going to turn up.The only redeeming feature was the goat. It must surely get a nomination for best supporting livestock at next years Oscars.If only the producers had done with this movie what they did with "real" Witches and burnt it.

IT WAS HORRIBLE! I have seen B rated movies that were better than this movie. I could barely understand the dialog and the camera shots were atrocious. I went with my sister and about an hour into the movie we were going to leave, but we hoped that it might get better, so we waited. By the end of the movie we looked at each other like "what did we just watch"? There was a couple behind us who asked the same questions; we were so lost. There was no suspense, no on the edge of your seat thrills. Save your money or go see Deadpool. Now that was a movie worth seeing. I have no idea how this movie got such great reviews and ratings. Someone must have paid someone off or they all saw something totally different. I do not know how it even made it to theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe my mistake was reading the reviews prior to seeing the movie because I was really looking forward to an excellent psychological horror drama. What I got was a kind of dull, slow moving, not-so-tense film that was a good study of a family's descent into madness. The first 10 minutes or so were very promising but then things slowed down to a crawl. The movie isn't really so much about a witch but rather how a family, in those times (and this is very important), dealt with adversity, pain and most importantly, the presence of evil in their home. I didn't find the movie scary but I did find it interesting. I like stories about early America and this film paid respect to the time with beautifully authentic costumes and language. It hardly mattered to me that I really couldn't understand a great deal of the dialog. The acting was so good that I was able to understand what was going on, despite the difficulty understanding the words. The film was obviously very low budget and you'll see this in some scenes but that's OK--the cinematography was great and it didn't have that same feel that many low budgets have, if you know what I mean. The acting of the main characters was superb--mainly Thomasin and the mother and father. The other kids were just OK. Finally, I didn't hear one positive remark from other people as they left the theater. In fact, most said they thought it was horrible. Guess it is that kind of movie--you either will love it or think its so-so. There's a lot of good about the movie (costumes, acting etc) to appreciate so it would be hard to hate it. It won't be a fan favorite and will probably be out of theaters quickly if word of mouth gets around, despite the great reviews.</fullReview>

I mean, on scale up to 10, if movie is rated above 5, then it should be worth seeing it in cinema... I guess.

Wikka followers may probably extract some sense out of all these spells, but I believe you can draw the same information from Wikipedia or specialised witchcraft sources, whilst seekers of adrenaline burst will certainly be disappointed - I wanted to giggle for the last 30 minutes - of this film if I hadn't been disgusted. Watching this opus is like watching a huge and almost completely static pile of human excrements - it's a pure, undiluted, concentrated and well seasoned crap.

		<fullReview>If you get the urge to go see a movie, let me tell you about the one I saw last night. The Witch... What can be said about this movie? The preview had a better plot. Yes the plot of the movie is different then the preview. It was so long and drawn out, that at times I wasn't sure if it was ending, or if it was actually going to go somewhere. The plot twists and foreshadowing music leads you to believe that it's going to come to a climax, and you start to look forward to something interesting, but then the screen goes black, and they cut to a new scene of the same drawn out garbage. It's listed as a Horror. But the only horror out of this documentary was the fact that someone invested actual money into it's making. The climax came before the movie started, because you are expecting to be scared out of your mind, the rest is a lecture of religion, like sitting through a 10 hour long catholic mass. No offence to Catholics, but your sermons are not really known for there zest for life. The end of the movie plays out beyond prediction, as if you can tell the director simply gave up on the film and had to make some kind of conclusion, and it makes about as much sense as wearing a winter coat to the beach in July and about as exciting. ... In short, if you want to go see a movie, and your thinking about watching this one...... Don't. Go to Walmart and look at what people are wearing. Trust me, that was actually more interesting and scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was highly disappointed by The Witch. I just don't understand why independent horror films keep failing to scare me these days. The closest anything has come to scaring me in recent years is perhaps Babadook and Goodnight Mommy, but even those fell a little short of their potential. In this one we have a handful of creepy scenes that are completely wasted, because this film so lacks anything resembling a plot that that's all they come across as, just random scenes.OK, here we go, I'll try to explain it (spoiler warning). A family is for some reason exiled from an early 17th century New England town, so they go off and find a spot to live on their own, but they don't seem to know how to grow or hunt for food. The family isn't properly introduced to us in the first place, so it's a little confusing (is there one or two families living together) but soon we figure out it's just one family with a lot of kids. They all talk like Shakespearean characters so it's hard to identify with them. One day the little baby vanishes in thin air and apparently there's some old witch living out in the woods who took him and I guess, ate him or something. From then on nothing is explained. The witch does make another appearance, but she's just a flash and she never becomes a character in this story, is never explained whatsoever. The older boy disappears in the woods and when he returns he's possessed, I guess, or maybe he's just sick and delusional. I don't know. The older daughter and the younger set of twins then start accusing each other of being witches because their goat gives blood instead of milk, while the mother thinks she's breast feeding her baby when really a crow is pecking on her. The father chops a lot of wood in at least four or five scenes of him chopping wood. Their goat then becomes murderous and everyone goes nuts and the girl discovers that the goat is Lucifer himself, I guess, and he tempts the girl to sign her name in his book and she goes off into the woods to float around in the sky with the other witches.The end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The horror movie the masses don't deserve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch, much like films like Kubrick's The Shining or Polanski's Rosemary's Baby just makes the viewer feel uneasy and nerved right from the start. A slow-burning, subtle and reserved experience that lets you resonate with the characters and really experience the unraveling of their family unit. What really makes this film special is that there's so many things that it could've very easily done wrong, but handled every aspect with class, tact and respect. The term 'Scary' means something different for everybody, so deeming this film as "un-scary" does not mean a thing, I will say though that this film goes beyond just 'being scary', it's not that kind of film. It's much more unsettling and unnerving, getting under your skin rather than being overtly frightening or gory. Frights last a moment, but the ability to not only get under you skin, but linger there is a mark of a truly great horror film. It's a story about losing faith, it's a story about guilt and how those things can tear a family apart. For those wanting a 'fire and brimstone' monster feature, you'll be sorely disappointed. This film is much more in the vein of masters like Stanley Kubrick, Ingmar Bergman with even a touch of Andrei Tarkovsky. It's amazingly and intimately well crafted and shot, scored, acted and researched. It takes its time to tell the characters' stories, but does so with a strange, otherworldly and totally supernatural feel. It's just as effective as an intense drama as it is a horror film. This is the kind of horror film that will be discussed for years to come, and only comes around once in a blue moon. I don't want to give away anything in this review, but I will say this: For those that really enjoy the art of film, storytelling, character building and the craft in general, believe the hype. It's excellent. But for those expecting a gory and fun, cartoonishly-satanist and jump-scare littered monster flick, stay away and don't ruin it for the others trying to enjoy their theater-going experience. You'll end up not enjoying it or will find it to be a tedious and boring watch. Even though at a trim 90 minutes, if you find it boring, you have no attention span whatsoever, but that's besides the point. To cap it off, this is the kind of Horror film I'm always waiting for, especially considering the droves of wanton garbage that flood the theaters week after week, and after looking forward to the film for nearly a year and a half, I'm glad to say that it delivered on all fronts. It's as flawless of a film as you can get, and for this to be Eggers' debut feature, he's in for a hell of a career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Witch" is a stylistically inventive cautionary tale, but is lacking in basic entertainment value.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1692, Salem Village and environs, within England's newly-renamed American colony, the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Political upheaval, town and family rivalries, religious disagreements, constant fear of Indian attacks, and some individuals' psychological and medical conditions created a perfect New England storm that exploded into what history calls the Salem Witch Trials. Based on unquestioned belief in the Bible, these colonists believed in the literal existence of witches and demons. Stemming from a lack of scientific knowledge, the Puritans also ascribed many natural occurrences to God or the Devil, depending on the prevailing opinions in their society. And, finally, the lack of separation of church and state in Massachusetts Bay meant that their government wrote and executed laws (and sometimes executed their people) based on their religious principles. The result of all this was a mass hysteria which occupied the colony's governmental apparatus and legal system for over a year and led to the killing of 20 accused witches. Now, having said all that, I have to tell you that "The Witch" (R, 1:33) is not about the Salem Witch Trials. However, taking place in the same general area 32 years before the witchcraft hysteria in and around Salem Village, all the same elements play out in the life of one Puritan family.William Nolastname (Ralph Ineson) is an extremely pious man, so pious that the leaders of Massachusetts Bay invite him to take his family and leave. (This is kind of like ISIS breaking away from Al Qaeda for not being radical enough.) William happily packs up a horse-drawn cart and takes his wife, Katherine (Kate Dickie), teenage daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), and son, Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), the younger twins, Jonas and Mercy (Lucas Dawson and Ellie Grainger) and baby Samuel even further out into the wilderness. They establish a homestead in the shadow of a deep, dark forest, but, despite their fervent prayers, things aren't going quite as well for them as they would've hoped.Life is tough in colonial America and it's even tougher when you're a day's ride away from anyone else. William's crops fail and the hunting ain't so good either. Then, baby Samuel disappears. One moment he's enjoying watching Thomasin playing peek-a-boo with him and the next, he's just gone. The family assumes he was taken away by a wolf, but the audience knows that the reality is even more frightening. As the family members venture into those forbidding woods looking for answers (and food), things go from bad to worse. Caleb disappears, family members reveal uncomfortable secrets to each other and as their stresses and insecurities build, serious accusations of witchcraft are tossed around."The Witch" is a stylistically inventive cautionary tale, but is lacking in basic entertainment value. The characters speak in Old English (think: King James Version of the Bible) and with antiquated British accents. This makes the dialog simultaneously interesting and hard to decipher (although it does get easier as the movie progresses). The acting is outstanding which, when combined with the small setting and even smaller cast, gives a realistic, even voyeuristic feel to the action. The plot, however, is intentionally un-realistic. First time feature film writer-director Robert Eggers has based the dialogue on actual official records and personal journals of the time period, and his story, on popular folklore and superstitions of the day. The result is a film that's original, but convoluted, and has open-ended plot points that call to mind a more European style of filmmaking which many Americans find frustrating. With a terrific cast and original (or at least, unusual) tone and style, along with great educational value (in understanding how something like the Salem Witch Trials could have happened) and relevant lessons as they relate to the dangers of religious extremism in the modern world, "The Witch" is just a little too overwrought and unsatisfying for me to call it "entertaining" and recommend it.

		<fullReview>The only thing scary about this film is that you have to pay to see it. I was truly disappointed and feel Walt Disney could have done a better job with it. The accents of the actors was very hard to understand at times and you had to really try to listen to what it was they were saying. The costumes and scenes were good as they did portray that era and what it would be like to be living in those conditions and times. The movie did try to be a scary thriller, as some critics stated it was supposed to be, but only with a couple of scenes (two or three). After a while the film got to the point of where it became boring as you waited and waited for something to scare you or make it worth while to see. Finally, the ending came and you sit there in disbelief thinking on the money and time you wasted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prize for worst movie I've seen in &gt;10 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the worst (almost comically so) movie I have seen in theaters in at least a decade. The best part was when a man started snoring during the movie and a brigade of movie goers had to try and wake him up.The new england accent was so thick I couldn't understand any of the dialogue (native American English speaker). The story was awful, and the actual "Scary" parts were non-existent. We basically had to guess the plot, which was lacking in every aspect. The end of the movie was bad. The beginning of the movie was also bad. We were thinking of leaving but all had a naive hope that it would get better. It did not. ON top of this the theater was garbage so perhaps my experience is worse than the average, but the movie is still awful.Save yourself the 10 bucks and go see 10 cloverfield lane, that movie is pretty damn fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen this movie compared to "The Shining" in reviews. Maybe because they both had credits, were in color and were put on film, but that is the only thing they have in common. The Shining is a masterpiece of horror and suspense. This is just a piece of..well, I digress.Other than the three "cheap scares", using overblown music and jump out tactics, and the BAD rubber prosthetic makeup, there was no horror. There was little suspense. There was a cheesy plot. There were undefined conflicts. This was a historically accurate (Except for the machine woven knit cap) piece that tried to be something it wasn't. It missed across the board. And BORED is what I was.I do give high marks to the actors, that handled the archaic language nuances and seemed to be in character, but a mediocre script, and a lack of intensity/direction sunk this flick. My wife, a big horror /paranormal movie fan, was disappointed as well.I should have known something was up when links to the "preview/trailer" landed on the Director explaining how he tried to be authentic to the time period. The three mildly scary parts were the entire movie in a nutshell, so there was no need to spend $20 to see it. Wait for it on Netfix and go see "Deadpool" again.</fullReview>

The best thing I can say about this movie is that it's only 90 minutes long. 90 minutes of trying to understand what the people are saying,and hoping to catch at least a glimpse of "the witch". The acting in the movie is actually pretty good. It's just the movie itself that sucked. I have no idea where these fabulous reviews are coming from. People actually rejoiced when the movie ended.

		<shortDescription>Not a "horror" movie - just a "horrible" movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many others, I was swayed...and fooled...by the overwhelmingly- positive reviews here and elsewhere. I'm still baffled as to what anyone found scary, frightening, horrible, unnerving, disturbing, etc about this film. Almost nothing happened in this movie. It was mostly an indecipherable look at a Puritan family alone on the 1600s American frontier and how guilty their version of Christianity made them at every turn. This film badly needed subtitles. I get that they're trying to be authentic but when 75% of the dialect is not understandable...well, that just makes the movie that less watchable. This movie needed the actual "VVitch" to appear more often. That might have made it more interesting. Instead, it was just scene after scene of the family's mother and father beating themselves up due to their warped fundamentalist Christianity. Black Phillip the Goat gets the lone star of my review, mostly for what he does near the end, which sped up my exit from this complete snoozefest of a movie. Same your time &amp; spend your money on a different film. This one is horrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. If your own nightmares have become less frequent, and you find yourself able to sleep peacefully through the night, writer/director Robert Eggers' first feature film will likely fix that. Based in 1630 New England ? a full 60 years prior to the Salem witch trials ? much of the story and dialogue is based on actual historical documents corresponding to the fears of that era. It would be a mistake to head into this one thinking it's going to having you covering your eyes or springing from your seat ? it's better described as unsettling and disquieting.Religious fanaticism plays a key role here, and is actually behind a Puritan family being exiled from the community. They set up a home and farm on the edge of an ominous, heavily-wooded forest ? and things start to go wrong. William (Ralph Ineson) and Katherine (Kate Dickie) are stern and stoic parental units to coming-of-age teenager Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), her younger brother Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), two spoiled and annoying twins Mercy (Ellie Granger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson), and a new born named Samuel.This is a slow-burn psychological horror film and it never relies on cheap jump-scares. Instead the eerie atmosphere, lurking Satanic evil, and unraveling of the family as they search for answers, all combine for a level of creep that's not often seen on screen. Adding to our pre-conceived notion that things rarely end well for closed-mind religious zealots is the unsettling use of Old World English ? it takes some time to adjust your ears.Most of director Eggers' background is in short films with an emphasis on Production Design and Costume Design. It's interesting to note the gradual decline of lighting as the movie progresses ? most notably on the opening and closing shots of daughter Thomasin, who faces the most backlash as a suspected (by her family) witch.This was a time when people prayed for food and for God to have mercy ? and to explain the unexplainable. No amount of praying can make sense of the titular witch (Bathsheba Garnett), or the family's goat Black Phillip (voiced by Wahab Chaudhry), or an evil bunny that would make Monty Python proud. The dingo taking their baby might actually be a preferred explanation.Eggers won the Sundance Award for a Director in Drama, and the film was nominated for a Grand Jury Prize. Mark Korven's score is unique and the perfect complement to the on screen happenings of this poor family. The film stays true to the time period, which of itself, feels like a parallel universe unfamiliar to most of us these days. Young actors Anya Taylor-Joy and Harvey Scrimshaw are real finds, and director Eggers will have a built-in and well-deserved audience for his next outing.</fullReview>

I don't know what movie the good reviewers saw but people left the movie theater I was at, teenagers, older people, The movie started out with almost no seats, by the end there may of been 10 of us left in the movie theater. All of us were taken back we were like the reviews said it was a good movie best horror movie in awhile ... To sum the movie up Disappointed. If someone paid me to watch it again I wouldn't.I honestly believe the good reviews were people who were paid to write them, or paid off critics, I bet they gave out gold and diamonds in the review bags, maybe some hard cash too, threw one heck of a review party because the movie I saw was awful I'd give it a -2 stars because honestly if you turned off all the sound ignored the dialogue and fast forwarded thru the violence and the really bad ending, you *might* have a beautiful and sad sense of what it was like to be a pilgrim in the 17th century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Witch" was stupid and it is not a horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting to be frightened out of my mind, to have nightmares, to see homicidal witches around every corner....No. After seeing "The Witch" last week, as the packed crowd for the evening showing laughed at the ending credits, my conclusion is that "The Witch" is an unbelievably ridiculous and poorly done drama set in seventeenth century New England. The movie was about this overly religious Puritan family consisting of a father, a mother, a baby (which gets kidnapped at the beginning),some twins, a son, and a teen age daughter. They get kicked out of a conservative religious congregation for being too "conservative." The family get banished to a dark and creepy forest where they get their butts kicked by their own fear and stupidity, and then later on get knocked off one by one (except for the teen age daughter)by a group of homicidal "killer" witches. I hated the whole damn family and didn't feel sorry for them at all. At all. First of all, this is my blow by blow description of why I hated them. First of all, there were the twin children who screamed and ranted throughout the picture like a bunch of god damn idiots. They were a big annoyance and distraction throughout. Why? Because they took me right out of the movie whenever they showed up on the screen. I felt like getting up and telling them to shut-up several times. I hated the extremely pathetic, needy mother. I thought the hulking, clueless dopey father was a moron. I was stunned at the stupidity of the son who had no sense of the danger he was in. I felt sorry for the daughter who just let everybody run over her. A lot of things in "The Witch" didn't make any sense. Like when the family's baby was kidnapped at the beginning of the story, you would think they would run back to the town they had left and gotten the police to help them (which is what you normally would do in a situation like that). They didn't. I felt no sympathy for these people. And the ending was too idiotic to be believed. The teen age daughter gets turned into a naked crazy witch who flies in the air, laughing (with other, flying naked witches). Huh? What was that all about? The ending felt like it came from another movie. Well, like a Ken Russell movie from 60s and 70s (if you know who he is). See this movie at your own risk. Or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Witch is not a film, it is an exercise in showing off mood with zero story throughout the entire running time. If you want nice visuals (which this film has) go and watch music videos on YouTube. Without going into too much detail, the characters have so much promise- they are meticulously researched by the writer/director. You feel like you have stepped into the past. But this feeling fades within the first few minutes as they are not developed at all. Not once was I frightened or scared, I actual felt ill as the film attempted to shock and build tension but failed every time. If you want a similar film that succeeds, go and watch The Shining. You care about the characters and you feel the tension. I went in with a friend and for the first time we both wished we walked out. Boring, perverse and not worthy of your precious time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most other reviews here, I was lured to this movie by an intriguing trailer and high IMDb reviews. Well, there's goes IMDb review credibility. The movie had nothing to do with horror, and barely had anything to do with a witch, but was little more than an old world family religious drama. I'm not going to waste too much time getting into the thin story but it was basically dead boring. The mother of the family was way over the top and desperately needed a good smack. The other characters were uninteresting or downright irritating (the cartoonish twins come to mind). Within the first 20 minutes, I knew I was in trouble. It just got worse from there.Several people gradually walked out of the theater, and I should have been one of those smart enough to know nothing would redeem this mess. When the movie ended, the entire remaining theater groaned and were very vocal in how much they hated the movie. What made it worse was that I decided to treat a couple of friends of mine on a Saturday night to what we were all excited to see, but unfortunately I lost $34 and a couple hours of life that could have been better spent doing something more entertaining or interesting, like lancing a boil. But we did get one unintended laugh from the film, and that had to do with a crow and the mother. But don't go see the movie to find out what I'm talking about, it's just not worth it.</fullReview>

The final credits cite contemporary records as the source material for the film. The fantasies, paranoia and superstitions of half-starved,Puritan settlers for whom witchcraft was a clear and present danger were brilliantly treated, for example, in The Crucible, but totally wasted here. The acting was overwrought and each character seemed to be following an arc independently of the others. The cinematography was OK I suppose but it would be difficult to film remote New England forest landscapes and wide, dramatic skies badly. We couldn't wait to leave the cinema and, judging from the restlessness of others, we were not alone. Wish I had done more research before buying our tickets. After a wonderful season of Oscar nominated and other works of brilliance this was a total disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfect subtleness heaped upon thrill after thrill surging into a thematic climax for the Ages! This truly is singly the way one composes a great work of art, not the only way, but feted surely to enter into the annals of History, may the Royal Society pay heed for the best is yet to come from this fantastic gentleman and fine scholar: Robert Eggers. By giving us more than the wonder that lies far beyond the mere meager middling minds and souls of the average creative, Roger extracts from the vast quarry of the vast beyond, giving us not everything, for how can one know such things, but by digging and never stopping, until he extracts just enough, a fine and lustrous rare seminal diamond akin to one of the greatest films which surely must stand the test of time. This is exactly how one moves the protagonist about a rich and robust plot disporting through a prevalent terror yet using the directing as a sort of spectral narrative in whose fiendish features, mobilize and galvanize the garrison for an all out assault on both phenomena and phenomenal classic reality. This is exactly how one wants to incorporate multi courses of ancillary characters whose affecting dialogue and multi-tiered peregrinations teeming with the style and wit of feeling from a seething stew over a hot steamy fire, perhaps a Witches stew, making everything start! And this is how you want to bolster a precious universal undercurrent whilst the classical prose like narrative, by one whose sophisticated sensitive nature of the most supremely intelligent persuasions brings it all together in an influx of manifold rhapsodical titular thematic explosion feted in supreme meritorious value; Pathos! This guy is a diamond in a sea of sinking wanna-bes', Who dare say, they cannot wait with bated breath for his next masterful work of art, and I want to stress the word artist, for 'The Witch' is a triumphant feat in the realm of classic works, a true opus! Truly loving it! Every dang second of it! Forever! "Clickety Clackety!" Will it have the lasting power, the answer is already in the past, Yes, for it has already met its long term goal, and so, justly all its short term goals fall right into place. In the now, it has awaken a complex system of outward signs yet masked as dowdy gewgaws, but inside a strange transmutation has given rise to a deeper understanding of those opaque things which dance with the cold gusts of hot importunate winds by our casements and lure us with fantastic shapes and forms into concupiscent realms of sepulchral fancy. It is compact yet eerily spacious. It has more than enough to make us ponder, then later reflect. Perhaps in the offing, posterity might hark-back and use this masterpiece to add the missing piece to the plight of our human puzzle, to effect change from the paternal quagmire our forefathers were presented with, dispatch with the hoax and forthwith call to the arms of science with a dash of the savage thusly spare us more wasted time, whereupon we are henceforth cast out of the darkest of centuries and hurled headlong into a polar contra-distinction so incredible, so fantastic, so irreprehensibly, inextricably sound it will make the nonce but a sad and petty prospect whose superstitious tenets bring only more discord and disharmony as a unified humane whole, with which to disobey would but surely shake the very foundation of sanity; conversely, we would all brainlessly stumble forth and crumble such to revert back to genuflecting at another more pernicious, more malicious tabernacle. Wake up, Heed the message festooned by 'The Witch's Jeremiad, let us step out of the penumbras of redundant turgid superstition which hitherto fells opportunity, and forthwith! Aye! give reason, science, logic and the arts the light for a new age! Lest one sits about in idle fancy, For 'idle hands are the devil's workshop'. So I say pray, beware of the witch and her resonating superstitions which rend and sunder all in her terrible wake borne on the wings by the lashing winds that echo her maddening prophecy in the night by and by, Alas! Do we want our children gamboling about half mad from fright mingled with confusion at the endless traceless nursery rhymes? 'I be not Mercy, I be the witch of the woods, and I come to steal ye', hear me stick a-flyin' through the trees, clickety clackety, clickety ... God Bless the children of the beast!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>psychological "horror" not for the typical horror fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atmosphere, performance, and musical score were all excellent but I don't see the average horror fan enjoying it much. No jump-scares. Other than the initial infant sacrifice there wasn't anything truly horrifying, gruesome or scary. The religious/superstitious/paranoia among the family is the real focus and anything supernatural that happens is more of a punctuation mark. The music keeps you feeling tense and unsettled throughout, which I'm impressed by, good eerie music can make a scene of someone washing dishes seem ominous, but visually everything is pretty anticlimactic. It's not a bad movie but it's not one that sticks with you. It's a one and done kind of movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blair Witch Prequel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first return to IMDb reviews in a while. I am doing my review on account of the message board thread entitled A Slow Burn Into Nothingness. That could be considered good or bad depending on the interpreter. I called my review Blair Witch Prequel? because it could almost work as such. Two films of a different camera style ultimately achieving the same goal. Minimalist entertainment through symbols and suspense. The end result is also equivalent. you've heard the hype, now see the movie! Either you love it at the end or you feel duped. Both films have that kind of story that make you wonder whether what you are seeing has any supernatural elements or if the people are just going mad of their own accord. I find myself hard pressed to say whether or not I truly liked either film. Each one has a quality and level of talent that I respect. The Witch probably more so. However the buck stops with the expectation factor, and what the audience wants from a so called Horror Movie. Both of these films fall somewhat flat in the scares department. In terms of disturbing imagery The Witch does a great job, but somehow it lacks purpose. Even old ghost stories of the early 1900s seem to have some particular point to them. I'll admit, I felt in terms of what this film offers in terms of cinematography, style, music, and acting it is damn near perfect. What's missing is the ability to care for the characters. Even the annoying kids of The Blair Witch Project managed to make me worry about them. So I'm writing this in agreement to those who were disappointed by this movie, and at the same time defending it to those who outright hate it. It ending up making me think about it a little longer, and I certainly appreciated the quality of the atmosphere, and imagery, Therefore I retain A great feeling of respect, yet remain wishing it could've somehow been "more". I have decided it would make sense as a good prequel to The Blair Witch Project, but in the end you'd have a double bill to provide that slow burn into Nothingness, and I'm not sure that's a good thing unless that's what you are looking for in a film. I myself prefer a little more intensity either in urgency of dialogue or in connection to the sequence of events unfolding. This film covers all the marks, but somehow lacks any emotional appeal.I guess in terms of more recent Horror, only The Conjuring will remain at the top of my list awhile longer.. Even though it started out better than it finished, it's the first modern horror film that left me invigorated and excited about it afterwards. Kudos to The Witch for trying, and being unique enough to stand out above the crowd. Next time more cowbell!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prepare yourself for what happens. More disturbing than anything, not for the faint of heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We will conquer this wilderness. It will not consume us." William (Ineson) is the patriarch of a devoutly spiritual family that is raising crops and 5 children. When the oldest, Thomasin (Taylor-Joy) is playing peek-a-boo with the baby she opens her eyes to find it missing. No one believes her when she tells them what occurred. Little by little the crops begin to fail and the family is tested. Eventually the truth is revealed. This is a hard movie to review. This is defiantly a horror but I found the movie to just be disturbing and not that scary. There are scenes in this that just left me wincing and feeling like this isn't something I should be watching rather than scared. This is nothing all that in your face and not gory or anything like that, and it's not the subject matter that got to me. I can't explain why I felt like that but when you watch it you will understand. This is a movie that is not for everyone and I rarely say this, but watch the preview and read the reviews first before you watch this one. Prepare yourself for what happens. Overall, more disturbing than anything, not for the faint of heart. I give this a C+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unholy....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this one with high expectations, I'd read various commentary suggesting how terrific it was.Alas, it would seem I was mislead. This feels rather more like a rehash of one of the Salem Witch movies, but this time it's just one little family who are seemingly failures at farming, and seem equally inept at hanging onto their children or preventing them from going in religious rapture against each other.Overall the best and most interesting (amusing really) part was the fathers reference to 'an unholy union with a black goat' directed at the twins who seem to be about six years of age. The goat will have his reckoning however which is one of the better parts of the entire movie. Of all the acting going on here, this goat is sure to get a follow-up job, perhaps in marketing for PETA?Whilst dark and broody, there is little else here for the horror genre, the 'witch' who like all before her seems to live in a basic leaf covered lean-to in the forest is a little creepy for all of her very brief appearance if more so than her seeming interest in 11 year old boys, 1 year old boys, rabbits and goats. Ultimately the 'horror' comes not in the form of the witch, but in a place you probably don't anticipate early on, but it's not really horror, its more just gore for the purpose of having it.The acting is actually very good, it is just the script that really lets this movie down, and the absence of any particularly good story or character development. There is, as one should expect, a lot of god squad praying and religious mania, I imagine the modern equivalent of this ignorant zealot nonsense would be a Donald Trump rally or an anti gay marriage meeting - there is just a little too much prayer and a little too much action going on, however I imagine that is fairly typical cause and effect as far as praying goes. The mother of all these children is as mad as a hatter, completely bonkers as again we all too often get with religious nut cases.If you like dark and brooding, black goats, religious mania, crazy mothers and Paedophile witches then this is the film for you, if however your tastes verge more on the normal and sane, and you look for more than dark screens and suspect goats in your horror, I would look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another flick that some will love and others will turn off after a few minutes because this is just about characterisation. Don't get me wrong, it's not your straight casual horror, this has other things to offer. It takes place in 1630 and we do follow a family who are extremely Christians but when their newborn son go missing and the crops fails they are sure that one of them is a witch. the language used can be difficult for some because they do speak like in that era. It's just about this family and towards the end you will see if there was a which among the family of it was all in their minds. The spoken words and the score used will turn a lot away but if you are fond of the dark ages and all witchery going on back then then this is a must see, if you think this is the next Witchfinder general (1968) with all the torturing then you are wrong, it's just mom and dad and their children. nothing to do with effects just a pure story.Gore0/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 1,5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch is Robert Eggers' directorial debut, he also wrote the film. It tells the story of a family that is banned from New England and moves into a farm in the middle of nowhere in the 17th century. There, they start to experience weird things as there may or may not be a witch causing trouble nearby. I'll just start off by saying I really liked The Witch, but I think a lot of people will be disappointed in the movie because it's really not a conventional horror film. In all honesty, parts of the first act kind of bored me. There were parts in the beginning of the film where the movie does slow down a lot and I actually nearly fell asleep. But that's where I realized this movie was more about the characters than the actual witch. It's a film about this struggling religious family and how they react to this certain type of situation. Even if the first act was pretty slow and I didn't know where it was all going, nearing the second act of the film, all of the third act and especially the ending was amazing. It is a movie filled with tension, every scene is filled with it. You feel like something could happen at any moment. There are many things in the movie that just blew me away: the directing is brilliant, the cinematography is beautiful and surprisingly, the acting was spectacular, especially from Anya- Taylor Joy who plays Thomasin, the main character. Her performance is brilliant and I really hope to see her in more films in the future. The score is haunting and really fits the movie's tone and the editing is pretty unconventional and I loved it. The editing lets you in at take a peek at the horrific things happening, but it never gives away too much information and it really is a prime example that the things you don't see are more terrifying than the things you do see.One of the things I really liked about the movie was that it felt pretty real and accurate. It's a very good depiction of the 17th century I believe and one thing in there that was great was the dialogue. Everyone speaks in old English. You know, like "How art thou this morning?" And things like that made the film feel real. The dialogue is kind of hard to follow but I can't really say that's a negative because it's built into the fabric of the film and how it wants to be more realistic.The last act and the ending is some of the best horror I have seen in years, maybe even ever. It's so gripping and tense and I just felt dirty and disturbed after watching it. It got under my skin in the best way, I thought the Witch was terrifying. However, like I said I think most mainstream movie-goers will be disappointed in the film, because there are no unnecessary jump scares and the movie moves pretty slowly.Besides from a few boring parts, I loved the Witch. It's a brilliantly crafted film, tonally perfect and scary as hell, too. One other thing I really liked is that this movie features some blood and gore at parts but it was never like violence for the sake of violence. The violent parts of the movie were there because the story needed it.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something lost along the way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always preferred horror movies based around tension rather than gore or jump scares. When I first saw a trailer for The Witch it seemed like the perfect horror movie for me. The time period and setting are even enough to bring chills just thinking about it but I am sad to say that these are probably among the best features of this movie. The Witch fails in so many ways that I am having trouble remembering the few things in which it succeeds, and those few things are not nearly enough to save this disaster.I don't want to make this review a list of things I hated about the movie followed by praise for Anya Taylor-Joy so I will begin with her performance. Really the only highlight of the movie, Anya Taylor-Joy brought the fear out of not only the terrible things happening, but also the feeling of being trapped as she was. Her character was the only one who I really felt for through the movie as all of the other characters were dis likable for the most part.I guess I will start with the story and whatnot since that is probably my biggest complaint. The story goes nowhere. The plot seems to be a series of boring farm chores and deep prayer scattered with a few moments of fear. There was no sort of effort to make the story circular, or to really even bring many of the things brought up in the beginning to a satisfying conclusion. The old saying of "Don't show a gun in the first act if you aren't going to use it in the third" is disturbingly broken here. The worst part about the story is that it is not even innovative. The normal worn out horror genre format is here with the first hour of the movie being a crawl with a brief moment is horror splashed in. Then the last half hour aims to shock and disturb leaving the last 15 minutes for the real scares. The Witch does all of this poorly as none of the moments of tension hit nearly as hard as they think and the overall payoff is not clever or satisfying.The direction of the movie is filled with close up reaction shots that most of the time amount to nothing. The camera will show a character horrified and then when the viewer finally gets to see what is so interesting it always ends up disappointing. There were absolutely no shots in this movie that were really impressive. The look of the movie actually was also impressive, but when juxtaposed with basic camera placement and movement it just offsets each other.Good horror movies are a dime a dozen these days, but The Witch seemed like it had a good understanding of how to make a good one. Again the time period and subject are a wealth of entertainment for this genre but the makers of this movie got lost somewhere along the way. I would not recommend this to anyone other than people who really like horror/thriller movies just to let them have an opinion. In my opinion this one is an easy pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if Puritans wrote Country-Western music?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, imagine a world where movies that make you feel good actually exist in the form of a drug. So, like, in a typical ED, you might hear someone shout -- "Damn it! They watched 'Mr. Holland's Opus' right after 'Love Actually'!" or "We got another 'Scott Pilgrim' cut with 'But I'm A Cheerleader'! Get a cart!" Are you imagining that? Okay, good. So, since the feel-happy movie drug exists and can be overused, there exists the need for an antidote, a "Shawshank Redemption" naloxone. "The Witch" is that movie. It telegraphs its intentions to chew up your soul like gas station beef jerky early in the film, and it makes good on that promise, and then some. Not only does it violate the horror movie casualty taboos, it gets those out of the way early on so it can move on to the meaty center of your desire to live in this world any longer. It borrows more than one actor from the "Game of Thrones" crew, and I can easily imagine them wrapping the project with relief so they can get back to their wacky, more family-friendly adventures in Westoros.(Also, if I were the devil in this situation, I would have gone a much more efficient route. Teenagers take forever. I'd go with a much more goat-heavy portfolio. #teamgoat #itatleastmademefeellikeagoodparentthough )</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie - worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very well made, with some great performances - notably Kate Dickie as the wife/mother. She is very fitting to this role as was the male lead. What I loved: Its portrayal of the 1600's puritanical thinking; strong ties to religion and therefore the devil, willingness to see the devil in anything that went wrong. The desperation of trying to hold on to your family and way of life. The performances of the actors were tremendous and very believable. The mother/ daughter relationship was well done - the daughter looking for her mother's acceptance and approval, the Mother always at odds with her. The younger siblings that were as annoying as today's younger siblings. The bond between the siblings. The setting, so lonely and isolated. The animal scenes, i don't want to spoil anything so i won't say more. The building desperation over grief, fear, threat of starvation. The ending - loved this. The twins were creepy! And I loved that I had no idea if there really was a witch, and if there was, who was it.What I didn't like: What season was it in New England that there are no leaves on the trees yet the weather seemed temperate? I'm thinking November, but they must have been some really hardy people. They never once seemed cold or were tending a fire. Whereas a movie like The Revenant literally made me feel cold throughout, this one seemed to be filmed during an Indian Summer. The music - I liked parts, but hated how the music would rise and get louder only to simply end in literally nothing significant. It would simply change to a black screen and then a new setting. While the music was exotic, it failed to match the tempo of the scenes. The dialogue was hard to hear and at time I could not make out what was being said because of both the accent and the old style language.I would definitely recommend seeing this movie - but I do think that it could wait until it is available on demand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't been scared of witches since?well, never. As I child, I was more frightened of creepy dolls and serial killers (probably the result of a premature viewing of Child's Play); witches just reminded me of Maggie Smith dressed up as Minerva McGonagall. While watching Robert Eggers's The Witch, I was genuinely creeped by witches for the first time in my life.In early 17th century New England a puritanical pilgrim, William, (Ralph Ineson) is at odds with his plantation's church. In an act of religious pride he moves his family outside the plantation's walls and into the unsettled Northeastern wilderness. However, when William's daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), allows the newborn to suddenly vanish, the family begins to descend into chaos.Going into the theater, I was anticipating reviewing The Witch as a genre film, but don't be fooled by the title; Eggers (the film's rookie writer and director) has far loftier aspirations. The script is thematically dense and every element of the film, from the lighting to the camera movement and placement, compliments those themes. The dialogue, too, is, at times, almost impenetrable and undeniably ambitious. Don't expect cheap jump scares or a threadbare plot.This, alone, would keep The Witch firmly entrenched in the realm of pretentious art films, but in Eggers, and his entire team's execution of these ideas, the work is magnificently elevated. It is a tonal masterpiece. From the beginning montage, where we are introduced to the world of the supernatural, to the ending's chillingly satisfying final image, you can see the meticulous calculation that went into the making of this movie. The result is a slow burn that never feels boring, but instead leaves you waiting, in anxious anticipation, for a moment of terrifying climax. Moments like that are why we go out to the movies. There's nothing better than that sense of fulfillment, especially when it's tinged with a lingering psychological thrill.My lone misgiving with the film, though, lays with the acting, Perhaps, in his concentrating on the stunning visuals, Eggers ignored his child actors, who periodically seem lost in the script's archaic diction. The adults are fine, and I was mesmerized by Ineson's gruff, haunting voice, but young Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson) are occasionally grating, and distractingly so. Even Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), who nails his important exorcism scene, falls flat on a few of the lower-key scenes. Taylor-Joy is the lone exception. She is mesmerizing throughout, and I wouldn't be surprised if she becomes a breakout star as a result of her work here.Those few hiccups won't ruin the film for a student looking for an interesting, new scary movie to occupy a study break, though, and for cinephiles searching for the next, modern horror classic, The Witch is your ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Expect Jump Scares, Expect Real Scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am very hesitant to go see horror films in the theaters because most of the time they only provide the cheap thrills of jump scares and do not really have any actual "horror" to them and I always leave the theater feeling cheated. I took a gamble with The Witch and boy oh boy I was not disappointed. The combination of the authentic feel of colonial New England, the devout God fearing family, the foreboding woods, the bone chilling musical score, the brief glimpses of the actual witch and chaos she creates, all of it works so perfectly together.Now I would not recommend this movie to everyone. The tension and horror slowly builds for over an hour until the final act so if you are impatient and want a beginning to end nonstop horror ride then you will be disappointed. The movie starts out quickly with the abduction of the baby Samuel (along with a VERY disturbing scene that shows you the extreme evil the family is facing) but then kind of dials back as the family dismisses his disappearance as an act of a wolf. Even though it is pretty slow in the middle the cinematographic shots and music keep you gripping your armrests throughout the whole movie wondering when the next time something sinister might happen.I wasn't 100% happy with the ending. It seemed pretty cool and different and might work for some people but it seemed a tad bit gimmicky to me which is a shame since the movie avoided such gimmicks for the ENTIRE movie until the last 5-10 minutes. That being said I don't know how else the movie could have ended but I guess that's why I'm not a screenwriter! Overall I was very pleased with the movie and will add this to my list of annual pre-Halloween movies to watch. A good horror flick will leave you feeling uneasy and replaying scenes in your head for the next few days. It will also leave you sitting in the movie theater thinking "WHAT THE #%&amp;@ DID I JUST WATCH?!" The Witch did all of this for me and I will most likely be heading back to the theater to watch it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Your Typical Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the reason some people didn't like this film is because they went in expecting it to be your typical suspense-laden, full of jump scares type of horror film and that is not this movie. The Witch focuses on the psychological decline of a family - how quickly it can happen and how it effects the dynamic of the household. The horror aspect comes from the creepiness which surrounds this film. It's a throwback to old Hitchcock films, and more recently, "Goodnight Mommy," in that it makes you question what is real and what is not. The acting is superb. Every actor in this film will make you uneasy at one time or another, which, of course, is the point! The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10 is because I didn't love the ending. Well, not really the ending itself, just how it played out on screen. But aside from that I thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it. Just don't go in expecting tons of jump scares and gore because you will be disappointed. Instead go in with an open mind and leave feeling a little better about the dysfunctions in your own family!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Great Performances and One Director to Watch For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best aspects about horror movies is their unbridled creativity. Large studios have made it their business to corner the market on large tent-pole blockbusters, goofy comedies and stereotypical biographical dramas. There are only so many ways to make an audience laugh or manipulate them into tears; there are virtually unlimited ways to disturb them. For that reason horror lives largely in the realm of independent cinema where any young person with a dream and a vision can become the next Sam Raimi or Peter Jackson. Robert Eggers, director of The Witch seems to be aiming even higher.The Witch opens with William (Ineson) and his family leaving a Puritan plantation in New World, New England. Banished from the safety of the plantation, the family builds a humble cottage near the woods and struggle to make an ample harvest for the winter. Katherine (Dickie), William's wife fears death while the children begin to fear something much more nefarious hiding in the woods. This fear is planted when the youngest of the children, the infant Samuel is taken while in the care of the eldest daughter Thomasin (Taylor-Joy). After a series of incidences and misfortunes, the family begins to suspect Thomasin has dabbled in witchcraft.Robert Eggers drains the film of all of the predictable jump-scares and needing stock characters that populate most horror films, and instead loads his story with elaborate period detail and an overwhelming sense of dread. Each tableau masterfully evokes the stunning compositional techniques of Andrei Tarkovsky and to a lesser extent Carl Theodor Dreyer. His wide shots are alienating and contemplating while his closeups are symmetrical and solemn. Only the editing of Louise Ford and crew hints at a modern sensibility, everything else is remarkably old-school. Most audiences accustomed to the average schlock-horror may find this film far too pensive to endure. Especially given the fact everyone speaks appropriately for the time period.This is a shame too, because when this slow-boiling fright reaches its climax the pace only adds to the horror and shock. The constrained William and his family become victims of hysteria constantly looking for the grace of God when there is only deceit, hypocrisy, fear and the woods. Every single cast member is uncommonly committed to this film. Every once in a while there comes a film that graces us with one singularly brilliant performance. The Witch rewards us with three stars in the making; Anya Taylor-Joy, Kate Dickie and Harvey Scrimshaw who plays Thomasin's younger brother.The Witch joins the recent crop of decent horror films that seep into the mind, provide interesting characters and make monsters out of intricate details. The Conjuring (2013), The Babadook (2014), Oculus (2013) and A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) all build their horror on a foundation of dread and suspense instead of butchery and chaos. This is not to say The Witch isn't bloody; it is. Yet the primary goal here is not to disgust but to disturb in a way that makes you leave the theater with an unnerving shiver. If you're feeling brave and are incensed by the eerie The Witch will certainly leave a strong impression.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606; out of 5) THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: The Crucible meets The Shining meets Rosemary's Baby in Robert Eggers' well- received but wildly overrated debut film.GRADE: C+PLOT SUMMARY: Set in the 1600's, faith lends a shaky hand to a devout Christian patriarch and his family as they encounter strange occurrences in a small New England town. Labeled as heretics, the family is shunned by the community and settles near a dark forest with talks of witchcraft and other evil forces lurking about.JIM'S REVIEW: While the film is called The Witch, it is its subtitle, A New England Folktale, that reveals more about writer / director Robert Eggers' first film. Folktales were originally cautionary tales told to impressionable children to forewarn them of the dangers in the real world. The film uses its time and setting most ingeniously, recalling the religious repression of that period and the mass hysteria associated with sin and witchcraft in a Puritan village. It has also garnered the awe of many impressionable critics as well. While this psychological thriller has some strong and disturbing imagery, it cannot hide the many illogical twists in the plot that are more evident after the film reaches its unsatisfying conclusion.One is initially captivated by the story, production values, and acting as the film tells its tale of a family surviving on its own after being exiled by the community elders. There are strange satanic goings-on as they settle into the woods (a bad place to be in most fairy tale lore): daily fire and brimstone sermons from an arrogant shiftless father, William (Ralph Ineson), Katherine (Kate Dickie), a cold and hateful mother who seems more possessed than humanly possible, lustful glances by a confused son, Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), a pre-pubescent unhappy daughter, two creepy twins spouting evil talk, and a baby who goes missing. Nothing goes quite well for these outcasts.The atmosphere is indeed moody and eerie, although the pacing of the film is in need of some stirring. Eggers is a solid director, and a talent that shows much promise. He creates a wonderful setting with much historical accuracy and his penchant for occasional surreal images with black birds, goats, wild rabbits, and subtle uses of blood to accentuate the perils surrounding the family are haunting and very effectively done.The acting is uniformly strong. Mr. Ineson, sporting an anachronistic 21st century six-pack physique that could have tempted many a Puritan, handles the speechifying astutely and Ms. Dickie brings a sullen and disagreeable presence to her character, but it is the acting of the two younger members of the clan, namely Mr. Scrimshaw and Ms. Taylor-Joy who deliver the emotional connection needed to care about this stoic family and their creepy dilemmas.Yet, as the story progresses and more and more supernatural things befall these victims, the leaps of logic become harder to accept. Mr. Eggers' script ultimately lets down the audience. His flair for visuals compensates for a lack of cohesiveness in his screenplay. There is also an over-reliance of heightened sound effects and atonal musical cues that telegraphs something wicked before it comes this way. Just as folktales are themselves cautionary stories, The Witch may hold one's interest in its storytelling, but this reviewer must caution any moviegoer that this well-crafted tale will leave you more bothered or bewildered than bewitched.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderfully Made, Not Mainstream Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first: The Witch suffers from another case of misleading-trailer-itis. This movie is not a jump-scare fest laden with gory special effects and a killing monster. It's a paranoid drama that prides itself on being honest to the material on which it is based, the 1600s witch hysteria, and being really intensive on religion and escalating fear. It's a damn good horror film, better than most other garbage out today, and the only thing I can think of to compare it to in recent years is The Gift, not because of anywhere near the same subject matter, but because both movies capitalize on playing the pace and tone right, and having the audience constantly be at the edge of their seat. I went to see it because I heard of all the Sundance buzz this movie got, and I was not disappointed. The film centers on a family in the 1630s, trying to survive in the wilderness after being banished from their New England plantation, when sudden strange occurrences begin happening on their new farm, leading to a witch hunt amongst the family. It's beautifully shot, with bleak and dark colors throughout, and the pacing of this film is very well done. Though the first twenty or so minutes drag a little bit, afterwards it is nonstop suspense. The Witch feels like witchcraft, in that it sucks its audience in to another world.However, there are still flaws. For one, the musical score was not what it needed to be. In classic horrors like The Shining, the piercing score was unsettling and added to the suspense. In this, the score sounds distracting and painful to the ears. It's not a good addition, and should have been turned down substantially. Also, for a film that is only 92 minutes long, the ending does not feel properly set up. The ending is creepy, but it feels like once the "big twist" happens, nothing else comes to light. The overall resolution could have been elevated to an even higher and scarier level, if it didn't feel tacked on, which unfortunately, is exactly how it comes off, and as a result it doesn't stick with the mind too long. The imagery that is present throughout the script is very well done, where it is shown enough to be comprehended by the critical eye, but not too blunt to where it comes off as condescending or just pretentious. My personal favorite part of this movie however, was the fantastic unknown cast that was assembled. The lead protagonist, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), shows that she can handle parts that would be hard to pull off. She cleverly displays her paranoia, whereas when the rest of her family is going nuts over all this witchcraft, she is logically trying to figure it out. Though it doesn't help to be practical and logical when everyone around is so god-fearing that nothing ever gets done. All of the performances are spectacular, especially from the child actors. Since it is so hard to get good child performances, credit is entirely deserved where credit is due. The standout for me was the father William, played by Ralph Ineson, who had such screen presence that I was unable to take my eyes off of what he was doing. Overall, this film definitely is better than most other horror movies out today, though it certainly is not for the average film-goer. The story is compelling and somewhat original to other "witch" movies, and everything on a technical level is done very well. Mainstream audiences I fear will not find it very "scary", and that is because the film isn't going for that, it's creepy and unsettling. I feel that if one wanted to see a horror in theaters, go check this out. It's 92 minutes of sheer, suspenseful fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This won't be to everyone's taste.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch is an indie flick, it will be enjoyed by lots of people who are aware of this and were expecting this. It's a film for lovers of real horror, not Hollywood horror, people who have a passion for art films filled with great cinematography will appreciate this movie. The stereotypical, mainstream movie goer who is hoping for jump scares and cliché horror plots will ultimately be disappointed.There is a scene within the first 15 minutes or so which is uncharacteristically brutal and gory. The rest of the movie doesn't resemble this level of horror and this scene will last in your memory long after the credits have rolled. This is a horror, there is no doubt about that, it just isn't a horror in the conventional way of the mainstream Hollywood movies.A devout Christian Family are banished from their plantation and set up home on farm on the edge of a woods, in the middle of nowhere. Before long, strange things start happening, their new-born seemingly vanishes into mid-air and their crops start to die out. We see the stress and strain take its toll as they slowly begin to turn on each other and become more and more emotionally unstable. Paranoia, hopelessness and resentment are all strong emotional factors and we truly get to see how these traumas can shake a family to the core. Their distress leaves them as a collection of individuals rather than a compact family, vulnerable to the evils within the forest.The Witch is a slow burner, a very slow burner. There were parts which I found boring and seemed to drag for no particular purpose. It is a very heavy dialogue driven movie with very little action; it focuses on the family and their relationships with each other much more than what is lurking in the forest.The acting has been praised very highly but I honestly didn't see it as that strong. I can appreciate that speaking in Old English was a challenge, especially for the child actors and this showed quite glaringly. The father of the family and the eldest daughter gave the strongest displays, both showcasing their emotions very well.The Witch has a fantastic score, the music used is perfect, capturing the old era and adding very strong tension. The music used with the breath-taking cinematography made for one very special looking movie. It is full of panoramic camera work, slow and drawn out shots which create tension and atmosphere perfectly. You never felt like there was going to be a jump scare as it is very obvious that it isn't that type of movie, but the tension is there nonetheless ? it is essentially a very uneasy watch. Another strong aspect for me was the ending. I was watching the movie unravel, with underlying thoughts of how they would end this movie. I won't say too much as it's a spoiler free review but I was very, very impressed with how they did it. The very final scene was powerful and graphic, it ended in a way that felt very concluding way and ended in a climax of drama.I felt like I had an idea of what this movie was going to be like and I was completely wrong, leaving me at the time, slightly disappointed. I have since been able to appreciate The Witch for what it is and when I look back on it I can see how very impressive this movie actually is. I will be watching this again as I feel I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have upon my initial watch at the cinema.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not scary, but worth seeing anyway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror is inherently a very subjective genre. It is about as subjective as comedy, perhaps even more so. Both comedy and horror are ruled by emotions that vary widely from person to person. For example, most critics hate Adam Sandler comedies (with a few exceptions) but audiences still receive them. Why? Because they find it funny. The same can be said for horror. Paranormal Activity has gone stale for most people, but there are still a lot of people that watch it. Why? Because they think it's scary. There are going to be people that like the new Ghostbusters movie, and people that are going to like the new 'The Ring' reboot that is coming out this year (seriously).The Witch, like 'It Follows' and 'The Babadook' before it, follows a trend of critically acclaimed, slow paced psychological horror movies that perhaps unintentionally market themselves as epic monster pieces that are full of scares. The Witch isn't full of scares. The concepts behind it are scary, but you won't jump in your seat. I didn't at least. The Witch is a mellow piece that builds tension over time. The cinematography is beautiful, the writing is moody and matches the time period, the music is amazing (probably my favourite part) and the young leading actress Anya Taylor-Joy was incredible in her role as Thomasin.I liked it a lot, but it didn't scare me. I won't be having nightmares because of this film, and that is slightly disappointing. If you're able to appreciate this film for its story, watch it, but if you're looking for a movie to scare you out of your skin, this isn't it, unless you're afraid of Christian fundamentalism and/or naked old women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alright, but not THAT good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So another film that is once again over-hyped by critics comes knocking &amp; fails top live up to it's hype! The Witch!The film is basically about a witch that attacks a family in a farm in the 1630's &amp; is hidden thin the form a human being. That's it &amp; so I'll tell you about the film.The film was OK, but not worth the stupid hype &amp; 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes! I don't get what's so good about this film, I really don't. Why critics seem to like boring crap like this &amp; hate great films that are underrated is beyond me! What goes in their heads!? Anyway...The plot of this film was thin &amp; watery, but not too complicated to say the least. My issue with this film is the fact that it took abit of time to get going &amp; was also quite confusing visually &amp; dialogue wise. It got me abit lost at one point. But, we got there eventually when it DID pick up about 30 minutes in.The dialogue was confusing as with the pacing of the film at the beginning! Why they couldn't speak normally was annoying! I mean it's like talking to someone about Star Wars &amp; them not knowing what your meaning! The film makers &amp; writer/directer obviously got too wound up in this film that they forgot to simplify the dialogue &amp; what was going on in the first 30 minutes, if not the whole film itself! It may be obvious to YOU but it won't be too us! Make it general &amp; not biased! Also in all honesty, as much as I liked the simple plot, it was all TOO simple! Like you could say the plot within 1 sentence within 10 words or less! I mean I like films that have an easy plot generally as films now work too hard to be clever &amp; end up confusing viewers &amp; falling flat on it's face, but the least the could've done was add abit more complexity into it! It was too straight forward &amp; didn't have a twist or clever plot whatsoever! How critics liked this again is beyond me!The film did have some good points to it mind. The kills were interesting, the graphic violence did spice the film up abit &amp; also made up for the first boring 30 minutes! I also liked the actress &amp; the naked women near the end of the film! The goat killing people was quite funny &amp; entertaining!I had a feeling upon watching this film I knew it wasn't going to be epic &amp; judging by the over hype it shows you can't judge a book by it cover! Over hype usually means it's sh!t &amp; under to panned usually means good in the day &amp; age! We also never got to see the witch too which was abit disappointing! I overall found the film to be mediocre &amp; very below average at best! Watch The Boy instead as it's far more entertaining &amp; has a good plot twist unlike this film which is too simple plot wise &amp; too complex &amp; overly confusing visual wise, it should be the other way around complex plot, &amp; simple visuals with great effects! At least then it would be more entertaining &amp; worth the stupid over hype these stupid critics seem to churn up! 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A creepy, intelligent folk tale of 17th century American colonisation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although directorially akin to British ethnographic horror movies such as The Wicker Man, The Witch is a distinctly American pastoral tale that sees a family exiled from their community due to religious differences and struggling to survive in a no-man's-land between civilization and the wild wood. By using authentic-ish period dialogue, director Eggers recreates in his protagonist family a society steeped in the language and thought of The Bible. Alternating between piety and goat-poo, the family are repressed as much by language and thought as by an unyielding landscape and any supernatural menace the woodland may hold.Parallels are drawn between the family's expulsion from their community and the Pilgrim Fathers' flight from religious intolerance. At one point England is evoked as paradise and the family seem to have entered Hell. So to some extent, this is a parable of colonial experience.Eggers weaves a magic realist tale leaving most of the reveals to the final act. The witch is a creepy unnerving tale in which moments of dreaming and wakefulness, fantasy and 'fact' are not always clear. This world is lovingly concocted from old fairy tales and folk tales. It is unsurprising to find Eggers' subsequent work has included and adaptation of 'Hansel and Gretel'. Sometimes the symbolism is jarring ? the inclusion of a woman in red hood, offering an apple to young son recalls tales of Snow White, Red Riding Hood, and, of course, the temptation of Eve but its in-your- face post-modernism wrenched me out of the fiction world. The Witch rarely strikes a bum note by eschewing cheap stunts like leaping cats, sudden crashes and musical startles. Instead, the director opts for a disturbing ambiance that takes its cue from 'The Crucible' but actually delivers on the supernatural front. The cast - Ralph Ineson as father William, Kate Dickie as his wife and Anya Taylor-Joy, Harvey Scrimshaw, Ellie Grainge, and Lucas Dawson - help draw the audience into the family's travails. It's a great ensemble cast. Harvey Scrimshaw puts in a gut wrenching performance as a young man seduced to the weird side by a stranger in the woods, while Taylor-Joy by turns loving, willful and afraid offers the emotional fulcrum around which the family revolves and finally dissolves.This creepy tale may leave fans of mainstream horror scares disappointed but its scenes will stay with you long after you have left the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Devil holds fast thy eyelids"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New England, 1630: A family is banished from their plantation community over unspecified practical or doctrinal differences--father William's "prideful conceit" is all that we are told. They make a rough homestead in the wilderness, where their infant son disappears in the literal wink of an eye while under the care of eldest daughter Thomasin. . .catch the connotations of her name? A lot of creepy stuff follows.While the plot line's a bit too hazy to be truly satisfying, "The Witch" is better and more original than most recent horror efforts. If more solid folklore and theology were brought in, this film might have been really great. It also could have worked better if the supernatural were left out altogether and everything was kept in the characters' guilt-ridden heads?or at least implied to be. I got a little restless during the draggy middle portions which, luckily, don't last long. That being said, those who want lots of action and constant surprises probably won't dig "The Witch." This film is also quite bleak, so the easily dejected should also perhaps avoid it.An interesting blend of supernatural and psychological horror. Keeps you guessing who's really evil--the parents, the children, neither, or both? Is the rabbit just a rabbit, the goats just goats? Is the silver cup really just an heirloom? Is it deliberate witchcraft, unwitting obsession or possession, or is the family just stir-crazy, overworked, and over-worried about how they'll survive the upcoming winter? Some of the middle details, along with the turnabout at the end, help to answer these questions, though they don't entirely--and who wants them to? The children's attempts at fun and games?or are they more than that?? add a great deal. It's easy to see why young kids would be bored out of their minds and willing to do just about anything for entertainment in these surroundings.Obviously fairly low budget, but the directors made good use of what they had to work with. A small cast and narrow use of settings, but good visuals, costume design, and dialogue. The latter is easy enough to understand if you know your basic thee-thou-hithers, etc. Still, it's hard to follow everything in a few places due to the heavy accents and muttering, so subtitles may be necessary?I saw this in the theater, where there were none. While "The Witch" avoids stereotyping the Puritan characters as completely austere and humorless, it conveys the setting pretty convincingly. Good acting by all the main cast, but especially those who play the four children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a film. I generally don't like horror movies because I get annoyed by the standard Hollywood formula. It's refreshing to see something that is disturbingly all kinds of wrong.The Witch is not a jump-out-of-your-seat-in-terror-brown-your-pants horror film but what makes this film especially unnerving is that it feels real and plausible. Indeed, this story is inspired by a series of historical accounts. The story begins with a family in the new frontier of the US in the 1630s getting banished from their township and their attempts to create a new life by the edge of a forest. Nothing else need be said. Just watch and squirm and be prepared to look away. There are some truly unsettling moments.I can tolerate all sorts of weird and freaky stuff with my movie watching habits, but the Witch had me rattled and I've not quite figured out why or how. The entire cast was amazing - the guy from the Office who plays Chris the sleazeball, that creepy Lysa Arryn from Game of Thrones, all four children, led by striking newcomer Anya Taylor-Joy who was impressive as Thomasin, the eldest sibling. The eerie soundtrack and the use of shadows in the cinematography were also very effective. The manner in which this was filmed places the viewers in the midst of the family's struggles making us helpless voyeurs and at times maybe complicit... I'll stop right here.This is exactly how horror films should be done. It is one of the best horror films I've seen in a loooooong time. Very promising feature debut by director Robert Eggers. Here's looking forward to see how he translates Nosferatu as his new project. Really impressive. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am going to walk through the entire movie and explain everything that actually happens. Based on reading this, it is unlikely you will have a desire to see this movie, so stop here if you so wish, or just take my word for it that this movie is definitely worth a watch.Okay, here is The Witch at face value. The movie starts with a family of 7 being kicked out of a puritan community because...well I have no idea why they were kicked out, they speak in this crazy language that sounds like drunk Shakespeare. "Dost thou barter a pic sixpense for me ninny?" Is something that was said during this movie. So the family drives this wagon (that totally looks like it's going to fall over) out of Jamestown or Boston or some sh!t and drive it to a field where they're gonna start new lives. The father builds a house and other manly sh!t while the daughter plays peekaboo with the family baby. She closes her eye for like 4 seconds and loses the baby. Horrible babysitter. The family moves on, because you know, back in those days like 80% of babies died. Anyway, The father and eldest son go hunting and try to shoot a rabbit, but the rabbit looks at them menacingly and his gun jams and something flies in his eyes, which are unaffected for the rest of the film. Then the boy and father get home and the two youngest children are playing with the family goat. The next morning the boy wants to go hunting but his older sister won't let him go alone and so she goes with him. After like a mile the girl falls off of the family horse and the boy goes on without her and makes out with this hot but clearly evil woman who came out of a tree. The girl wakes up and runs home to tell the family, later that night the boy teleports back to the home completely naked. The eldest daughter is accused of being a witch because the naked boy who was left out in the rain won't wake up. Then he wakes up and it turns out he was just choking on a gross apple. Then he re enacts what would appear to be an entire performance of Macbeth before dying. The Father thinks a witch killed his son and does what every rational parent would do, and locks every one of his 3 remaining children in sheds outside. He then stays outside and prays while eating dirt. Meanwhile, a crow goes in to motor boat the mother. Morning comes, the family goat kills the father, the two youngest children vanish and the mother tries to kill her only remaining child. The eldest daughter stabs the mother, goes to nap in a shed, wakes up to talk to the devil, then goes into the woods where tons of tastefully nude women are dancing and flying. The end. That's the movie, but you have to believe me...it's worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anytime someone says something like "cinema as art", you know it's a rubbish film.The Witch is well shot, well acted, poorly written and poorly directed. The cinematography is good. The aspect ratio is unusual, but works well.The acting is good, and I liked the authentic-sounding dialogue, although it got a little talky at times.**** SPOILERS ****It's poorly written &amp; directed. There's an real lack of tension. The film starts with a bang - a witch steals and kills a child - and then... nothing. The witch is almost completely absent from the rest of the film til the end. There's a rabbit and a goat that seem to be possessed, but that's all. The film would have worked much, much better if the witch was a constant presence, even if only half-seen.Without that, the film just plods along. After such a dramatic start, it gets dull and slow. It's a real shame, since there's a lot of good things going on. The problem is that there is no tension. Certainly strange things happen, but the director is unable to sustain any tension through it.</fullReview>

The entire cast is outstanding and truly convincing in their roles, even the young children. The film is directed, from a technical perspective, in superb fashion as the audience cannot help but be absorbed into its darkness and desperation. The problem is that The Witch spends its entire run time setting up for a climax that doesn't really come. The audience is left hanging with no perspective. The ending is so weak that it renders everything that happened earlier as irrelevant. This is primarily because the film takes the audience exactly where we thought it was taking us from the beginning. There are no surprises, no real twists and the whole package is just a well-produced disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be cautious, let me start with SPOILERS ARE INCLUDED. That said:I will preface by saying I wanted to see this movie, and I wanted to like it. Historical horror has worked well with me in the past. The premise holds together as a great send-off. A family rejected by their community, forced to eke out an existence at the border of an ominous wood, fueled by zealotry and potentially paranoia. What the film does right: It is beautifully shot. It gives a great atmosphere of starkness, and one can palpably sense what sort of desperation could occur. The lighting of the scenes, with its low glow and candlelit imagery reinforces this. The sound works well with this (most of the time), and the actors manage to deliver some effective scenes, two in particular standing out. When a child first disappears, when a daughter confronts her father, these scenes by themselves read very well, if they don't connect well with each other. But herein lies the fundamental problem with this movie. It doesn't tell a story, at least not as a whole. As you watch the movie, scene to scene, it seems more like a series of unconnected or at best very loosely connected vignettes than a story. In a different sort of film, that may have been all right as well, except this is a film that takes a singular point of view with this one family. At first, it looks like it will be a story of seeking a lost sibling, then a story of paranoia, then a story of supernatural witches picking off the family, then a potential story of punishment for indecent thoughts as a sin, then a story of child abuse pushing a character to enact vengeance on her family, and so on and so forth. The longer you watch it, the more you are waiting for the moment for the plot to turn, for the story, or whatever message the film is trying to put forth, to present itself. Except it never does. The writing at the end of the film pretty much confirms it, as the film reveals it was based on numerous separate witchcraft stories of the era. It doesn't tell a story because it has no one story to tell. Following its anticlimactic scenes, you are left with an ending that is as unsatisfying as it is nonsensical, and numerous holes in both the story and plot. The titular witch is never really identified, whether it is an old hag, a younger counterpart, one of the main characters, or if any of these are the same person or not. . .and honestly, leaving the theatre I am not sure I cared. "Evil animals" switch likewise, from rabbits to birds to goats, with no specific internal logic or reason presented. Plot points are developed and just as quickly abandoned seeking the next "scare", but the scare never comes. And honestly, it is a shame. For a film with such great potential, a very worthy theme, beautiful shots, good sound, even a solid cast. . .I left never having any desire to see it again.Two out of five stars, being generous, and that is mostly for the cast doing the best they could with little, and for the talented cinematography and lighting/sound designs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing period piece with horror elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch is written and directed by Robert Eggers and is about a Puritan family in early 1600s who is torn apart by a witch living in a forest near them. Now I've been really excited for this movie for a while and now that I've seen it, I can honestly say that this one of the best directed movies I've ever seen from a first-time director. First off, all the performances in this movie are amazing, especially from the oldest daughter (Anya Taylor- Joy) and the father (Ralph Ineson). All of the actors aren't well-known so it was nice to see some new actors to look out for. Also, the tone and atmosphere make this movie what it is. This movie is really creepy, disturbing and, at some points, really hard to watch. Also, the musical score for this movie helps you feel the tension and uneasiness of what's happening. The cinematography and look of the movie also help set the tone. The movie is slow-paced and there are a lot of wide shots and it worked perfectly for this movie. Lastly, the ending was really disturbing and interesting. It's the kind of ending that is left up for interpretation and leaves the audience thinking about what it means exactly. If I were to say anything bad, it would be that this is not our typical modern-day horror movie. Compared to the horror movies that come out today, this is a slow-paced movie that will probably leave a lot of typical moviegoers bored and wanting more. This might be because of the way this movie is marketed, which shows it as a full-on horror flick specifically about a witch. While it is that in certain parts, this is really a movie about the effects that a witch has on a Puritan family. For what it is, this is a wonderfully crafted film that can described perfectly in one word: disturbing. I give this a 9.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, horror without cheap jump scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch is exactly the type of horror movie I have been hoping to see for some time. It's a movie that chooses make you think, listen, and pay attention. Too often horror nowadays gives you a couple jump scares, then another 10 or so minutes of bad dialogue and silly plot points that give you time to make a bathroom break and get a snack before the next "scary part". This movie never gives you that break from the dread, even if the movie is slow. It's obviously intentionally slow, to truly build the characters. However it lets you know right away that the witch is real, and it takes the most vulnerable of victims almost immediately in very gruesome fashion. This is sort of the brilliance of this film; it gives you a vile antagonist, but then centers the majority of the movie around the religious beliefs of the family, and how it is tearing them apart, and then let's you decide which is worse. This is the type of movie that will leave some questions unanswered, and while it has its gory moments, it's not particularly violent throughout. And finally, the last thing I love about this film, is that it's clear mix of a "true story" and a fairy tale, which one depends on which century you were born in</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it is time for a witch hunt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard a lot of good and bad stuff about this film. It was strange that in this world of found footage horror films, bad cgi horror films, and really poorly made slasher flicks that we could ever get a period piece type of horror that seems like it would be closer to a true story than any past found footage movie. I don't think this is some artsy horror film like "It Follows" was, but I do think it is in many ways a sophisticated horror film that uses a lot of language of that time period. Sadly I don't think that sort of old style speaking is going to appeal to the mass of people who wanted to see a horror films, but I do think that it will get them talking. This is a real treat of a film that should be watched. It is not a psychological horror flick, but rather a scary and yet neat look into the ideas of the Salem Witch Trails that had once happened and brought fear into many people of that era. It brings in the use of magic and witchcraft in a pretty new and different way. It is a film that works on all levels to make the reaction that the directors and writers want us to feel. The Witch is creepy and daring and has a lot of characters to match. It works on multiple levels to be a cool a neat flick that I think you can find some enjoyment out of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Few redeeming qualities and a grossly misrepresented genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually the amount of patrons that leave a theater in the middle of a showing is a accurate representation of a films worth. Four people did so at the 7pm showing of Robert Eggers' "The Witch" and I can't really blame them. The movie itself is well acted and the interaction between the characters is believable. Couple that with the excellent sets and costumes, period anarchism's and speech and you can actually believe that this is how 17th century Calvinists would of lived. However at no time did I feel frightened or unsettled by what was happening on screen. More than once myself and the majority of the audience actually laughs out loud or groaned in embarrassment at a sequence that was clearly intended to produce frights. In fact it is my opinion that this would of been a much better film if stripped of all supernatural elements and presented as merely a family drama that dealt with the issues of isolationism, mistrust and the effects of pride and religious fanaticism on the wellbeing of a colonial family. If that were the case I would of rated it far higher. As it is however, presented as a horror movie, I give this film 4 stars out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am puzzled at all the reviews claiming this movie is the "next big thing." I love TV shows/films about the Salem Witch Trials, and I was excited to see this one. I have to commend the director for keeping the dialogue close to what it would've been like in the respective time period. However, the lines were mumbled at times and were undecipherable.Aesthetically, it was a nice movie with great cinematography and a notable score. The problem is in the storyline. There is no tangible plot or created suspense. The relationship between the characters and the audience is nonexistent. I wouldn't waste your money in the theater on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE WITCH asks questions uppermost in many American minds . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . such as, "What IF Satan is Real?" and "What IF the Devil always has been Top Dog in the U.S.?" THE WITCH shouts a resounding "You Betcha!" in answer to both questions. If THE WITCH's viewpoint is correct, it certainly would make a few turns of events easier to understand, such as the unparalleled Genocide wiping out 90% of 837 Native American Nations, Black Slavery, The Civil War, Concentration Camps for the Japanese, John Wayne's anti-Semite Witch Hunts, and Trump in the White House. Certainly, the filmmakers responsible for THE WITCH have carefully crafted this flick with as much True Believer fervor and attention to detail as the people behind Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHR!ST. No corners are cut in the pains-taking regard for period language, belief systems, and social fabric here. It's as if viewers have stumbled out of a Time Tunnel just as America is signing over her Soul to Baal. This film does more to show Evil Triumphant than any movie Hitler's Videographer, Leni Riefenstahl, ever churned out. The only caution to be made is that THE WITCH seems to have emanated from Satan's Playground, a.k.a., Canada.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As other reviewers have said, "The Witch" is not a movie that scares you with the tired old tricks, or tries to make you jump out of your seat. It did chill me to the bone, however. The setting, the dialogue, the score, a goat named Black Phillip, all worked well together to creep me the hell out.I was a bit disappointed by the ending, or maybe just confused by the choice to end it in that manner. I'd still recommend this movie to anyone looking for an entertaining, different, kind of movie. Great to see some originality these days.Also, Black Phillip, may be the best name of any character (human or animal) ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frightening &amp; Engrossing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer-Director Robert Eggers's 'The Witch' is a Frightening &amp; Engrossing film, that left me awed. This one's an unsettling, slow-building horror masterstroke, that delivers some thrills, but is overall a work of pure treatment. 'The Witch' isn't all about scares &amp; spooks, but a tale that grabs you &amp; throws shivers down your spine, even without a single cheap scare. 'The Witch' Synopsis: A family in 1630s New England is torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession.'The Witch' is an exercise in fright. Believe me, after the All-Time Blockbuster The Conjuring, 'The Witch' is another film of the 2010's that does the horror genre right. Eggers's Screenplay moves on an intentionally slow-pace, only to build &amp; build to an unforgettable culmination. You watch the ill-fated family being torn apart from the evil &amp; although heartbreaking, the narrative remains engrossing. Eggers's Direction relies on treatment &amp; he has aced it here. He treats every moment with a sense of paranoia &amp; unpredictably, adding all the more force to the goings-on. Egger is the True Hero of 'The Witch', as he gives his all &amp; rises with a superior Horror Film.A Special Mention Jarin Blaschke's excellent Camera-work &amp; for the Performances by Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson &amp; Kate Dickie. On the whole, 'The Witch' is a solid watch. Go, get scared (for real).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Pilgrim Fathers have set up shop, but devout William falls out with them and sets up a homestead miles away with his wife and 6 kids, going from teenager Thomasin down to a baby. But a couple of the kids disappear, and others are at odds with each over as to who is a witch and how witchcraft is affecting the family. Since the family all believes very strongly in witchcraft, this has a major bearing on relationships within the family.It almost doesn't matter whether the witchcraft here is real or not: what matters is what happens to the family, and I'm certainly not going to spoiler whether the goat really is the devil, or whether Caleb really does fall foul of a witch, or whether it is all mind tricks and excessive devoutness. To do that would spoil what little enjoyment you might get from this film.Because this ponderous movie takes itself very seriously indeed. The dialogue is archaic and delivered in Yorkshire accents, and is often very difficult to follow. The images are carefully composed and captured on film, and give a convincing impression of how hard, drab and dark life must have been. Yes, there is a slowly building sense of an awful fate in the offing, but the emphasis here is on "slowly", and the starting point is pretty depressing to start off with.On the plus side, the performances are all excellent and great effort has been put into what the film looks like. It just isn't very entertaining.</fullReview>

There's the lonely picture of a small colonial family holding on to their meager patch of turf and the all-consuming gospel of an indifferent ancient god, as they face a wild web of trees and shadows in the preying woods at their doorstep ? while a wolf is blamed as the lurking danger and cause of sorrow, it's the very Christian witch hunt and devil-chasing within the settlers that will yield self-fulfilling rituals of rapture and sacrifice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Expertly Crafted "Folk Tale".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been a considerable while since a film had elicited such a pure reaction of gut-wrenching horror from me. As a horror veteran, tired of the same generic haunted house garbage we get month after month, year after year, I am so happy to write that Robert Eggings brings us a film that transcends all expectations and clichés. The Witch is a palpable breath of fresh air for horror; or rather, a forced serving of black bile poured down your throat to churn inside your stomach and send shivers down to your soul. Even if, and I am certain of it, nothing here will be noticed by such a sanitized society like the Academy or an immature audience seeking cheap thrills, the fact remains that everything on display in The Witch is of master-class craftsmanship. The choice of 1.66 : 1 aspect ratio, a highly subtle effect, is most likely responsible for much of the film's highlights and weaves a strongly claustrophobic environment. Many of the shots are close-ups on characters' faces or characters' backs, a technique that seems to be gaining popularity as shown by last year's phenomenal Son of Saul. The camera rarely expands beyond the intimacy of our characters' personal spaces and this creates a sense of attachment and empathy wherein the viewer experiences a feeling of active participation rather than safe and casual outside observance.The gray and murky autumnal environment is succinctly rich in flavor which accentuates on the film's aesthetic of a "folk tale". The sky is ever overcast, and the trees in the woods are all stripped of leaves, remaining tall imposing husks that are easy to get lost in. The aesthetic and environment are almost like characters themselves in The Witch, hearkening back to Eastern European tales of the macabre, the Grimm Brothers, or Nikolai Gogol. And like a classical folk tale, subtlety is key here; you will find no obnoxious jump- scares or cheap gore here. The heavy immersion power of The Witch is pulled along by the small cast of characters who luckily, are mostly unknown. I personally recognized no one besides Kate Dickie from Game of Thrones but this was nothing distracting. It is easier to sympathize with people whose faces you aren't familiar with, rather than thinking to yourself, "wow, Leo is doing great work here". This holds immersion for the viewer, and because the cast was enormously talented, nothing broke that immersion or tension. The 17th century script the cast works with is written with great care and effort and remains understandable and relatable, creating no barriers between the film and the audience. There is a lot more I can comment on, but this is a spoiler-free review. For any comment in regards to story, I can say that the way the story is presented is an extremely tense family drama, punctuated by brain-searing sequences of horror. Robert Eggers, for a debut film, shows total command and mastery of the genre he presents, and plays all the cards right. The sensation of horror is crafted through just enough lingering on certain imagery, and just enough glimpses of the horrific and supernatural to make a world of difference between a competent period piece horror, and one of the most disturbing films of the 21st century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most unnerving cinematic experience in a very long time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard a lot about this film prior to going in. It is the sort of film that you either really like or really dislike and it is clear why. The Witch is a 1630s English folktale and it doesn't shy away from showing that. Things get very real very fast and i can easily say this is the most unnerving films i have been to see for quite some time.By that i don't mean it is a jump scare fest. I've seen a fair share of horror movies this year and all of them have been complete tripe, with countless jumpscares and a put you to sleep kind of vibe. The Witch features my favourite type of horror, the psychological type, and with that it provided something truly unique. The plot is simple, a 1630s family is torn apart and plagued by witchcraft and terrible unsettling things happen. Of course a lot more does happen, and over the course of the film i felt more and more uneasy. I have heard people complain the 1630s feel makes it boring, but never once was i bored. I was transported straight to this time period and i was transfixed to the screen for the entire duration. This is very much a family film and every member of the family does such an amazing job. The father of the family plays his role so well and you are constantly guessing what he is possibly hiding. This film will keep you guessing the whole way through, but does a stellar job at getting right inside your head and under your skin.The first scene where the witch was introduced to the audience happens quite early on, it genuinely terrified me. Not to the point i was screaming aloud and jumping out of my seat, it was a different type of terrified. I was glued to my seat, not able to take my eyes off the screen as the sounds from the speakers were ringing through my ears getting louder and louder until the scene changed and put me back into reality. All of the scenes like this were the same, they would consume and take you out of reality for a bit to remind you that what you are watching is something that could have easily happened. It was terrifying also how realistic this film actually was, i know it was only filmed over a course of 25 days but it feels like the camera crew literally went out to film a 1630s family suffering from the threat of witchcraft and put it into a 90 minute film. I love when a 90 minute film can pull you in so much that it feels like a lot longer. I hope psychological horror makes a huge comeback, i said this when i reviewed It Follows and until now, nothing had quite compared, but The Witch does. It is the best horror for a very long time and is one that i will honestly be thinking about for well over a week because that is what this genre of film does for me. Go and see it in cinemas.. but if you are faint hearted then beware because it will keep you up at night, in the best possible way.</fullReview>

I do not want to get too specific but I can say that the ending was terrible, the movie was not scary in anyway, and despite a great cast this movie just fails to deliver.

		<fullReview>Going into this movie, I tried with everything I had to enjoy it. I was fully aware of the type of horror film it was, which I believe we need more of these days. Being scared by not seeing but feeling and not knowing what is the cause of the problems that arise. We fear what we do not know or understand. Going back to a time where if you were different than you were labeled as evil. I've always said that the perfect setting for a horror film would be the Salem Witch Trials. With that being said, it felt as if something was missing throughout the film. Everyone was waiting for that moment of pure fear but it never came. A few intense scenes helped set it up, but there was never any payout or anything memorable.I can appreciate wanting to keep this as authentic as possible with having the characters speak exactly how the Puritans spoke back then, but it was hard to follow for 2 hours. There were many times I found myself thinking "I have no idea what the hell they're talking about." Hats off to the cast for having to memorize those lines. Don't go in expecting this to be anything close to the your typical horror film (which many in the theater failed to do.) I do not regret seeing it, but wished it had left more of an impression.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hood Review: VVitch? (The Witch).Quick Hits:The Goat is the best actor. Bible Thumping? Lots of it. Not a scary movie.The R rating got my dander up for this one. That rating mixed with the spooky trailers had me hopeful. But 'The Witch' under delivered in just about every category. The trailer basically is scarier than the movie. There were some disturbing moments and couple jumpy parts. But outside of that, it is just not a scary, not even a little bit. I'd categorize this as more a drama sprinkled with suspense. Then add a dash of WTF, and a splash uneasiness moments and you have a Wrong Island Iced Tea. What it did capture very well is one family's struggles and how evil was able to divide their family bond and conquer the family unit by preying on their weaknesses and the weakened bond. Witches had an incredible amount of bible thumping going on, but being the story took place in the 1630s it seemed appropriate. So get ready to hear a bunch of "thou", "thee" and "hither" type speak and ton of biblical type scenes and references. A few times it took my brain a few seconds lag to decipher what was being said. This film did manage to keep an air of mystery, creepiness and interest through out the movie. The finer points were probably the direction and cinematography. I also get the feeling we could have did without seeing the Witch at all. The random, sporadic appearances of the actual witch did little to add value to this flick. The acting was so-so. That R-rating though. Them sneaky jerks. They snuck one in on me. How they managed that R- rating was by adding a couple lightly gory shots and a bizarre scene were a bunch of chicks were randomly twerking in the woods and chanting while naked. Outside of that this coulda been rated PG-13.All in all, this was actually a good movie. But for all the wrong reasons, it's a blatant case of false advertising. If you like thrillers/suspense this would be a good one to check out. But horror and scary you are looking for? Move along, there is nothing to see here? And for that I am giving The Witch 2.5 EBTs.</fullReview>

Some bullsh!t.Then after like an hour you see a kid with a gun run off on his own, he then sees a f*cking witch come out of a little hole in a small house in the middle of the forest. Your first thought would be 'shoot the b!tch' but the kid instead looks confused, gets a small boner and kisses the witch.Then he gets possessed and then somehow comes back home for some reason OK then they are praying and praying and praying doesn't do a single jack sh!t, trust me they pray for about a 1/3 of this movie, let me tell you, God does not give one flying monkey sh!t about this stupid family. Everyone starts dying, a goat kills the father for no reason and then suddenly the girl is speaking with the devil. She then becomes a witch and then flies away up into the sky.The main problem with horror films now-a-days is that they pose not a single fight against the danger, they almost just give up and cry and instead of fighting the witch they simply fight each other. Why not shoot the witch? Why not tell your family the baby disappeared instead of running to a forest for no reason, why not shoot the witch, why are they praying for hours yet not a single pray does jack sh!t, why aren't these guys moving away from this haunted ass farm?Not only does this movie make white people look like pathetic idiots, it makes God look stupid, and it makes the devil look the most powerful thing of the world. The ending sucks cock and doesn't make sense. I have no idea why this movie has such good ratings, it is the most boring movie I have ever had to sit through. the best part of this movie was the credits, do not watch this film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, not scary, and looked college-level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand the film was not meant to be an action film, but it failed at keeping my attention at many parts. I also fail to see how this was a horror film at all. It was incredibly dull, which once again, I understand it's not meant to be exciting and keeping you on the edge of your seat, but this movie did a terrible job at being a calm film. It was too calm. Secondly, the film killed off the characters too quickly and strangely. It seemed as though the directors took too much time introducing their family, and needed to hurry the plot up. The father, mother, and twins all died within 5 minutes of each other in the film. By that point, there was only 15 minutes left of the film anyways. The movie was eerie, but it was not scary. It didn't strike me as a professional film either. It looked very college-level and amateur. I do not recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just returned from the theater.What was that?? That was not a horror movie. At best, that was a psychological thriller. But really it was more of a drama.I wanted a horror movie and I get this? I feel like I was lied to. I do not understand how this movie has such rave reviews and a comprehensive score of 7.5. I have no explanation for this.Thoroughly disappointed. No jump scares. No gore. Not creepy, People claim the tension alone categorizes this as a horror movie. That is a ridiculous claim. Home alone also had tension at points. Just......wow.If your looking for a horror movie, look elsewhere. If your looking for a drama about a crazy family that speaks olde English and you can't understand anything they are saying, and quite frankly you don't care to, then this is an Oscar winner.Just wow. I am remembering the directors name so that I can save myself the burden of sitting through one of his stupid movies ever again. You've been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what to say other than why was this film made? Do you need to be religious or actually believe in the existence of witches to have any emotional buy-in? Since we find out early on there actually is a witch, it kind of kills any ability to feel for the paranoia amongst the family as to who among them is the evil one.There are repeated scenes of the father going out to chop wood and each time the soundtrack would get ominous. These were the only tense points in the movie for me because I thought he was going to have a bad swing and cut off a body part. Alas, not to be.Had the cinematography and acting to be a much better movie but the finished product was boring and pointless. "Best horror film of the year"? Well, if you're scared by the sensation of boredom then they may be on to something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Witch' Review: Truly Terrifying, Psychologically Disturbing and Authentic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"There's evil in the wood."Set in the 1600s, a family is banished from the commonwealth for not serving God to the fullest. Forced to move outside the village, the family wanders off to find a cozy spot to build in front of the woods, as the gate to their normal lives shut behind themThe family starts their lives over at their newly settled house. They grow crops and chop firewood, while attending to their children and newborn, who suddenly vanishes. Lost hope settles within the parents who make up their minds that a wolf took the newborn. Strange occurrences begin taking place around the farm. The family comes to the conclusion they haven't been fully committed to God and have sinned. It the cause of evil, and witchcraft.One thing that really sets "The Witch" apart from other horror films is the acting. The ensemble is very impressive, especially the three children who I bought right from the beginning. The goat is also incredible and creepy, who is real.The film was shot using predominately natural light, which allows us to see how families really lived in the 1600s without the luxuries we have today. The horrid score added greatly to the general creepiness, which you can hear in most of the trailers. The language used was researched for years by Eggers and pulled from history books and journals. The film is just so genuine."The Witch" is the most authentic horror movie in recent memory. One leaves the theater deeply disturbed, like we just witnessed something we shouldn't of seen. We feel the need to be cleansed and purified. Director Robert Eggers' debut film is a slow-burner and everything horror fans want their movies to be. The audience is able to be placed in that home and feel the evil within the family. We're able to feel the terror of Black Phillip, the witch and the surrounding absence of hope and help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Witch is creepy but also confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This New England folktale shows the difficulty of settling a new land, the delusion of blind devotion, and the troubles of an isolated youth. The movie moves slow with brief disturbing scenes to bring the viewer into the plot but overall amounts to a more confusion than actual horror. There are certainly things throughout that will leave viewers cringing in their seats, or on the couch since this film seems to have trouble showing in all theaters and may be more of a rental. The horror is certainly there and the Writer/Director Robert Eggers does plenty to ratchet up the tension but falls short of a complete story.With only a family in the midst of the horror, the characters are a majority of kids with the two parents being Game of Thrones alumni. Kate Dickie plays the mother Katherine who slowly devolves into insanity as her family is slowly picked off by malevolent forces. Ralph Ineson plays the father whose faith is out of control. His deep croaking voice delivers dialogue in such a profound way and worked perfectly in this haunting setting.CHECK OUT MORE OF THIS REVIEW AND OTHERS AT swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably doesn't have spoilers but I don't know what counts as one. This is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen. I don't throw that around lightly because I like to see the better side of bad movies. Sadly the movie was poor from start to finish. The opening scene gave very little information and any revisiting of the topic later on gave even less information. The oldest boy was nearly impossible to understand but the rest of the cast was not much better. The amount of screen time for The Witch was seriously laughable. The baby got more screen time. The scariest part was sadly the bunny. The ending was just plain confusing and made no improvement to the already boring plot. I will make sure everyone I know knows how awful this movie was. I don't want anymore people misled by a great looking trailer to waste their hard earned money on such boring trash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into this film with an expectation that it would be scary as hell, the trailers showed a lot of cool scenes that left the viewer in anticipation of something that hasn't been done in a horror film since, perhaps the Blair Witch Project? Films about Witches are rare, in my opinion the greatest of all time is Suspiria, mainly because of its originality and the great soundtrack. But this film, I would say is befitting of its epic title. Not since It Follows was I this scared walking the dog in the park at Midnight. For the record, I walk the dog every night at midnight, and I have a tough dog. And I average about 30 horror films a month, my collection is quite extensive, so for a movie to scare me, it really says something. I'm a little worried going to sleep tonight, may have some bad night terrors or something, perhaps I should watch some Dora the Explorer cartoons to ease my tension. For a horror fan and fans of films alike, I think it is time to give credit to where credit is due and classify the horror genre as important as the Rom Com and nominate it for something, anything. Scary as Hell.</fullReview>

I went to see this movie with two other highly intelligent people (IQ&gt;130) and we did not get the movie. It is not artistic, it is painfully boring. It is one of those movies that you keep waiting for something good to happen, and it never does. I was excited when I had to take a restroom break in the middle of the movie, if that tells you anything. At the end of the movie, I looked at my friend and said "I told you we should have seen Deadpool." The audience, all in agreement, said "No Kidding!"

The scenery was even dull and the setting was dark. they should have developed the witch more..it leaves you not really knowing anything about the witch even at the end where most movies at least bring it all together to make some sort of sense...not this movie.

		<shortDescription>Unnerving, Wacky, and Super Realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch is a good movie, but it also has a very narrow audience. For those that love slow, yet tense, horror films that are as bizarre as they are scary, this film is for you. The Witch is unnerving, super realistic, and wacky to a fault. I will say that the film's writer and director Robert Eggers did an amazing job for a directorial debut, and he is undoubtedly a force to watch in the future.From the opening scene of the film to the very end the film is unnerving. The film is quite slow, but never really boring, because the filmmakers did a great job creating a very tense tone. The tone is essentially formed from three major elements of the movie, the bone-chilling music, the ominous cinematography (especially in the forest), and the always noticeable presence of darkness lurking. In this film the titular character isn't in the film often, but their presence is felt. Combine that with the excruciating attention to detail, and the film takes on a sense of reality.The film is extremely realistic, and that is because Eggers took the time, and had the attention to detail to make the film as realistic as possible. While the dialogue may distract some, it is exactly how people used to talk in the colonial era. The lighting is usually dim, but is to is realistic as the film is literally made to look as if it's being lit by candlelight or moonlight. The actors were on point, most likely due to great direction, and the sets were almost exactly what one would expect things to look like back then. That kind of dedication, deserves respect, but it also helps the audience get lost in the filmic world.However, the film is downright wacky, and in some ways that's great, and in others it hurt the film a little. The film is unlike anything I've ever seen before, in an interview Eggers said his original pitch was "too weird, or too obscure" considering the film he made, I want to see that film because this one was wonderfully obscure and weird. However, the film was a little hard to follow, at times it felt as though too many things would happen in a short period filled with moments of confusion, which did help reinforce the insanity the characters were growing into, but made it harder to follow.It may not have helped the film, but as an observation, the film was devoid of humor. In the end, the film is original, unnerving, realistic, very well made, but does have an obscure feeling to it. The cinematography is beautiful, the filmmakers had an amazing attention to detail, and horror fans will most likely like the film. If you like the wacky, weird, obscure horror films that don't rely on clichés and jump scares, check this film out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this 3 stars. 2 of which were for the child actors, who did a pretty good job. The movie was shot well and that's about it. Character development was poor at best. There were a few jump scares but nothing noteworthy. It had an overall depressing feel to the film. It seems to have been marketed as a true horror movie. I couldn't call it a creature feature, or a psychological thriller. Its not a docu-drama, but seems to try to be all these things without achieving any of them. About halfway through the film, people in the theater were bored and talking to each other, completely uninterested in the screen and what was (or wasn't) happening. When the credits started rolling, I was happy it was over because was ready to leave and hour before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accurate portrayal of a witch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My review is going to be about the content of the movie and not the movie itself example: acting, filming, sets etc.The family of William and Katherine was banished from society. We are not told why they are but the movie is based on their survival in the woods.The reason they were banished is because the daughter was into witch craft and bad luck was plaguing the people. That is why they were banished.If anyone here knows anything about the occult you will know why the baby at the start was murdered. The occult is a counterfeit religion of Christianity. The death of the baby was a satanic ritual used to satiate the desire of Demons. This is a copy cat death of Christ.Leviticus 18:21 Thou shalt not give of the seed (family) to offer it unto Moloch (the Devil), that thou defile not the name of thy god, for I am the Lord.Let there not be found among you that makes his son or daughter to go through the fire, or that uses witchcraft, or a chooser out of days or that regards the flying of fouls, --The family are obviously Calvinists. They believe in the doctrine of Jean Calvin and that is a false doctrine. They memories prayer and chant mantras for safety. They obey the bible and not God in hope their souls are saved.How ever in the woods, the small boy clearly admits that his sins are not forgiven which proves the religion is vain.---The Goats used in the film are obviously used for demonic symbolism and not the benefit of the family. The crops fail and the goat produces bloody milk. These signs are all signs of the use of witch craft.--Witches and Witch craft is not reserved for a small period of human history around the 1600's. Wit craft is an actions reserved for Witches and Wizards. It is the method used by humans to commune with fallen angels. Thomasin conjures up her Demon at the end of the movie and it talks to her. It offers her prosperity which is exactly what Satan offered Christ.Just about all the movies Holly Wood produces are filled with the ritualistic and satanic symbolism and is it no surprise these celebrities live deliciously? Not just the movie industry but the music industry also.If you find it hard to believe that the craft of this movie is still conducted to this day I urge you to research someone like Charles Manson and learn that he to was using witch craft.This movie is basically a $3,500,000 lesson on how to become a witch or wizard.Exodus 22Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror At It's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Witch: A New England Folktale" is one of those movies that just catches you off guard. A family in 1630's New England area encounter witchcraft, black magic, possession. It starts out while Thomasin(Anya Taylor-Joy) is watching her baby sister for her parents. The baby abruptly "disappears" and very weird and nasty things start to happen. I won't go any further than that on the plot because this is a movie that needs to be experienced. With the lights out. The characters are brought to life by relative unknown actors. They are good. Really good. Anya Taylor-Joy plays the older daughter and boy does she deliver. Look out for her very soon. The dark, brooding visuals wrap you up in the story. Writer/Director Robert Eggers has put this together well, the flow is slow and methodic and keeps building. The music by composer Mark Korven only adds to the feel of the movie. A great horror flick that takes it's time but never stops moving forward. WARNING: It does get graphic ? real graphic. Disturbing imagery and content. Weak stomach? You might want to avoid. 9/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More drama than horror but still worth a watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been looking forward to seeing this movie as I'm a huge horror fan but after watching it I'm a little bit disappointed by the lack of actual scares in the film. In all other aspects it's really well crafted; the cinematography is stunning, the acting is great and the authenticity of the time period is impressive. I liked the storyline but I found the execution a little bit confusing. The witch is shown at the start of the film dispelling any mystery and what follows is mostly a psychological drama following the family of the story as they question the bizarre occurrences that are unfolding due to the witch's magic. The dialogue is in old English but still easy to follow, the actors do a wonderful job of delivering the lines and getting into character. I thought the direction was good but I did wish it was actually scary rather than, in my opinion, mostly just being creepy and atmospheric. I wanted something more terrifying or bizarre but in the end it was, bar a couple of occasions, quite restrained even when depicting mystical goings-on. I thought the imagery could have been heightened but it's all very realistic which struck me as an odd choice, I just felt that it could have had a little bit more to it. I would definitely recommend checking this out as it has some good moments and a very rich moody atmosphere but don't expect to be blown away or particularly scared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting an "artsy" horror film. But this isn't really a horror film at all. It's a moody meditation on what happens when absolutist and unsustatinable thought meets the sustainability of chaos. I've heard this film described as Satanic, but this rings true only if you define the Satanic as the intentionally chaotic, as the rejection of any form and order. It acknowledges only the limitation of the body, which is to say death, which is to say the limit of mortal knowledge. The cinematography is magnificent, brilliantly capturing the lighting of the pre-electric world at least as well as did The Revenent. This is true wilderness, and its unknowability as such is thus much more believable on its own terms than was that of the woods of Von Trier's "Antichrist", a work, it must be said, to which this film owes much of its forest-as-cruelty imagery. The person who can live with chaos is necessarily a by-product of a society that seeks to avert it, and the only person who can survive in this natural chaos is not inherently "evil", they are only thrown into a situation in which their natural strength reveals itself in relation to their peers. They are simply the only one with the strength to see the option of choosing the chaos of nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see how the everyday horror fan would not like this. But, I completely loved this movie. I like horror, and I also like really good movies. This is an excellent movie that is a horrifying story. This movie does not give you any cheap jumps, is not gory, and is very slow paced. It also doesn't give you anything to laugh at, as a lot of horror movies do with their impossible and unbelievable situations. This in itself is unnerving. And I found it also very difficult to identify with the characters - an extremely puritanical family of 7 - leaving one just an observer of this strange foreign world and getting pulled into it, almost without realizing. If you go into it with expectations, you'll find yourself impatient, looking for cheap thrills, and will end up disappointed - if you go with no expectations, and just sit and watch, you'll find yourself with your eyes and mouth wide open as the film slowly pulls you in and itself apart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Autistic Family Drama with Horror Elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this at the theater. I think it is worth seeing because I just plain believed the drama playing out on screen. This is because the acting was very good. It looked beautiful (of course). And the writing was believable.Basically there's a family patriarch in colonial America who pulls up stakes at his village and tries to resettle out in the wilderness over some kind of moral/religious disagreement with the town elders. The strain of living off the land all on their own, then, is naturally no good for the friction in the family. To top it off, their isolation makes them vulnerable to a coven of witches in the forest nearby who kidnap, murder, and/or craftily turn them on one another.I'll get the flaws out of the way: the movie has an annoying, pretentious habit of lingering on certain shots for WAY too long. Yes the acting and writing is really good, I really do feel like I'm in the 1600s with this family to whom religion is the center of existence. But the camera freakin lingers on the boy Caleb getting a bandage around his chest for what feels like half an hour... On an agonizingly slow pan up to the treetops of the forest while loud and dissonant music brays like a wounded jackass... It distracts from the narrative and almost feels like a film student who's smitten with his own brilliance.Also Caleb's death scene was really stupid and drawn out. It clubbed me over the head with "CRAZY POSSESSED CHILD HIJINX" so hard that I almost got a concussion. There's a strange feeling I got that the movie, like, makes you expect something cool to happen (like, I dunno, the mutation scenes in John Carpenter's "The Thing"), but they never do... We just get actors acting crazy and fake blood and loud music. Kinda like a hamburger without the patty.One exception was a scene involving a crow and a bloody boob. That was clever and a little creepy.But still, the movie is interesting because it somehow rings true. It said it was based on true accounts of witches, and I believe it. Witches are not nice. They do not mean well. They are monsters who hate everything good, and Christianity is the only thing that really challenges them. There may have been a few good reasons behind the witch hunts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overwhelming Experience of Terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new indie-horror The Witch will cause one of the following two reactions in anyone brave enough to face it: 1) to run away as far and as fast as possible from the residuals of nightmare fuel; or 2) to dive in deeper, seeking out the bleak origins and intense terrors underlying its cold surface. Either reaction would be legitimate, as its unsettling visuals and themes are as enveloping as they are hard-to-stomach. Less a forceful, shocking horror than an atmospheric vision of fear, these two disparate effects point to the same truth: The Witch is an overwhelming experience of sheer terror. Set in 17th century New England, teenager Thomasin and her family are banished from their paranoid town and forced to make a life of their own. As witchcraft and black magic begin to make their way out of the neighboring woods and into the family's life, things go from bad to worse. Newcomer Eggers directs with such fervency for authenticity, it feels like he time-traveled to capture this unique era for horror. His characters carry all the affectations you expect of the period (old-fashioned English, enclosed communities), but more importantly, each member of the small cast is layered with empathy and dark humanity. Those characters, coupled with the dreary beauty of the visuals and the mesmerizing score, give us a clear first-look at a fearless talent. Eggers not only has a handle on the surface level aesthetics, but dives into some deep wells of thought, like religion vs. spirituality and the very notion of innocence. Thematically propulsive, visually rich, and disarmingly demented, The Witch casts a spell you can't learn even at Hogwarts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE VVITCH (2016) A Review by JP February 27, 2016 9 Evil Goats (out of 10)Since I've caught half-hate over my love of "The Babadook", bear in mind I enter each film (particularly horror), with a clean slate, an open mind, and a willingness to be scared. More often than not, I leave disappointed. That was not the case with this indie epic horror film that exudes with Kubrickesque qualities, most eloquently in the cinematography &amp; music. I heard haunting hymns from "The Shining" while my partner heard "2001: A Space Odyssey". In every single frame, a composition by which a photography class could be taught. The lighting was exceptional and imbibed the overall mood of dread that amassed throughout an expertly-paced 90-minute runtime. Truly disturbing situations arise. Though tastefully done, the imagery is sure to sustain long after leaving the theater. I could feel the anxiety from the handful of others in the theater with us. I could not tell if they were impatient by the 10-15 extra seconds that would typically be cut from modern forms of horror or the unsettling images just out of sight but definitely not out of mind. Once the 10 distributor logos cleared the screen (which gave me a deeper appreciation from the get-go the many trials this gem had to traverse in order to craft success), much like my favorite Kubrick picks, my eyes would not dare leave the screen. This dark historical piece, genuinely creepy to the point of traumatizing, actually scary when the time was right, and acted with a maturity void from so many films nowadays, especially child actors. Summarized credit where it is duly-earned, in order of noteworthiness (cast first): Anya Taylor-Joy, Harvey Scrimshaw, Ralph Ineson, Katie Dickie, (&amp; crew) composer Mark Korven, Jarin Blaschke's Oscar-worthy eye for the light, also kudos to the dozen+ producers, including Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potters 1 &amp; 2), and writer/director Robert Eggers. What a memorable, nightmarish cinematic experience!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was disjointed and disappointing. The existence of the "witch of the woods" was given away too early. Seriously, there was no mystery at all after about 8 minutes. Opportunities to expound upon sex roles (primarily suspicion of women) and religion were missed. The final scene was absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary (inapt comparisons to The Shining and other movies be damned) and the final 7-10 seconds of nothing but a black screen, repeating a theme that led the audience to expect more, was intellectually insulting. The score was often times inexplicable (dramatic music accompanying long shots of the forest from afar). Also, there isn't any consistent underlying point to the story. Most importantly, primarily as the result of the early reveal, it just wasn't scary at all.That's the bad stuff. There is also good stuff. The acting was first rate, especially the children - specifically Thomasin and Caleb. The costumes, sets and scenery were excellent. The depiction of 1630 America and the people was entirely believable and well executed. In spite of the previously mentioned flaws, the director did a reasonably good job of ratcheting suspense and manufacturing dread.To me this was a period piece about an unprepared family led by a less than competent husband under duress. There was also a poorly managed side story about a witch who quite literally lives in the woods, communicates with Satan and feels the bizarre need to mess with people's livestock and sacrifice babies. That last scene. Seriously. I have yet to read a sound justification for it that I can believe. What was the point?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The VVitch is a movie written and directed by Robert Eggers. It stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie, and Harvey Scrimshaw, along with Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson.A family in 1630s New England is torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession.The VVitch is a 'horror movie' like no other. It manifests itself inside the viewer creating a genuine feeling of dread and anxiety as it becomes more and more apparent how inescapable the situation truly is. This dread and anxiety is reflected onto the silver screen as the characters understand their predicament slightly later than the audience.Though I did thoroughly enjoy The VVitch, I can definitely a large number of people hate it as everything about it seems so damn impenetrable. This is mainly due to the quaint setting and the fact that this movie isn't a true horror movie or even thriller. What it is, is a rich period piece that finds its depth in its heady yet poignant themes.Writer, Robert Eggers, understands the kind of movie he desires to make and does it with much gusto. He wanted to design a heated family drama under the masquerade of a supernatural thriller. This is no easy task as Eggers makes the active choice to keep the characters in the dark, while feeding the audience provocative twists on the age old story. This works quite well in constructing a tense and morbidly dark atmosphere that succeeds at making the viewer feel helpless with no real reason why. Emphasizing build up instead of cheap results and firm grasps on familial ties, paranoia, extremest mindset, the script of The VVitch is deeply disturbing yet pristine in its construction and subtext. Though tedious for some, and a joy for others, one thing is universal in both parties: the distaste seemingly tidy conclusion. For a movie that packs so much creative bite, an ending that boasts some interesting twist or an open ended yet arguably conclusive was definitely necessary. Eggers decides to go in a different, more definitive, end. This is frustrating since on first glance it seems too simplistic for a movie that is anything but. This is a complete fallacy as the straight forward, strict ending demonstrates the amount of nuance behind the main character in surprising and dour ways.The main character, Thomasin, is brought to life with full autonomy by Anya Taylor-Joy, who as a first time actress, delivered a surprisingly seasoned performance. She is assisted by Ralph Ineson who gives an equally dedicated performance. Perhaps the biggest surprise for me was Harvey Scrimshaw progressively improving performance, that really stole a handful of crucial scenes almost seamlessly.The direction in this movie was also surprisingly as Eggers makes some very smart calls as he uses exaggerated pans, wide shots, and moving shots as he truly brings out the setting while building the atmosphere, however this does drastically slow downs the pace which somewhat works against the progress made. He also uses an abundant compelling amount of imagery resembling fairy tales like Red Riding Hood and the Rabbit from Alice in Wonderland, which in turn stimulates childhood fears and subverts them. This is matched by the dreary yet realized cinematography and the ominous score. The VVitch is a Unsettling masterwork of horror cinema that's brilliance is realized by his great ambitions. The VVitch gets an A or a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Farm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William and his family have to find a place to live after they are banished by the elders, and find a spot in the New England wilderness at the edge of a forest. Little do they know that the forest is inhabited by a witch (what are the odds, huh?). Anyway, strange things happen in and around the farm. Since they are Puritans they can't figure out what could be wrong, since they are extremely religious and obey God's commandments. So they search for an answer."The Witch" is well acted and pays great attention to detail, and to outward appearances recreates life on an early 17th century farm. The family's speech is sprinkled with 'thee's' and 'thou's', and, although the film is in color, it is washed out to lend the feeling of austerity and adds to the bleakness of the landscape. I thought Kate Dickie, who plays the mother of the piece was outstanding. Not sure if they give Oscar noms to actors in indies of this type, but if so, she would qualify. I also wonder if life on a 17th century farm was as lethargic as depicted here."The Witch" is more of a melodrama than a horror film but there are a few scary moments. Speaking for myself, I get tired of trying to connect the dots of this type of movie, where you must chalk up natural aberrations and illogical circumstances to The Supernatural. The picture contains the usual defiance of reason which has no explanation except whatever you assign to it. And so you make a colossal effort to suspend your disbelief to make it all work. This is the second horror movie in a row for me, having seen "Southbound" last week. "The Witch" has better production values but "Southbound" was more entertaining and moved at a quicker pace.</fullReview>

It actually had a great plot and great acting.The movie has two elements of horror, the witchcraft and the family turning on each other. The things that are left unseen are actually the scariest.It reminds me of the Shining in the way that the family slowly loses their minds AND there is some supernatural things going on.

		<shortDescription>The Witch (2016) Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the 1660's is the story about a family who after leaving their plantation goes out to live in the outskirts of New England. When their baby, Sam, is taken from their parish an unruly force takes over the family that begins to slowly tear them apart. The film is directed by Robert Eggers and stars Kate Dickie, Anya-Taylor Joy, and Ralph Ineson.It's been a long while since watching a film that is genuinely unsettling but to also find it refreshing at the same time. This time around we're talking about 'The Witch' and having viewed the trailer this past month I was eagerly looking forward to seeing it. To describe this movie is nothing but unsettling and the credit goes out to the director who was able to hone in the suspense not knowing where the movie would go next. Now I have to warn everyone in saying that this isn't your typical horror film with big budget effects and cheap jump scares forced down your throats. Instead you are treated to a time piece that sets the tone with events that took place in old folklore and a time where witchcraft was believed to exist. So for some viewers this may not rub off so well and could turn them away if your not knowing what to expect. With that said, this is not one to be overlooked.You can read more of my review here at: http://thecinemascore.com/2016/02/19/the-witch-2016-review/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beleaguered innocent farm girl turns witch in this 17th Century film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Eggers' first feature film is an astonishing achievement: It's a Seventeenth Century film. If a 17th Century American colonist had our technology this is the film he would have made. Everything in it is 17th Century: the characters, the language, the world view, the life, the clothing, the props, the lighting, the faith. Mainly the world view. There is no sign of modern knowledge, science or medicine within the film. The only modern understanding is what some members of the audience may bring to it. Not anyone from the Republican/Tory Right, though ? it's their knowledge and belief the film depicts in its total fidelity to the 17th Century. That, of course, is why the film was made today. Our current political debate makes Puritan religion a perfect emblem of contemporary pre- Enlightenment America. The film reminds us that America's putative independence remained rooted in religiosity. When the constitution deliberately separated the state from religion its intention was not to privilege any one religion over the others, not to free the land from all religion. In God they still trusted but they didn't want to advantage any one god or path. This the ultra-Christian modern demagogues have self-servingly forgotten.The religiosity smacks through the opening scene. A Puritan court ? black and white in its religious morality and duds ? banishes a family from the plantation because the father has been even more religious and demanding than they are. The banished William and Katherine, with their five children, carve out a homestead in the wilderness. At first they seem the model of self-reliance. But when things go wrong, when they make mistakes, when nature proves noncompliant, they can only blame the devil and his spawn. That's why we have religion: to blame the devil for our failures and to court God with our arrogant humility. Because this is a 17th Century film we watch the witch ritually abuse the stolen infant, we see the siren tempt son Caleb and choke him on the forbidden fruit (a desiccated Delicious), and we hear the witch descend in the wind to kill the goats and carry off the twins. What in a modern film would be supernatural horror in this 17th Century world is nature. What begins in nature ends in supernature. First the ram Black Phillip kills the father. That's natural, what often happens when an animal previously out-rassled by his master, gets a chance for revenge. But then nature is ratchetted up to superstition (aka religion). We hear the black devil ram seduce the oldest, Thomasin, and carry her off to join the powerful coven of sexually free women that terrifies domestic normalcy. That sexual paranoia, of course, is the psychological source of the legends of witches. They represent a rampant female sexuality that no man can control ? so they must be demonized. Certainly never elected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Witch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the year 2000, I had the pleasure of seeing the director's cut and re release of The Exorcist on the big screen at my local theatre. This was such a thrill for me as I was not around in 1973 to see the film when it was first released in theatres and now having a chance to see not only one of my favourite horror films, but one of my favourite films of all time on the big screen was an experience that I was to savour and that was a great all around film experience for me. Overall as I mentioned, seeing the film on the big screen in stereo sound and with additional unseen footage was great. I also thought that being able to see and experience the film with a then live audience full of people who perhaps had never seen the film before as well as fans of it probably who even saw it back in the 70's would be a real treat, but unfortunately seeing it with a live audience was one of the drawbacks of the film. All the then teenage viewers who were in the film audience amongst me, were instead of being in fear, or absolutely captivated by the film as they should have been, they were instead laughing and mocking the film as if what they saw on the screen was one of the funniest things they had ever seen. I was completely in disbelief and truly was despairing of this generation of moviegoers, even if I unfortunately fall into that same age group and demographic. I mention this in this review of the new film, The Witch, because the exact same thing happened to me while I was watching this film with a live audience who typically fell in the teenage age bracket as well. People were not only laughing and sneering at the film as if this was the funniest film to come along in quite awhile, but they also mocked it, were squirming in their chairs with boredom and countless times various people of the audience would leave and then come back into the theatre which each time caused the heavy theatre door to make a large slamming sound as they would enter and then exit the theatre and this happened frequently throughout the film. I think in both cases with The Exorcist, and now with The Witch, both films are very good, but the proof shows that they go beyond the typical maturity level of a teenage audience and those who attended my screening. The Witch, is a smart film with sparse and bare settings and backdrops that reminded me of the European films of Bergman, Tarkovsky and even Lars Von Trier's last few films in his depression type trilogy with Antichrist and Melancholia being the main examples. The acting was all by people who were relatively unknown to me as was the director and most of the crew if I have to be honest about it, but their dedication and craft on this film was excellent and this ended up being one of the most effective and interesting horror films of recent years. There certainly were moments in the film that were almost baffling, ludicrous and even hard to understand at times, but I at least was so compelled and interested by what was going on that even the more bizarre aspects of the film were intriguing to me as opposed to being something that bothered me about it. The film is getting rave reviews from critics and for good and appropriate reasons because technically it is one of the best made horror films from an artistic standpoint as well as any serious fan of the genre can tell you how effective and thought provoking this experience was. The people in my theatre like the people almost 16 years ago who laughed and mocked The Exorcist, are from a generation who like their horror films violent and with loud, annoying and sometimes just plain idiotic jump scares and stuff that most of us would just avoid, or roll our eyes at if we saw. Too bad that all these years later that today's teens are still enjoying the same old garbage and are totally aloof to anything of any artistic merit such as the two films in question. With time we will see how these films continue to fair, but I have a suspicion that critics and horror fans will be on my side and these teens will eventually grow up and their past tastes will be left in the dust. Time will certainly tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well made art-house horror film, that wont be relished by fans of escapist cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me state on the onset that The Witch carries a beware tag, for most people going into this film excepting a full blown horror film, that offers cheap thrills like the regular released Hollywood horror films ex. Saw or Paranormal Activity you will be disappointed.The Witch offers more of an art-house film with the films setting being horrorish. The Witch is a niche film made for people who relish artistic cinema, its not really made for the regular cinema going audience who indulge in escapist cinema. The film has certain milieu, that caught my attention right away, I was sucked into 1600's New England. The clothing, the way the people talked with heavy accents, the houses made of wood/hay, the farms filled with animals, everything was genuine and authentic of those times. The films attention to detail was something to marvel at, the cinematography was impeccable, it helped create the eerie dark feeling the film had from the first frame. But the film has its flaws but more on that later.Story wise in the 16th century, the deeply religious William leaves a New England plantation alongside his family (wife Katherine, daughter Thomasin, son Caleb, and twins Mercy and Jonas) due to a disagreement of beliefs. After a day's travel, the family finds a spot of land to start their new life. Several months later, the family has built a house and farm on the land and Katherine has given birth to her fifth child, Samuel. Thomasin looks after the infant Samuel one day but, while Thomasin is playing peek-a-boo with him, Samuel is abducted by a witch who lives in the surrounding forest. What happens next forms the crux of the film.Acting wise the cast was full of newcomers/ newer(unknown actors) actors who performed exceeding well. Anya-Taylor Joy has a cute innocence about her which she conveys well on screen, but when the dust settles especially in the climax/pre climax she turns too the dark side and shows her devilish side well. Ralph Ineson shows a helpless side of himself as a father stuck between his family and religion, he is great. Katie Dickie is schizophrenic on screen as the mother who cant cope with the loss of her child and turns semi-crazy. The younger kids have more of a comical role, and provide some nice light moments.The most important part of The Witch is the films whole aura, which is pitch perfect. Like I stated before the 1600s is perfectly depicted. The whole family being extremely religious is spot on for those times. The films director Robert Eggers makes sure that the audience has been encapsulated back in time. With the extraordinary camera-work the whole dark eerie, unsettling theme is fleshed out well. I must say I have never really seen a horror film like The Witch before, were most of horror comes through the silences, and from a artistic landscape, its a film that makes the mind think . There is no gimmicky fake cheap thrills, there is some gore, but its rather justified, and not overdone. The music creates a big impact on the film, and creates a tension filled screen. This film is more about creating a dark atmosphere, rather than trying to scare the audience. Which can be a bad thing or a good thing, here its a mix both. The films pace is very sluggish and a 1hr 30 min films feels more like 2hr + plus film. The Witch sometimes is to art-house for my liking, and more thrills were needed to keep the audience engaged, as I could see audience members getting tireless while watching this film. Finally The Witch is at its best in the films last 30 min when all hell breaks loose , and the scene when the brother has a exorcism of sorts, and when the sister heads to jungle with a black goat are the films highlight.Overall as I could gauge from the audience I was watching The Witch with, this film is not everyones cup of tea. The Witch is for more of a niche audience, who enjoy all types of cinema, and hone films as a artistic form, more than just escapist entertainment. Its a Sundance winner, and I can see why, there's a lot to love here, and I throughly enjoyed myself, but I feel bad for the audience going in excepting a full blown horror film, the film is misleading. Watch at your on caution you have been warned.3.5/5* or 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this is something! It is - as it is labeled - a horror film but also a mystery film. I would add that this is kinda a fairy tale. Are witches in fairy tales?Or only the good princesses and nice things?!Anyway, the film is quite good. I really liked the performances of all characters in the movie. Really convincing and utterly believable! The oldest boy was phenomenal! The oldest girl too, but really, every role was perfectly acted! I really had a feeling I was in the 15th or 16th century. The mood and the tone of the film totally transports you to those dark ages of new puritan America and those religious fanatics... We have the devil in the movie, but I must say that the figure of father was reminiscent of Jesus ( on purpose or not - and maybe it is only my thought - did not read other reviews yet). The film is disturbing at times. The witch is ... well, I am not sure if there is only one witch or there are many in the film ( not counting the last scene) who were after the family.The sounds ( I would not really call it music) was totally dramatic! It fits the mood / color of the film. The last witch dance and those sounds were ... chilly!!! All in all, this is really a great film. Fairy tale horror I would say. Definitely would recommend to anyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film's opening scene follows a Puritan family being exiled from their church due to the father's pride. They attempt to form a normal living on their own accord.I wish to commend the two younger child-actors for not ruining this realistic portrayal, very impressive performances from both, along with the rest of the family. The viewer is really pulled into this realistic atmosphere by the realism and border-less screen. At the beginning of viewing, I found the old-English to be quite irritating to listen to, but overall I feel that it definitely added realism.The horror in this film, while minimal, is very haunting. Child and animal possession, along with very disturbing imagery is common. The animal trainer should be congratulated for their work with the goats and rabbit. I felt the hold-back on the horror added impact to the more disturbing scenes.Possibly a commentary on religious and marital pressures put on women, The Witch is a film which will keep you thinking well after the film's conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very thought provoking Horror Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My husband and I went to see this movie. I enjoyed it, he did not. I really like horror movies, he does not. Since this is what I would call a quiet horror movie (not lots of jump out scares or graphic violence), I thought for sure he would enjoy it.I have always been fascinated by witches, and the time period around the Salem Witch Trials. Although this took place years before the trials, it was still interesting to watch. While there were horror moments, to me it had more to do with family dynamics and religion. Which to many people can be very horrific.William does not believe that the village he and his family live in has strong enough religious beliefs. So he takes his family to live right on the edge of a creepy forest. This is when the secrets start coming out, slowly, building up the tension, and making for a very interesting ending.There are a couple of secrets that if they would have been out in the open right away, the family would have fared much better, but then, there wouldn't have been a movie.If you are planning on going to see the movie, and want to me surprised, don't read any farther.Spoilers Ahead?The subtle horror in this movie is amazing. Caleb is just beginning to have sexual thoughts, and his sister, Thomasin, is the only female of age, besides his mom. You can see him feeling horrible about having these thoughts about his sister. But since his father took them out of the village, there are no other females to project these thoughts onto. There's the underlying ideas of puberty, which is scary for anyone. Along with the possibility of incest.Then when the baby is taken, the mother turns on her daughter. She tries not to at first, but when more strange things begin to happen, the whole family slowly starts to turn on each other. Besides the stolen baby, there are other secrets that are being kept, which just make the whole situation worse.If you are looking for a slasher movie, or something with lots of scares that will make you jump, this movie will probably not be for you. But if you are looking for one with lots of subtext, and that will leave you with a creepy feeling long after you've finished watching, then I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Witch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a director has the courage of his (or her convictions), and doesn't resort to clichés and cheap scares to create a movie; coupled with a meticulous attention to detail, you end up with a movie like The Witch. There is a brooding tension right from the outset, and you really feel the plight and misery of the family's circumstances as their situation trying to struggle in a harsh and hostile environment reaches its conclusion. For fans of more old school horror film techniques, that rely on a story to develop through excellent acting and the use of 'what you don't see' rather than what you do, this film is for you. Think 'Whistle and I'll come to You' or 'The Haunting' for the 21st Century. I'm still not entirely sure I really enjoyed the ending. I can imagine Eggers might have had a few different options. I'm not saying it spoiled the film, it just felt like it jarred with the style of the previous 90 minutes, but I'm being picky! This is a mature and beautifully made film. An outstanding debut for the director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow-burning, Disturbing Horror Period Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch is a horror film set in 17th century New England, and after a family's youngest child is taken into the forest under supernatural circumstances, paranoia challenges the family's Christian beliefs and threatens their lives in ways they never could have imagined. The Witch premiered at Sundance last year, and following rave reviews, has finally received a wide release. The Witch is a very different horror film that relies on atmosphere, disturbing imagery, and sound to craft a slow, but terrifying, horror experience.The story in The Witch takes familiar ideas of witchcraft and Satanism and puts them in an isolated setting with a family of six on the outskirts of the forest. The father and mother preach strict religious values, so after their youngest child goes missing, the family slowly begins to point fingers and the dark situation becomes a witch hunt within their own family. I liked this unique spin on witchcraft and demons, but I only wish the characters were more interesting. The mother and oldest daughter were the two most interesting characters, with the rest of the family being entirely forgettable. The dialogue is taken straight out of the 1600s, so while it is authentic, some lines and words are hard to make out. Because this dialogue is combined with thick accents and some characters mumbling, there were times were I was legitimately missing entire sentences. The Witch does explore some interesting themes for a horror film, like faith and isolation, which I appreciated.But most importantly in a horror film, is it scary? Yes, in chunks but not as consistently as I would have hoped. The scares are not jump-scares or anything like that. The scares are enhanced, and sometimes carried, by sound entirely. There are many times in The Witch where there is nothing on screen but the forest in the distance or a rabbit in the barn, but the sound gives you an unshakeable feeling that something terrible is about to happen. It's some of the best use of sound design I've seen in a horror film in some time.There's also some really disturbing imagery I can still visualize a day after seeing The Witch. The use of off-screen space is cleverly utilized to add to the more psychological moments. There are palpable moments of dread throughout, but after these sporadic moments, there are lengthy scenes of downtime with the family speaking to one another in the cabin. So while The Witch does have atmosphere, the pacing of the scares and the storytelling makes for a somewhat uneven film from start to finish. However, the final 10 minutes are so incredibly twisted and satisfying that it makes up for the slower moments up until that point.While I mentioned I was not in love with the characters in The Witch, the film uses the forest as a character itself, and very good one at that. The forest has an unmistakable presence and is completely captivating because of the potential darkness that lies within. Shooting on location with the forest and beautiful landscapes, combined with excellent costume design, results in a low-budget film that looks incredible. The cinematography is breathtaking, and I love the film's use of desaturated color to add to the dark tone.While The Witch is slow at points and some characters are not very engaging, I still found the film to be a beautiful and unique take on the horror genre. Not to mention the last 10 minutes will remain etched in my head for the foreseeable future. If a horror movie can affect a viewer for even a moment following it's conclusion, it's definitely worth a watch from any horror fans who thinks they can stomach lots of gore, mutilation, and goats?If you liked this review, check out my website for more reviews and movie articles www.watsonmoviereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to classify this movie. Let's call it Gothic drama. There's really nothing scary. I'd say overall it's unsettling. You know this family is screwed when they leave their settlement to live alone. And there's no ambiguity - it takes a path and goes down it.The acting is top notch. The story works when you realize what the end-game really is. The music is downright creepy, creating a tone throughout. And that has to be the thickest woods I've ever seen that is not a jungle.The very last scene sticks with you. It comes out of nowhere.ed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Witch really puts emphasis back into the word "horror". Very discomforting film, filled with such a large amount of disturbing images that haven't left my mind. It always keeps you at a distance to not fully grasp what is going on, but this adds to its lingering power. It honestly feels like a horror classic that has been able to stand ground with films like The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby. The entire ensemble cast is incredibly strong, being able to engage in this dialogue that could have felt inorganic but feels totally lived-in and natural. Not only are the adult actors strong, but the younger actors as well. This fits in well with The Babadook and It Follows as three legitimately fantastic horror films that all came out within the span of three years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Legitimately terrifying horror film set in 1630s. A family banished from regular society makes their humble home at the edge of the deep woods. They are on the brink of starvation, with their decimated crop, but they have more immediate problems when their youngest baby is kidnapped by something from the woods. The remaining children (a teenage girl (played by the terrific Anya Taylor-Joy), a slightly younger teen boy, and two creepy twins who seem to be best friends with their pet goat) are threatened by their parents' grief and religious fervor (the parents are well played by Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie). First off, the film is just gorgeous to look at. Eggers has done marvels with the details of this film, and based the period-appropriate dialogue on actual writings of the time. I also have to thank any director making a film like this who's obviously seen and loved Benjamin Christensen's Haxan. I am not 100% sure what I feel about the ending of the film - it's either a bit too little or a bit too much. It's most certainly one of the best horror films of recent years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 2014, we have The Babadook. In 2015, we have It Follows. And so far in 2016, we have ourselves another horror masterpiece, The Witch. First time writer-director, Roger Eggers, has delivered a movie that is soul-shaking, intensely disturbing, and gleefully Satanic enough that will likely satisfy most horror fans who can tolerate slow-burn style of movie. The Witch slowly builds its tension and thanks to its terrific production, performance, and music, all of which fit perfectly to create a dreadful tone and pressuring the audience the whole way through.Like It Follows, the music in The Witch is just haunting and uneasy to listen to and really plays a huge part in creating the eerie atmosphere and tension effectively. The visual here is just as stunning and compelling as well with a brilliant production and setting that makes us feel like we are watching something we are not supposed to. While the story-line is not as spectacular as other elements in the film but it still manages to delivery the theme of faith and human nature effectively enough through the talented performance from all the cast. Even though this is a slow-burn horror film but it never gets boring as there are always something interesting and captivating to look at and the pacing here is just nicely flow with its tension rising up and down throughout the whole film.The Witch doesn't rely on any cheap scares, like most modern horror film did, or over-the-top gore to shock the audience but rather its theme and concept that really creeps the hell out of them and delivers a spine-chilling experience. The Witch succeeds in almost every aspect in filmmaking giving horror fans an eerily rich and devilish experience that's pleasantly disturbing throughout. It's excited to see what the writer-director, Robert Eggers, has to offer in the near future as he has proved with The Witch that there's still hope for a horror filmmaking once again.&gt;&gt;A-&lt;&lt;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But where did Black Philip come from???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So lets start off with saying this movie will not appeal to everyone. I saw it with my girlfriend who has become such a movie buff over the last few years that she now enjoys movies for the subtle metaphors and imagery where I still look for a great plot and close to flawless story. Once the movie was over and we both had a couple of days to let what we just witness marinate we both had two totally different opinions. She on one hand enjoyed it, where I felt it was just Meh. She liked it for the imagery, and bits of meaning behind certain scenes (I want to keep this spoiler free so feel free to see the movie if you want to understand what I might be referring to). I dozed off for a bit in the middle of it, but even with what little I did miss I doubt it would answer the question I left the theater with. Where I think many will get lost or bored will be with the old English dialogue, and constant references to religion which is needed since this is based in the 1630's and God/Family/land is what people lived for. What made this movie dull for me is that it seemed filled with useless dialogue. There were parts that I liked, but everything leading up to them really did not serve a purpose. I would have much rather have some back-story on the family, the Witch, or even where they got that creepy Goat known as Black Philip instead of just mumbled old English dialogue about god, and the hardships this family is going though in the now. Give me some story and some substance if you want to be considered a horror/mystery movie. The only thing I can say I really enjoyed about this movie was that there were scenes of suspense that could be considered chilling, and they didn't need to use any cheesy jump scares. If you love the horror genre I would say give it a shot, more so if you like to look for meaning in movies. Call me what you will but I think "Lords or Salem" portrayed the Witch culture/folklore better while giving a creepy and unique story despite the horrible ending, but that is for another review.</fullReview>

Its a slow burning movie but that really isn't a problem at all. It's fantastically atmospheric and meaningful. My only fear is that the general public won't see the brilliance of this film because unfortunately were stuck in an age where people want a quick thrill with hardly any substance at all.

		<shortDescription>Not for simple minded viewers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The response I've seen for this film is that people are expecting a simple, jump scare, gore filled, and conventional horror movie. I feel like the same people who are giving this film such bad reviews would really enjoy movies such as 'the brothers grimsby', a film I can only describe as being filled with slapstick and vulgar comedy that requires no thought from the audience.(based on the trailer and previous movies such as 'brüno' and 'borat' which are cut from the same cloth) Unlike those, this film requires you to really think and pay attention to whats going on. Not because of their accents and old way of speaking-this is a period film- but because what the actors are saying holds all the information to keep the plot going. If you miss whats being said, then you'll be lost. That being said, it's not without it's laughing moments, such as the twins leaning into black Philip and say "baa baa baa" or the way black Philip shows near human expressions (or the way he gallops away after killing). Although, I would have liked a little more involvement with the witch and maybe a little less rushed. Then again, it is based on folktales which aren't very long to begin with. What people need to understand is, this is more of a thriller than a horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Definition Of Psychological Terror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch is one film that chills you to the bone and will warp your mind while you watch in fear, confusion, and anxiety. There hasn't been a horror film like this in a very long time. Any horror buff will agree that this film is a valuable gem in an underestimated genre. I had very high expectations on this film before seeing it, and it bargains much more than I expected, in which is highly rare nowadays.The film takes place many years before the Salem Witch trials and it starts off with a Puritan family leaving a plantation, due to disagreement beliefs. They find good size piece of land that is outside of a dark forest and built themselves a cabin and a farm. Once their newborn baby disappeared under the care of the post- adolescent daughter named Thomasin, things go downhill from there for the family. Crops of corn go bad, no luck on hunting food, and an ongoing grudge between Thomasin and her mother Katherine. Things get much worse when they sense evil is coming from the forest and the only thing that can save them are prayers and faith. But, for how long?The first thing that brought to my attention is the dialogue. It is an awesome idea that director and writer, Robert Eggers,had wrote it and execute it this way. It feels like we're seeing a prequel of the Crucible (I never saw the movie, but I've read the book. Unsure if the Winona Ryder film followed the original writing). Next, the atmosphere felt very authentic. You can sense absolute no civilization around the family and the cool, damp, New England weather, even though it was filmed in Canada. Third, the acting is tremendous! Nothing was campy, cheesy, or off. They felt like legit pilgrims on the screen. The father, played by Ralph Ineson, is my personal favorite character in the movie. It felt like I was watching a young Donald Sutherland. And last, but not least, the fear factor. It's intense. This film shows no mercy to the victims and to the viewers. There aren't that many casual jump-scares like in your everyday horror flicks, but just gives you a psychological fear that makes you highly uncomfortable. The fear just gradually builds up throughout the plot rather than spurts of scares here and there. It feels like a nightmare that you can't wake up from. After watching the movie, it makes you just speechless.If you a huge horror fan that wants something completely fresh without the cliché, The Witch is for you. After you watch it, you can't stop talking about it. It's that good. Robert Eggers did such a fantastic job and will be a household name of horror such as Stephen King, George A. Romero, Guillermo del Toro and Sam Raimi. this maybe too soon say this because we're in February, but I believe that this is the best horror movie of the year. I don't know if any upcoming horror films that'll be releasing this year can top The Witch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Witch is one of the best horror films of 2016. This is a film that you'll either love it or hate it. I'm one of those people that loved this film. The film is creepy but not really scary. What's creepy about this film is the atmosphere and the musical score. What was scary about the film was the haunting imagery. The acting for the film is phenomenal everyone does a great job. When I was watching this film it felt like I was in the 1600's. Whoever did the set designs and the costumes all deserve an Oscar nomination. The directing for this film by Robert Eggers did a fantastic job for his directorial debut and I can't wait to see what he does next. There were a couple problems that I had with the film but they're only minor ones. The pacing of the film does have a couple slow parts and the language that the characters speak is hard to understand but later on in the film you start to have a better understanding of what they are saying. A lot of people didn't like the ending but I thought it was a good ending and I will be remembering that last shot for awhile. Overall if you're a fan of these art house horror films then this is for you. I think this is a film that will be analyzed in film schools and will come down to a horror classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychological Horror Meets Family Period Piece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch has been receiving a lot of buzz recently from horror fans and Sundance Film Festival attendees. Writer/Director Roboert Eggers even won the Best Director award at the festival. So does it live up to what people are saying? Well yes, but you have to know what you're getting in to. Knowing that this is a smaller indie film from Sundance and that it isn't going to be your run of the mill, make-a- quick- buck horror movie there is a lot of great stuff here.This film combines two things that I am not the biggest fan, period pieces and horror, and, surprisingly, make them work. in his first film, Eggers does a fantastic job and building and sustaining tension. The atmosphere of the film never lets up making for suspense that really gets under the skin in moments where it really counts.Furthermore, the actors were just as equally great as the direction, at first, the older dialect was hard to follow and didn't feel very natural. But after about ten minutes, the language flows better and every thing becomes very believable. Going on with the believability, everything in the landscape and surroundings felt as thought it fit the time period. The film just pulls you into the time period where you fell the struggles as the family does. There was a point where I had to look around the theater to make sure that I was indeed not in Old England.The one thing that might be off-putting to some will be that the story isn't exactly about a witch versus a family. The story focuses much more on the family aspect as we see every family member deal with grief in their own ways as they sink deeper and deeper a psychological trance. There aren't as many straight up "scares" as one might hope, but there no doubt be times that make you jump and make you gut wrench. The family struggle is the fuel that drives the story forward and it makes for some great dramatic acting from adult and child actors alike. As for problems, there are a few, but none to detract from the tension and drama that the film builds. The film is very gray and bleak, and at some points, it can be a little overwhelming at times, where you wish the color palette would liven up. To continue, there was a point where I thought the mother character was a little one- note, but I just assumed that it was her way of dealing with grief since she is obviously the one that gets hits the hardest in family problems. The ending can be polarizing to some, I wish there was a even a little more ambiguity, but the way Eggers decided to end is sufficient enough. Lastly, a note must be made about the music and cinematography, both add to the film wonderfully and enthrall the viewer into whatever Eggers wants them to see.Overall, The Witch is a very good horror film, certainly a brilliant start for Robert Eggers and easily a mark or two above the average horror film that is released nowadays. The closest thing I can compare this film to would be The Shining. So, just know what kind of film you are getting in to and you won't leave disappointed.

		<shortDescription>Effective Film with a Rich Atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch (2015) *** (out of 4) Extremely well-made horror film set in New England during the 1600s as a family moves away from a colony and starts a new life in a house on the edge of some woods. One day the oldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) is watching her baby brother when something from the woods takes the child. Soon the family is torn apart by witchcraft.Writer-director Robert Eggers' THE WITCH is the latest horror movie that is getting raves from critics and fans and it's also the newest movie to be called the "scariest of all time." I'm not going to sit here and say the movie scared me because it really didn't. With that said, THE WITCH really was a refreshing throwback to various European horror films from the late 60s and early 70s where atmosphere was the most important thing.I really respected that Eggers tried to deliver a religious horror film that didn't deal with cheap shock effects and needless over-the-top exorcisms. There's really not any graphic violence or gore either. Instead of going for these cheap jump scares the director instead builds up a terrific setting and slowly plays out the action. The film clocks in at just over 90 minutes and rest assure that every single second is well-made, effective and it slowly builds up to its conclusion. I'm sure mainstream teenage viewers won't enjoy such a slow build-up but adults should enjoy this.The atmosphere is certainly the selling point of the movie. I thought the director made you believe that you were watching something taking place in the 1600s and there's no question that the entire cast does a very good job in their parts. The atmosphere is certainly rich and thick and manages to set the film apart from most of the horror movies out there now. As I said, I wasn't scared by THE WITCH but it did a good job at slowly building up the drama and it plays out extremely well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Witch (2015)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since seeing the trailer a few months ago, I've been dying to see The Witch. It calls to mind recent art-house horror movies like The Babadook and Goodnight Mommy, but The Witch is far scarier than those movies. It's a grim, perverse, and disturbing tale of religious paranoia among a crumbling family that will surely be remembered alongside the likes of Rosemary's Baby and The Omen. The Witch takes place in 17th century in Puritan-era New England. A family is excommunicated from their village and settles on the edge of a vast forest. Soon thereafter, their baby goes missing into the woods, and the family is torn apart by accusations of witchcraft, black magic and possession. From the first ten minutes, The Witch has a morose atmosphere and starts out with an incredibly disturbing scene. The initial shock is carried through the next few scenes which are dialog-heavy and slower, causing the dread to continue to the next horror. The terror never lets up and only amplifies as the plot progresses until the final 20 minutes are agonizing to watch. I could only vaguely tell you how the movie ended because I was watching through my fingers. It's perversely scary. The acting is fantastic from the entire cast, especially from the child actors. They're given heavy stuff to work with and pull it off with unsettling results. Along with amazing cinematography and an ominous score, it'll be difficult to find a better horror movie than The Witch this year. It'll leave you shaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting and unsettling depiction of hysteria in early United States</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The shadowy and untold world between what we fully believe and the unexplained is scarier than anything in your well-worn campfire stories.A highly zealous puritan family in New England circa 1630 is banished from a large settlement and forced to live on their own in the uncharted spooky woods that surround the area. A year later as they forge a living together out in the wilderness, something begins to act on all of them, something devious, wicked, and insidious. Their oldest child, a daughter named Tomasin played remarkably by Anya Taylor-Joy, is taking care of the new-born baby when it is snatched away. Almost immediately an unspoken change occurs between her and the rest of the family especially between her parents played strongly by Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie. They begin to act strange around her, seemingly suspecting her of the deed and perhaps something more nefarious. But do they really believe that she is in some way responsible? Is she completely innocent or in fact turning into something from folklore and scripture?This stunning debut from writer/director Robert Eggers is a tense-atmospheric- historical drama centering on the fringes on hardened belief, the unexplained and supernatural, and the maddening hysteria that can come from all of them crossing- over into each other. Set some 60 years before the infamous Salem Witch Trials, Eggers has seemingly traced the root causes of the tragedy, most notably with the extremely pious that anything beyond their understanding is an affront to God; the core of their beliefs. The victims of this infamous Witch Hunt tragically unable to plead their innocence against the tide of fear and paranoia that griped their towns, neighbors and families.Anya Taylor-Joy as Tomasin plays the ostracized girl with doe-eyed innocence, but with fleeting glimmers that something may not in fact be right with her, supernatural forces notwithstanding. She is growing into maturity, suddenly experiencing changes both physical and emotional and because of the distancing she is feeling from her family she is coping with them on her own. Only her brother Caleb, played powerfully by Harvey Scrimshaw, seems to even be able to reach out to her, nonetheless an uncomfortable undertone to their relationship develops that further divides the family.As family members begin to suspect one another of evil tidings, the grey New England skies seemingly become darker, their farm animals begin to act wildly and the very woods themselves take on a menacing presence. Getting to the point where even a wild hare is as unsettling sight as the titular Witch on-screen. That is masterful horror cinema, akin to Polanski and Kubrick, generating an constant oppressive atmosphere of dread. The horror genre is experiencing a welcomed resurgence in that last few years with the likes of The Conjuring,The Babadook, It Follows, because the filmmakers carefully take the time to portray their worlds from an oft-kilter perspective. To take a line from the Bard "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark". Something is wrong, we can't quite point it out, but something isn't right.That is what true horror is, derived from a primal fear of the unknown and unexplained. Horror genre filmmakers in recent years have tried to manufacture scares into what one can call Shock cinema. Trying to put "frightening" images and gore on-screen and using jump-scares to try an jolt their audiences into thinking for an instant "Well, that was scary." While that may work for amusement park rides, film is a completely different beast. It is able to grant a unique perspective and understanding of the nature of fear. Nothing should be on-screen to shock an audience, at least in the cheap thrills department. You can be unsettled and disturbed by what is happening in the narrative certainly, but as part of the film's experience you should be trying to understand why you are feeling that way.The Witch is the crown-jewel in the recent string of truly disturbing horror films. A darkly beautiful film shot by Jarin Blaschke that treats its New England forest setting in a suffocatingly claustrophobic manner. The production design team render period authenticity from the cloths, lodgings and especially the 17th century style of English- speaking that may be hard for some to follow but the dedicated performances keep you engaged and concerned. The eerie musical score by Mark Korven makes the haunted woods seemingly sing not unlike the monolith in 2001. All these outstanding cinematic elements compliment one another to create a vision of hysteria that would manifest itself in real-world horrific ways in the area's history.At my screening just as the end credits appeared, another member of the audience cried out "That's it? What was that?" in a unsatisfied tone. "What was that" indeed, I guess we never really truly grasp what lies waiting for us in the darkness when we journey to the edges of what we're used to.9.5/10 (An unsettling film that depicts the primal fear of the unknown in uniquely disturbing ways. An atmospheric horror film that has truly terrifying historical roots in the real-world, and never cheapens its storytelling for an audience.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understandably slow and with a total feeling of creepiness, The Witch embodies everything scary about an unknown world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today's movie The Witch finally addresses two things that aren't just scary, but terrifying; historical prejudices and a trapped location. The early seventeenth century marks the earliest of American history, not too long after the pilgrims made a home for themselves in the New World. With a land that was mostly unknown and passage back to Europe taking weeks, that's a great example of a location where you have no choice but to face it head on. Even without the possibilities of something supernatural, there's still animals and Native American attacks that could prove forceful and frightening.At the time, the pilgrims left England as they felt the religious standards were too lose and wanted to practice without ridicule. The last thing you want is to be stuck with pilgrims as their moral beliefs steam from the ideal that if someone is acting out of the ordinary, then they must have made a pact with Satan. This would even lead into the famous Salem Witch trials that persecuted several people that were have thought to have practiced witchcraft. While this film is set decades before those trials took place, The Witch paints a scary picture that would make any fundamentalist into a pilgrim. Within the early days of the New World, William (played by Ralph Ineson) is even more religious then his fellow pilgrims, deciding that he and his family need to leave the plantation and search for their own home. He settles on this parch of land where he builds a farm and try to make a life for his wife Katherine (played by Kate Dickie), eldest daughter Thomasin (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), eldest son Caleb, twins Mercy and Jonas, and baby Samuel. Things get creepy right away when Samuel is taken while playing a game of peek-a-boo with Thomasin.Katharine spends her days crying to god while Caleb and William do their best to hunt to feed their family. Thomasin overhears that her parents want to send her to another family now that she's approaching womanhood. This put more tension within the family as crops are failing and are not even sure they will have enough food during the upcoming winter. Caleb then goes missing during a hunting outing with Thomasin's twin sibling accusing her of being a witch. When Caleb is found close to death, more eyes from the family blame Thomasin for the bad things happening, despite her innocence.The Witch is film that scared me more then half of the horror movies I've seen in the past three years. A lot of it has to do with the setting as the entire story feels unsettling. The dark imagery of the forest, the farm and even a simple dinner feel threatening as if there is no escape from any danger. Anya Taylor-Joy is a total breakout as she represents the last of innocence that any girl would have, regardless of that time period or now, within this circumstance. She carries the movie well enough that we wanted to see whether she'd escape.The story manages to remain more layered then it needs to be. With little explanation on what the monster is here. The filmmaker understands that the scariest ideas may not be the unseen force, but rather the people that start to look at you at the first sign on trouble. I would love to watch this again, though subtitles would be a welcome addition. Everyone talks in an older, Middle-English tone that makes the setting more alien, though a little hard to understand. Slasher fans may find this too slow, but it freaked me out.I'll give this ten black goats out of ten. The Witch is everything I want in more horror movies; a total feeling of creepiness, a defenseless set of people, and a unique setting. I'm sure that more horror writers will take inspiration from this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror film that's worthy of appealing to critics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One definition of the word 'Horror' is "Intense Repugnance" this film is a perfect example.The Witch follows a family that's being torn apart by the acts of a witch. This film doesn't have jump scares, nor lame cgi driven action. It instead focuses on its story.The performances are brilliant. Everyone was FANTASTIC! This movie just looks brilliant. So many shots look like they could be genuine works of art.I'm not going to go on about being a cinephile though. Because this movie can really appeal to all. The great dialogue and chilling audio leave you feeling perpetually chilled. You can't sit comfortably watching this.There are several shots that are quite disturbing but they aren't overly gory or torturous. We don't get to see the Witch in the film very much but when we do its awesome and unforgettable.I just can't recommend this movie enough!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magically Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once a year, a horror movie is released that doesn't follow the original "hot girl, jump scare" plot, and delves into a mind twisting story that slowly builds up until you're completely lost in awe. 2016's example of this is The Witch. What starts as a simple plot, a family getting excommunicated from the village in 1630's New England, turns into a tale of deception and family bonds being broken. One of my favorite things about the Witch was the dialogue; the entire movie uses Shakespearian-like dialogue that really draws viewers in. The acting itself is superb; there isn't a second that passes by where the actors aren't 110% in character. The film itself makes it evident that witchcraft will play a vital role in the plot, and while it does, the plot takes a turn and really builds itself upon the deteriorating family relationships. The setting of the film itself was beautifully haunting; shots of the forest surrounding the family's farm will fascinate you with a childlike sense of terror. The film's pace was also smartly planned; a well paced build up leads to one of the most intense endings in cinematic history. Overall, this is one of the best works of film I've seen in years, and not only is it an example of what horror movies should be, it's an example of what the art of cinema is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Witch is monstrous, horrifying, cunning, and seedy enough to gratify your well-deserved disgust.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the first preview for VVitch in October, I pondered whether or not to see this movie, not because it didn't look interesting, but because I questioned the impact it would have on my spirit and moreover my soul. Rob Zombie's The Lords of Salem (2012) was one of the better takes on the witch in American Cinema. His representation was frightening and enchanting, drawing you into it's madness as the female protagonist, played by Sherri Moon Zombie, slips into the world of the witch. Cable TV Shows like American Horror Story and True Blood also crafted their versions of the folkloric succubus, while mainstream media and broadcast TV typically glamorize these demonic women to fit popular culture.The Witches of Eastend (Netflix, Jenna Dewan Tatum) put a Norse spin on the origins of witch clans, while the shows Salem and A Penny Dreadful brutally recant the trials which suspected and actual witches faced. Both shows are led by phenomenal actors; Janet Montgomery, who plays Mary Sibley in the Lovecraftian drama, Salem; and Eva Green, Casino Royale's to die for Bond-girl, who darkens every scene with her piercing blue eyes, passionate prose and gorgeous charisma. Last summer, I listened to an audio book entitled, The Teachings of Don Juan, by Carlos Castaneda. The book is an autobiographical account by Castaneda of his exploration into the world of hallucinogens, with a Native America (Don Juan) witch doctor serving as his apprehensive guide. After returning from one of his hallucinations, Castaneda is warned by Don Juan that a witch has found a way into his psyche and might manifest him/herself in the physical world unless Don Juan draws her out. The account of the exorcism is a frightening moment for the reader and author. It is the same underlying feeling of Castaneda's journey that courses through each word, each scene, and embodies this real world witch, a movie so carefully and perfectly crafted by Robert Eggers, it ensures cult status. The Witch is horrifying in its very presentation, with the threat of the unknown always looming. A shining light within the film, Anya Taylor-Joy, plays Thomasin, the beautiful eldest daughter of a farm fed family. Her coming of age, along with several subtle nuances create a duality within the film which is slowly delivered with small, yet impacting, climactic moments. One of the more apparent overtones in the movie is represented by a beautifully candlelit sequence where William (Father), played by Ralph Ineson recites a prayer while holding up a bit of bread that will soon be broken and eaten by his family. William's appearance resembles that of an imagined Christ, on one occasion his clothing appears as swaddling cloth as if an aberration of the Son of God was plucked from a Renaissance painting and superimposed into this film.William's twin children are an indulgence of the eyes and ears, to say the least, their perfect delivery of the well-crafted dialog all but solidifies the films believability. Their relationship to the families blasphemously black, horned billy goat is a trepidation, their counter charm an essential ingredient in the films making. It's always difficult to see children in a role which may expose them to moments of stolen innocence, yet the poetic dialog and tactful inclusion/exclusion of the children during brutal yet necessary moments in the movie allowed for a clear conscience. That's not to say you don't get your witch. The Witch is monstrous, horrifying, cunning, and seedy enough to gratify your well-deserved disgust.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Jesus couldn't save himself, what makes you think he's gonna save you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First-time writer/director Robert Eggers has had quite a ride with his debut film "The Witch," earning the respect and endorsement from the Sundance Film Festival, the majority of American critics, and even the Satanic Church. His film is meant to be both an homage and an ode to New England folktales and fairy tales centering around witchcraft and the supernatural. Most of the film's dialog and structure came from folktales from over two-hundred years ago, as stated in the film's end credits, and the look and feel of the film is remarkably 17th century, right down to the environments Eggers utilizes.If nothing else, "The Witch" is destined to be one of the most aesthetically refined and remarkable films of the year, let alone most beautifully shot horror film of the year. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke emphasizes the eeriness of the deep-wooded New England plantations, with precise focus on the location-swallowing fog and the overcast skies. As dreary and as miserable as the film looks, it's also immersive in the regard that it clearly plunges you into a different world; one you haven't been familiar with in horror films in quite sometime. Every year, we're almost guaranteed to get a Gothic-style, Victorian-era film that emphasizes lush scenery and immaculate cinematography, but rarely do the visual conventions of 17th century folk intersect with contemporary horror. In that respect, "The Witch" is a novel concept that sets itself up for noteworthiness on the basis of its locational possibilities alone.Before I get any more carried away than I already have, the plot must be introduced. Set in the aforementioned century, the story revolves around a traditionalist, god-fearing family led by William (Ralph Ineson), the intensely religious patriarch. His family consists of his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), his eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), his son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), and his young twins Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson). The family leaves their old land to start a new life on a farm, where Katherine gives birth to her fifth child, which is subsequently abducted by a witch before being sacrificed.This starts an unrelenting curse on this family that works to destroy it by going after its most innocent and helpless individuals, the children. Eventually, Caleb winds up becoming the witch's next victim, as a controlling and possessed spirit enters his body and begins to overtake him, all while the family is grieving over the loss of their newborn. Meanwhile, William and Katherine find themselves considering sending Thomasin into an arranged marriage now that she is becoming older, and seeing as she's proved herself in capable to take care of her younger siblings.As one can see, "The Witch" is very much a family drama, with psychological and supernatural horror ingredients injected into the film's premise to add the unsettling undertones. Unfortunately, "The Witch" gets its atmosphere down to a tee so well that it forgets to make a story that's as creepy as it sets itself up to be, let alone moving or worthwhile. Despite such wonderful, gloomy settings, the film never becomes very creepy or interesting enough for audiences to care. Everything, from the characters' personalities to their religious guidance, feels within arm's reach of us, and while the authentic, period-specific dialog is a commendable element, it only works to further distance people from the film's themes.This is truly a shame because I appreciate what "The Witch" sets up: a family rooted in deeply traditionalist, religious doctrine that is slowly finding out that Jesus, God, or any other kind of figure from their Bible cannot save them from the evil and sin that runs amok in the world. The idea that Jesus couldn't save himself is one that's hard enough to grasp, but what happens when one realizes that, because of that, he cannot save him or her either? William, played very well by Ineson, who goes for assertive and unnerving here, has the hardest time grappling with this idea as he watches his family crumble before his eyes.With that being said, watching "The Witch" can be a frustrating experience just because of how lifeless it often is. The level of character interest doesn't come anywhere close to the interest level of the film's setting, and as a result, there's little to connect to or embrace. It wasn't until about the hour mark that I truly felt conflicted as a viewer; here's a film with a biting, interesting premise and themes that's weighed down, not only by its esoteric approach, but also by its lack of legitimate creepiness until the last twenty minutes."The Witch" doesn't flatline entirely like "The Forest" or other horror films of recent years, particularly ones neutered in content and approach to attract a younger crowd, but it doesn't titillate or excite like "It Follows" or "The Sacrament," both films with similar premises, strong themes, but far more accessible characters and consistently interesting setups. Some will claim my soft dislike for "The Witch" comes from my lack of tolerance for slowburn horror, but consistent readers of my work know I hold slowburn horror near and dear to my heart and vastly prefer it over the tropes that have become commonplace in contemporary, American horror. The problem with "The Witch," at the end of it all, isn't its pace, it's the paces it takes in the wrong direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Unsettling but Well Put Together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the best word to describe this movie is unsettling. The trailers hinted at just how unsettling the film would get but they barely scratched the surface of what was going to happen during the story. It's definitely a horror movie but it's unlike any other film I've seen in the genre before. There are parts where it seems like we're just watching a very intense drama but then the atmosphere kicks it up a notch and you're reminded that this is a really disturbing horror flick. The director is a guy named Robert Eggers who hasn't directed a whole lot just yet but I can't help but believe that he has a promising career ahead of him. Let's talk about the plot.Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) and her family in 1630 New England are forced to leave their village because of a difference in religious beliefs. The family heads out into the woods to start a farm and worship the Lord in the way that Thomasin's parents (Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie) want them to. They're already having difficulties adjusting but things get even worse when the baby of the family goes missing. Unfortunately, this is just the first of many strange and horrible incidents that befall the family.The cast does an absolutely phenomenal job and I have to give credit to Anya Taylor-Joy for carrying this movie as well as she does. She hasn't been in the acting game for very long but she already shows quite a bit of promise. Thomasin is a very ambiguous character since she obviously loves and obeys her parents the best she can but her situation is also stifling her. There are many reasons for this but the most obvious one is the deteriorating relationship with her mother. Speaking of the mother, Dickie gives a phenomenal performance as a loving but very strict woman when it comes to her children. I also can't forget Ineson's role as William. He comes off as a tough and hard man but he's afraid of letting his wife know about their true situation out in the woods.I mentioned earlier that the movie excels at being unsettling. Well, there are a few reasons for this. First, the atmosphere out in the woods and around the farm is very claustrophobic and the it feels like there's never a good day around this place. It's always dank and it just feels miserable outside. The house and barn are both small and quite a few scenes take place with all of the characters scrunched together with barely any light to speak of. The film also lets you know right off the bat just how cruelly it's willing to treat its characters about eight minutes in.Another aspect of the movie that I really enjoyed was how it dealt with the titular Witch. We only see the Witch a handful of times during the course of the story but it's obvious that this is a downright evil and sadistic character. We the audience know of the Witch's existence long before any of the other characters do and it makes what the family is going through all the more painful. The Witch is dangerous but the family starts tearing itself apart with accusations and a complete lack of trust. This is best shown in the way Thomasin and her mother interact with one another but Thomasin also has problems with some of her younger siblings. We slowly start to learn that this distrust is part of a larger plot but it definitely leaves you wondering what's going to happen next.I enjoyed this film but it's definitely not the type of thing that leaves you smiling when you exit the theater. Horror fans will probably appreciate an excellent addition to the genre and even fans of period pieces will probably like the look at the past that the movie offers. However, this film definitely won't be for everyone. I found it disturbing and I have a pretty high resistance to this kind of stuff. I recommend it just because of how scary and well put together everything is but make sure you're actually in the mood for something downright disturbing and unsettling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're a true horror fan, you have got to watch THE WITCH</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cinematic achievement in horror. THE WITCH is superbly crafted. Writer/director Robert Eggers has given us the perfect blend of psychological and supernatural thrill that will terrify you to your core. You'll never stop talking about THE WITCH long after it's done.A family in 1630s New England was banished from their settlement, and so the couple and their five children are out living in the wilderness, struggling to survive. Faith is the only thing that keeps them together. But their newborn son mysteriously vanishes and their crops fail, and the family begins to turn on one another, as they are torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession.What's brilliant about THE WITCH, on top of its excellent attempt on trying to be accurate to the period it portrays, is that it's very different from any of the other horror movies we get out there. No jump scares, no cheap gimmicks, no pointless plot. Everything is built up to lead you to creepy and unnerving discomfort and much of it also reminds me of dark paranoia thrillers of the '70s, where there are plenty of suspicions and blame to go around. Writer/director Robert Eggers successfully messes with his characters' and the audiences' minds. In addition to that, great choice on using the olde English mixed with excellent costume design and chilling cinematography, and young talent Anya Taylor-Joy is a revelation, THE WITCH gives a unique and refreshing take on this genre. It's frightening, it's terrifying, full of twists and turns you don't see coming a mile away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The VVitch": A Jewel of Pure Horror Since "The Conjuring" Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Eggers joins the list of the best directors in the genre of the horror of the decade with his first invention of the genre, along with my great idol, James Wan.There are great attributes in the film, the most important "printing". It is logical to think that the movie will comply with poor requirements of today's horror films, but no, this goes beyond, it has tone, it has history, it has soul and has strength. The debut of the director and writer Robert Eggers revolutionizes the genre for the 21st century; trampling all the clichés of the genre and proposing a new face for horror films, it is intelligent, absorbing, stressful and really leaves the audience with a trauma after leaving the theater.The project of Eggers has own terror and does not need jump-scares or any other discounted help to create an atmosphere that even without that it passes nothing wrong feels tension and danger. Perhaps, it is true that "The VVitch" won't have the same thematic impact that had "The Blair Witch Project" in 1991 but if it will have a drastic impact on films of last 5 decades. To create a masterpiece like this, it is not necessary to record scenes difficult to understand ("Inception" - "Donnie Darko") but record scenes difficult to see, film does not take decisions easy but is one of the few excellent horror films where the psychological is not the first trick. The only purpose of the director was capturing the true tale of the New England where religion took side against evil.An extremely religious family composed by mother (Katherine - Kate Dickie) - a Christian woman committed 100 percent to pray and be in communion in all respects religious-, father (William - Ralph Ineson) - a woodcutter who must confront himself for standing to his family and deal with everything that is over him-, the eldest daughter, and face female protagonist of the movie (Thomasin - Anya Taylor-Joy) - a teenager girl from a religious family that's happening by physical and hormonal changes typical for a young man who is prone to overlook the situation that will give a twist to the plot of her life-, the duo of younger siblings, (and so frightening) Mercy and Jonas - Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson)-two ordinary children who serve as gate to destroy the little stability that the family had had after they banished them (this sounds very similar to "Adam and Eve") is confronted to begin again once they were evacuated from the villa where they remained (have to take into account that it is the MDCXXX century (16th century), where there are no hotel, houses or shelters) for purely religious reasons. The father being the head of the family, decides to entrust himself to the Lord and bring them to a forgotten forest to begin a new life together filled with love and peace. After settling there, children play, the father imitates a grower, mother do household chores with her daughter, all normal, until evil touches to their door. Strange but meticulously timed events begin to happen and tension and flame of the film is born and progresses in an uncontrollable manner.A big plus for the movie was the period where was record it, where everything seemed a film of horror, even Eggers' team make it seem better than it was at that time. It is imposing the eye and hand of the director for a show scene with such high quality, dark, evil, totally expressionless. Touching parameters of all horror films but revolutionizing them, as the rain where terror was more dramatic than physical, the forest, where someone was not intended them, someone wanted them, the witch, the presentations were great, Eggers is my third master.The cast is perfect. The formula is again present. No Hollywood stars is needed to give tone and fame to this project. The little unknown cast made us familiarize ourselves better with the characters and in part served to launch the notoriety to Anya Taylor-Joy (born in Miami, but proudly bred by Latinos) and two children.The first appearance of the witch is totally frightening and surprising, it makes to scream to the public with natural elements, with images and a monumental instrumentation that decorate the scene as a typical and disturbing tale of fear.The second appearance of the witch is too much "Red Riding Hood" but the more praised. I have no words to express the mysticism, finesse but at once grotesque introduction, ambiance, scenery, everything, everything...While some people, the end not has seemed them very good, for my was the best, and that it was the result of an excellent game, that had that be the end and the way how they projected it was ambitious, real and mysterious. Colors, soundtrack, photography, cinematography, art, performances and the contribution to the genre of mystery and horror is colossal. It left a mark, a record.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Fashioned Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a while since we have been treated to classic movie making, a period piece where there's strong emphasis on shaping well-defined characters that go beyond simple sketches and are able to project various types of emotions, draw us into the drama, which in this case is more intense than recent releases because it takes time to develop but is firmly grounded on its themes and takes big chances, using realistic dialogue, natural cinematography, and some pretty incredible costumes."The Witch" succeeds because everything in it is carefully tended. The opening scenes have the community dealing with a religious crisis. The camera moves around showing every detail of the austere life this community lives. They live under strict rules, in a new but dangerous world, and we have just learned, one of its members chooses to leave the safety of the small settlement and try their luck near the cold, dark, and very scary forest.As if the world wasn't full of extreme situations that involve hard work, raising cattle, growing crops, and having a severe case of bad luck, there is someone living inside the dark forest, someone who might eventually destroy each and everyone of this family. At the beginning, crops start going bad, the animals sense some mysterious force is approaching, and a very young baby is snatched away by "the wolves", but it soon becomes clear that there is no animal, but a supernatural being that manages to becomes stronger after committing a terrible deed, something that must have taken a lot of debating before it made it to the screen.Events continue, taking each of the members through a slow decay of their inter-relationships. At the center of this is the young girl who is blamed for the loss of her younger brothers, the very strange twins whose behavior hints at some type of dark influence, a guilt-ridden mother whose faith is faltering, and a father who is seeing how his world is about to implode.The film is as naturalistic as it can be, and this makes the horrors appear stronger and very real. The branches of the trees are haunting and alive with forces we don't understand, but this is no art piece, and when nature (in the shape of otherwise, innocent looking creatures) strikes, we know we're dealing with something that will most likely cause a lot of destruction.The world is a cold and nasty place; it's always gray. The sun never shines, and the wind looks like it might just kill you. The night scenes are spooky, and we don't feel safe, completely relating to what the various characters go through. Making the situation worse is that there are children involved, and we are witnesses to a quick deterioration of whatever strength the parents might have. Soon, we see how the forces around them begin to create divisions among them.Another family member is abducted in one of the most shocking scenes in modern cinema, slowly leading to more horrific events, each of them striking even harder than the one before. The film is so powerful that it even uses one of the most popular representations of evil, and it is as if we've never seen it before. When we realize who or what it is, we know we are in the middle of the circles of hell. Much will be said about the ending, but since we have grown used to this great directorial effort, giving us a carefully designed and powerful film, we might excuse the flight of fancy that takes the last minutes of the film. Yet, if that being's intervention looked and felt real, why isn't it possible that we believe that such a situation is possible.One of the best films of the year so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique feat in horror-movie filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the beginning to the end of this film, a unique sense of dread and disgust plagues the family in the film, as well as the family. There's no apt way to describe the feeling this film is going to give you. It's a festering feeling that sits in the pit of your stomach that only gets more agitated as the images of the film sit in the sub-conscious. The Witch is truly unique in that regard; it's a new breed of horror never before seen by the genre. If you're expecting jump-scared and quick-cuts, prepare to be disappointed. This is a film which takes its time and demonstrates mastery of several technical elements of filmmaking. The cinematography is beautifully framed, well-lit and really adds to the uneasiness 'The Witch' aims to evoke. The performances across the board are brilliant, even among the child actors (though, be warned, the entire film is in Old English so pay attention to the dialogue). The direction and production design is especially impressive considering this a first-time director and long-time production designer. Eggers really hit the nail on the head with this horror masterpiece, which will certainly root itself in Horror film history. Do yourself a favor and watch this film whenever you can. Just don't expect any warm, fuzzy feelings walking out of it.Grade: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A completely new experience in the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror has been having it's highs and lows as of recent. There have been some fantastic film, like It Follows and some duds, such as last year's Dark Summer. Luckily, out of the dark waters of big budget horror comes spectacular indie horror films that defy the genre. The Witch defies what horror has been and what it will be.The Witch is one of the only films to rattle me to the core. I found myself alone in the theater, luckily being the only one to watch this film. I had nobody else there to watch with, feeling just as isolated as the characters in the film. I had to tell myself that this was just a movie several times throughout, as I became so invested in the film that I forgot it wasn't real. Being alone, I was fully able to immerse myself into The Witch, a feeling that I never will forget.This film is beautiful. Not only is the script perfect, the score is absolutely beautiful. It is absolutely haunting, creating the perfect atmosphere for the film. The score was perfect, coming in at the right times, causing so much more tension when there could have been some just from the film alone. This film, as many others films could have been, relies heavily on its soundtrack, as it puts forth even more dread than presented in the film. Without the soundtrack, this film would have felt extremely empty. But, the score needs a great movie to work efficiently. And Robert Eggers directing the film makes the film worthy of such a fantastic score. His camera work seems like he has had years of experience, while this is his debut feature. He had control over all aspects, as well as a clear goal that he wanted to achieve. His choice of color palate also was fantastic, as the cool blue tones had the feeling of dread, which is constantly present throughout the film. There were some scenes that were extremely dark and hard to watch, but this makes the film even more mysterious and it makes you even more uncomfortable than you were before. If this film were directed by another person (many other horror films are like this), the film could have been an absolute trainwreck. But in Eggers' hands, The Witch is able to prosper and become the film that achieves its full potential.The acting was superb as well. These performances felt extremely pure, since it seemed as if I were watching something filmed during the time the movie was set in. The standout, of course, was Anya Taylor-Joy. Her performance was the most genuine, where Ralph Ineson gives the most powerful performance. Both actors together had fantastic chemistry, creating the tension and bond needed for the film to succeed. Katie Dickie also was fantastic, being able to completely become a grieving mother. This cast was honestly just stunning.I can say that The Witch is not for everybody. I've read countless reviews claiming that this is the worst movie that they have seen. I feel that this film should not have had a wide release, as the general public won't, and hasn't, enjoyed the movie at all. If this film was released in independent theaters, I think that there would be a whole other reception from the public, as not everyone would be going and seeing it. Nonetheless, The Witch is absolutely an amazing film.While 2016 doesn't seem like it will be the year where many quality horror films are released, The Witch absolutely makes up for the movies that won't be coming out. While this film may not be for everyone, it should be taken with a grain of rice and should be at least considered, as it is a fantastic film. I can say that this may be one of the best films of the year, as well as one of the greatest horror movies to be released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a horror junkie so I'm an expert at managing my expectations. I go in not expecting much. I'm very pleased to say The Witch is one of the best horror movies I've seen in the last 10 years. It has a smart script, a great cast and a creepy score.The film centers on a pilgrim family whose religious fanaticism gets them thrown out of a colony and forced to live in the woods nearby. Shortly after settling, the youngest goes missing while under the charge of Thomasin, the eldest daughter. The family quickly implodes.The director is in no hurry to rush this story. Patient horror fans will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, nothing new on the theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was totally disappointed by "The Witch". I think it's pretty safe to say this movie is the biggest ripoff/letdown of the year! Why? The movie is slow, boring, and adds nothing new to the theme of witchcraft among New England pilgrims. The story revolves around a dysfunctional family that's constantly fighting, and a witch in the woods that barely shows up. When she does show up, she resorts to the usual tricks we've all seen thousands of times before and which therefore leave us cold.To make matters worse, the protagonists speak with thick accents that are an awful mixture of cockney and archaic English and are very hard to understand for Americans. My friends and I couldn't understand at least 40-50% of the dialogs (especially the mother and father's) and so we missed a lot of details.Getting back to the movie, the underlying theme seems to be "evil prevails over good" and "don't expect your Christian faith to save you from the devil". Well, tell us something we don't already know and haven't seen portrayed in movies at least a hundred times! Other than that, not much else happening in this so-called horror. So, I ask, was is the point of this movie? The answer is easy: none.Friendly advice: save your time and money and don't pay to watch this mediocre movie on witches. Do the smart thing (unlike us) and wait till the movie is available on netflix before watching it, if you are determined to waste 90 minutes of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say never in my life have I ever wanted to truly cry about how terrible a movie was. I wasted my time and money on a movie that had me wondering "why the hell am I watching this?" I don't think these reviews make any sense because "The witch" was not scary or entertaining at all. I watched this movie after reading these reviews thinking it must be good, but NO it was beyond terrible. I made this account specifically to write a review for this movie and warn people that it was TERRIBLE! Everyone in the theaters felt the same way considering the fact that we all left the theaters laughing about how our time was wasted and confused wondering what the hell we just watched. The highlight of the movie was when I lost my phone for a minute and spazzed out looking for it. That was the scariest part of the movie. I really don't understand who rated this movie as scary because if anything it was disgusting because of the old naked lady.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Witch" is undoubtedly one of the most skillfully made horror movies I've ever had the privilege of seeing. This movie excels on multiple levels: the performances, the cinematography, the score, art direction, production design - and above all - its unmatched uniqueness. I'm fully confident that this movie will be remembered for quite some time.Something so horrifying occurs during the first five minutes that we are 100% invested for the rest of the movie. We have seen this in the trailer: a young woman is playing peek-a-boo with her baby brother in an open field. Suddenly, the baby is snatched up by an invisible witch and taken deep into the woods. For the record, this movie does not attempt to leave the baby's fate up to question; we see everything. This is an incredibly bold move to make in the first five minutes, and it's frightening as hell. This is not a movie that relies on jump-scares or gore. Rather, it's a perfectly paced slow-burner. Through flawless directing, we are completely aware of how serious of a role religion played for people of this time period. This allows us to understand their overwhelming fear of witchcraft and evil. It wasn't a superstition to them, it was a reality. What makes this film so exceptional is that we are able to feel that fear for ourselves. We sympathize so much with the family on screen that it breaks our hearts to see them afflicted with so much fear. It feels like we are witnessing an incredibly convincing nightmare from 1630s New England. From start to finish, we are presented with so much vivid historical detail, that it's hard to look away from. The dialogue, the costume design, and the historical accuracy make the film all the more realistic. It legitimately feels like we are seeing the 1630s in-the-flesh; not one detail is missing.I highly recommend this movie - not just to horror fans, but to film-lovers everywhere. The sheer level of focus makes it unlike any other horror movie. The performances are so convincing that we see actual fear in the characters' eyes. Nothing looks fake. The score is eerie and deeply unsettling. The cinematography is hauntingly flawless. "The Witch" is never difficult to take seriously. It is all at once a perfect historical film, a heart-breaking drama, and - above all - a blood-curdling horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Scary, Slow Paced and Just Plain Weird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Witch", starring Anya Taylor-Joy-Atlantis_tv, Vampire Academy; Ralph Ineson-Guardians of the Galaxy, Game of Thrones_tv; Kate Dickie-Game of Thrones_tv, Prometheus and Bathsheba Garnett-P2, Mean Girls.I heard a little bit about this movie, before I saw it; that it was a small budget independent horror film with some really good scares. Not so. It's not very scary at all, more on the weird side than anything and it is very slow paced. Ralph and Kate are the devout Christians in 1630's New England that are forced to leave the colonial American settlement they have been living in with their 5 kids-I did not really understand the reason why they had to leave-and find a new home, away from everyone. After building a new house in the middle of nowhere, Ralph and Kate let Anya, the oldest daughter of the 5 kids, watch her baby brother in a clearing near the edge of the forest. Unbeknown to the family, Bathsheba is their neighbor and she performs strange black magic witchcraft during the night. Her latest ritual calls for a baby and Bathsheba decides it won't be a big deal if she was to just pop over and borrow a cup of baby. That is when the whole family starts acting strange and accusing each other of being witches, their animals start acting weird and their crops suddenly go bad. I read that the director used real transcripts from this time period to make the dialogue sound authentic but I had problems sometimes just understanding them, you know, with the thick English accents. As far as the set pieces and the look of the movie itself, they did do a good job on that. It's rated "R" for violence and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 32 minutes. I would not buy this on DVD. I would not rent it on DVD, either, if I were you. If you really want to see it, you should wait until it comes to cable.</fullReview>

I couldn't get past the ridiculous heavy-handedness of the ridiculous themes that the movie addresses. I found myself confused as to what the final bit of the movie did to garner such shock and awe, as I found it to be rather stupid and intelligence-insulting. Also - there was NO HORROR! Common to modern garbage filmes, it was another drama posing as a horror movie. You're better off spending your money on superior offerings: The Village, Blair Witch Project, Antichrist, the original Wicker Man.. even Kill List. I'm sure there are others!Indie movie offerings largely turn out to be disappointments, and this was another example.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How is this a horror movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not sure why this movie is getting such great reviews. It was entirely boring, mostly unintelligible, and not scary in the least. I get that it is set in 17th century New England, but the "This thou musteth come hither from yonder" made it impossible to follow. It is also painfully slow. There were so many times that it seemed to be building to something exciting, only to go completely nowhere. I so wanted to leave early, but just had to wait till the bitter end to see if there was a payoff. No such luck. No horror. No excitement. There was even one point towards the end of the film where the screen goes black for several seconds and I was hoping and praying it was over. It wasn't. The best part of the experience was when the credits started to roll. As soon as the credits started to roll, a woman in the audience said very loudly, "are you serious?". Priceless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the entire movie is spoken in early English, so you really have to pay attention to what is being said. The movie opens to the family being banished from "The Plantation" for some unknown reason. Setting out into the wilderness, they find a plot of land and begin to farm. First, the new baby is gone (it shows a witch preparing to sacrifice the baby and then using it's blood to make herself young). Crops won't grow, bread won't rise, animal milk turns to blood. The son Caleb and his sister Thomasena go to find help, but are separated in the woods, and Caleb is molested by a witch. The family frantically looks for him and he appears naked in the yard, under the spell of a witch. He ends up dying, the young twin children accuse Thomasena of being a witch, she accuses the twins of being witches and the father locks them all in the barn. That night, the witch comes to the barn and destroys it, taking the twins. The father is sure Thomesena is a witch, but before he can do anything, he's killed by the goat. The mother tries to kill Thomasa, who kills her mother in self defense. Then Thomasena calls on "Black Phillip" and joins witches dancing naked in a circle. When the movie ended, almost everyone in the theater was talking about how horrible this movie was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Evil is the nature of mankind." Hawthorne's Young Goodman BrownHawthorne would be comfortable writing in the world of Robert Eggers' The Witch, depicting 1630 Puritans and the repression fostering that witch hunting world. (Need I mention Hester Prynne?) Sins have been committed, no doubt, and retribution seems to be the order of the day, but as in any solid horror flick like this, the evil forces are not clear, hiding as they do behind forests, quick cuts, and darkness.William (Ralph Ineson) and his family are banned by the elders for his pride, never fully explained but seemingly stemming from his willfully breaking of the communal laws or his severe interpretation of religious law. Once outside the safety of the community's walls, the family is subjected to various horrors beginning with the snatching of the newborn child.What witch snatched him, and it's never in doubt that witches are responsible, is briefly conceded to the shot of a voluptuous, ravenous female seducing teen son, Caleb (Harvey Schrimshaw). Beyond that truth lies a host of allegorical possibilities including Brown's sweeping indictment of humanity (see intro quote) with thoughts no doubt going to Adam and Eve.More possibilities lie in the teenage lust Caleb has for his beautiful teen sister, Thomason (Anya Taylor-Joy) and his brother and sister's collusion with the black goat, a sure stand in for the demon. Along with Dad's sinful pride, these sins seem waiting retribution and what better situation than this self-righteous family situated on the edge of a Hawthornean forest peopled by witches.Beyond the explication of punishment and myth, The Witch is just darn good horror filmmaking: The mise en scene has multiple little objects to carry bleak-house metaphor well, the cinematography emphasizes the dark landscape and hidden horrors, and the characters are grimly poetic enough to be holding pitchforks in front of a Gothic farmhouse.Having been a Catholic altar boy and schooled by nuns, I can vouch for the film's accurate and titillating setups for sin and guilt. This is a horror film bound to please horror geeks and novices and the rest of us sinners in between.</fullReview>

Hey, I'm all for historical and period trappings, but when you cannot follow the incessant mumbling of the cast using long-discarded tropes of the common tongue, it's time to turn this twaddle off and watch Margaret Hamilton do the Witch of the West for the 1000th time. Now that's a witch! Here you have grubby expatriate pilgrims or something like that living apart from the other settlers at the edge of a forbidding wood. The isolation evidently makes religious paranoia set in and the the rest is snoozeville. I woke up long enough to realize the Black Goat gives the best performance and then cursed myself for spending the money to see this after-school special about the olden times when all you had to do was accuse someone of talking to a chicken of being a witch.

As if they were thrown in randomly without any sense. Between some scenes there are 5 seconds of black image - what is the purpose of that? Also why is Caleb looking at Thomasin's tits twice in the first half an hour? Wtf? Aren't they brother and sister? This movie could easily be shortened by a whole hour and again it would be so boring. This is not a horror film, this is a bland faceless crap.

		<fullReview>I love horror films. Despite the many I've seen, this is the first of any film I've been compelled to comment upon.Many currently titles seem to focus on a couple of good scenes which you see most of in the trailer. The rest is mostly filler to help the story along which may not receive as much attention. I believe "The Witch" to be a rare exceptions. The story, storytelling, acting, and directing alone would have been enough to make a good movie, but the combination of all parts made it incredible.I cannot remember any dull moments in this film. The story, drama, and horror steadily crescendos until the last second. I must admit that the trailer didn't impress me. There are parts of the film which could have been added to make a better trailer, but it would have given away too much (as is the case so often). Overall, I don't think you'll find another recent horror film which executes everything close to the degree of "The Witch."Well done! Cannot wait for the next film from Robert Eggers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Witches in the 1630s were not 2016 modern gaia loving pagans who worship the earth. Witches *from a 1630s Puritan perspective* made pacts with the devil, drank blood, cursed and killed and this type of hysteria &amp; paranoia is the premises of this film. It's a slow to burn, cerebral movie like The Shining, or Suspiria. But in this day and age of stimulation overload, and film goers who laugh at jerking off jokes, The Vvitch will no doubt be reviewed by some as "boring"..sorry, there are no jump scares, no stupid one liners, this movie makes you think and feel everything. This piece of art was absolutely dark, unnerving, extremely disturbing and completely amazing. It is fantastically made and beautifully executed right down to the soundtrack which is every bit unsettling, containing no more than single string and faint wailing noises.

In an era where there is a fair amount of good horror movies, this snuck by as a period piece that lacked substance, and had a script that could have been written by a 6th grader, which is insulting to 6th graders, because a really smart 3rd grader could have written. A true Hollywood example of owing someone a favor. There was no suspense or build, there was no plot, and nothing made any damn sense. Why was this as scary as my daughters 4th grade haunted house? Was hoping to watch something relevant and instead got something that had the depth of a daytime talk show. Think The View is scarier and has a better plot line than this lame attempt at horror. The only saving grace for this movie would have been if the black goat battled Master Pain in the forest while all the naked ladies pounded on their drums and screamed "that's a lot of nuts".

		<fullReview>I've not seen a film like this in decades. A throwback to a CGI-less era where special effects were minimal, the story well written and performances weren't phoned in for the paycheck. This film doesn't rely on cheap jump scares or loud music to trick the audience into scaring. In fact it relies mainly on tension and the paranoia that eventually overwhelms this New England story. I sat in a theatre in the afternoon with about 30 people. A group left 20 minutes before the story unravelled to a satisfying conclusion (their loss). The performances here are all spectacular, the cast made their roles appear utterly believable. Extra credit is due to the promising young actress Anya Taylor-Joy who stands out above a stellar cast. During the showing there no screams or gasps, just positive comments when the credits rolled. Already this film has found an audience, but I think it's the sort of film to grow ever popular over the next decade or so, possibly even studied. If you like your horrors dripping in guts, gore and profanity, then stay away. This is for fans of the old school horror films, reminiscent of the 70's horror classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed The Witch immensely. The mood it captures so well. A real bone-chilling horror story that conveys full plausibility to the world that it depicts. And the scenery and music help the mood along very nicely.William (Ralph Ineson) and Katherine (Kate Dickie) and their family are expelled over some religious dispute with the elders of a Puritan plantation in early 17th century New England (1630 is the date given). Even the language used throughout the movie is Early Modern English (1500-1700) with its thou-thy/thine-thee 2nd person familiar pronouns-now considered thoroughly archaic. With their children in tow, they tough it out on a small farm somewhere on the outskirts of the plantation, growing Indian corn (aka maize) and raising goats, forbidden to participate further with their brethren in the fortress. This forced isolation from society and other human beings plays a significant role in the movie as does their intense religious practices and beliefs. They take the grace of Christ very seriously as they also do the wickedness of the Devil. The large dense forest near their farm also plays a part in the movie. The focal point of the movie is William's and Katherine's elder daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy). She is 14 or 15 in the movie and what today would be called a pubescent teen. She is the oldest child and is tasked to watch over the latest addition to the family, the infant Samuel. While Thomasin is playing peep-a-boo with him, he mysteriously disappears from her sight. The scene shifts briefly to the shocking scene of a strange nude woman bashing the child to death and smearing herself with his blood. William and Katherine are distraught with grief. At first William explains Samuel's disappearance to a wolf. One other incident is worth noting. The two younger children frolic with their large male goat appropriately named Black Phillip. Thomasin is jeered by them as they hold her responsible for Samuel's disappearance. She chases them and asserts that she is the witch of the woods. After this they fear her.After Samuel's disappearance things grow more awry. His father having failed to find game in the forest, Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), their eldest son, and Thomasin mounted on the farm's only horse set out in search of game in the thick woods. A large hare stares intensely at them as though it has a mind of its own. Caleb tries to shoot it with his father's blunderbuss but he misses. The shot scares the horse. He bolts and tosses Thomasin to the ground. Caleb runs after the hare deeper and deeper into the forest. Soon he realizes he has lost his way. The forest is dense and scary. He stumbles onto a hut and is greeted by a strange but alluring woman who hugs him to her ample breasts. He returns home several days later delirious with fever and dies mumbling prayers as though he's committed some heinous sin. As the incidents pile up, William and Katherine see something sinister and unholy in all the goings-on and become convinced that Thomasin is a witch and begin accusing her of witchcraft on their children, which she vehemently denies. They are both frantic with fear and loathing and soon they turn on Thomasin. Hysteria and chaos set in. In their struggle to take control of her, William is rammed and killed by Black Phillip. As Katherine tries to strangle her, Thomasin kills Katherine with a knife. In the commotion the two younger children are killed. Thomasin is now all alone expect for Black Phillip. Although not clear, it was hinted that she's also had some kind of sexual relation with him. There is the mysterious scene of the witch seemingly milking a goat, but a more sexual interpretation can clearly be made. Docilely she follows Black Phillip into the barn where she partially disrobes, clothed now only in her tunic.In the darkened barn we see the shadow of a man-creature who speaks to her in a deep male voice, asking her what she wants. To experience the world in all its splendor and glory she tells him. He instructs her to sign allegiance to him. She cannot write she tells him. To which he responds: I shall guide thy hand. At the very end we see Thomasin nude in the woods observing a coven of naked witches dancing around a fire chanting curses and incantations and then hovering lightly in the air, they ascent into the sky. Thomasin has become one of the witches of the woods.Was she a witch? It depends on what angle we view the facts presented to us in the movie. Within the cultural milieu in which she lived, one would have found her guilty of witchcraft. Her punishment would have been death by hanging or being burned at the stake. But what about our present milieu dominated by science? A different angle would be to see a young woman severely constrained by parental authority suffering from a neurological disease that would today be classified as schizophrenia, which often manifests itself in teenage years and early adulthood. In her case characterized by the display of both auditory and visual hallucinations (to a person having these hallucinations they experience them as completely "real"*), paranoia, and aggrandized modes of thought. And in the cultural milieu and isolation that she experienced, she could easily believe she had become a follower of the Devil. So, the appropriate answer to the question is, Which milieu does the asker inhabit? To the actors and director, kudos to all of them. A masterpiece horror movie. And one that is open to a sequel.Regarding the archaic English, even though I could follow the conversations reasonably well, I honestly think subtitles would have been helpful. 10 out of 10.* The mathematician, John Nash (1928-2015), learned how to control his hallucinations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bare Witch Project</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I approached this particular witch with caution. At first glance it appeared to be sharing DNA similar to that spooned from the same misfiring cauldron as two of my least favourite sub-genre outings of the past 15 years: M Night Shymalan's The Village and Ben Wheatley's A Field In England. The Buzz generated from early reviews &amp; trailers promised the visual aesthetics of the former and theatrical bombastic lingo of the latter and I braced myself for another hyperbolic disappointment.But I needn't have worried, as writer/director Robert Eggers debut effort delivers full on its promise with a slow burning historical tale of external evil manipulating internalised religious fervour to its ultimate sticky end.The story involves a puritan family of seven ousted from the safety of their colony into a life of corn-crunching hardship in the fertile land of New England's past. But deep in the forest lurks an unspeakably malevolent force that wastes no time instigating a plan of destruction for its unsuspecting neighbours, and it isn't too long before finger pointing accusations of witchcraft begin and the ship of dread sets sail toward its unknowable, terrifying destination...With more than a passing nod to lurid 70's classic Blood On Satan's Claw, Eggers' wicked 17th Century yarn is alarmingly brought to life by his informed ear for the period dialect and the remarkable DP work of his cameraman Janin Blaschke, whose lighting skills drain just enough colour from the landscape to make you believe we're right slap-back bang in the middle of pre-creature comforts 1630.There's no shirking from the harsh day-to- day realities &amp; tensions of these new/olde' puritans existence, but Eggers' screenplay never loses focus on their humanity as a real living, loving family unit either. As the dogmatic hubris of ingrained faith begins to tear them apart from within, the dynamics of the story stubbornly refuses to make snide, self-righteous judgements at their expense, so we always care about their survival even when it looks like things are heading to the point of no return. Any whiff of archaic restraints imploding on the usage of Eggers' authentic dialogue is expertly staved off by a first-rate cast who deliver it with unforced conviction. Ralph Inesen and Kate Dickie as parents William and Katherine (respectively) are very fine indeed, but it's their brethren of offspring that steal the show with Harvey Scrimshaw's Caleb and star player Anya Taylor-Joy as Thomasin making the biggest splash via two of the most original and, not to mention, rudest sexual awakenings ever committed to a horror film.And yes, The Witch is very much a horror film. Brooding atmosphere and disquieting menace take precedence over the urge to indulge the usual tired genre tropes, and the more conventionally minded patron seeking a roller-coaster broomstick ride might be put off by Eggers' steady, deliberate pacing. But when it's ready to get its hands dirty, out come the teeth and claws to reward your patience, not least by landing a jump scare I guarantee you will not see coming, but boy, will you feel it! This one isn't called The Witch for nothing.Eggers' draws everything to a close via an orgasmic flash of perfectly timed delirium that, intentional or otherwise, hits a key visual beat from Logan's Run. The reference points don't stop there either as the eerier aspects of the iconic soundtracks for 2001 and The Shining are gleefully aped by composer Mark Korven's score. His music enhances the outlandish finale to such a spine tingling degree, you almost feel as though you've snuck a peek behind the magic curtain to witness one of the world's best kept secrets.Voices of dissent have called out this ending as a step too far. But for me it's further proof of the movies balls and insurance against a branding from the dreaded 'Psychological Thriller' iron too. The Witch is lean, mean and when it chooses to be, damn right nasty. By stepping back in time to the darkness of our past, Eggers' has sneaked the genre creeping and cackling into the 21st century with an entry to make you think twice about picnicking in the woods anytime soon. And to that, I raise a glass of bloody goat's milk. Cheers Phillip!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Witch was a tremendous cinema accomplishment, especially as the introduction to the big screen for the director. "Evil" has very rarely been so perfectly captured on film. It was not the physical presence of "The Witch" that had you gasping for air, it was instead the pungency of evil that enveloped the entire film. The plot was outstanding and the realness of the situation truly left chills long after the movie was over. "The Witch" is not a film that was meant to be taken lightly. It was a statement, a portrait of how diluted and powerful evil can be. There are no gimmicks, no flashy scenes, no jumps. The fear is meant to linger and leave the theater with you. This movie will not be enjoyed be everybody. It will require a deep thinker and a certain belief or understanding of religion in order to capture the full spectrum of terror provided by this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Is Safe to Say I Will Avoid all the Black Goats at the Petting Zoo Because of Black Philip!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "The Witch" is based on stories about witches and devils that have been circulating for over 400 years or so. The last name free Puritan family of William (Ralph Ineson), wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), daughters Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) Mercy (Ellie Grainger), and sons, Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), Mercy's twin, Jonas (Lucas Dawson) and infant son Samuel are the main characters in this story.The story takes place in 1630, 10 years after the Mayflower landed in Massachusetts. The family is incredibly zealous even by Puritan standards and this doesn't set well with the community who kicks them out. William is determined his family will not let the woods tear them apart and the farm will be a thriving one. The life of the family literally goes to hell when baby Samuel vanishes while Thomasin is watching him. The crops begin to die and the chickens lay dead eggs and the goat gives blood instead of milk. The one animal on the farm that gives the most grief is Black Philip. The twins claim he talks to them and they also claim Thomasin is a witch. The only real witch in the story is the one who killed Samuel and who seduced Caleb when the older boy went out for food for the family. Caleb comes back naked and delirious. He is in hysterics in bed and this wears out his heart and he dies. Mercy and Jonas don't help matters either when they both collapse on the ground in hysterics as well! In the end, the whole family except for Thomasin is killed. William is gored to death by Black Philip while Katherine is killed by Thomasin in self-defense. Katherine tried to strangle her daughter and Thomasin stopped her. Black Philip is really the devil who set in motion all the bad things that happened to the family. He has Thomasin sign the book he has and leads her to the woods after she strips naked. Thomasin is now apart of the coven of witches in the woods and in a weird way is much happier now. Before everyone made her feel like she was a witch and abnormal because she was a teenage girl struggling with puberty. This was a very interesting, scary movie about how a belief system can turn people against each other. This family forgot about love and acceptance all belief systems should have and the devil was able to get a hold of them. All the characters were excellent with special mention paid to Anya Taylor-Joy as the misunderstood Thomasin! Robert Eggers really did his homework in regards to the language, clothing, and religion of the time and it shows!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE WITCH': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed indie horror flick, from debut feature filmmaker Robert Eggers. It tells the story of a deeply devout Christian family, living in the wilderness (of 1630s New England), that are terrorized by a witch (and other evil forces). The movie stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie and Harvey Scrimshaw. It was made on a budget of just $3.5 million, and received rave reviews from critics (but poor reviews from theater audiences). I enjoyed it quite a bit. William (Ineson), and his family, leave the New England plantation they're staying at (in 1630), and head out to the edge of the wilderness, to start life over there. William and his wife Katherine (Dickie) have their fifth child together, named Samuel, but he immediately goes missing. Katherine blames her oldest daughter, Thomasin (Taylor-Joy), for the baby's disappearance; since she was the one watching over him at the time. More mysterious, and very creepy, things keep happening, as the family continues to turn on each other; while always trying to stay true to their faith. The movie is very purposefully slow-paced, and it works. It's always building towards something, and always digging under the viewer's skin. What Eggers does, with such a limited budget, is extremely impressive; and the cast is all great as well. The movie is very creepy, and horrifying, while never giving the viewer any cheap thrills; it's horror done right! It also has some great social commentary, on how being deeply religious can do a lot of psychological harm; to individuals and families (the Satanic Temple even enthusiastically endorsed this movie). Being raised catholic, I'm always fascinated by (well done) religious themed movies (like this). I can understand why the average (unintellectual) viewer wouldn't like it, but everyone else should be blown away!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/vlqkdyuq2zY</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch is not a conventional horror film. In fact, this film deserves a new genre because this film is horror-drama. Everything about The Witch was phenomenal, the acting, the writing, the beautiful yet eerie shots, and the score. I have been waiting for a movie like this. There is no gore, just true suspense and creepiness. For instance, there was a scene when the oldest daughter was milking the goat and saw blood instead. In a different setting this would be merely a concern of the goat's health, but it was truly unsettling for her and thus the viewer. This is a movie that encapsulates the viewer into the scenes themselves. Everything felt like it was touched by evil thanks to the flawless execution. I thought it was refreshing that even though it was titled "The Witch" you only saw her once, making these happenings more mysterious. The ending was my horror fantasy come to life. Not because i haven't seen witches dancing naked by the fire, I've been around the horror movie block a few times, but because of the good daughter you're rooting for becoming an agent of the devil and liking it. This was a drama version of Lords of Salem and a horror version of the Crucible. So creepy and good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Witch has made me unnerved and scared in a way that I haven't been scared in a very long time. It's not a crippling fear, nor is it a jumpy fear but a fear that will make you squirm in your seat. This movie has a undertone that I can only describe as being "incredibly uncomfortable". Robert Eggers found a way to take the once campy and silly Halloween decoration that is the witch and make her feel real and terrifying. 17th century dialect helps you stay grounded and adds to the realism that this movie goes after. I give this movie a 10/10, this movie is important for independent filmmaking and artistic integrity. Please go and support a great movie made by talented people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsettling supernatural chiller with echoes of Hammer horror; excellent all around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WITCH (2016) *** 1/2 Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie, Harvey Scrimshaw, Ellie Grainger, Lucas Dawson, Bathsheba Garnett, Sarah Stephens, Julian Richings, Wahab Chaudhry. 17th century supernatural spook fest about a clan of Puritans in exile attempting to forage for themselves find out instead a sinister force in their midst, threatening their very lives and possibly their souls. Newbie filmmaker Robert Eggers manages to get the psychological underpinnings of the real horror at hand - personality conflicts and paranoia - while evoking a too-real to believe world created with immense production design by Craig Lathrop, beautiful cinematography by Jarin Blaschke and unnerving music by Mark Korven. The ensemble is perfectly blended with a finely etched turn by Taylor-Joy as the eldest child of the brood who is caught between heaven and hell. Genuinely chilling and echoes of Hammer horror films adds to its pedigree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Witch: Allegory of Female Suppression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch renders the world described in Nathanial Hawthorne's Young Goodman Brown and The Scarlet Letter as well as Arthur Miller's The Crucible. &nbsp;This is a film with roots in the great American literary tradition with a twist that leaves the viewer wrestling with some important questions, and like great literature it does a marvelous job posing questions, providing differing view points, but ultimately leaves the answering of the questions to the viewer. The Witch can be consumed as a ghost story and, as such, it is top notch. &nbsp;It has enough spine chilling moments and frightening images to rank among the great horror movies. &nbsp;If, however, one looks at the metaphysical aspects of this tale, it is very much a warning of the dangers of suppressing and subjugating the feminine in a society and how this practice leads to destruction.&nbsp; It also demonstrates the folly of relying on belief over thinking. &nbsp; This movie is literally dripping with symbols representing the feminine, the givers of life: &nbsp;teats, breasts, lactation, an egg, and suckling young are featured throughout the film. &nbsp;We also see the damage that is being done to the feminine over the course of this movie. &nbsp;A babe at it's mothers bosom is lovingly shown at the start of the movie and by the end we see that very same bosom being pecked apart by a crow while the mother believes she is nursing her dead baby which has inexplicably come back to life. &nbsp;We see a hen's egg looking diseased and when it is dropped a bloody half formed chick issues forth from the egg. &nbsp;The life sustaining goat milk which nourishes the family sprays into the milking can as a stream of blood towards the end of the movie. &nbsp;In short, the movie is symbolically yelling at us that the feminine is being snuffed out by this family environment. &nbsp;The female characters in play include Thomasin, the teenage daughter, Katherine, the mother, and, of course, the title character herself, The Witch.&nbsp; If femininity is under attack, it is under attack by the prideful, faithful and incompetent males, most notably the father, William, and the brother, Caleb. One feels for Katherine as both she and the audience begin to understand that William is taking on challenges for which he is clearly not equipped. &nbsp;He is a stubborn man with a fool's notion that with prayer and confession, God will provide and have mercy in the wilderness. &nbsp;William lacks honest, integrity and let's his prideful theological musings be the catalyst for the family being jettisoned into the wild. &nbsp;Caleb admires his father and is working to understand his religious dogma as well as the survival skills that William cannot teach. &nbsp;Additionally, William spends much of his time chopping wood; the only survival activity he has mastered. &nbsp;Perhaps breaking apart organically structured forms is all he is really good at. The female repression is most clearly illustrated with Thomasin. &nbsp;She is working hard to win her mother's approval and support her father's dream even though she most clearly sees the hypocrisy and overall weakness that her father represents. To add to Thomasin's mental strain, we see Caleb straining to look down her shirt and the young twins calling her a witch. &nbsp;All of this comes to a breaking point when Thomasin overhears that her father is planning on bringing her to town to either marry her off or enlist her in to some type of indentured service. &nbsp;The forces at play have Thomasin near or beyond her mental breaking point. &nbsp;We also have The Witch who is shown in the opening scene murdering the baby of family and rubbing the youthful renewing blood all over her naked body under a bright moon. &nbsp;The Witch hounds this family and ultimately is their undoing. &nbsp;She seduces young Caleb and the power of their union leaves him naked, cold, and babbling incoherently. &nbsp;Caleb ultimately dies, but only after vomiting up an apple which clearly symbolizes his sin and also evokes thoughts of the original sin where the feminine was held solely responsible for getting humanity kicked out of the garden of Eden. &nbsp;Silly females, if only Adam had been around to think through the devil's bargain for Eve things may have gone very differently. &nbsp;Perhaps Adam was busy napping, praying, or chopping wood, who knows. After Caleb dies, things go equally badly for the rest of the family until only Thomasin is left. &nbsp;She meets the devil, signs his book, and joins a coven of witches dancing naked in the woods. &nbsp;This is a clever twist on the old tales where we are led to believe this naked woodland dancing is the fabrication of repressed school girls seeking to add a little excitement to their lives. This movie holds blind belief and faith up as a poor strategy for survival against knowledge and know how. &nbsp;It's the mocking of believing over thinking that provides a clue to the real events in this movie. &nbsp;The film is called The Witch and we come to believe and except that this supernatural being exists. If we spend some time thinking though, we see a much more clever ending - THERE IS NO WITCH!&nbsp; Thomasin is the murderer.William treats the women in his life badly, he demonstrates pride and immaturity by leaving the safety of the village and he pays the ultimate price for this folly. &nbsp;If he had listened to his wife and daughter and displayed a modicum of empathy for them, these events never would have happened. &nbsp;Sadly though, the story of the masculine overpowering and ignoring the feminine is very much with us today, and it is one we need to evolve past or we risk unleashing the destruction symbolized in the character of The Witch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be a challenge for any movie to live up to the hype that The Witch has gotten since its Sundance debut last year, but wow, what a gorgeous film. The craftsmanship is beyond impressive. Every shot could have been an art photograph. All of the sets and costumes and props were so painstakingly period accurate that the world of this film felt viscerally real. The oppressive tone never lifted for the entire run time so that you leave the theater still feeling a bit weird.The Witch reminds me strongly of "The Others". Much of the creepiness was drawn from the set and the location. The pacing is similar. Both have super small casts and center the action around child actors. There's very little blood and gore. If you hated "The Others" and thought it was boring, then "The Witch" is not for you. It's not the typical Hollywood horror "scare-a-minute" CGI romp. There's no break in the tension for a comedic relief. It goes to a very dark place right from the start and never shifts that tone.The dialogue can be difficult to follow. It's much more similar to a Shakespearean play than standard issue Period Piece English. I could understand them with some effort, and it made the world of the movie feel that much more real, but some might be turned off by it, especially since the film is so dialogue-heavy.All of the acting performances were top notch. The Twins were creepy and every one of their scenes made my stomach turn. I appreciated that the plot didn't hinge on "horror movie logic". Really, the only complaint I have is that I don't know if I quite buy the ending. Definitely looking forward to seeing this one again, and I hope it makes money because I want to see more smart horror with fewer terrible looking monsters and more filmmaking craftsmanship.</fullReview>

A story about a witch should be sufficient without being tied so closely to "winter's coming." Winter comes annually. Witches mercifully not so much. The young lead actress, Anya Taylor-Joy is terrific. Hopefully a breakout role for her. Actually, all of the young actors are well cast. The 17th century "yeoman farmer" English country dialect is often difficult for an American ear to follow. The movie is a kettle on slow boil. Tough watching a kettle boil.

The cast is well acted, especially the father, and the rest of the cast help to make the film a very spooky experience. As a directial debut for Robert Eggers, this is amount the greatest(along with Tarantino, Shylaman and Redford), and has already etched himself into the history of horror, we can expect a lot more of him in the future.For a great cinematic experience, I recommend watching the witch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More a psychological family drama than a horror movie (not unlike "The Shining" was)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Witch" (2015 release; 93 min.) brings the story of a 17th century family in New England. As the movie opens, we see the husband of the family at trial, due to religious disagreements, and the man and his family (his wife and 4 kids) are forced to leave the plantation and start life anew. Some time (a year?) later, we see the family having built a house and working the land in a far off place. Thomasin, the oldest daughter, goes out near the woods and plays peekaboo with the newest addition to the family, a baby boy. Then after another peekaboo, when she opens her eyes, the baby is gone. She frantically goes looking for the baby in the woods. At this point we are about 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the debut film of writer-director Robert Eggers, and what a debut it is! In the opening credits, we see that the movie's full title is actually "The Witch - A New England Folk Tale". The movie is billed as a 'horror' film, but if you are expecting a slasher movie or something explicit like The Exorcist, you will surely be disappointed. Think of "The Witch" more in terms of the Stanley Kubrick film "The Shining", also termed a 'horror' movie but in reality more a psychological family drama. Even though they are completely different movies, the parallels are uncanny: the isolation, the gradual breakdown of the family, and the ultimate insanity of it all. Newcomer Anya Taylor-Joy is sensational as Thomasin, but truth be told, so are Kate Dickie as the mother and Ralph Ineson as the father. BEWARE: the movie is spoken in 17th century English ("thee", "thy mother", etc.) and I must admit that quite a bit of the dialogue flew straight over my head, I just could not grasp it (English not being my native tongue may be a factor, although I have lived in the US for 30+ years--I'd be interested in anyone else's perspective on this). Even with that 'complaint', I found this to be quite an amazing movie, furthermore so considering this was made on a nickel and a dime."The Witch" premiered at the 2015 Sundance Festival and made a huge splash. I've been waiting to see it since. Not sure why it's taken more than a year to finally get a release in theaters, but better late than never I suppose. The screening I saw this at on the Friday evening of the movie's opening weekend was attended okay but not nearly as well as I had anticipated. Couldn't help but notice that a group of about 4-5 people left the theater midway through, and didn't return. I'm afraid that there was a gap between their expectations of this movie and what the movie really is. Yes, it is a 'horror' movie, in the same way that "The Shining" is a 'horror' movie, but it is so much more than that. If you are in the mood for an outstanding original tale of one 17th century family's descent into insanity, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. "The Witch" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>gets under your skin and haunts you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes you can't believe what you're seeing in a cineplex that will more than likely only show the latest from the major studios. A film like The Witch or most other films from the studio A24 - mostly (if not all) done independently and then picked up for distribution - such as Under the Skin or Springbreakers, would normally be relegated to some art-house theater where not many people could see it. But unlike some distributors who think in only day-and-date theatrical/VOD (or just VOD only), A24 puts something like The Witch as basically a mainstream release (needless to say I saw the trailer for months, many times, in front of big horror and other releases). But I love that a film that goes for being all about simply scaring you by its brooding imagery, period dialog and actors who you won't know unless you have every cast member of Game of Thrones memorized (hint, it's the parents), gets to be seen by so many people. It's not about silly jump scares or characters who are idiots... well, not in the sense of the usual teenagers, but let's get to what I mean.This is all about witchcraft, but it's also not the simple 'riding around on broomsticks' shenanigans or anything that comes close to being jokey. Filmmaker Robert Eggers (which is all the more astonishing as it's the director's *debut*) suffuses his actors and crew into a setting that is unmistakably 17th century New England, and it's from here everything else can be conjured up. His story follows a family of Puritans from England who are cast out from their community (we don't know why, no real need to, except that the father and mother are, to say the least, very religious, even for the Puritans!) They set up a farm and are preparing for a long season until they can grow their crops. They have a bunch of kids, an teenage daughter, an adolescent boy, two twins and a baby. Right at the start the baby is taken by... who? What? Sometimes having some ambiguity can work in a film's favor to make the horror from the story and place even more potent. There's not too much ambiguity with The Witch (unless someone wants to warp around things to their liking, or found something I don't know), and it's clear: there is some real heavy-duty black magic going on in the nearby woods, and whether the spirits (in human and animal form) come to the family because they're religious or just because they're evil beings that like to slather themselves with blood is a little more open to interpretation. And in less confident hands it could have become schlocky or unconvincing, set in a period so that either monotonous imagery could unfold (it could have easily been a too-hard-to-take pace wise effort) or all about the special gore effects.Eggers finds the sweet middle ground, and creates a portrait of a family undone by their own religious fervor, while also being true to what were, at the time, historical accounts of witchcraft. Whether those carried much creedence, Eggers doesn't care - he commits to showing these woods and showing something like a goat or even an apple as something deathly serious, and yet loaded with significance. He doesn't move the camera around like crazy, and of course he doesn't need or should have to: the production design is among the greatest in any horror film, not to mention the certain color palette that he and DP Blaschke give to every shot so that it's like the world is drained of color - grays are even grayer, browns dirtier, and blacks somehow much blacker. It's a serious, darkly directed film, but there's always an intensity about it that doesn't make it ponderous to a point that takes one out of the movie.A large part to why the film is so effective and chilling is the acting. The main adults (Ineson and Dickie, rarely below a 10 emotionally speaking, though Dickie has the trickier role as the one who has to try, up to a point, to keep his wits about him) are very strong here, both playing variations on God-petrified mortals, but the movie for me really belongs to Anya Taylor-Joy (her first major movie role, expect to see her in many things to come) and Scrimshaw as Caleb.For the former, she has to carry many scenes all based on why she is a trustworthy person, and she sells it, while for the latter, this boy, it's a role that needs someone to play the period dialog (which is only occasionally obfuscated by the accents) and having to be genuinely scared to death when faced with the evils in the woods. When you have characters who are both "simple" folk of the Lord while also being capable of being twisted by the same dark forces they can't escape, you need people to sell it. They all do, to lengths not unlike out of Polanski at his fiercest.So combine a filmmaker who wants to make Dread with a capital D his priority, a setting and location and things like just a barn or a door that feel eerie and ominous, and actors who dig in to characters who could very well destroy one another due to their fears (except for Thomasin), and you got a unique genre piece that works just as well as drama as horror, if not better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a horror film, nor much at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witch presents the audience with some interesting dialogue, an enjoyable setting and a couple very good characters. This unfortunately ends the positives for this film. The Witch is not a horror film, and perhaps that is more the fault of the marketing rather than the film, it is a period piece with a couple of weird scenes in it where nothing frightening happens except perhaps one jump scare. No build, no tension, a single jump scare and credits.The score for this film is a tad offensive, it's the same exact score other B level horror films blast so loud you have to cringe a bit, followed by nothingness. Basic dialogue taking place in a pretty setting, then when you believe the film might be starting it is over and you're wondering where the hell the film from the trailers was, or where the "horror" aspect was hiding. The biggest flaw of this film is that no story is told, it's a couple of scenes strung together that don't build to anything, and in the end there is nothing of interest. No scares, no story, no narrative, a couple pretty shots of the wilderness and a goat.If you really like old accents and monologues in dark rooms, this is for you. If you want a story, anything frightening or tense, or something you haven't seen before, this one isn't it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Witch: An Allegory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Witch" is arguably one of the most racially prevalent movies of the millennium. This is a story of white (English) settlers who settle in rural America and are banned from a plantation. The plantation is a literal reference to the plantations that white forefathers originally enslaved blacks in colonial America. William (the father) was kicked out of the plantation for being too radical, to which he argues that his practices are, in his mind, justified because they what God demands. He and his family are banished and take their farm somewhere else. Black Phillip (the goat) symbolizes not just the black slaves, but the entire black race; when let out of his pen he is taunted by the children for being black and even his name: BLACK Phillip is a nod to the tyranny and oppression of the white man. Throughout the movie, however, Black Phillip learns to turn the white family against one another. Eventually they all kill each other. Black Phillip (The black race) rises to the top where he belongs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horribly boring!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see The Witch at an advance screening with no expectations, not watching the trailer nor reading any reviews ahead of time. I was bored to death. This movie should have been edited down to 30 minutes. The use of suspenseful music to make me anticipate something is going to happen but nothing does makes me feel humiliated. Using low lighting to minimize the visual effect of scary scenes is counterproductive. This types of techniques won't work in the horror genre nowadays. The old English language is another negative feature of this movie. The TV show My Haunted House is scarier than this movie. A horror movie fan should skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flat, boring, overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I saw this one at the grand opening of the Sitges festival. I went with high expectations after all the praise I read from the critics and success it had in Sundance. WooW, what a waste of time, this is proof I will ever pay attention to critics again, seems they live in another planet (not were the rest of the viewers lives). Flat boring script where absolutely nothing happens during the first hour, you start wishing the movie ends waiting of course with a weird ending. And that's exactly what you get, what I regret the most is that I love movies involving witchcraft, but this one is a truly forgettable one. Invest your time in Salem on TV, that's the best you can get thinking about Witches right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The early reviews are quite shocking. it seems that this film is getting positive ratings due to the fact that it is In the sundance film festival. I saw it there and was very disappointed. The few things the film does right are lost among all the problems. While the music does a decent Job capturing the tense atmosphere it fails to be anything more then unoriginal. The films uneven pacing is another key factor in its demise. It's extremely hard to watch in that it's very boring. When the film really gets going it's hard to care since the character development was limited to a few scenes between characters that feel forced. The subtleties the film attempts at are lost thanks to poor script writing. It mashes different folk lore of the period together and winds up feeling very clunky. Especially in the horror parts. The mood and atmosphere are set up beautifully but when it comes to the scares they fall flat, again thanks to poor character writing. In the end The Witch feels lazy, underwritten, and devoid of any real scares. If you would like to see a real atmospheric, well put together horror film see The Babadook. This film is one I will not see again.</fullReview>
