		<shortDescription>'Please Don't Tell What Mildred Pierce Did!'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James M Cain's novel 'Mildred Pierce' was much tougher, dirtier, violent and cynical than the gorgeously mounted movie it became, but the film still manages to maintain enough of the flavor of the book to be interesting. The portrait of working class life in Southern California works well, as does the depiction of a marriage that breaks down because of disappointment and resentment rather than anything melodramatic. Within its first hour MILDRED PIERCE captures something anxious about American life and marriages and families that is more true than most of what movies had shown up to that time, and it would prove to be even more so in the postwar world to come. The movie actually becomes more false and synthetic as it moves into Mildred's rise in life, but by then the plot and characters have taken hold.And so has the film's increasingly bleak look at what women can expect when they live and work alone in a man's world, beset by men who want to exploit them, sexually and otherwise. This too, though softened from the book, would have seemed refreshingly frank to many of viewers at that time.What raises the film to the level of classic is the first class work from every professional in every department. Joan Crawford is not much more expressive here than she was in her later MGM pictures, but this character suits her limited talents so well that she seems better than in almost anything else she did. All her Warners pictures used her more effectively than MGM usually managed to do, perhaps because in them she is invariably exploited, abused, maligned, even tortured. The bad behavior her Warners characters inspire in others is so extreme that she doesn't need to be. These plots do what Adrian's sometimes garish clothes did for her at MGM: they give her a personality, make her seem more interesting than she really was, and they make her sympathetic despite her essential coldness. Crawford gets able support from Ann Blyth, Eve Arden (as comedy relief; she is almost appearing in another movie entirely), Zachary Scott and especially Jack Carson, dead-on as a sweaty hustler and low rent lothario, bringing nuance to what could have been a one-note portrayal. Bruce Bennett isn't really a good actor in the role of Mildred's first husband, but he's perfectly cast -- he looks like an Okie from one of Dorothea Lange's photographs who went west to 'make it' and never did.And as has been frequently mentioned here, Ernest Haller's cinematography (especially in the brilliant prints now being shown on cable) is consistently evocative and beautiful. So many of his shots live in the memory: in the scene where a mink wearing, gun wielding Mildred comes upon Monte and Vida kissing, the image is an almost primal one of betrayal and glamor -- the way their profiles are in darkness, the way Ann Blyth arches back against the bar, the hard, dim glitter of lame and the billows of tulle from her gown. The way Vida tumbles forward into almost blinding lamplight while Monte's face hardens behind her -- these are the kinds of wonderful images the best old films regularly delivered. Also excellent is Anton Grot's art direction, opulent but still managing to help create the particular SoCal atmosphere of this picture. And as usual, Max Steiner's score is effective, but as an earlier poster noted, he recycled a couple of motifs from his Oscar-winning score to NOW, VOYAGER. And director Michael Curtiz must be praised for keeping everything in perfect balance. This is one of the most admired '40s pictures and well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Great Film Noir Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joan Crawford, one of the world's great movie stars, truly shines in "Mildred Pierce", a tense, prickly film noir full of suspense and drama!Joan is Mildred, a hard working pie and chicken maven who becomes a successful restuaranteur. Ann Blyth is superb as her nasty daughter Veda, who stoops to every level to get what she wants. Eve Arden and Jack Carson are unstoppable as Mildred's friends. "Mildred Pierce" was directed by the famed Michael Curtiz, best known for his work in "Casablanca". But it is my opinion that his best work is "Mildred Pierce". The lighting, the costumes, the sets, and most importantly, the writing all help this gem of a film become a true classic.Joan won an Oscar for her breathtaking performance, but the tour de force powerhouse in "Mildred Pierce" was Ann Blyth. Black hearted Veda was the lynch pin of this movie, and Blyth's portrayal made Veda seem all too real and frightening. Nominated for an Oscar, she should have won.Don't miss this timeless nail-biter</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crawford's tour-de-force is a real stunner.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joan Crawford's tour-de-force as a self-sacrificing mother is a real stunner. Directed by Michael Curtiz, and based on James M.Cain's steamy novel, "Mildred Pierce" is a slick stylish sudser that ranks among the best.After a decade-long streak at MGM, Crawford, made her way over to Warner Bros. It was a brilliant move as Crawford won an Oscar (as Mildred) and ended up back on top.As the title character, Crawford brings a sense of steely determination and guts. As a devoted housewife, Mildred puts the needs of her family first. So when her husband (Bruce Bennett) begins a sleazy affair with a woman down the street, Mildred kicks him out and starts life anew. Nothing - not even one daughter's death and another daughter's selfishness - stops Mildred from working her way to the top. She goes from waitress in a greasy diner to the wealthy owner of a successful restaurant chain. But despite her achievements, Mildred must contend with a slimy lover (Zachary Scott) and her increasingly vile and spoiled daughter, Veda (Ann Blyth). All the drama comes to a rousing climax, which culminates in a physical altercation between brat and mom.Crawford's gut-wrenchingly sympathetic performance draws you in, and the sparks that she and the wonderful Blyth create are unforgettable. Also, a playful Eve Arden as Mildred's pal, spouts off some terrific dialogue."Mildred Pierce" is an exceptional piece of work that uses some of the finest elements of classic cinema. The story moves along at a sleek pace, and thanks to the writers, "Mildred" never sinks in the froth of its own soapiness. A powerful, emotional cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noir Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joan Crawford won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of the title character in this 1945 offering by Warner Brothers. Ms. Crawford was in her prime then and members of my generation, who remember her in films such as 1968's Berserk and 1970's Trog, are sometimes surprised to learn how attractive and talented she was in her heyday. The mean-spirited commentary of her life which we have been subjected to since her death in 1977 notwithstanding, still there was a certain hard edge to her personality which shown through in her screen roles. That she was able to win filmdom's greatest prize by playing a willing victim and vulnerable woman is perhaps the greatest tribute to her abilities as an artist. At any rate, she was the star of this film noir classic, a story that holds up well after 57 years. Mildred Pierce was an ordinary housewife of the era. No skills, relied on her husband for sustenance and leadership and was crushed when he ditched her for another woman. Her daughters were her whole life, doting unhealthily on Veda, the older one, especially (a very young Ann Blyth, herself nominated for Best Supporting Actress for this film). But, Veda was a schemer, conniver and social climber from the word go and it was ultimately her actions which brought an interesting human interest story to a thunderous climax. The story fascinates as we see Crawford, through iron will and determination, become an independent, successful business woman even as she makes tragic error after tragic error in her personal life. Mildred Pierce really is a rare animal, as it truly is more of a human interest story than any other in the film noir genre. The cast is great: Jack Carson, outstanding as Mildred's lifelong friend and would-be suitor, Bruce Bennett as Mildred's nice but weak-willed husband, Zachary Scott as the caddish successor to Bruce Bennett for Mildred's affections, and Eve Arden (still another nomination for Best Supporting Actress) in one of her trademark roles as a no nonsense gal pal. In Mildred Pierce, we have murder, love, misguided love, love not reciprocated, jealousy, misunderstanding, and good intentions/bad results. Could it be this film is so intriguing because we see in our own lives one or more of these very human conditions?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent characters, excellent story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent, riveting story. I watched it on DVD (not having been alive to see the theatrical run) and did not pause once for refreshments or breaks. If a movie can captivate you start to finish, immersing you to the extent that you do not want to break the spell, then it is excellent film-making.I believe it is misclassified. Mildred Pierce did not really strike me as Film Noir. That may be because I went into it expecting Film Noir and, while some of the genre elements are present, it really never stayed in that territory. Mildred Pierce is very much a simple character study, almost a biopic. It starts and ends addressing a murder, and Mildred's flashbacks occur while she's at the police station, but that's pretty much the extent of the Film Noir influence.Instead the movie focuses on who Mildred is and how she became that way. At the time of the murder she is an accomplished and successful businesswoman. She did not start out that way and the movie traces her life path at a steady and interesting pace.Joan Crawford is? well, she's Joan Crawford in the title role. The only flaw I can find in the movie is that Joan has difficulty expressing vulnerability. She looks so imperious and so strong that it is sometimes tricky to accept that her character is so downtrodden. One cannot completely excuse Joan for this either as, even when Mildred is a single mom of two daughters, desperately broke, she still wears clothes that look far above her particular station. This was always a signature quirk of Crawford's where she was loathe to appear in public looking anything less than the glamorous movie star and, likewise, did not want to appear unattractive in her movies. Compare this to Bette Davis or more recently Charlize Theron (in "Monster"), two actresses who happily "uglied" themselves for certain roles.That is a rather negative tangent though and I should state that this aspect of Joan's presentation of Mildred was, to me, a minor flaw. Overall she was solid throughout, demonstrating quiet dignity when faced with challenges, unwanted advances and even heartbreak. Her two moments of rage were presented in an authentic contrast. So, Crawford delighted this viewer and I cannot imagine anyone else in the role.The supporting cast was excellent as well. Jack Carson (one of my favorite character actors) shined as the wolfish friend who really treated her better than either husband. Zachary Scott was so authentic as the lazy, formerly rich hanger-on both in acting and appearance that he was almost a caricature. Eve Arden's role was smaller but it contained plenty of her famous sarcastic wit. Bruce Bennett was the weak link in the cast but, to his defense, his character of Bert didn't really have much to do other than be a catalyst for Mildred's success in the early part, and then a mildly sympathetic shoulder in the later.The best performance possibly goes to Ann Blyth as the hateful daughter Veda. Blyth played Veda as porcelain, untouchable and wholly uncompassionate. Veda barely bothered to hide her contempt from her love-blind mother and feigned sadness or remorse when the situation demanded it. She was unapologetic to the end. A fascinating portrayal.Highly recommended if you have an opportunity to see it. Like a novel, the movie is best viewed in an otherwise quiet, dark environment so that it can be afforded full focus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joan Crawford's Signature Role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With those broad shoulders, those wall-to-wall eyebrows, that steely look on her face, and wrapped in those expensive clothes, the inimitable Joan Crawford exudes glamour and resolve as famed Mildred Pierce, housewife turned businesswoman, in this Michael Curtiz-directed film, part mystery, part melodrama.The film's story, told in flashbacks, begins with mystery, and it is helped along by terrific B&amp;W lighting. Most of the rest of the story is sheer melodrama, with talky dialogue that erupts from confrontations between various characters. The most important confrontations occur between Mildred and her ungrateful, scheming daughter Veda, who requires tons of money to be happy. As the story moves along, Mildred buys and successfully operates a restaurant, but it's not enough to win approval from her odious daughter. Mildred's love for Veda is deep. But Mildred, we learn, is also a take-charge woman who won't take any guff from anyone, at least from caddy suitors or prospective in-laws.It's a great story. And in addition to the topnotch cinematography, the film has great production design, costumes, and editing. We're also treated to some pleasantly nostalgic music from the 1940s. Crawford gets good support performances from Ann Blyth, Eve Arden, and Jack Carson. I also liked Butterfly McQueen, the little lady with the high-pitched voice who plays Mildred's maid.I suspect this film would have been worthy of praise, even with someone else playing the title character; the film is that good. But no other actress would have had the stage presence of the impressive Joan Crawford. It's mostly because of her that "Mildred Pierce" will be remembered and loved, for generations to come. It's also partly because of "Mildred Pierce" that Joan Crawford will be admired as a Hollywood legend, for generations to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's a mother to do?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film might very well be director Michael Curtiz's best movie ever. He was working at the top of his form; it didn't hurt to have a great team behind him. Mr. Curtiz worked very well with Joan Crawford, who was about one of the most professional actress in the Hollywood of the 30s and 40s. For this Crawford vehicle, the novel of James Cain was chosen, even though it was probably a high risk to take in those days of hypocrisy and censorship.Several commentaries in this forum classify the film as an example to the genre "film noir", but if by that, the criteria is based on the great black and white cinematography, it is completely wrong, in this viewer's humble opinion. This novel is a hybrid of pulp and mystery writing. It is pure melodrama, so in vogue at the time when this movie was made.The way the story is told in flashbacks holds the viewer's interest because it makes one feel as though Mildred did the terrible deed, when in reality she is nothing but a victim herself of her cunning little daughter, who couldn't care less for the mother that gave her life. Mildred is the kind of woman who will sacrifice herself in order to give her daughters the life she didn't have, only to be resented by Veda, the child who is the monster and always wanted more. Veda is just the opposite of her younger sister, who dies, inexplicably, and becomes the center of attention for the ever doting Mildred.Veda is a spoiled child, and she knows it! She plays her hand very well knowing she has Mildred eating out of the palm of her hand. By wishing to be what she is not, Veda enters a world of sophistication she is not prepared for, even though she fakes it. One can almost see her falling into the greedy arms of Monte Baregan, the playboy who is the love object of both mother and daughter. He will be their downfall. We cannot think of anyone, but Joan Crawford, playing the title role. She was at the pinnacle of her career, something that Michael Curtiz knew and got a great performance out of her. Ms Crawford is totally convincing as the mother of the story tormented by the same monster she created.Ann Blyth was fairly new to films when she appeared in this picture. At times she looks extremely young, even younger than what she is supposed to be in the film. That Ms Blyth holds her own, playing opposite to Ms Crawford, speaks volumes. Her career never had such a fantastic moment as the creation she made of Veda.Jack Carson was an excellent actor who always played secondary roles, but he shines as Wally. Zachary Scott also, plays the oily Monte with great panache. Perhaps the direction of Curtiz helped his performance, but then again, compared with his work with the director in "Flamingo Road", he makes this Monte become real. Eve Arden, as Ida, doesn't have much to do, but she was always so good in everything she did.There is something that no one has commented upon, and it is the great, if brief, performance of Butterfly McQueen, who alas, is not even mentioned in the IMDB credits. She might have been uncredited in the film, but it is about time to give this woman the recognition she very well deserved in her brief scenes on the movie.Mr. Curtiz couldn't ask any better than Ernest Haller as his cinematographer. This man's work is nothing short of genius. He was a huge talent behind the camera! The music by Max Steiner is always effective, however, there is a moment in the film that one hears a few notes of the score of another movie, and frankly, I'm not sure whether it's from "Now Voyager", or another film. It's very quick, but it surprised me, as Mr. Steiner was a very original composer.This film is not only a classic, it is Hollywood at its best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melodramatic and proud of it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story that unfolds in Mildred Pierce is complicated and dark, and at its darkest, is a chilling portrait of a mother so devoted to her children (well, child, really) that she would go to any and all lengths for them. Although some of the situations and scenes suffer from the passage of time (the modern audience in the cinema, myself included, couldn't help laughing at some of the more ludicrous things said/done), the film as a whole worked, mostly on the strength of the performances.Joan Crawford won her only Oscar for her role, and it was well-deserved--she held the film together with a confident performance that ranged from charming and sassy, to desperate and almost frightening. The final scenes of the film, especially, captured Mildred at her most pathetic, and Crawford looked utterly despondent in the telephone scene. Ann Blyth is utterly convincing as the spoilt, deeply disturbed Veda, narcissistic and unrelentingly manipulative of her mother. And the best supporting performance had to come from Eve Arden, who played Mildred's friend Ida--Arden saunters across the screen, stealing scenes left and right, before disappearing from view again. She was excellent!The film is well worth the watch--not brilliant, but definitely very good. I also like the story-telling technique and the direction (the director made quite clever and frequent use of shadows and mirrors), and it's good that the darkness and melodrama was frequently mitigated by the well-written dialogue. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie this is even on my (I think) 4th viewing. Joan Crawford excels in the title role as does co-star Ann Blythe who normally played sickly sweet heroines. Here she is the manipulative narcissistic daughter. The tension builds throughout this movie, the script is excellent and all the minor roles are cast and played beautifully. Eve Arden is wonderful as the second banana, she is dry, droll, witty and jaded and gets this across so well and is a wonderful counterfoil to Joan's intense mothering. The ending is very satisfying and feels exactly right. Why don't they make them like this anymore. a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. Joan Crawford gives a stunning performance as Mildred, and I have never seen anyone with those eyes! I saw this with my mum on video when I was young, and I thought Joan was the most beautiful woman in the world! Color film could never give her such transcendent perfection. Butterfly McQueen, the maid Lottie, stole my heart as well; her sweet yet practical manner makes her an unforgettable asset to this film. You can't help but love her. Veda is a perfect nasty, her frozen beauty matching her frozen heart. I always thought that the penniless playboy looked like one of Tex Avery's Wolves! Watch "Red Hot Riding Hood" to see what I mean! It's a crying shame this movie only got one measly award. Even if you don't like Noir or older films, this one you can make an exception for. The sight of Joan in that incredible fur hat with THOSE EYES makes this more than just another movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film on a college campus in an auditorium built in the 1930's. It was over twenty years ago, yet I can still feel the emotion and experience of seeing a Joan Crawford movie for the first time. This film was, and still is, one of the best on many levels. The film noir connection is evident. The supporting players, Jack Carson, Eve Arden, and Ann Blyth, among others, were perfect. Joan's portrayal of the mother who had to work in a restaurant was real. Blyth was the ultimate bitchy daughter and deserved the Oscar as supporting actress.I learned later of Crawfords huge comeback with this film, and not knowing her successes previously, it made perfect sense. She really had it. It's a shame that Faye Dunaway couldn't project this part of Crawford's life and career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting....but beware!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This gets high points for the fine acting, memorable characters and successfully melding a film noir with a soap opera. The movie is very interesting all the way through but if stupid and/or annoying characters get to you, then don't bother with this because there are some big-time fools in this film who are guaranteed to raise your blood pressure! There are six major characters in this film, only one of which I can find no fault. Three people are totally despicable, one is nice and sensible, and two are somewhere in the middle.NICE AND SENSIBLE - Eve Arden, who provides the humor and common sense consistently. For those Baby Boomers who remember her as TV''s "Our Miss Brooks," that's what she is here: same voice, same wise cracks.HORRIBLE HUMAN BEINGS - Ann Blyth, the Daughter from Hell, one of the worst spoiled kids in the history of film. Zachary Scott as Mildred's second husband, a slimy, gold-bricking bum who has absolutely no morals. Jack Carson as the way-too-horny slob and ruthless businessman/lawyer .IN THE MIDDLE - The lead character, Mildred Pierce, played by Joan Crawford. Her good characteristics: hard-worker, good business sense (until the end) and very devoted mother. Her bad characteristics: absolutely no sense of judgment on how to raise kids or what a marriage is all about. Bad hairdo, too! Bruce Bennett as Mildred's first husband. Good - has common sense regarding the kids, shows forgiveness and loyalty at the end. Bad - cheats on his wife to begin with and walks out.Note: Get the DVD. It's a beautiful transfer: nice sharp picture with good contrasts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce (1945)A masterpiece with few flaws. You want a fast beginning, a mother of all flashbacks, a cleverly deceptive detective, a daughter to rival the "Bad Seed," and an empowering triumph of a woman in a man's world? "Mildred Pierce" creates a matrix of all these things. Add two husbands with dubious intentions, a potential boyfriend who is a sheep in wolf's clothing, a masculine female sidekick with uproarious quips, and an African-American maid who chimes in with perfect and disturbing agreeability. Oh, and a murder, an affair between husband and daughter (not his daughter, at least), and some set design to make your heart pitter patter.The movie is complex without seeming baroque, and richly visual without seeming indulgent. For all its melodrama, the construction, the acting, and the plot, actually, are restrained. Or if that's impossible to imagine, they are reasonable, focused, and powerful. Crawford dazzles.Five years before the filming, Crawford had adopted a daughter who would as an adult write the scathing book, Mommie Dearest, so there already were personal reasons the actress might really respond to the plot of the movie, which is about misunderstanding as much as indulgence. (The real Crawford was accused of abusing, not indulging, her adopted children.) She was by 1945 a seasoned, devoted actress, who knew her trade and had the talent to back it up, so she poured herself into scene after scene, stealing the movie, and winning Best Actress from the Academy. As usual, the best acting award went to a performance in a brilliant film--everything about the movie is exceptional. Even the slightly caricatured sidekicks played by Eve Arden (such sarcasm) and Jack Carson (with a heart of gold after all) end up believable, and their airiness sharpens the drama of the other roles by contrast.The daughter? She shifts from spoiled child to spoiled young adult in the four years of the narrative, and never loses sight of her greed, which really does blind her. Even when she is a cheap performer (on screen) she is biding her time, and has plans to win. At any cost--the price being paid in the final dramatic scene (which opens the film). And then the actual parting shot--is it a happy ending? Not exactly. It's somber, but it leaves us hopeful, and that is enough, and frankly necessary, because we have seen Mildred Pierce triumph over losing her husband who left, losing a daughter to pneumonia, losing a business to indulgence, losing a daughter to prison, losing a husband to bullets, and almost losing her life in suicide at the docks. If she is stupid (not) or naive (not) or just plain stubborn (maybe), she is also admirable and positive, too talented and at least conditionally generous. We are on her side straight through, and we win.Director Curtiz (of "Casablanca" fame) and photographer Haller (see any number of amazing films, starting with "Gone with the Wind") combine to make this film ripple in every visual sense. The story is by John M. Cain (who has "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Only Rings Twice" to his credit, no less), whose compact plot makes for perfect filming. And there is the music, in tune with the emotional drama and yet not over the top, by Steiner. The pedigree was perfect, and the stars aligned. Give this some attention and you'll be able to watch it twice in a row.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How To Teach Noir With This Template</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:I actually saw a review of Soylent Green calling it neo noir. This film is a great way to help you not embarrass yourself. The most important aspect of Noir is that good triumphs at great cost, often dying, as in Out Of The Past or Double Indemnity. I am sorry she indulged Veda but she was a moral mother who sacrificed everything, even attempting to die for Veda at the end. Indulgent does not make not a moral mother. Mildred is the good character who suffers the tortures of the damned to try and help Veda. Being a waitress, later owning a chain of restaurants all to provide that snotty, little poster girl for birth control the lifestyle that her role model, the fop Monte, thinks is so indicative of existential worth. The other test is the use of shadows Film Noir means black film; it is an existential metaphor. But notice, at the beginning at the beach house, where Mildred attempts to frame the loathsome Wally for Veda's killing of Monte, see the shadows everywhere? If you are watching an old black and white film and the director does not use shadows prominently in the frames, as you see here, you are not watching Noir. Black film because of the misanthropy the shadows represent; the shadow inside all of us. It is a reference to Jung who was quite popular when these films were made. Everyone except Mildred, including Burt, is a louse here. Yes, the youngest sweet daughter is good, but Curtiz kills her off quickly. All the main characters prey upon Mildred in one way or another. Please, stop with she spoils Veda so that means she cannot be a Noir protagonist. She tries to go to the electric chair for her; I say, that might qualify her as a moral heroine. The whole picture is centered around the sacrifices she makes for that snake. Again, watch the ending, notice the rising sun dispelling the shadows, another existential metaphor but look at the suffering Mildred has endured!! This is quintessential Noir, good prevails at the end but often it kills or cripples the protagonist as in Out Of The Past. Even Wally buys her restaurants out from under her for a song. There is no one but Eve Arden as comic relief and moral support everyone else is a complete villain.The shadows at the beach house, how they partially envelop the characters who walk through them. Yes, theoretically, Body Heat and Black Widow were color Noirs. Body Heat uses shadows very well despite being in color. Kasdan does this by making almost the entire movie take place at night. Black Widow is not nearly this well done. The shadows are usually walked through here. Yes, Mildred's actions may seem somewhat morally dubious but all is for Veda. She protects and sacrifices her happiness for that evil, little witch. When we first meet her she is about to jump in the ocean. Only the cop stops her. If you really wonder: is the protagonist moral in sacrificing for another person as Mitchum in Out Of The Past? The movie is a great film far superior to the overrated, boring Casablanca; it is Curtiz's best picture. It also is an excellent way to teach Film Noir. Crawford deserved the Oscar she gives her best performance by a mile. Ann Blyth plays the daughter from Hell. Who will ever forget her speech at the foot of the stairs after faking pregnancy to shakedown that rich family with Wally's help of course? One Of The Best Noirs Ever Made.</fullReview>

It is packed with suspense , emotions , murder , intrigue , and is pretty entertaining . Top main cast with a splendid Joan Crawford whose acting in the title role won an Academy Award for best actress . Furthermore , a strong support cast as Zachary Scott , Jack Carson and Eve Arden who won Oscar nomination as likable friend . Fine cinematography in black and white with lights and darks by Ernest Haller , who along with Nicholas Musuraca and John Alton are the main artists of the classic photography that illuminates the Noir cinema. Excellent and tense score by the maestro Max Steiner fitting perfectly to intrigue and melodrama .Also shown in horrible computer colored version but is necessary avoid it .The motion picture is stunningly directed by Michael Curtiz . He is an expert in strictly American film Noir genre and in drama as proved in ¨Bright Leaf , Flaming Road , Passage Marseille¨ and of course ¨Casablanca¨ . Rating : Good , above average . Worthwhile watching .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Personally, Veda's convinced me that alligators have the right idea. They eat their young"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall seeing Joe Wright's 'Atonement (2007)' in the cinema, and being absolutely enraged at the character of Briony Tallis (played by Saoirse Ronan), who so selfishly and ruthlessly destroyed the lives of those close to her. I didn't think that any film could make me dislike a girl so strongly, but 'Mildred Pierce (1945)' wins the game, set, and match. This classy noir drama from director Michael Curtiz is all about biting the hand that feeds you: single mother Mildred (Joan Crawford) does her utmost to provide for daughter Veda (Ann Blyth) ? an obnoxious, loathsome, spoilt little brat ? only to be betrayed and disparaged over and over. If true love is blind, then the love for one's children is even more so. Crawford salvaged her flailing career with this excellent Oscar-winning turn, playing a strong, independent female character, but one whose daughter turns out to be her fatal weak-point (Veda is essentially the equivalent of the treacherous dame that tempts a traditional (male) noir protagonist).'Mildred Pierce' opens with a vicious murder, the victim crying the name "Mildred" with his dying breath, and subsequently flashes back to the years leading up to this moment. From here, Curtiz (working from a novel by James M. Cain) pieces together a tragic story of love, lust, jealousy, loyalty and betrayal, and Ernest Haller's magnificent use of shadowy black-and-white photography keeps the sordidness at bay. Aside from the female leads, the three male actors (Zachary Scott, Bruce Bennett, Jack Carson) each bring something different to their roles, but most impressive is Carson, playing a relentlessly cocky, and oddly likable, real-estate agent. Throughout the film, there are a few moments that don't quite sit right: the death of younger daughter Kay (Jo Ann Marlowe) seemed like an unnecessary tangent, as was Monte Beragon's improbable, offhand query of "I thought you had two daughters?" However, the occasionally misstep can't dampen one's enjoyment of a premium 1940s noir melodrama. If nothing else, 'Mildred Pierce' will put you off having children, or, at least, will have you hoping for sons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder, Materialism &amp; Maternal Instincts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Parents have a natural inclination to protect and sometimes indulge their children; however, in "Mildred Pierce" we see what happens when this tendency is taken to the extreme and predictably the results are grotesque.When Mildred (Joan Crawford) is abandoned by her unfaithful, unemployed husband Bert (Bruce Bennett), she finds employment as a waitress and also bakes pies at home to generate extra cash. She soon decides that she wants to open her own restaurant and with the help of her husband's ex-business partner Wally (Jack Carson), buys a property from Monte Beragon (Zachary Scott). Monte and Mildred become friendly and after spending some time together at his beach house, Mildred is told that her younger daughter Kay (Jo Anne Marlowe) has been taken ill. Kay dies from pneumonia and Mildred, who had always showered her older daughter Veda (Ann Blyth) with lots of affection and possessions, becomes even more committed to making sure that Veda gets everything she wants.The restaurant business is successful and soon grows into a chain. Mildred's relationship with Monte deepens but becomes strained by his regular need for her to give him money to fund his playboy lifestyle. Eventually, after becoming concerned that Monte's indolence is providing the wrong sort of example for Veda, she cools the relationship. She later reignites it however, simply as a means of providing Veda with the standard of living that she desires. Monte is wise to her motivation and consequently his acceptance of her marriage proposal comes at the cost of her relinquishing one third of the business to him. He continues to be irresponsible financially and this leads to Mildred losing her business. When Monte is subsequently murdered at the beach house, Mildred is questioned by the police and tells them all about her relationship with Monte before they finally deduce the identity of the murderer.The screen adaptation of James M Cain's novel recounts the story in flashback starting with Monte's murder. This provides an immediate and powerful impact and the pace of the events that follow keep the interest level high throughout. As well as being an engaging murder mystery, it's also a melodrama which revolves around Mildred's relationship with Veda. Mildred readily sacrifices everything for Veda, keeping up a punishing work schedule and even marrying a man she doesn't love to ensure that Veda gets all that she wants. In return, Veda is totally selfish, ungrateful and treats her mother with utter contempt. She has no respect for her mother's efforts or achievements and is actually embarrassed by the type of work which Mildred does.Joan Crawford (who won the 1946 Oscar for Best Actress for this part) convincingly displays all the strength which her character uses to emerge from adversity to become a successful businesswoman and also the vulnerability she feels because of her desperate need to please Veda and cope with her daughter's abuse and disdain. Ann Blyth is excellent as the spoiled and materialistic Veda and the remainder of the cast also provide consistently good performances. The most entertaining of these is Mildred's friend and co-worker Ida (Eve Arden), who is witty and humorous and gets to deliver some great lines such as; "Veda's convinced me that alligators have the right idea. They eat their young".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a movie where you can see Joan being one of the women she was famous for being. She plays a hard working woman who suffers through a failed marriage and is left alone to fend for her two daughters, one of whom is an ungrateful, conniving b!t@h. Sound familiar? I like this movie a lot, for everything from its campy story and drama down to the costumes and sets. A lot of people argue about whether this is true film noir; technically it's not, although the photography and sets are clearly inspired by noir. Joan won an Oscar for her performance in this movie, and she really deserved it, although Eve Arden is especially good here too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love how this movie started off showing the ending, it was very dark and a great idea by the filmmaker. When Mildred goes to the detectives office she is telling about her life through the use of flashbacks which happens a lot during this film. I love how it shows the prior events in her life that led up to the murder. When Mildred started her own restaurant, which eventually led to other ones being opened she spoiled her older daughter Veda with many things. She then became a femme fatale by luring men in to a relationship with her then using her love for him to get him to buy expensive things. I love movies that have these big twists at the end, especially when it isn't as predictable as others. Joan Crawford plays the role of Mildred exceptionally well and the film had won an Oscar for her for best actress. The dark atmosphere of the movie makes it the great film it is because the whole time you are thinking about the murder since it was the first thing that was scene in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I surprisingly really ended up enjoying this film. Originally when I saw the plot outline I didn't think it would be that good but it turned out to have a lot of good qualities. The direction, acting, plot and actually the lighting I felt were executed very well in this film. I also particularly liked the relationship between the characters, all of the issues just seemed very real. Specifically though the relationship between Mildred and her daughters. Spoiled Veda and than the sweet younger daughter who eventually passes which was very sad to me for some reason (I loved the foreshadowing of her death though I realized that throughout the film she has a cough and it gets progressively worse until she finally dies, very interesting)probably because of how rotten and spoiled Veda was. It was just crazy to me how Mildred fell for Vedas nonsense every time but I guess that's what motherly love is. I really liked also how it's a story from rags to riches in the beginning she doesn't have much and shes scrubbing floors but by the end she has people scrubbing floors and she no longer has to. The intro to the film was also great, the whole time you watch the movie you think Mildred is the murderer until you learn it was actually Veda in the end? Brilliant. The flashbacks also were a really nice touch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joan plays a married lady who does everything to make her two daughters successful--even if the oldest isn't the least bit appreciative. To make this wonderful life possible, Joan decides to work and make a successful business so she can afford to spoil her kids. The problem is that along the way she totally alienates her husband (who eventually leaves) and the youngest dies and so all of Joan's boundless energy is placed on the oldest (Veda). Then, once rich and successful, Veda behaves much like Louise Beavers' daughter did in IMITATION OF LIFE--she had no respect or appreciation of her mom's hard work.This film garnered Joan Crawford an Oscar for Best Actress and while she did do a good job in the film, I couldn't help but think that this was not a great but more of a very competent performance. The reason is that in many ways, the Warner Brothers writers made her character way too one-dimensional and hard to believe. Throughout the film, Joan is so self-sacrificing that she will do ANYTHING to Veda happy--even if it means divorcing her husband, working her fingers to the bone and seeing Veda grow up to be a selfish monster. The self-sacrifice aspect of the film was believable to a point, but when she realized what a horrible person Veda had become, again and again, Joan played a giant doormat. Even when she threw Veda out, soon she came running back to her. So on one hand we are to believe that Joan is bright, driven and successful but on the other also a total idiot! I don't think so. I really think if Joan had been a little more realistic AND Vida had not been OBVIOUSLY 100% evil, then the movie might have been better. Still, considering that the film made a ton of money, revitalized Crawford's waning career (or should that be "reVeda-lized"?) and gave her an Oscar, who am I to complain? It's still a very enjoyable and highly entertaining melodrama, though I agree with Bette Davis that this film was overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films of the 40s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is not having a good day. After an argument with her husband (chiefly about how she spoils her daughter), he leaves her for another woman. She turns to her daughter Veda for consolation, who merely whines about the state of a dress her mother has spent money on for her. Desperate to gain her daughter's affections, Mildred finds a job as a waitress, and soon after gains the qualifications to launch her own brand of catering, gaining her success and wealth, as well as the attentions of a wealthy playboy Monte Beragon. But what Mildred really wants ? the love of her daughter Veda is still not received, and despite going to extreme lengths, never receives it.In the lead role, Joan Crawford is superb. In a time when melodrama was all the fashion, she goes all out in her performance, exhibiting a wide range of emotions. But despite the over-the-topness of her style of acting, she manages to make her character believable and accessible, and the audience are able to feel her love for her daughter, if not understand it. Veda is a black-hearted brat, and Ann Blyth captures the sneaky cruelty of her with frightening accuracy. The women are joined by an array of talented male players too.There's a clever storytelling device that has been adopted for this movie, of telling the story of Mildred's life back in flashbacks. That, aided with Mildred's narration, gives the film a hard, film-noir, edge, and there is plenty of 40s style suspense presented to us by capable hands. Under the direction of movie luminary Michael Curtiz, this is further accentuated. But Mildred Pierce is in essence a melodrama (Max Steiner scoring? Hello?), and an extremely fine one too. Though the characters we meet are all quite detestable, Mildred, brought to us with perfect care by Crawford, is one that we're rooting for throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From rags to riches, individuals that didn't want to live in a poor environment have worked their hardest to find a job and succeed in life, regardless of what their job was. As long as they were making themselves and their family happy, then that's what mattered to them. Individuals don't have to be ashamed of where they came from, especially if they came from a poor decent family that worked minimum wage jobs during their entire life. It's important for family members to not become greedy people that only crave attention,money, and a sole mate for themselves and not have any respect for their elders. Individuals that become greedy, are more than likely to face severe consequences for their evil deeds.It is important for individuals to remain truthful and faithful to one another in life.Mildred Pierce shows the twists and turns of infidelity, love, hate, jealousy, and evil deeds well throughout the film. The importance of a unified and separated family in a home setting is shown well through the film's main plot. The importance of the plot is important since the viewers that have or haven't experienced this situation are able to relate their experience of attempting to live in the American Dream while avoiding drama in their everyday lives. The actor's take of their character's role in the film is authentic and realistic. The drama, suspense, the acting, and the plot twists help keep viewers interested in the film and keep them guessing at what's going to happen to the characters.The acting and the cinematography throughout this film is excellent. The lighting and focus is very sharp, well lit in contrast on the character's faces during the dramatic scenes.The cinematographer's use of close ups, long tasks on Mildred were used well to heighten up the drama and suspense of retelling the flashback at the police office. The use of montages of Mildred's various successes of her restaurant chains with the passing time of the flashback, helped speed the plot along nicely. The use of the close up and the zooming out on the circular order holder was beautiful and fantastic in its compositional framing and shooting.With its interesting suspenseful plot twists, it's family drama, and excellent acting, this movie is very enjoyable to watch!!I would recommend this movie to anybody that's interested in watching a great dramatic Film Noir film!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crawford Keeps Her Eyebrows in Check</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mildred Pierce" is a strange mix of women's picture and film noir. In typical noir fashion, the film begins with a murder and flashes back to the events that led up to it. It also has the standard issue noir look; veteran director Michael Curtiz knew his way around a movie set, and gives his film a moody, shadowy look perfectly at home among the "Maltese Falcon's" and "Double Indemnity's" of the decade. But the story is pure melodrama, full of motherly suffering and gauzy swoonings. If you crossed Douglas Sirk with Raymond Chandler, you might get something like this.Joan Crawford is wonderful in the title role, and the movie clearly exists to showcase the talents of its star. Ann Blyth is nearly demonic as Mildred's spoiled-brat daughter, Veda. And Eve Arden plays the only kind of character she was ever allowed to play, that of the acerbic, wise-cracking best friend. The men in the film are nearly an afterthought, interesting seeing as this movie came out during WWII. This is yet another of those films from the same time period that offered a hypothetical warning about what would happen to the homefront if women carried on in the roles traditionally reserved for men. Mildred enters the world of business but gets slapped down the moment she becomes successful. Feminist film theorists love this movie; in fact, I saw it in a feminist film class.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is directed by Michael Curtiz and adapted from the James M. Cain novel by Ranald MacDougall, William Faulkner and Catherine Turney. It stars Joan Crawford, Ann Blyth, Jack Carson, Zachary Scott, Bruce Bennett and Eve Arden. Music is by Max Steiner and the cinematographer is Ernest Haller. It was nominated for 6 Academy Awards and won just the one for Crawford in the Best Actress category.Plot finds Crawford as Mildred Pierce, a devoted Mother of two girls who struggles to not only make her marriage work, but to also keep her eldest daughter, Veda (Blyth), in the luxurious life she demands. Murder, treachery and heartache is about to dog the Pierce family?.Mildred Pierce is of course the film that is often remembered for being the film that saved Joan Crawford's career. After being dumped by MGM, and tagged with being box office poison, Crawford, it seemed, was destined to be the latest visitor to the acting scrap heap. But Jerry Wald over at Warner Brothers had other ideas. The part of Mildred had been offered to some of the big hitting ladies on the Warner studio lot, Stanwyck, Davies and Sheridan are just three of the names known to have shied away from the role. The feeling was that playing a woman with a mid-teen daughter was a no go for the age proud ladies. But Crawford, just entering her forties, took the role on, and in spite of initial protestations from director Curtiz, gave a terrific performance that landed her the coveted golden statuette and prolonged her film career for another 25 years.Blending the psychological aspects of the woman's picture with the physical edges of film noir, Mildred Pierce is something of a unique picture. Very popular on release (it was a box office smash), it was thought that Cain's source novel wouldn't transfer well to the screen. Credit then to the writers for managing to create such an intriguing and watchable piece. True, they have had to tone down aspects from the book, and even added incidents and changed characters, but the essence is right and the timing couldn't have been more perfect for such a story. As film noir was becoming a telling genre in film making, Mildred Pierce also coincided with the later stages of WWII; A time when the role of the Woman, either in the service or at home, was under scrutiny. One of the great things about the film, and the performance of Crawford, is that it cobbles together many character strands of the 40s woman: in life and in film noir. She's a Suzy homemaker type, asked to be mother and wife, yet driven to be a business woman because she feels she's lacking in the necessary in the family home. Where the film gets its noir flecks from is that Mildred may also be a murderer, a femme fatale, a woman whose every decision spells trouble. It's as if the makers (not just here but many others at the time) are saying that a woman's place is in the home, doing homely family stuff. Intriguing for sure, not necessarily in good taste, but an added spice into the melodramatic cooking pot that already contains greed and obsession.Told with a flashback structure, the film is smoothly directed by the versatile Curtiz. But both he and Crawford are aided considerably across the board, not least by a truly great "Bitch" performance from Blyth. Veda is at one detestable, spoilt and mean, the daughter from hell, a status-seeking brat whose love comes at enormous cost to those who dare to get close to her. Blyth revels in it and her play off with Crawford is one of the film's major strengths. The support cast of Scott, Carson, Arden and Bennett are excellent value, while Steiner's music is unobtrusive and able to shift freely with the narrative twists. Finally it's left to Hallers photography to capture the feel and mood of the unfolding story. Shifting from sunny suburbia one moment to shadowy expressionistic bleakness the next, the photographer of such notable film's like Gone With the Wind and Rebel Without a Cause, is integral to the moody excellence of Mildred Pierce.A murder mystery flanked by asides of class distinction, bad parenting, dubious sexual leanings and pure greed. Yep, Mildred Pierce is no ordinary movie: And hooray for that. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film noir classic and possibly Joan Crawford's best role. She deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar (her only one). She plays Mildred Pierce, a woman whose cheating husband leaves her with their two daughters. The oldest, Veda (Ann Blyth), is a spoiled brat who wants the finer things in life and doesn't care how much her mother has to work or sacrifice to get them for her. Still, Mildred does everything she can to provide for her kids, going from struggling waitress to restaurant owner. The younger daughter dies, which leaves Mildred twice as determined to keep Veda happy. But unfortunately for her Veda is a total monster! This is widely considered Joan's best starring role. I can think of a couple of movies I maybe enjoyed more for entertainment purposes but I wouldn't argue with any claims that this is her best. It's just that good. Jack Carson, better known for his comedic roles, is good here in a more dramatic one. The always perfect Eve Arden offers wonderful support as Joan's wise-cracking friend. Veda was the best role of Ann Blyth's career for sure. She's so evil she belongs in a horror movie. Zachary Scott, an actor I've never been enamored with, gives a memorably sleazy turn as Beragon. This is one of the jewels in legendary director Michael Curtiz's crown. The story was adapted from the James M. Cain novel and this is definitely one case where the movie is superior to the book in every way.</fullReview>

She hopes for the best in people to come forward, as it does in her own character, but alas! it never does in others!Jack Carson as Wally Fay is the one thread of faithful friendship she has, and she never really appreciates it. She can't see past his gruff, opportunistic exterior.Great performances all around. But there are glaring problems for the audience. Zack Scott as Monty Baragon is such a slime ball that it's hard for us to understand why Mildred can't see through him. Veda is a spoiled bitch, pure and simple, and it's obvious that she'll come to no good, or else make everyone around her miserable if she does succeed. Once again, Mildred seems blind to this throughout the film, a mother's love notwithstanding.Wally is a prince, if a realistic one, and we wonder when Mildred might wake up and see him for who he is. When a guy is always there for you, through thick and thin, bad and good, and always has your best interest at heart, even when it's tough on you, you need to see that! But she keeps pining away for the nogoodnicks like Monty, and to a lesser degree, Bert Pierce (who, while noble, is not above betrayal and destructive selfishness at times).Ann Blythe is the real revelation here, although thoroughly unlikable, unlovable, and downright nasty! A meaty role for such a young actress, but handled convincingly.I know nothing of the Crain book, but plan to investigate it soon.What else can you say about a classic?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Romantic Film-Noir Tragedy about the American Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce, directed by Michael Curtiz who also made Casablanca, is also based on a crime novel by James M. Cain. From his books several classics have been born such as Double Indemnity by Billy Wilder and Luchino Visconti's debut feature Ossessione. Mildred Pierce reached the same "poetry of summer nights" that Double Indemnity did: the Californian landscape, strolling roads, the sea and hills. But, on the other hand, it represents the complete different kind of film-noir: the romantic one which The Big Sleep, for instance, does too. In Double Indemnity the dark variant of the genre found its true form: people were dissatisfied and unheroic but even if Mildred Pierce doesn't include as brutal characters, it does show a loveless world characterized by death.Film-noir found its dynamic form in the years of WWII but it went through its finest blossoms during the late 1940's -- and to this group Mildred Pierce fits in: to the division of postwar film-noir, all of which were strongly characterized by postwar disillusions; how the actual war was over but it was still going on in our minds -- on social level. The genre was going straight ahead on full speed and therefore Mildred Pierce was just as clever and insightful as the director's 'magnum opus': Casablanca. It was a pure genre-film in which the basic realizations and bases of film-noir were internalized perfectly.In the title role stars Joan Crawford, who won herself an Oscar for this performance, as Mildred Pierce: a strong independent woman who, after her husband leaves her, tries to attain an affluent lifestyle on her own. However, her own daughter openly despises her; no matter how hard Mildred tries to win her approval. The true nature of this tragedy starts to reveal itself when Mildred's daughter begins to show interest for Mildred's new husband.When writing about Mildred Pierce, we could easily start analyzing and interpreting the entire genre of film-noir -- as it is one of its finest blossoms. But what is more interesting is to drill down to the film's essential being and contents. First of all, the characterization is superb because its personal gallery is quite unconventional: there is no typical desperate male protagonist who would be fooled by a dangerous woman. In this case, the femme fatale is a desperate mother who doesn't try to manipulate a silly man but another woman -- her own daughter. Just like Billy Wilder and Douglas Sirk so was Michael Curtiz, as a born European, able to approach the American milieu and its people honestly, without any formal idealism or cloaked sarcasm. The characters of Mildred Pierce aren't necessarily unheroic but they are strangers to each other: the mother doesn't really know her children, let alone her husband, the people don't know the people they marry and don't really hate the people from whom they divorce. All the people are double-crossing each other and try to fix their desolate situations by money and success but only to find themselves from worse tragedies.At its heart, Mildred Pierce is a mother-daughter drama and all the film noir-like crimes are actually done on personal level: in the relationships which are filled with greed, betrayal and passion. The world of Mildred Pierce is characterized by death -- as the entire genre is -- but it also achieves to give slight doses of optimism every once in a while. In the end, it is an exquisite film-noir but also an insightful interpretation of the American dream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The characterization of film noire is applied to certain films that touch on the grittier, more cynical aspects of life. This genre is typified as having lead roles played by strong, solemn male characters, in this respect, Mildred Pierce is an exception. In all other ways Mildred Pierce follows the model for a great film noire. The main character encounters both success and crushing emotional hardships, which the viewer gets to see the effects of. The supporting characters do a wonderful job depicting deceit in action, and each individual character contributes moving specific parts of the film along. The film ends with somewhat of an untied knot, and the viewer could certainly learn to love Mildred as the epitome of a "tragic hero". The film starts with a mystery and works it's way backwards, and as you can assume the viewer imagines he/she knows what is going on, when clearly the writer has us at his whims. Great acting. Great tragedy. Great film noire.</fullReview>

Quite possibly on one of my many "top 10" lists from here on out. Admittedly, I ended up being a geek about the cinematography, because it was absolutely fantastic. This is lovely film noir, and I'm really glad it was filmed in this style-- it suited the script and subject matter so perfectly. One shot in particular is sticking with me: when Veda shoots Monty. The shiny fabric of her dress, the gunfire, her shadow against the wall, and the low-key lighting, made for a gorgeous shot. I also liked how the feel changes during the "happier" parts of the flashbacks. The Mise-en-sc?ne in general was just really great. Being film noir this movie obviously had a lot of darkness, but not in a Gothic or horror way, which was interesting. Overall I'd say this film comes across as tense.

		<shortDescription>Crawford's zenith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A top flight look at the dark underbelly of the American Dream told through the travails of one woman's rise to the top and the problems she encounters on the way and when she arrives there. Joan all but a has been prior to this waited out her Warners contract for two years until this role came along. It was worth the wait since this turned out to be her signature role and she molded her screen persona to it from then on. Everyone is excellent, Eve Arden, one of the best friends a lead actor or actress ever had, has great lines and delivers them with aplomb. Jack Carson adds just the right amount of slime to his usual slickster role to make Wally Fay likable but rather contemptible at the same time. The real standout however is Ann Blyth, never better, as the odious soulless black spider Veda. Somehow after this stellar showing the studios never again cast her as a villainess but as sweet young things and she was just not as effective, a shame and a waste of her natural gift. Directed in full noir mode by the talented Curtiz who was tough on Crawford but she always admitted that it was worth it especially since it brought her an Oscar and revitalized her career. At times referred to as a women's picture it is so much more than that and I have never met anyone who has seen it all the way through who has not admired it. The remake while closer to the book and longer is a mere shadow of this masterwork.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joan Crawford Gets Her Man of Gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently a murder suspect, broad-shouldered glamor queen Joan Crawford (as Mildred Pierce) reflects upon her life of suffrage? In flashback? Glamorously strung in an apron, Ms. Crawford begins a business empire by selling cakes and pies to her neighbors. She walks her legs off, sheds unworthy men, and meets wisecracking waitress Eve Arden (as Ida Corwin). Eventually, Crawford becomes a restaurant tycoon. Alas, it's all for naughty Ann Blyth (as Veda), the mother of all selfish and ungrateful daughters."Mildred Pierce" is one of the model woman's movies of the 1940s. It won the important "Best Actress" Oscar for Crawford; and, sustained her career as a consistently performing leading woman into her fifties, which was uncharted territory for the time. Moreover, it's impeccably photographed by Ernest Haller, expertly directed by Michael Curtiz, and marvelously performed - especially by Crawford, who not only performed the role with palatable determination, but often hid herself behind its façade.********** Mildred Pierce (9/24/45) Michael Curtiz ~ Joan Crawford, Ann Blyth, Zachary Scott, Jack Carson</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Curtiz directs this great drama about a woman Mildred Pierce(Joan Crawford)and her struggles to become a success in the business world. Along the way she loses control of her "me-me-me" daughter(Ann Blyth)that resents her doting mother. This prime Film-Noir heats up when Mildred realizes that she is competing with her daughter for the love of the same man. Emotions run high leading to a twisting terse finale. Crawford wins her first and only Oscar for this performance. Blyth leaves her usual sweet and innocent persona behind to play Veda the ungrateful spoiled daughter. A top notch supporting cast helps make this movie a solid classic. Cast members of note are: Zachary Scott, Jack Carson, Eve Arden and Bruce Bennett. A mother's love is sometimes blind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprising to see such an epic come from a censored time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce was the Pulp Fiction of its day, jumbling narrative to create a sense of confusion and a puzzle-like story to be put together by the human mind. Unlike Pulp Fiction with no narrator to tell the story, however, Mildred Pierce is told by the narrator in a police station, Mildred Pierce. By the beginning of the film, it is unclear who committed what crime, and by the end it is so utterly surprising to see who actually did the dirty deed that makes it a great sleuth movie (the audience being the sleuths, of course.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ok, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening of Mildred Pierce goes down in my memory asamong the best openings I've ever seen. It begins with anintroductory sequence that shows a man being shot, a woman(Mildred Pierce herself, as played by Crawford) walking across abridge in tears, making almost as if to jump off before beingstopped by a police officer, and then finding an acquaintance(Wally Fay, played by Carson) at a restaurant and taking him to anelaborate beach house-the one where the man was shot, wherehis body still is. Mildred's response to Wally's suggestivequestion about whether her husband is broadening his horizons(a very cold "He's not home") tells us both who the body is and thatshe at least knows that it's there. She surreptitiously locks all theexits and sneaks out of the house (presumably on her way to callthe police), leaving him to discover the body alone. When he does,the beauty begins. He runs around the house in a panic, trying allthe doors, running up and down a dramatically art-deco andexpressionist spiraling staircase. As he becomes more and morepanicked, the house seems to rise up around him, more andmore intimidating with every second, and the shadows becomemore and more exaggerated, to the point where his own shadowlooms horrifically over him. The shadows cast by the railings ofthe spiral staircase are beautifully nightmarish.After this incredible scene, though, the movie kind of goes downhillfor me. Maybe it's just my preference for noir over melodrama, ormaybe large swathes of the movie are boring in both action andappearance. I just couldn't work up any interest for Mildred thebored housewife (which is odd, because bored 40s and 50shousewives fascinate me), or Mildred the restauranteur, or Mildredthe sad mother with one dead child and one disgustingly awfulone. I couldn't. And movies don't bore me. One of my favoritemovies is Tarkovsky's Solaris, the slowest movie ever made. Even bad, predictable movies don't bore me. This one did. I don'tknow why. It's not a bad movie, as far as I can tell. It just boredme.The performances are all superb, especially (of course)Crawford's. Arden's work as a friend/coworker of Mildred's is alsoexcellent, though it's a relatively minor role. And the twist ending,while it's probably pretty predictable, took me by surprise. It wasgreat, and it actually made my memories of the rest of the movie alittle better. However, a surprise ending, even a rare good one,doesn't change the fact that the actual experience of watching themovie is boredom itself.Recommended, with reservations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, film noir...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In response to the criticism about Mildred Pierce's film noir classification, the characters in a film have little to do with establishing a film as "film noir." Mildred Pierce is by all means film noir. The majority of the movie takes place in flashback form, it centers around a crime, and the chiarascuro (dramatic use of black and white) is just very prevalent. Other film noirs were not comprised completely of characters who were "up to no good." In Chinatown, Jack Gittes (Jack Nicholson) was a morally upright character, and in L.A. Confidential, arguably the last great piece of film noir, Ed (Guy Pearce) and Bud (Russell Crowe) are both good people. That said, Mildred Pierce is a film noir character because she has secrets from the past that implicate people she loves in murder. While the film does have a soap opera feel to it, so does every other film from the 1940s. Mildred Pierce neatly fits the mold of "film noir," and anyone who would argue otherwise obviously does not know the meaning of the term.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoying film about indulgent mom of spoiled brat daughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why people keep referring to this as film noir. To me, it totally plays like a bad soap opera. Almost all the characters are extremely unlikable and annoying.Mildred is the overly indulgent mom to her daughters, especially Veda, played by Ann Blythe. Veda has to be the most narcissistic character ever in film. Her manipulations rise to the level of art form. There is another young daughter named Kay. I think the most ridiculous part of the whole movie is when she dies, Mildred says something lame like "I'll never forget her." And then she narrates the next scene - "So I worked harder than ever." Just like that - her daughter dies - and its back to work. You've got to be kidding.I will give kudos to great black and white cinematography and gorgeous sets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A supreme melodrama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie in my film noir class, and I was extremely thankful for having seen it. One, because it's a terrific film. And two, because the movie we watched before that was "The Maltese Falcon." Don't get me wrong, I liked "The Maltese Falcon," but after watching a complicated mystery, I was in the mood to watch something shallow and superficial. And no, that's not an insult to "Mildred Pierce." It's not anything deep, but it's not meant to be. It's meant to be an intriguing melodrama full of thrilling subplots relating to greed, sex, murder, two-timing, double-crossing and all that good stuff. The pacing of the film is excellent, getting a firm grip on its audience and never letting go. I can't recall one scene that dragged. The extraordinary performances make the experience all the more delightful. Joan Crawford is astonishingly great in the title role, and so is Jack Carson as the smiley-faced Wally and Ann Blyth as the sadistic Veda. Though the film piles one intriguing sequence after another, the story never feels contrived. It's totally unpredictable, especially at the end. I never expected that final twist. I assumed that it was already given away in the opening shots. I recommend "Mildred Pierce" to anyone who's a film buff like me. As I said, it's an excellent melodrama jam-packed with intrigue. But remember, it's a melodrama. If you're looking for heavy, realistic drama, you might prefer something deeper. The only element of the film that irked me was the portrayal of the African-American housemaid. I know back then it was normal for black people to play lamebrain characters--audiences were desensitized to it--but now it looks offensive and degrading. My score: 9 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly Crawford's best film performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A unique story interestingly told and a classic that everyone should see at least once. I think it's intriguing that Butterfly McQueen, who played that famous role in Gone With the Wind ("I don't know nothing' about birthin' babies) has a major role in this movie--she's in it from beginning to end as Mildred's maid Lottie--but she has no billing at all. But Veda Ann Borg, a minor actress who played mostly in action serials like The Shadow, gets a billing despite her very minor part as a singer in the nightclub where Mildred's daughter works. In fact her role is negligible and takes place in the club dressing room, but she gets a billing while Butterfly McQueen does not. If that isn't racism I don't know what is.To me that's the only defect in this super dramatic and beautifully acted and directed film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting film-noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is a film-noir classic. It was fast paced and full of drama, there wasn't a single scene where I became uninterested in the film. I love how Joan Crawford's character was such an eccentric, strong and bold woman who could get through any obstacle that she was faced with. The beginning of the movie is very interesting because it begins with the murdering scene and the audience does not know exactly who the murderer is. In another way, we can say this movie begins with the conclusion and goes back to the exposition of the movie by telling the story of Mildred Pierce (first-person narration). I think the arrangement of this order is really creative because it creates curiosity and grabs your attention. During the whole film you think Mildred is the one who killed her husband in the first scene, but at the end when the truth behind that scene is revealed you almost can't believe you didn't see it coming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Mildred Pierce. I really appreciated how strong the roles of female characters were in the movie, and even today you don't get many movies with a large female cast. The movie did a great job of portraying the grief and hard work that the protagonist went through throughout her life, and she is one of the most rounded characters I've seen in a while. However, the movie drags on for far too long. Many scenes could have been whittled down or cut without impairing the message of the film or the impact of each individual take. Mildred Pierce is undeniably well made, but I somehow found myself waiting for it to end halfway through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is a classic film noir starring Joan Crawford as the film's namesake, Mildred Pierce. The film begins with Mildred taken in for questioning after her husband is murdered in their beachfront home. The events of the film play out as a long sequence of flashbacks that Mildred tells in her version of what happened to police.Mildred Pierce is a fine film. If I could describe it with one word, I think the best I could come up with would be "sturdy." It's well acted, with Joan Crawford giving an excellent performance as a leading lady in a genre filled mainly with leading men, and the technical aspects of the film are good (although certainly not striking or memorable at any point) but none of this can really make up for the film's overall inability to be thrilling, or even compelling for that matter.After seeing Mildred Pierce for the first time I don't think it even affected me enough for me to feel the need to form an opinion on it. I had seen it, and it was a movie, and if I didn't need to I think that would have been the last I ever thought of the film. I asked my friend Claire what she thought of it and her response was as fitting as one I could ever imagine; It 'meandered'- and that is exactly what it did. This was a film about a murder, and the main conflict in the film was the murder, so why did it need to put so much effort and detail into so much of Mildred's life that really had no impact or weight on this conflict? It worked to build Mildred into a very three dimensional, developed character, but it just went overboard. About halfway into the film they had done so much of this it was already experiencing a lot of diminishing returns, and viewing it turned into a chore.All of this may seem very critical, and I may not have enjoyed the film, but I do stand by my earlier description- It was sturdy. The film functioned well enough for me to acknowledge that it was a well-made film with merits to admire. It may not have been the most exciting film, or exciting at all, but it was a film that focused primarily on one character, and that character was done very well. For that, Mildred Pierce is a solid film, and it makes sense that this would be the area where the film excelled, I mean the film is named for her after all. If only it had put a bit more effort into being enjoyable rather than just Mildred Pierce.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not had very much exposure to film-noir before, but in general, especially since I have never been big on black-and-white film itself, it is not my favorite genre. I don't mind it, though. I understand and can definitely appreciate its strong points. I honestly think that I just do not find mystery movies as enthralling as a drama or a comedy. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying this is a bad movie. I did enjoy the parts with Mildred's diner, and I thought that the acting was very well done, also. The lighting and some of the camera angles were very artistic, and it was easy to see how it fit into the film-noir genre. I think that my least favorite thing about the movie is just the fact that it takes place in flashbacks for the majority of the movie, and it almost makes it seem as if it is not a flashback at all. I have no qualms about them, but it is a bit easy to forget that you're watching a flashback during an interrogation. Overall, it wasn't my favorite, mainly for the story and the layout, but it was not a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched this movie it infuriated me so much! Down to the last second. If I even tried half of the things that that snotty brat did, my mother would have had my head on a plate At first I did not want to even finish this movie, but as I watched more and more I just wanted to see Veda get her just desserts. Even as she was being taken away she wore an awful condescending look that made me furious. At first I was not sure how I felt about watching this movie, but as the time passed, I got to thinking that anything that can engross me for that period of time, without making me bored, is definitely a good movie. Even if my main reason for watching was to watch Veda get hers, it was still a good movie, that in the end can even show you the faults of loving too much and too hard. Mildred has good intentions especially after having lost one daughter much too soon, but Veda is an awful, rotten person, even form the beginning. I did like how the story was written, from the ends of the incident to the police station and then all the way through, making the audience believe that it was Mildred who was the villain. Apparently this is was based on a book from what I gather, but I do not know for sure, and whether or not it is a successful adaptation. Even thought the story was completely antagonizing, it was a well made film, that in the did turn out to be interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce was an interesting film to watch. The actual dimensions of the film were extraordinary; the third-person narration throughout a re-telling of the main character's past. The story of Mildred's rise in life was just as compelling as the mystery of the murder of her second husband that lingers at the back of your mind throughout the entire film. Mildred was a wonderful protagonist and you find yourself rooting for her wholeheartedly during the entire film. Even when the movie leads you to believe she murdered her husband, my opinion of her did not falter. I found myself hating Veda an excessive amount, which implies that I was completely immersed in the story. Therefore, I would have to conclusively say that this was a fantastic film. My only issue with Mildred Pierce was the not-so happy ending. The movie's bottom line seemed to be that women are to remain in the house doing their "womanly duties" as they were. Mildred became wildly successful and you admired her for it, but everything that mattered to her outside of her career fell apart because of it.</fullReview>

It tells an inspirational yet tragic tale of an empowered woman who crafts her own future from the bottom rung of the ladder of society all for the sake of her spoiled daughter, whom she ends up losing in the end because of all the efforts to make her life better. I found it very tragic that from the very beginning Mildreds efforts were all done to try and make her daughter happy and she ended up betraying her and spiting everything shes done for her. A very strong, cohesive, emotional plot that will have you entwined in the story from beginning to end. I found the acting in this film to be very interesting and well done. Every character fulfills their role perfectly and are all very believable and emotional in their presentation. The daughters role as the spoiled, rotten child is acted out so well that at times you'll wish you could reach through the screen and give her a firm smack. In terms of camera-work, I found it to be very satisfactory. It wasn't the most amazing cinematography I've ever seen but I found it to be very good for what it was. Overall, a great movie.

Her independence and will to succeed was overpowering and uplifting. Her sense of self and pride was well portrayed of her character as she remained calm and had a very demanding, yet smooth way of overcoming issues that came her way. The "girl-power" she had was very encouraging and really helped the film become a big hit. This is one of the more interesting and good films I have seen for this time period.

		<shortDescription>Mother's unconditional love can't save bad seed offspring!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who believe that films must remain 'faithful' to their source material should take a look at the original 1945 film version of 'Mildred Pierce'; it's an example of the 'right' way to adapt a novel into a screenplay. Contrast it with the turgid, long-winded 2011 HBO version of 'Pierce'. There's actually no comparison: the 1945 version is wholly entertaining while the recent adaptation will bore you to tears.Mildred Pierce was the perfect vehicle for Joan Crawford. Ironically here she plays a mother whose love is pretty much unconditional toward her bad seed daughter Veda (in real life, however, Crawford used 'tough love' on her own children with disastrous results). Unlike the novel (and the recent HBO Version), the noirish murder scene constitutes the inciting incident and linchpin of the entire plot.The break into the Second Act begins during the police interrogation as Mildred recounts her break up with husband Bert and quest for financial independence. When a waitress is fired during an argument with another waitress over tips, Mildred just happens to be in the right place at the right time and is hired on the spot. It's these neat little scenes that add to the overall verisimilitude of the plot.Act two introduces us to Mildred's conflict with Wally, Bert's former real estate partner and daughter Veda. As for Wally--he's distinctively played by Jack Carson as the seedy salesman who can't resist trying to putting his paws all over Mildred (he's a serial groper!). Ann Blyth is brilliant, making the most of the chief supporting players' part, as the evil Veda. The character is so over the top that one can scarcely believe there are people like this in real life. Veda can't control her contempt for her mother and yes teenagers often do rebel against parental authority; but the disdain is usually a lot more subtle than what we see here. Still, Veda's exaggerated (and escalating) misbehavior is what makes the film so enjoyable (there is a catharsis of sorts as the audience gets to 'hiss the villain').If there is one sentimental sequence 'Mildred Pierce', it's when younger daughter Ray contracts pneumonia and dies. The scene is a bit drawn out but provides an explanation for Mildred's continuing attachment to Veda?the loss of Ray causes Mildred to try and protect the only child she has left! The stakes get higher in Act 2. Monte is temporarily thrown 'under the bus' when he refuses Mildred's request not to indulge Veda and stay away from her. Then Veda goes ahead and cons her new husband and his mother out of $10,000 by pretending that she's pregnant. There's that great iconic scene where Veda ends up slapping Mildred and she throws her out of the house. Meanwhile, Mildred finds success in the restaurant business by opening up a chain of restaurants. Should I mention that Mildred's former supervisor Ida (deliciously played by Eve Arden) is the comic relief with her sassy comments about men. Leave it to kind-hearted Bert (who finally has gotten his act together), to bring Veda and Mildred back together. This happens when he brings Mildred to a seedy nightclub where Veda now works as a low rent singer.The dark moment of Act 2 occurs after Mildred agrees to marry Monte and give him one third of the business (she does this to perhaps improve her social standing in Veda's eyes). Monte betrays Mildred by selling his share of the business along with Wally, which bankrupts her. The ultimate indignity of course is that Monte begins an affair with Veda.What makes Mildred Pierce so engaging is that not only is Veda damaged goods but so is Mildred. She's willing to send an innocent man to jail to save her daughter when she tries to set up Wally as the killer.Note that the story is not without a few false notes. How can the police arrest Bert at the beginning of the film? Yes, they have his gun and no denial that he was responsible; but they don't actually have a confession, so the evidence seems rather flimsy. Then there's the ending itself?the murder feels a bit tacked on as if the screenwriter couldn't come up with something more creative and needed to rush things to an almost immediate conclusion. It's really not much of a twist as Monte's murder seems rather predictable.Despite the minor pitfalls, 'Mildred Pierce' remains a highly entertaining part noir, part soap opera, that manages to thrill audiences even to this day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred Pierce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is a film that struck me very interesting and a little on the bizarre side. The mother Mildred has the overwhelming need to impress her daughter who is a snob. Her daughter is not satisfied with her mother's social standing, and her career. In order for the daughter Veda to continue with her lavish lifestyle Mildred gets a job as a waitress and Veda is furious. Still not satisfied Mildred finds herself caught up in a loveless marriage and owning a chain of restaurants in South Carolina. This film incorporates murder, lies, and social acceptance. These are all areas in which many people today can relate. I can describe this film as an older soap opera, a lot of drama and twists in the plots that many don't see coming. I really liked the sets in the film; although I did read the book and the restaurants in the novel were not described as elegant as the film had portrayed them. In the film Mildred owns a chain of restaurants and in the novel she owns about three. The film portrayed the novel well, most of the details were described well from the novel to the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"SPOILED BRAT TAKES RAP! Meanwhile, across the seas Churchill's Iron Curtain speech is seeing ramifications in Europe while MacArthur continues to encourage the new Japanese democracy to embrace baseball... in other news, Stalin today..."Wow. Suddenly I don't feel so bad about myself after seeing this film. I thought I had a hunch of where it was going about half way through (perhaps a bit earlier), but dismissed the notion as that of my parents' worry genes kicking in. But, lo and behold, it turned out to be true.What did? Well, to learn that, you have to buy yourself a ticket to the Stanford Theatre or rent a copy from Netflix or Blockbuster.My god, they don't make 'em like they used to. Today's films are so micro-marketed that you simply can't see what you really want to see, and this film dishes out social messages left and right.Shot in black and white this film bounces a bit from classic noire to a more normal and upbeat style, but the message of the film does not suffer for it.I've often wondered why anyone would want to throw money at their kids. Just why? It never solves anything. And only makes things worse. This is a message that has been hammered home again and again in theatre and literature of all sorts. Yet the parable seems to be lost on so many as we hear of offspring of the rich gone horribly awry with the law.But even then, the parents try to protect them. It almost reminds me of the classic Star Trek episode "The Devil in the Dark", only the mother Horta had a true reason for her call to arms. In "Mildred Pierce" we see the motherly instinct gone horribly wrong. AND, she was warned about it.I'm going to go out on a limb here, but one wonders about the skyrocketing divorce rate, and the sense of entitlement among male and female sexes of the species. One wonders if their parents didn't have an element (free radical, if you will) of Mildred Pierce running through their genetic makeup. And thus infused in their children a sense of "mine" and self centered thinking.I remember a friend of mine and his sister got two brand new corvettes as either graduation presents or Christmas gifts. I can't remember which. And I remember the father of another friend saying he wouldn't do that in a million years. Amen to that. But Mildred Pierce puts her motherly instinct above all else. To her "the children" come first. One almost hears shades of classic 1990's Hillary Clinton come to the forefront. And in this film we see all too clearly that treasuring that which only knows treasure is no treasure at all.In this vein it's also a warning to the most ardent feminist and consumer driven female. If you're married, then consider how happy you are and why that is. If you're divorced, then too consider this, and contemplate how you got there. If the matter involved money and children, then this film is for you.Enough said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred Pierce is not the victim, she is the culprit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film expecting to see a good noir. However it was not a film noir, it was not a melodrama (as many reviewers have classified it here). It was a tragedy. And what tragedy it was! - prompting me to write my first review on the site.From my point of view Mildred Pierce tells the story of a woman too strong and stubborn, unable to yield to the discernment of her husband. In a sense the movie is a story about women's liberation: Mildred breaks many taboos of the 40ies driving her husband out, yielding to sex with another man while still married, being the active party to pursue a divorce, becoming a successful businesswoman and remarrying. But to what end? To protect her selfish and spoiled daughter Veda, who grows ever more despising of her mother the more Mildred tries to provide for her.Aside from the frame report involving murder the story begins to fold from Mildred and her freshly unemployed husband Bert getting into a quarrel over household money, which Mildred has earned herself by selling pies for neighbours. Instead of using the money to pay for bills as Bert would have it, Mildred has bought Veda a dress (which Veda soon despises because it is too cheap.) In the ensuing conflict with Bert Mildred holds her own head. This results in the unemployed Bert moving away from the family home - which Mildred unemotionally accedes to. I see this as the stroll of the strong woman over a man whose self-esteem has been weakened by the circumstances, reflecting the changing role of the sexes in the society in general, when the man whose role has traditionally been to bring bread to the table while being the man in the house is driven to concede his position as the supporting force of both the household and general society. But does this change bring happiness? The answer of director Michael Curtiz is in my opinion a resounding NO. While Mildred is able to grow from an unskilled housewife into a successful businesswoman with a restaurant chain of her own, she is unable to exercise the needed authority at her own home. Mildred's 'motherly love' to her daughter Veda that pushed her into conflicting and driving away her husband consists of trying to serve Veda's every spoiled demand. But without boundary setting fatherly love Veda only grows to hate and despise her mother more and more, finally wishing to escape from the all-encompassing and all-forgiving tyranny of Mildred's motherly embrace.In my opinion the message of the movie is to demonstrate what happens in the family and society in general when the ordinary working family man is pushed out and is not present to suppress the whimsy behaviour of girls growing into young women. This is aptly demonstrated by the upper class playboy Monty Beragon who enters the life of the family becoming for a time Mildred's lover while actually trying to get into Veda's pants and milking every available penny (and finally her successful restaurant chain) out of Mildred's hands. This morally depraved character who capitalizes on the sexual freedom of the liberated woman with his inherited status and swinging lifestyle with which the ordinary man stripped of his role as the head of family cannot compete, replaces the father Bert as the role model whom Veda looks up to and aspires to imitate for her peril.Most of the reviewers at this site have for some incomprehensible reason seen Mildred either as the victim or a non-responsible object of melodramatic turns and twists. However in my opinion it is clear that Mildred is the actual culprit in the movie: Veda growing up the way she does is the result of Mildred's actions. Note, that Bert's supposed cheating with Ms. Binderhof is never shown. It is Mildred who brings up the accusation, while it may be, that Bert is at that point only looking for a listening ear which Mildred does not provide, not necessary anything more. In the final parts of the movie Binderhof marries, but not Bert. When Mildred asks for divorce, Bert refuses, and agrees only after having witnessed Mildred's relationship with Beragon. Even after Mildred has remarried and supposedly murdered her second husband Bert is chivalrously willing to take the blame for the murder. Mildred's affair with Beragon on the other hand, while being separated but still married with Bert who refuses to divorce, is shown in detail. The negative morality of the deed is illustrated by the death of daughter Kay immediately after.I found the movie a most interesting commentary on the demise of traditional values and the mayhem that follows. It may be that those who see Mildred as a victim of an unsatisfactory husband or melodramatic circumstances have grown so far from traditional concepts such as lifelong marriage that they are no longer able to comprehend the underlying ethical framework. From my opinion the movie is an insightful early commentary on the changes the woman's liberation was causing in the society. One of the few movies to receive 10 / 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce was a Film Noir about a Femme Fatale. This movie is a film noir because most of it is shot in the dark and the mood feels dark as well. The power of a mothers love can sometimes turn out in unexpected ways. This movie is about a strong woman who came from nothing and made a name for herself. The only person who holds her past against her is her spoiled daughter. The movie takes a twist Mildred's second husband is found dead. Mildred tries to cover it up so you think it's her for the longest time. And then SURPRISE!!! It had a good twist at the end that was unexpected. I didn't see it coming and I'm usually good at detecting twists. If you like suspense and some what of a thriller this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was an okay movie. This movie was filmed in 1945. There is a flashback in this movie by showing the audience that someone was killed but don't know by who until the end of the movie. I do like how this movie shows that money doesn't bring happiness. The audience sees this women struggle with living on her own with her children and still trying to pay the bills as well as giving her daughters everything they want. Mildred eventually makes it big by having her own business. Even though Mildred tries to give her girls everything they want the oldest is a brat. She doesn't appreciate anything. I really couldn't stand how this girl treated her mother when her mother tried her hardest and gave her everything she wanted. Even after her daughter treated her badly she still tried to protect her in the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murdering Scene In The Beginning Wow.. !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning of the movie is very interesting because it begins with the murdering scene and the audience does not know exactly who the murder is. In another way, we can say this movie begins with the conclusion of the movie and go back to the exposition of the movie by telling the story of the main actress (first-person narration). I think the idea for arrangement this order is really creative because it creates the curiosity of the audience and grab the attention. The audience knows the conclusion, but how does the movie continue to that point? Moreover, the life of the main actress varies between the good situation and the bad situation. There are many things go into her life. However, she still keeps her goodness and to be really good mother in the concept of flat character that opposites with her daughter (round character). Furthermore, another interesting point is that who the murder is. This helps hold the attention of the audiences for finding the answer. Finally, this movie is a good example to distinguish between story and plot because we can listen many tellings from the police that they have not shown in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred Pierce Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is a film noir that was produced in 1945 by Michael Curtiz (also directed Casablanca!) Due to the style of film noir this film had a sort of gloomy, hopeless feeling to it. The introduction to this movie is a ocean shot, rolling waves continuously turn over the opening credits. To me these waves are symbolism for the unsteady tide that is a metaphor for Mildred's life. In the first scene of the film, Mildred is followed by the camera as she slowly and wearily walks down the boardwalk, moonlight streams over her face (making her intentions seem desperate, somehow mysterious and dark) There has been a murder- Mildred's husband. Playing dumb Mildred is taken to the police station to be questioned. Her movements are noticeably nervous and finicky. During this scene Mildred has a flashback while talking to the Poliece (flashbacks are common in film noir) It is during this flashback that the audience and police officer are witness to her life previously and the events leading up to the murder of her current husband. Through this flashback we see Mildred's divorce, financial difficulty,emotional and mental abuse by her eldest, Vita, who is extremely ungrateful and the cause of most of Mildred'd unhappiness, the death of her youngest daughter, the success of her new restaurant business, and her marriage to Monty (seriously influenced by the money they could accumulate together). It is quite apparent throughout the film that Milly and Vita's relationship as mother and child is pathetic. Vita is spoiled rotten and the more she rejects her mother, the more Milly intends on spoiling her to win her affection. Vita's acting is phenomenal. I really hated her in this film, she was the epitome of a bad child, she was completely convincing. During this flashback sequence the cinematography is amazing. All of the camera angles are sharp and dramatic, also common to this style of film. Specifically, during the first romantic scene between Milly and Monty, there is a shot of them kissing reflected in the mirror across from them in the living room. This indirect shot of their kiss is romantic and intense, a very clever way to capture such a moment. This camera angle makes one feel like they are wrongfully peaking in on the two lovers. As well as the spectacular film elements, there is also a surprising element of humor in this film. Both the female housekeeper and main waitress at Milly's restaurant are hysterical. The housekeeper has an unusually high voice and is flighty. The waitress is sarcastic and dry- "let me bite you, darling boy *barks*". These two women create a necessary break throughout all of the tension in this film. Many people don't care for film noir because of it's dramatic effect and it's seemingly identical story lines. However, I am a fan of film noir and enjoyed this particular film a great deal. I would rate it as a 7 out of 10, the acting was well done, which leads me to compliment the script writing as well. Lastly, the cinematography was intriguing and really set the mood; this is what really caught my attention during this film. Two thumbs up for film noir!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1945 hit Mildred pierce is a phenomenal film. Joan Crawford is amazing she is truly an excellent actress, from the silent films like the Unknown to this film. She is so believable. You could think that what is happened is real because she does a great job in this role. You can see how she feels and it brings so much realism to the film. Ann Blyth plays Veda Mildred's daughter. She also does an incredible job convincing the audience that she is a stuck up spoiled brat. Jack Carson acts as Wally Fay. He also does a stand up job. The film is packed with great actors and actress who have good chemistry on the screen. I really enjoyed the way the film is set up. The whole film you think Mildred is the one who killed her husband in the first scene. But at the end when the truth behind that scene is revealed you almost can't believe you didn't see it coming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting take of noir.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mildred Pierce" is an amazing movie. For the most part the plot is decent, but the acting is what really did it for me.Joan Crawford was unbelievable (in the good way) as Mildred, a successful working mother who is overly devoted to meeting the demands of her her child and may or may not have been involved with a murder. Having learned the craft from Lon Chaney while on the set of "The Unknown," by this point Crawford had perfected the art. Ann Blyth, in one of her earliest roles, played the sociopathic Veda perfectly. Blyth was really able to capture the evil within Veda.The way the movie plays out is typical of many noir movies, the events are shown in a flashback. The only problem that I can see with this movie is that some people may not like the ending. It is a bit predictable from about the halfway point in the film, but aside from that it is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce was a film directed by Michael Curtiz in 1945. It was a drama filmed in black and white. One of the themes in the movie was a mother-daughter relationship. Mildred, portrayed by Joan Crawford is the mother who is trying to win the approval of her selfish, self-centered daughter. Joan Crawford's performance was outstanding. She was awarded the Oscar Academy Award for Best Actress. A second theme of the movie was greed. Pierce's daughter, Veda, portrayed by Ann Blyth, was relentlessly greedy in her relationships with her mother and her husband. The movie was realistic by today's standards, maybe not as common for the time period it was filmed. She wants to accomplish success and achieve the American dream. But along this journey, she goes through a divorce, and has a successful business that runs into problems. The lighting and locations go from daytime scenes to dark scenes as the changes happen in Mildred's life. Scenes included a bright open-airy room, which take on the feel of a resort. Then, there were the scenes which showed the shadows of the actors seemed to build a suspense in the movie. The camera shots of Mildred show her to be a woman in control.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crawford Shines in this Pseudo-Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a given that all mothers love their daughters. But if they knew to what extent they'd go through, it's doubtful that a movie like Mildred Pierce would end up the way it did.Joan Crawford plays the titular role, and all she wants for her daughters is to have a good life. This cased around a whodunit sort of mystery, and this movie has an instant hook. Told in a few flashbacks at the typical detective's office, it's immediately apparent that director Michael Curtiz wants us to think that these flashbacks were all peaches and cream, instantly shifting the color schemes from a nighttime rainy setting with dark buildings everywhere to beaches, sunlight, and white stucco houses. It's arguable that this technique is meant to throw you, especially as the movie wears on it's apparent that Mildred's daughter (Ann Blyth) will take whatever she can get.Thematically this movie is all over the board, but the one that sticks in my mind the most is the generational wear that parents have on their children. All Mildred wanted for her daughter was the life she thought she deserved. And she planted this thought in Veda's head, and that's all Veda thought about: the life she deserved. In the end it's what consumed both of them, and essentially ruined them and all of the lives that touched them. I found it also very interesting that the male actors took a backseat in this film for this era, but refreshing at the same time.And you probably won't, but I saw the twist coming 20 seconds in. Good luck, a great watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is such an amazing film. The lighting itself throughout the movie was wonderfully thought out. Some of the absolute highlights of the lighting was when the body was on the ground and how it wasn't noticed in the dark, but when the lamp fell it was like a huge revelation. Also the shadows were amazingly used to show reactions and to show if someone was coming. It was a really nice aspect that I really appreciated because it made the movie stand out for me. Another thing I noticed was when Veta and her friends were blowing out her candles how wind seemed to come out from the camera which not only breaks the forth wall it also feels like the audience helped her do that. Joan Crawford is an outstanding actress and no one else could have pulled off the roll as well as she did. She reacts so sincerely and wonderfully and her timing is just impeccable. As far as the story itself it was nice to see that Mildred had what it took to hit her daughter, as awful as that sounds, I say that because Veta absolutely deserved it and lets face it everyone in the audience wanted to do it themselves. Having reacts like that build up in those watching is what defines a really good film. Also, for a 1945 film I wasn't sure if they would have gone as far as to say Veta was stealing her mother's husband, but it was nice to see that they went there and that the feeling one got throughout the movie wasn't misleading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing that caught my eye was that the leading character in the film was a female, not a male as per the norm of other film noir movies. The opening sequence of events was also a real attention-grabber; it pulled me into the movie very quickly. The use of flashback to narrate Mildred's story was very effective in my opinion. I loved how the inspector fooled Mildred into thinking that her first husband had killed Monte, causing her to relate more and more of her story. The end twist was not completely clear until the last twenty minutes or so of the film. The camera work, especially the use of POV, was very effective in creating an emotional attachment to the film. The plot was well developed, and has a great sense of realism attached to it, particularly in Mildred's character and how she struggles to make her daughter happy. I myself have known people like Mildred and Veda from my experiences at the Saratoga Racetrack, so I thought those two characters were by far the most believable of the whole cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce was an odd movie to me, although I thought that it had a great plot. The best scene is the first scene where Wally is trapped in the house with the body of Mildred's husband. The use of shadow and darkness really enhanced the fact that he was trapped. I thought Joan Crawford did a wonderful job of developing this character, who evolved from a housewife who baked pies to a very successful restaurateur. This was a strong female character that we haven't seen before. I did have a hard time picturing Joan Crawford as a wife and mother. The most realistic character was Wally-he sort of brought everything together. The daughter was a little snot, right from the get-go, she angered me off so much, I couldn't stand her. When Mildred had enough and kicked her out I was so happy. But then ironically it hurt Mildred more to see her daughter working as a singer and dancer. Since the younger daughter died, she tried to over-compensate and ended up creating a monster. A psychological portrait of Mildred Pierce.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is WAY ahead of its time. It's hard to believe that anyone would make a movie that was so supportive of women and mothers in 1945. The way the woman protagonist is portrayed and viewed in the story would make me believe this was a modern movie. It features Joan Crawford as woman who tries her best as a mother to survive while being independent. Meanwhile she sees her daughter slowly become a tragedy as her spoiled nature consumes her. The character development of every character is very clear and helps the story drag out without being too boring.Joan Crawford gives a really good performance that brings a lot of charisma. The whole cast is very interesting and you can see a natural reaction in almost every second of the movie.The movie ties up details very smoothly considering how confusing the first few scenes can be. The film noir contrast of brightness in different scenes sets the mood very nicely and use innovative camera techniques to intrigue the viewer. The camera makes very good use of it's framing by often setting itself just over and behind the back of the shoulder to give an almost first perspective while making sure that the viewer knows who they are supposed to feel like. It also at the same time brings more attention to the person who we are supposed to be focused on. This camera technique is used in a few movies like Romero's Night of the Living Dead, but it's switched with other camera shots to break monotony and make good use of other cinematic techniques.The lighting is perfect. The use of background lights is very good, but the movie also uses shadows with that lighting to create subtle symbolism during scenes of resolution and conflict. The sound is also really good and doesn't sound cliché except for maybe in a few scenes where it still works. The sound effects are also effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a touching, yet hard movie to watch. Throughout the whole film you wanted to reach in, grab Mildred (Joan Crawford) and shake her for being so giving and nice to her horrible, spoiled, selfish daughter Veda (Ann Blyth). Ann's character Veda really bothered me throughout this film for many reasons. The cast picked out for this movie really fit the parts of each character to the "T". Now I see why Joan Crawford was such a strong, wonderful actress of her time (and to date.) Michael Curtiz (director) did a wonderful job when filming this. There was amazing lighting throughout the whole film. I loved how special attention was paid to lighting up each round characters face during certain important parts. It really captured the beauty of not only the character but the scene at hand. I thought the twist at the end of Veda being the murderer was wonderful and I did not see that coming at all. Even though I thought Wally was a creep throughout the film I didn't think he would have stooped that low to molest a child. The plot from beginning to end was wonderful. MacDougall, Faultner, and Turney did a wonderful job at the screen write. Overall, the film was wonderful and very hard to take your eyes off it. Many round characters in the film but the viewer never lost the focus off Mildred and her strong character. Great film!</fullReview>

The different camera angles and focuses were a great touch, as well. "Mildred Pierce" may not have been as good as Casablanca, but it was certainly a good try as it was nominated for five Oscars with one winner.

		<shortDescription>Mildred Peirce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Peirce (1945) is a powerful movie that falls into the 'film noir' category. The dark scenes, the damsel in distress and the romance that drives the entire film. This description makes a 'film noir' look simple but Mildred Peirce was quite the opposite. With intensely dynamic characters and a wild plot, director Micheal Curtiz succeeded in making a great film. While staying in the genre of 'film noir' he was able to deviate from the norm and create a stunning, unpredictable film. One aspect that stood out was the use of lighting throughout the movie. Curtiz created an ongoing lighting theme throughout, with dark colors and large shadows. This helped him portray the dark world wherein Mildred Peirce took place. Another very important aspect of this film is the casting. Each and every character of this movie is so perfect for their roles, everyone complements each other and the foils are very powerful. Overall Mildred Peirce is a powerful film noir masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joan Crawford's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After establishing herself as a star in Hollywood in the 1930's with films like "Grand Hotel" "Rain" and "Sadie McKee" Joan Crawford began to see her career waning by the early 1940's and she was released by MGM. She signed with Warner Bros. and in 1945 starred in what could possibly be her best film - "Mildred Pierce" in which she won the Oscar for "Best Actress" playing a divorced mother who stops at nothing to provide for her family. The film also includes an outstanding supporting cast including Jack Carson, Zachary Scott, Eve Arden and Ann Blyth as "every mother's nightmare" of a daughter.Crawford's performance skillfully maneuvers back and forth through the film between the weak, naive mother who refuses to think ill of her spoiled rotten daughter and the hard driven businesswoman who suspects any and everyone, especially the men that she deals with because they have other intentions when they offer up a helping hand to her. Mildred immediately recognizes the men's motives but stubbornly turns a blind eye to her own daughter's selfish demands. The rest of the cast puts in solid performances as well. Jack Carson as the savvy businessman who loves Mildred almost as much as he loves money and tries in vain to win her affections. Zachary Scott as the idle, scheming playboy, who thumbs his nose at the working class and Mildred, behind her back, but doesn't turn down a handout from her. Eve Arden as Mildred's clever best friend and business associate who isn't afraid to speak her mind about Mildred's greedy daughter but is powerless to convince her to put her foot down - and Ann Blyth as Veda, certainly cannot be ignored. She delivers a memorable performance as Mildred's spoiled and uncontrollable offspring.Directed by Michael Curtiz (Casablanca) and musical score by Max Steiner (Gone with the Wind) "Mildred Pierce" is one of Joan Crawford's finest films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crawford was Desperate for Role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the year 1945, Joan Crawford had a long career in films and was beginning to fad out of the Hollywood Big Screen. Many other famous actresses were being considered for this role as Mildred Pierce. However, Joan Crawford called the Producer of this film, Jerry Wald almost everyday for his consideration; the reason being she knew this was the part for her, because of the fact that Joan Crawford in real life was just like Mildred Pierce. After many generations have viewed this film, everyone knows that Joan was destined to play this role and win an Oscar for her wonderful performance. Jack Carson,(Wally Fay),"Cat On A Hot Tine Roof",58 gave an outstanding supporting role along with Zachary Scott,(Monte Beragon),"The Mask of Dimitrios",'44. Monte Beragon was a very dark and sinister character and Zachary Scott was perfect for his role. This is truly a great film Classic which will be enjoyed for many generations to view and review !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great film, this one really had me at the edge my seat. I was filled with anger throughout this film. Veda Pierce was possible one of the worst people that I've ever watched on film. The character was portrayed so well, I believe every action and every word that was spoken from Ann Blyth. What a phenomenal actress. The photography of this film splendid. It had the feel of the movie Casablanca: soft, dark, bright and smooth. I loved how when a character would walk in one direction and the camera would follow. And also in one scene there was a angle the camera person was and it stood in front of the characters but it backed up as the character walked away. We see some of the characters focused on but the surroundings are blurred out. The lightening is soft on the Mildred's face and as well as the other female actresses. The transitions from scene to scene are nice, it all flows. There also was this one scene when there was a spot light on the house/ at the beach. I thought it was nice, it was something I haven't seen before in the black &amp; white films. The photography in this film was beautiful, plus the views of the ocean were magnificent. I also loved how a good part of the film was a flashback.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce was a great film and I really enjoyed it start to finish. The lady that played Mildred Pierce did and outstanding job portraying her character. The character to me that stole the show was Mildred's daughter. The lady that played Veda Pierce was excellent in all phases of what her character was like. I really enjoyed this movie and more so than most of the others we have seen in class so far because it was more mystery type. You also never knew what was going to happen next, which kept you on your toes and to follow the clues that you were given to solve the mystery. Movies like this are my cup of tea. I would recommend this movie to everyone and I would without a doubt watch this movie for fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I was watching Mildred Pierce, I wasn't sure if I was watching a movie or a soap opera. It was very dramatic, a little too over dramatic if you ask me. I also thought that it was very dragged out. Towards the end of the film I couldn't stop looking at my watch wondering how much longer it could go on for. Despite this, I felt that the film itself was made really well. I liked the film-noir aspect of it. The dark shadows and stark contrasts were something that isn't as viewable in today's colored movies. I also enjoyed the memorable one liners that were said by the characters. There were some funny quotes and decent acting, so that's what helped me sit through the whole thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A strange Film Noir. Using a female lead was different, but it never once has to regret that decision. It is beautifully acted, so well in fact that there were several points in it that the room I was in erupted in disapproval at action that were taking place on the screen. It was much like I imagine housewives reactions to their "stories".Being that it was Noir, it has very deep shadows. I can't get over how beautiful shadow and light can be when it dances on one's face. I wish more people would realize that its more about what you don't see then it is about what you see. (I'm looking at you horror films!)It is a movie that will keep you guessing to the end and I would suggest it to anyone looking for a thrill or even a great movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just love Joan Crawford. She brings a sense of steely determination and will to this film. Her character is a devoted housewife, who puts the needs of her family first. When her husband began to have an affair with a neighbor, she kicks him out and starts life with her two daughters. Vida was her pride and joy, the apple of her eye and would give anything and do anything for. Vida had taken complete advantage of that and the main story in the film. She messes up so horribly and her mother is always there to clean her mess. But her final act her mother wouldn't help her anymore. She realized that her helping Vida was actually hurting her because her perception on things was extremely construed. What makes this movie so amazing is that Crawford's determined, sympathetic performance draws you in. "Mildred Pierce" is an exceptional film that uses some of the best elements of classic cinema. The story moves at a sleek pace,. Watching this movie gives the viewer a powerful, emotional cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred Pierce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among the films in the category of "Film noir", Michael Curtiz's film Mildred Pierce stands out. Not only does it break genre's normal pattern of a troubled male lead but it adds a great deal of excitement and draws the viewer in. Joan Crawford's portrayal of a hard working single mother turned successful businesswoman charms and the audience and allows them to sympathize with her throughout the film. The supporting cast was spectacular as well. Mildred's daughter played by Ann Blyth was fantastically selfish and manipulative and the dynamic between the two actresses set the mood for the film from the very beginning. Monte Beragon, played by Zachary Scott, was also fabulous and the relationship between those three characters added a great deal of suspense to the film since the viewer is always waiting for the ball to drop causing some sort of catastrophe. The filming techniques that were used in the film were quite fantastic as well. The use of flashback was probably the most utilized technique in the film since most of the film was Mildred's conversation about thee vents leading up to the murder. It was also interesting to have Mildred be the narrator of the film, it really put the viewer in her shoes. The scene work and locations chosen for the sets were magnificent. The shots of the beach house and the water where Mildred and Monte were spending time together are beautiful. The intricacies of Mildred's restaurant was fantastic. As a whole the film was great and brought the genre of Film Noir to a completely different level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred is a Must</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce" is a great movie because it tackles the need for wealth and the problems that stem from money. Mildred Pierce is a particularly likable lead because she is a strong female, where her only major flaw is her over providing for her ungrateful daughter, Veda. Mildred embodies female empowerment, telling her cheating husband to pack his bags. She then starts from the ground up, from waiting tables (gasp!) to owning her own franchise. The sad part is that since Mildred is so hardworking and honest, she is taken advantage of by nearly everyone in her life. This movie shows how money can truly tear people apart and bring unhappiness.The movie is particularly interesting because the majority of the movie is told in flashback. This is interesting because you know in the beginning how Mildred ends up but you don't know how she got to that point. It makes the movie a little like solving a puzzle.Overall this movie is excellent. If you are looking for film noir specifically though, I would not recommend it since ninety percent of the movie takes place in a sunny, Southern California flashback.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joan Crawford's Crowning Glory!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Casablanca" director Michael Curtiz made another classic melodrama with "Mildred Pierce," and actress Joan Crawford scored a major comeback with this tour-de-force soap opera about the rise and fall of a woman as an entrepreneur. Crawford had been dumped by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and picked up by Warner Brothers where she loitered for a couple of years before she found precisely the kind of role that she felt was ideal for her. Initially, Curtiz wanted nothing to do with the high-handed Crawford with her padded shoulders. The Hungarian-born workalcoholic Curtiz originally sought Barbara Stanwyck for the lead role, but he changed his mind about Crawford when he observed her aggressive work ethic. Indeed, "Mildred Pierce" represents Crawford at her zenith, and she won her one and only Best Actress Oscar. Warner Brothers surrounded Crawford with a sterling cast including Anne Blyth as her snotty, stuck-up daughter Veda, Jack Carson as the fast-talking Wally Fay, and Zachary Scott as a dissolute womanizer with a closet filled with swim suits belonging to his many sisters. The theme of mother versus daughter stands above all others in this woman's film that depicts a woman struggling to succeed in life without a man and raise two daughters. At the same time, the theme of women versus men hovers in the background. Just as Mildred seems doomed to be a bad mother because she indulges her arrogant daughter's every whim, Mildred achieves no success with the men in her life. Zachary Scott is simply brilliant as a worthless playboy type who preys on Mildred like a leech and eventually robs her of every dime. Cast as Monte Beragon, Scott not only takes Mildred to the cleaners, he takes advantage of Veda. Hollywood made several movies about tempestuous mother and daughter relationships, among them the Bette Davis soaper "Now, Voyager," but "Mildred Pierce" ranks as the most memorable. Producer Jerry Wald convinced studio boss Jack Warner to buy the rights to James M. Cain's novel, but the writers had to eliminate much of the sexual content because the Production Code Administration prohibited the kind of behavior that Cain portrayed in his book. Such had been the case with previous cinematic adaptations of Cain's work, including "Double Indemnity" (1944) and later "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (1946).Warner Brothers released "Mildred Pierce" in 1945, less than a year after World War II ended. Although there are many references to the war in the film, such as Monte's crack about nylons being out when he pays a spot inspection visit to Mildred's diner, the filmmakers never make any overt references to the war. The setting is clearly in the early 1940s while the Allies were fighting the Axis Powers. Never do we see any servicemen in uniform wander through the mise-en-scene. Essentially, "Mildred Pierce" qualifies as a film noir. Curtiz shoots virtually everything with shadows and the plot focuses on the death of a major character at the outset of the action. Curtiz loved to tell stories in flashback and his Humphrey Bogart World War II thriller "Passage to Marseille" is related in flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks. "Mildred Pierce" isn't as convoluted as the Bogart film and the mystery about who murdered Monte Beragon is what drives this black &amp; white film forward. After the opening sequence when unsavory Monte is shot and killed in cold blood at his house, the plot reverts to the past as Mildred recounts her life story to a detective. We learn that the marriage between Mildred and her real estate salesman husband Bert (for U.S. Olympic shot-put champ Bruce Bennett) is not congenial. Mildred lives and breathes to please her two daughters, Kay (Jo Ann Marlowe of "Dangerous Intruder") and Veda (Ann Blyth of "Brute Force"), but she concentrates on Veda, at the expense of Kay. Sadly, nothing that Mildred does for Veda ever pleases Veda and Veda winds up making life hell for Mildred. Mildred usurps her role as a wife and Bert grows sick of her and has an affair with Mrs. Maggie Biederhof (Lee Patrick of "The Maltese Falcon") that leads to his divorce from Mildred. Mildred strikes out on her own, reflecting the success that women achieved in the workplace since most men had been mobilized for the work effort. Indeed, Mildred becomes a seeming success story over night, owning and managing a franchise of restaurants with the help of her right-hand girl, Ida Corwin (Eva Arden of "The Doughgirls"), who delivers the choicest wisecracks. At one point, Ida observes about her relationships with men: "When men get around me, they get allergic to wedding rings." Later, she adds about the opposite sex: "Oh, men. I never yet met one of them that didn't have the instincts of a heel. Sometimes I wish I could get along without them." Altogether, Mildred tries to act as the mother and the father and she winds up failing miserably. Daughter Veda emerges as a villainous of the worst sort and her comeuppance is something that you enjoy watching her get. "Mildred Pierce" emerges as a very atmospheric movie and Curtiz never wears out his welcome, even when he shifts back and forth in time. For the record, there was no murder in the novel, but it occupies the centerpiece of "Mildred Pierce" and all the characters swirl around it. "Mildred Pierce" is a brilliant example of top-notch film-making. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

This movie grabbed me, pulled me in, and altered my emotions with the plot as any great movie would.Throughout the movie, the character Veda really bothered me. I could not understand why Mildred would continue to try and please her insatiable, ingrate daughter. Sure, she loves her and is the only daughter she had left, but when someone is that cruel to you, the sacrifice of your happiness is completely fruitless. Even after Mildred found her daughter having an affair with Monte (her husband) and killing him, she continued to give anything she could to protect her daughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soapy but enjoyable story, even if the dramatic bookends don't work as well as they should</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When her husband is found murdered, the police pick up Mildred's ex-husband Bert, who doesn't deny that he had done the crime even if he doesn't admit it. Mildred is sure that Bert didn't do it as he is far too mild mannered. She tells the police the story of their marriage where Bert left her alone with two children ? the tomboyish Kay and the materialistic Veda; how she started to work in a restaurant before eventually being able to open up her own place and making the money that she needed to give Veda everything she wants out of life.Despite knowing that it is one of Joan Crawford's better films I didn't know a great deal about it and decided to make good use of Christmas television by catching up on older films that I had never gotten round to seeing. The film starts many years into the main story, using a murder to trigger a flashback into a rather melodramatic story where Mildred's maternal instincts are directed towards the pursuit of money for her demanding daughter Veda. It is all a bit soapy and melodramatic but it is still an enjoyable story featuring an emotional battle between mother and daughter that affects all aspects of her life. It is delivered with some wit but mostly it is quite dramatic in a human sort of way ? I hold back from saying "melodrama" again because normally that implies an average story to me but it did work here. What didn't totally work was the framing of the story with the murder subplot; it works at the end once it gets tied in but at the start it didn't make a great deal of sense and the story seemed irrelevant at the start.Happily this is a minor problem because the story does get pretty engaging as it goes. This sort of film is typical Crawford territory and she is very good here ? building from a gentle, loving mother to a woman turned hard by her treatment by others. Equally as good is Blyth's Veda, she is very good in the second half of the film although she is too obvious at the start, meaning that I did wonder why everyone seemed so blind to her faults. Arden is almost a cameo but her sharp wit does provide some relief from the soap in an effective way meanwhile Carson, Scott and Bennett are all pretty good in the male roles for a variety of reasons.Overall this is an enjoyable drama that is well told with a good central character and good performances. Time has given it a high reputation thanks to Crawford and I wasn't disappointed with it. Well worth a watch for a solid piece of story telling albeit with a bit of soapy melodrama in there too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wrote down my impressions ten years ago: Saw it for the third time and I could keep watching it forever. It is one of the greatest ever made. Visually gorgeous. The dialogue is smart, real. Joan Crawford is priceless. Everything works. This could have been a soap opera, but it is far from it. It is touching, amusing and always interesting. It never sags or lags. The only flaw is the rather pointless death of one of the daughters. The movie has some didactic elements (don't spoil your children), but it is far from being just a sermon. There are no villains. The writer sees everyone as a human being. These are real people, complex, contradictory. Yet the complexity isn't overdone. The movie remains light and never sinks into bathos. I don't know what it is about Joan Crawford that thrills me so much. She is a damn good actress. She knows just the right balance between acting a character and being one. Gone are the days of stylish acting like hers. My views are not set in concrete. I can't believe I liked Love Story (1970) only a few years ago! In retrospect it seems shockingly classist, with the girl having to conveniently shuffle off her mortal coil to prevent inter-class miscegenation. Hollywood is reactionary when it comes to racial and class miscegenation (and many other things), and one must watch out for these cryptic messages that masquerade as tragedy. Is Mildred Pierce a tragedy, because she is a working woman? Is the message, that working women are up to no good?</fullReview>

The evil must get what they deserve! By the way, did anyone else notice that scene where Bert turns and walks off after Mildred and Veda reconcile? Mildred and Veda talk long enough for Bert to have left the house, but when Mildred realizes she hasn't thanked him, he's only a few feet away. It drives me crazy every time I see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I watch Mildred Pierce I can't conceive of myself or any of my siblings treating our mother the way Ann Blyth treats Joan Crawford. Bad seeds are a pretty scary prospect for any family and no one likes to admit they gave birth to one.There was so much pressure on Joan Crawford in this film. She had been dropped by her original studio MGM because it was said she wasn't box office any more. And outside of an appearance in Hollywood Canteen, Warner Brothers wasn't offering her much work either.Legend has it that Jack Warner signed Crawford as a way of keeping Bette Davis in line and that that was the beginning of that famous feud. Whatever it was when the brothers Warner acquired the rights to James M. Cain's novel, Joan KNEW the role of Mildred Pierce was for her. She campaigned and got it.It's not all that different from some of the parts she had been playing successfully at MGM. Even when she wore gowns by Adrian, Crawford usually was playing someone who worked their way up to where she could afford them.So she is in Mildred Pierce. After husband Bruce Bennett leaves her because she spoils her two daughters rotten with no time for him. He's had some business reversals and Crawford won't cut back on her luxuries where the kids, Ann Blyth and JoAnn Marlowe are concerned.But Joan's got grit and she goes to work, starting as a waitress, she works her way up to owning a small chain of restaurants. She also acquires a no good scoundrel of a second husband along the way in Zachary Scott. It hits her in one dramatic scene that she's spoiled her daughter too much. Not entirely her fault, Bennett's got part of the blame here. But Ann Blyth may very well be the Queen of all bad seed children ever put on film.Crawford won her Oscar in 1945 for Best Actress and this gave her career a fifteen year lease on life. Ann Blyth was nominated for Best Supporting Actress with Eve Arden who played Crawford's wisecracking friend with sage advice as only Eve Arden could play that kind of part. Unfortunately the split allowed for Anne Revere to win for National Velvet.Unlike a whole lot of films in this time period, this was not a happy ever after ending. Crawford lives, but her future is by no means certain or guaranteed to be happy. But she does do a whole lot of living in the four years covered by the Mildred Pierce plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is a film about a single mother who is by all means fight against poverty and in the end her wins. However, the fight with the ungrateful and mentally ill daughter can not be measured not with wealth nor with prosperity. Family suffering of main protagonist is greater than the mysterious murders with which the film begins. One extremely strong and complex female characters disrupted selfish and spoiled daughter.The relationship between mothers and daughters is it definitely the biggest problem in the film. I am convinced that the mother should often hold educational lessons to her older daughter. In this case, the struggle for survival woman away from loved one. Death of younger daughter is shown too transient to be convincing. Life goes on. Ruin this little life that is left.The film is filled with vague premises that lead to quite a clear conclusion. The older daughter is a definite cause of the problem and the story ends. Love of parents towards children is strong, but I think that love is not solely responsible for making good person.Joan Crawford as Mildred Pierce Beragon is a strong and capable woman. How much is actually smart!? Blind love for a living child is illogical. Today, similar examples are often present. Almost always lead to a certain extreme. She wants her kid to be happy. Luckily that never existed has its price.Ann Blyth as Veda Pierce Forrester is pretty amazing. The actress who is in every sense unconvincing makes a good impression.Mildred Pierce is a film that lacks style. Emotions are strong, but a little impersonal. Description of characters, except the main female character, is not impressive. This movie I'd never led in the context of the situation of women in society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred Pierce (1945)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really appreciated how strong the roles of female characters were in the Mildred Pierce.Even today you don't get many movies with a large female cast. The movie did a great job of portraying the grief and hard work that the protagonist experienced throughout her life. She is one of the most rounded characters I've seen in a while. However, the movie drags on for far too long. Many scenes could have been whittled down or cut without impairing the message of the film or the impact of each individual take. Mildred Pierce is undeniably well made, but I somehow found myself waiting for it to end halfway through. Overall, the movie is something I believe people will continue to enjoy for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story about divorce, and a women's relationship with her daughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to start by saying I am not much for noir films. Though there are aspects I like. They have a very dramatic and distinct feel in the way that they are shot, however, I dislike the character development of the genre. They all tend to portray men and women and their relationships the same way. Women are usually portrayed as manipulative...though it is portrayed rather well by the daughter in this film. She tends to not be a likable character throughout the film. From what I have heard, the film is much more appreciated if the novel it is based on is read first. Overall, a well executed movie, just not my taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred pierce is a great film because of how much different it is. The focus is on a woman who is picking her self up after divorce. I personally enjoy any story about someone who works hard and chases what they want. The story stays interesting by flashing back and forth between present day discussing a murder and her life before and what led up to the crime. The editor did a great job of making this these time changes very smooth and apparent. Also since they don't show the murderer it keeps you in suspense especially since there is a happy story but you know in the back of your mind there is going to be a murder. The only bad part about this movie was the daughter. She single handedly ruined every scene she was in the girl was a bitch. I was glad to see she was a dancer. Felt like justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film made history for many reasons. The major reason was the fact that the main character was a woman and that she was successful and making money. This was not uncommon for the time period because of the war just ending and the men that had been drafted were just re-entering the work force. I am proud to say that the production staff did a good job on this film because I did not see the ending coming. The cinematography of the film was outstanding and the lighting especially helped convey the mood that the characters were trying to form. I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in a different kind of movie that will keep you guessing long after it is finished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Curtiz's direction is truly superb in the way he presents the story as well as delving into the mind of its titular character. Curtiz also plays up to the noir style of the film by creating an opening sequence while never revealing who kills Monte. This would create a tone where it becomes very dark during Mildred's interrogation scenes. By the time the third act arrives, the mixture of melodrama and noir finally blend as the tone of the film darkens. Cinematographer Ernest Haller does a phenomenal job with the film's black-and-white photography from the wondrous, sunny look of the suburbs that Mildred lived in early in the film to the dark, eerie world that comes in later in the film. Max Steiner score is excellent from its sweeping theme that plays to the melodrama of the film to more uplifting pieces that plays to Mildred's rise. Steiner's score is definitely another of the film's highlights as it's truly spectacular. The cast is definitely wonderful for its array of some very memorable performances from the big actors to some small roles by other actors. Mainly Joan Crawford in one of her finest performances as the title character brings realism to a woman in the 1940s trying to do what is right for her children. Bringing a sense of frustration over her spoiled child, but never once coming off as a mean spirited mother. It's an overall iconic performance from the legendary Crawford. Ann Blyth is superb as Veda, the ungrateful daughter who wants to become rich and ambitious as she is also a selfish, spoiled, and uncaring. With a stylized yet dramatic performance, Blyth succeeds in creating an unsympathetic character that everyone loves to hate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny how much I enjoy this film with only two really likable characters in it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...one of whom dies early in the film, and then there is Mildred's right-hand woman, Ida Corwin (Eve Arden), who was at first Mildred's boss and then, does the same job for Mildred in Mildred's restaurant. She swings some great one liners, and seems to hold no resentment for that glass ceiling she is stuck underneath.The film is about the trials and tribulations of the film's namesake, played by Crawford, a housewife to a jobless man, Bert, who has a caveman's attitude. However, with no business sense and no job, he is a caveman without a club. Furthermore he spends all of his free time with the widow/divorcée?? down the street, Mrs. Biederhopf (Lee Patrick) who doesn't mind Bert's jobless state because she probably has either alimony or life insurance from the former or dead husband.The long and the short of it is that Bert and Mildred quarrel, he refuses to stop seeing Mrs. Biederhopf, and she refuses to stop spoiling their oldest daughter Veda (Ann Blyth) who is a complete snob. The two separate and eventually divorce. After Mildred's youngest daughter dies suddenly, Mildred holds tighter to Veda than ever, making sure her every wish is granted, not seeing the sociopath she is breeding right in front of her eyes. So Mildred's big weakness is naiveté and blindness where her daughter is concerned. By saving and hard work as a waitress and a made to order baker of pies and cakes, Mildred opens up first one restaurant, and from there becomes a chain. In opening her first restaurant she comes across the male equivalent of Veda - middle aged socialite bachelor Monte (Zachary Scott) who is all hat and no cattle, all snob and no work, all standard and no gold. The culmination of all of Mildred's mistakes is to let Veda spend so much time with him, and then getting Vida to come back home after the two have a big fight by marrying Monte, figuring that touch of old money class as a stepfather figure will make Veda want to stay. Monte's big mistake? He tells the female equivalent of himself the kinds of things that he figures would hurt the most -they do - at the worst possible time to a teenage girl who up to this point believes sex equals love and has no moral compunctions whatsoever but does have a big dose of pride. As Eastwood said, "a man has got to know his limitations".I didn't realize how good the acting was in this one, because I saw it several times before I was ever into classic film and my mind just typecast Zachary Scott and Ann Blythe into complete scumbags. How surprised I was when Turner Classic Movies came on the air and I saw these two had done a wide variety of roles, just as convincing as the roles they played here. As for Joan Crawford's Oscar, it's not that she didn't deserve this one, but I can think of roles before and after this one where she was just as good such as 1947's Possessed (for which she was nominated), and 1934's "Forsaking All Others", for which she got no Academy nod whatsoever.The murder mystery between which all of this is sandwiched is not from the original novel. It's a product of the production code to make sure wrongdoers are punished, and, in my opinion, to imply an ending I found a bit unbelievable but again, the production code was probably involved there too.Let me give kudos to some other people. First director Michael Curtiz and the screenwriters who handled the meat of the story ? Mildred's tormented relationship with Veda ? with great skill and drama, all the while keeping the story moving at a brisk pace. Then finally, there is supporting player Jack Carson. He is greedy, a wolf, full of himself - in short he is a human version of Daffy Duck - but he is really a needed supporting ingredient in all of this. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was first hesitant to watch Michael Curtiz's Mildred Pierce and was pleasantly surprised at how quickly i was involved and absorbed into the its seamless story. Some would argue the story "lacks conviction" but i felt as though the story was engaging and interesting. The story features a few overarching themes such as the familiar theme of the "American Dream" and it is all centered around a woman instead of a man which i could appreciate. The woman being Mildred Pierce played by a highly competent Joan Crawford who delivers a knockout performance, in my eyes. Mildred Pierce climbs the proverbial ladder throughout the film and with each knockdown rises with grace in social standing. Her daughter Veda, who was portrayed marvelously by Ann Blyth, undermines and belittles Mildred throughout, but Mildred is no ordinary woman. Throughout the story we encounter drama, betrayal, and love that weave together perfectly. The cinematography was simply brilliant and beautiful. Shots such as the the one we see at the films climax of the mysterious shadows in the dark as they slowly come to light only add to the drama and tension. The story is told through flashbacks and the audience is slowly fed throughout the movie which is a refreshing change from some of the chronological and mundane movies i've seen. I've always appreciated Curtiz's Mildred Pierce, and to put Mildred Pierce in simple perspective; i hold it in higher regard than Curtiz's earlier work, Casablanca</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is a Film Noir classic. Because it is very different from other films made before this time, because it shows the woman as having very large role, and be more independent and more successful than her husband, whom Mildred divorces in the beginning for cheating on her. Mildred works very hard to give her two daughters everything they want, but it seemed to be impossible for her to ever please her oldest daughter. Her youngest daughter died, so she promises to give her oldest daughter anything she asked for. But the more and harder that Mildred worked to do that for her daughter the more her daughter resented her for degrading their social status. In these Film Noir movies, women are also shown as having a bad sad, which we see in Mildred Pierce, because she kills her boyfriend to have his home. I thought this was a pretty good film, I liked that it showed a new side to women in movie, such that could have more of a role in the film.</fullReview>

She had all the characteristics. Mildreds daughters, husbands, boyfriends, and friends could have been way more outgoing and could have given more to the film. This is my opinion, but it seemed like Mildred carried the entire movie beginning to end, I hated most of the other characters and it is shown by the fact that Mildred is pretty much in every single scene. This movie could have been much more if only the other characters put in one hundred and twenty percent instead of ten percent, while Mildred gave it her all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The unexpected number 1 femme fatale, a criminal mastermind in her own right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Veda!! Wow. That is all the words I can utter about her after seeing this film without going into rambles trying to analyze her. From the get-go, we have the noir set-up, we see Mildred Pierce about to jump off the dock only to be saved. Then we follow her to the home in which a dead body is discovered, she remains aloof and the same man that saved her from suicide and walked her home becomes the number one suspect for the man's murder. So, initially, Mildred Pierce is set up as the femme fatale. When she speaks with the police officer, we go into a flashback (which is a majority of the film), that shows us how the story got to the point that it is at the present where someone must be charged for the crime. We see Mildred having femme fatale qualities for sure; she uses the men in her life for her own personal gain both in her business and moving up the social status ladder, she destroyed the typical stereotype of the time in terms of being a housewife, she gained success on her own (above the level she had with her ex Husband), she is independent, strong, and her goal-oriented desire is something one can envy. But what drove her to this? She may have been happy with one, or a few restaurants in her name, but Veda, her greedy nature always wanted more. She disguised her money-hungry motives as love. The better her mother did, the happier she was. She asked her mother about why she was a waitress and called it degrading. Then when her mother was well off enough to purchase a mansion and buy her daughter a car, that still was not enough. So in that, Veda was the top dog, or rather the true femme fatale. In addition to being conniving in fueling her mother's ambition, who only wanted the love and approval of her daughter, she had a few other "puppet shows" going on all the while with many other individuals. She even proves to literally fatal in the end, and in true femme fatale fashion, she almost gets away with it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. I liked how the films main character was a woman. Mildred Pierce was extremely strong throughout the entirety of the film. From her husband cheating on her, to her youngest daughter dying, to her oldest daughter not respecting her, she never once faltered. When she needed something, she went out and for it for herself. She worked hard and never got anything handed to her, which I really liked. She was strong without being intimidating or manipulative. She was honest and good. Her eldest daughter on the other hand, had what was coming to her. I actually despised her throughout the entirety of the movie and was not one bit sad when I found out she was one who killed her mothers husband. I was beyond happy to see her go to jail. Overall though, this film was beautifully done especially with the shadows and how dramatic it was, without being cheesy. Great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a 1945 movie, Mildred Pierce, is ground breaking. It places the woman in the protagonist role. She leaves her husband because he was sleeping around and he could not provide for them. It has her opening a restaurant chain, her gaining the livelihood to support her family. And yet all the while, this strong independent woman is being manipulated by her daughter Veda. The concept of it is truly engaging. We as an audience learn to love and sympathize with her, while hating the deceitful, spoiled Veda, who Mildred will do anything for. Everything she did, was for her daughter, and it was never enough. My congratulations go to the two female leads. They were phenomenal. I actually cursed Ann Blyth out. She really made you loath her. That is good acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engrossing tale of tragic sentiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very rare that a self destructive character can successfully lead a movie. Mildred Peirce accomplishes that feat. Why that is achieved is most likely because of the way the films time line is portrayed. Since the film starts off with a murder with no suspect and then told through flash backs the viewer is forced to stay engrossed. The film challenges the viewer to solve its own mystery. By doing that, even if the viewer is put off by certain aspects of Mildred's character, they must still keep interest in her. And Mildred's unappealing aspects are not flaws in the writing of the character. Her flaws make her sympathetic. She is a woman proving to the world that a woman in that time period can make something of herself. But she's doing it for all the wrong reasons. Reality constantly slaps her in the face but she preservers only then to trip herself up again. All the while the viewer is still trying to figure out who the culprit is before the crime is even committed. The way this story is woven makes it a great experience to watch.</fullReview>

She was a very spoiled girl who was not appreciative of what her mother had given her. Mildred was a hard working single mother. She was a great symbol for women in the real world to look up to. She worked very hard to give her daughter's all that she could her own with the husband out of the picture. Curiz is the master of lighting. This is another film where Curtiz shows his exceptional skills of setting certain moods through lighting and camera angles.

		<fullReview>This movie was definitely a good one to see. The acting was great, the story was really good i thought, but the best thing about this movie was the way it looked. The lighting and editing was so damn good and the camera work was solid. The movie does look like and give the feel of a film noir but I'm not sure if it actually is considered a film noir or not. I think film noir's usually have a male main protagonist but I'm not completely certain. Regardless if its film noir or not it still gives off the dark and powerful visual of a film noir movie. I think Michael Curtiz is a phenomenal director after seeing Casablanca (1942) and this one just made me think even more highly of the guy. It wasn't until a few months ago where i really started to find an interest in these types of movies but i highly recommend Mildred Pierce (1945) and any film by Michael Curtiz.

Another thing that I loved about this film that the entire story is told through a flash back.

I totally hated the daughter character, but at the same time, I understood why she was the way she was, besides the fact that she's just a b*tch by nature. I understood the struggle of a woman trying to work in a time when women were expected to stay in the house.

This movie has all of the twists and turns that you would expect from a good drama of today. The film begins with the death of Mildred's husband and we are not let known the assailant. Actress Joan Crawford is stunning in this film as an older, wiser self than she played as a younger actress in Hollywood. The film can almost make its viewers angry, much like I found myself getting upset with her daughter's lack of passion.

		<fullReview>I did not expect this movie to be this well made, if we are being honest. Right from the start the movie is different from what I've seen before, during this time period. That is having a woman (Joan Crawford) as the lead character, with multiple secondary male characters. Curtiz made this movie brilliant, while it could have been easily rejected due to the woman lead. I can't remember one part of the film in which I found myself either bored or confused. It was a true mystery, because at first you believe Mildred kills her husband. As the story develops however, it becomes clear that it could not have been her, and you get a very good look at how she became who she was. It was a bit of a shock that Veda, Mildred's daughter, was the murderer. Not only was the main character a woman, but the guilty party was also a woman. Brilliantly made, and would highly recommend to any movie lover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred Pierce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is an elaborately told story of manipulation and social climbing. The title character, Mildred (Joan Crawford), is a resilient and hard-working woman, and Crawford brings all the necessary determination, ferocity, and maternal concern that the character needs. She plays Mildred very well. The audience is proud of Mildred's accomplishments, afraid for her at the police station (even if the beginning sequence does lead us to believe she's a criminal), and frustrated by the manipulation that she so frequently falls victim to.Mildred's eldest daughter, Veda (Ann Blyth), is also an example of an excellent on-screen performance. Blyth plays Veda as not just diabolical, but blunt about it. Her manipulation isn't subtly puppeteering--it's knowingly hurtful, calculated but upfront. The acting between Blyth and Crawford is actually, for lack of a better word, electric. I don't know if any other combination of actors would have brought such a combination of heartbreak and fury to audiences watching the dangerous relationship take its toll on Mildred.Technically, the movie is completely solid. Throughout extensive flashbacks, the cinematography and sets are beautiful. The sets bring their own kind of emotion, one that Mildred often misses out on in her struggle to please her daughter. For instance, Mildred should (and the audience does) feel proud to have found a place in the restaurant where she initially works to provide for her daughters, but Veda's shame overshadows Mildred's hard work. Once again, when Mildred has opened her own restaurant, there is a sense of accomplishment about the place, but Mildred misses out again as it will never be good enough. The sets go on like this throughout the movie, contributing to the frustration meant to be felt for Mildred.Overall, The filmmaking is extremely sound. The work with light is beautiful, the camera-work solid, the acting excellent. Mildred Pierce even passes the Bechdel test, so it is certainly progressive on top of being a generally good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Film is Great! Mildred Pierce is most definitely a classic that America should appreciate. The story of a mother who does everything she can to raise her two kids and give them the things that she didn't have as a child. This film also keeps the audience on edge at some degree, in a way that you keep guessing what will happen next. The one character who does a fantastic job would be no other than Joan Crawford. Her character really stands out from others. Mildred Pierce's oldest daughter, Veda is an absolute witch in this film and parents should watch this film just to see how terrible Veda can be to her mother. This film should be owned on DVD to preserve a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good movie. Lighting was excellent. There was always just enough light in the scenes to make it dramatic or emotional. There would be a lot of shadows in the background, outlining the characters bodies. The acting was great, Joan Crawford was very good when switching up roles. She could act like a pathetic, desperate mother, then an angry, cut- throat ex- wife. The daughter was great, too. She really could make you think she was innocent and just wanted bigger things in life but then you hated her with all your guts. She really hit the nail on the head with her spoiled, selfish, and greedy character. It was a cutting edge film, there were a lot of aspects in the movie for this time period. Divorce, working women, death,violence, and sexual innuendos pushed the limits in this film. It was suspenseful, enjoyable, and pretty iconic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After her cheating husband leaves her, Mildred Pierce (Joan Crawford) proves she can become independent and successful, but cannot seem to win the approval of her spoiled daughter.There are any number of themes one can get out of this, but the one that jumps out is the spoiled daughter. My goodness, how does that happen? Is it something the daughter did to become that way, or the way she was raised? It is one thing to want the best for your children, but this is something else.The strangest comment is when the daughter says her mother will always be low class because her parents were low class. First, how did this girl get to be so disrespectful? And second, does that not make her low class if she was the child of someone who is low class?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Six shots fired and a man falls down dead. Shortly thereafter, we meet a desperate Mildred Pierce who walks along the streets of the night. After a policeman prevented her from jumping into the river, she ends up at a bar where an old acquaintance flirts uncontrollably. They go to her house on the beach, from Mildred suddenly quickly departs. It turns out that it was in this house that the man was shot and soon the police on the spot. During interrogation begins the story of what led up to that fateful night. Mildred tells how she differs from her husband, working upward as a business woman and how she is willing to do absolutely everything to their already spoiled daughter Veda.Mildred Pierce literally sparkles. Director Michael Curtiz, probably best known for Casablanca, knows how to get the luxurious feel of a grand noir drama. Elegant small transitions, meticulous and dramatic lighting applications, all in classic Hollywood manner, where nothing is left to chance.The dialog is fabulous. Mildred's right hand Ida is so cool, with the hatching of witty one-liners. Even the ever-swarming Wally Fay is constantly exciting to listen to. The story in itself is exciting, where you always know roughly how it will end, but not why or what role some of the characters will play. The characters are the driving force. It's about Mildred's efforts to give their daughters the life she had wanted, although it also means she does not listen to what they really want. Then there is a former spouse who is living his new life in the periphery, the friend who is helpful, but not without being sure to reap the rewards of Mildred's success and even a new one that might not be what he appears to be.Crawford got a well-deserved Oscar for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mildred Pierce" is a unique film noir in that it features a woman as the main character, but the movie pulls this off very well and stays true to the film genre. Joan Crawford is a good actress who portrays her character very well. She is believable and likable, but at times you just want to shake her for the mistakes she makes. The film uses shadow in a very artful and beautiful way, the way most film noirs do. The script was well written and the dialogue wasn't corny. This movie felt like real life and sucked me in the moment I began watching it. I found myself getting frustrated with some of the characters though as they blindly made the same mistakes over and over again. It's not always your job to make your spoiled brat of child happy. This made them more relatable though and I enjoyed that. The plot was able to keep my attention and made me excited about what was going to happen next. Overall it was a good drama and I'm glad I had the pleasure to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie proved the point that a true film noir film does not need a male character in the lead role and that the mood can be set without following the typical guidelines of the genre. Joan Crawford was brilliant as Mildred Pierce and the audience is able to feel her struggles throughout the film. The story-telling gave the film a special aspect that allowed the film to give the off the mysterious mood that it did. The filmmakers did a fantastic putting this movie together and director Michael Curtiz was able to follow up his movie, Casablanca, with another hit. Joan Crawford's performance rightly won her the Academy Award for best actress and showcased her immense talent as an actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is a classic film noir, and I like the fact that the main character was a female, as were some of the more compelling characters. The acting of Joan Crawford playing the role of Mildred was top notch and Eve Arden almost steals the show for me with her portrayal of Mildred's sassy friend and employee Ida. Ann Blyth playing the role of the bratty, manipulative, unappreciative daughter of Mildred is an awesome performance, diminished only by my not finding the character believable given the ethic and values of her mother Mildred. The use of the flashback and narration to tell the story keeps things moving along briskly and you never know how it is going to end until the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I very much enjoyed the film Mildred Pierce. The film started out with a murder and then the main female character began being questioned by the police, which lead to her flashing back through her past for the majority of the film. I really enjoyed this approach to the movie as it helped add to the mystery of the film and of course the film noir feel of the film as well. It had all of the stereotypical makings of a film noir, except of course that the main character was a woman and not a man. Without giving too much away, I think they did a good job at the mystery aspect of this film with there being multiple possible suspects, with the revealing of the murderer actually surprising me a bit; although maybe it shouldn't have. This movie was by no means one of my favorites, but I would definitely recommend it to someone, especially if they were looking to watch a good film noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film Noirs are very interesting and entertaining to watch for me so I enjoyed watching Mildred Pierce. I thought everything from the lighting to the camera-work, and editing to the acting was fantastic! The movie is about a woman named Mildred Pierce who goes through a divorce and had to raise her children on her own. They open a restaurant to help pay the bills. Mildred had an affair with a man named Monte. Her one daughter, Veda, pretended to be pregnant by a wealthy man so she could get his family's fortune. Veda ended up running away and only came back after her mom promised her that she would return to the luxurious life that she once loved. Mildred married Monte to get money but then something began to develop between Monte and Veda which led Monte to get out of the business with Mildred which left her bankrupt. She then went to kill Monte but when she got there he was with Veda. She ran out shocked and then heard gunshots from the car. Veda had killed Monte. I love film noirs because they are so exciting and you never know what is going to happen.</fullReview>

The film has a great quality to it that can be enjoyed by anyone. This has proved to be one of my favorite films i have seen so far. The different dynamics that really tied into real world pressing issues is a fantastic edition to get the audience interested. The directors use of shadows, lighting, and camera angles really add to the film quality. The darkest times we're really represented in the lighting. The story takes the audience on a world wind of issues that are not so black and white. This is a great film to watch for most audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crawford makes a magnificent Mildred</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We begin with a murder. Monte Beragon is shot dead. Who is Monte Beragon? We'll get to that later. As he dies Monte mutters the name Mildred. That would be Mildred Pierce, who it turns out is married to Monte. He's her second husband, she's now the obvious suspect in his murder. But how did we get here? The movie tells its story in flashback, Mildred narrating all along while in the present day she is being interrogated by the police. And what a twisted tale it is that Mildred Pierce has to tell.The police tell Mildred they're going to pin the murder on her first husband, Bert Pierce. Mildred protests, saying Bert is too kind and gentle to ever do such a thing. But if not him then who? All signs point to Mildred herself so perhaps the lady doth protest too much. We flashback to see why it was that Mildred and Bert separated. Turns out it has to do with their two daughters. Their eldest daughter, Veda, specifically. Bert thinks Mildred spoils Veda and he's right. Mildred would do anything for Veda. Unfortunately Veda does not appreciate her mother's efforts even one tiny little bit. This young woman is in fact spoiled rotten, the biggest brat you'll ever see. Mildred works so hard to provide for Veda yet the girl has absolute disdain for her mother. How dare Mildred lower herself to work as a waitress? Oh the shame of it all! Veda, despite growing up in a decidedly working-class family, possesses the quite delusional belief that she should be an upper-class society girl. She wants money, she wants possessions. But heaven knows she doesn't want to work for any of it. And when her mother puts in the work for her Veda treats her with utter contempt. But Mildred has a blind spot for her daughter, she loves her dearly and she'll do anything for her. Anything.Among the things Mildred would do for her daughter is marry a man she doesn't love. This brings us back to good old Monte Beragon who opened the movie by being shot dead. Monte comes from a wealthy family and lives the life of a playboy. Unfortunately he doesn't actually have any money left. Ironically it is Mildred, who by now operates a successful chain of restaurants, who brings the money to the marriage. Monte brings his family's name and social standing. And that's what Veda wants. But of course everyone does not live happily after. How did we get to the point where Monte finds himself riddled with bullets? It's quite a story. And that story makes for a very compelling movie.The story is fascinating. Mildred Pierce is a terrific character around whom to construct that story. And Joan Crawford is utterly brilliant in playing the role. This is the kind of performance which rightly wins awards and which ultimately defines a career. Crawford shows such great strength. Strength undermined by the weakness Mildred has for her daughter. In playing that miserable young brat Ann Blyth provides a worthy foil for Crawford. Eve Arden also makes a good impression playing a business associate and friend of Mildred's. Her character provides a little levity which comes in handy in this otherwise very dark tale. The men in the picture aren't quite up to the standards of the women. First husband Bert has very little personality, Bruce Bennett turning in a rather bland performance. The ultimately doomed Monte is a much livelier character. Zachary Scott does OK with that role but he's really no match for Crawford, she's much stronger than him throughout. Meanwhile there's Jack Carson who plays Wally Fay, an old business partner of Bert's who carries quite a torch for Mildred. Of all the men in the film it is probably Carson who comes across best. But this film belongs to the women.Crawford and Blyth. Mildred and Veda. It's the women's story and that story has some sharp surprises in store. Things get a little melodramatic at times and perhaps things get dragged out a tiny bit longer than needed. And after so much buildup and suspense the ending feels a bit rushed, not giving you much time to process what it was you just saw. But all in all Mildred Pierce is a very good film, buoyed by a breathtaking performance from one of old-time Hollywood's greatest legends. In this film Joan Crawford is simply marvelous. She makes this film her own and makes it into something quite special. Every once in a while there is a performance which becomes the stuff of Hollywood legend. This is one of those performances. Rightly so.</fullReview>

Beginning as a normal house wife and mother of two, her husband divorces her, even though he's one of the more likable characters in the movie. She soon starts getting money from the restaurant business. Her oldest daughter, however, isn't satisfied. The richer Mildred becomes, the larger her daughter's greed grows. This movie was good.

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce in my opinion is an excellent film. It is considered a classic Noir film. The film was released in 1945 and was directed by Micheal Curtiz and starred Joan Crawford who won an Oscar for her character as Mildred. The film is a kind melodramatic character study. Throughout the film Mildred is constantly doing all she can for her daughter Veda, who is a selfish, ungrateful pain to Mildred. throughout the film Mildred tries to do all she can for Veda but always ends up disappointed with vedas selfishness. The film has a great plot twist that makes for an excellent story. I would give this film an 8/10 for its story, character development, and nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've done a similar review on Casablanca, and in all blunt honesty, Curtiz is amazing at setting trends. This broodingly dark and amazingly well set drama/Murder Mystery is a perfect example of what a Film Noir can be without directly following dead in line with the set guidelines for the genre. It of course follows many conventions, just twisted a bit, instead of an isolated man being stuck in an awful situation alone, it is a woman, the film's name-sake, "Mildred Pierce", forced to make due on her own for her two daughters. It's an amazingly well put together piece, it follows all of the Noir conventions that Curtiz loves to use, such as the very edgy and sharp shadows and lighting. It all serves purpose of course, the movie grows deeper and deeper in plot as the film continues, and you won't find yourself bored at all. An amazing piece I'd watch again if I could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contemptuous behavior, greed, and distasteful motivation; this movie will make you despise them even more than you already did (unless you're one of these people). Mildred Pierce, like Casablanca ends up teaching a valuable principle of human nature and the capacity of an individual to realize the fallacies within their conduct, at least, to me. The surface of the film provides a reliable means for entertainment, romanticizing aspects of murder mystery similar to film noir does. Mildred Pierce borrows heavily from this formula but still deviates from it in minuscule ways, most notably the female protagonist. The film uses this to its advantage, teaching empowerment of the individual, especially through the lens of a woman at the time period, a way in which women weren't perceived too often. Most importantly the film emphasizes the unhealthy dictation in an unconditional-love relationship.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce, directed by Michael Curtiz is known as a "Film Noir" which means black film, or dark movie, and if you have seen this film, the lighting is mostly dark. Sometimes in these kinds of films, you can't even see anything, but you can hear the noises in the background. Mildred Pierce has various flash backs, in fact, most of the movie is a flash back. Michael Curtiz uses a lot of dutch angles in his film showing the camera being tilted, giving the impression to the viewer that the world in the frame is out of balance. Curtiz also used various high and low angle shots of the actors or actresses in this film. He uses close-ups to focus in on some of the objects you should be focused on that will let you know more about what happens in the film. Overall, Mildred Pierce was a great Film Noir and film itself, I like how Curtiz uses all of these specific angles and shots to make sure the viewer understands the movie better.</fullReview>

Although this movie is long, it is eloquently produced, and is a good example of film Noir.

The film continues on, building your relationships with the characters: your love of the mother, the disdain for the daughter and your apprehension towards Monte. The film does an excellent job of wrapping you into the story line, making you wonder what is about to happen next, how much longer can the daughter be so unlikable, is Monte really this sleazy and how does Mildred not realize it, or DOES she and she is just turning a blind eye. And then, BOOM, the twist to end all twists. Obviously you kind of feel as though it is Mildred who was the murderer, but in a crazy Hollywood twist, it was actually the daughter!

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is indeed a textbook film noir and a take off point for crime dramas. It's significance for the genera of early crime dramas is really the ending. Because crime dramas in several cases are intended to replicate actual events or at least tell a realistic story the ending is not always one that can be celebrated. In the end of Mildred Pierce, Mildred's daughter is sent to prison for killing her lover who is also Mildred's husband. Her daughter's confession to the murder and the punishment that will follow is inadvertently Mildred's fault, although the daughter deserves it. In the beginning of the film we learn Mildred's original husband Bert cheated on and left her. Following seeing her daughter confess to murder and taken away by authorities the last scene of the movie features Mildred walking away with her ex-husband, Bert. Presumably this suggest the two will leave their pasts behind and pursue a new life together. A women leaving the past behind and starting a new life with her ex-husband after watching their daughter confess to murdering her mothers current husband who she was having an affair with is in no respect a happy or generic film ending. However, this type of conclusion is the pinnacle of crime dramas. Often in crime dramas, villains (the current husband in this case) will get away, the ideal "good guy" (Mildred Pierce) will face an ambiguous future, and the characters collectively are not better off in a fairly tale like environment where everything worked out. Furthermore, the film as a social significance about the dangerous of trying to make please people, especially loved ones, through the use of money and material possessions. In order to win her daughters approval when Mildred becomes a wealthy restaurant owner she proceeds to buy and give to her daughter ever possession and opportunity she ever wanted. Instead of creating a loving and fruitful relationship this approach instills in the daughter a spoiled greedy attitude and an extreme lack of respect for her mother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was not one of my favorite films. Mildred Pierce is a film noir that follows the events that lead up to a murder. The plot is well done, following a wealthy family that struggles to survive the depression while dealing with inter-family issues. However, I often found that the plot was sometimes difficult to follow due to the style of the film, which reveals most of its plot through flashback. I did enjoy how the film starts with the murder, leaving the viewer guessing through the length of the film at who the criminal was. The film also effectively makes itself a "film noir" by including contrast lighting, dark settings, a crime based plot, and a femme fatale. While this film did not particularly appeal to me, it is still a great example of film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred Pierce (1945)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it doesn't exactly live up to James M. Cain's novel of the same title, Michael Curtiz's noir style 1945 film "Mildred Pierce" still manages to be one of the top noir films of its era. Joan Crawford as Mildred Pierce, a mother who decidedly proves herself to be an independent, successful business woman after her husband leaves her, must face the torment of her horrible, spoiled teenage daughter. With the overwhelming desire to win the love and approval of her daughter (Ann Blyth), Mildred does whatever it takes. Unfortunately for her, nothing she does could ever be good enough for her daughter because she is a spoiled brat with no sense of remorse.Like many noir films, "Mildred Pierce" uses a variety of different filming techniques to provide the viewer with a thrilling, lesson- learning drama that is both interesting and complicated. Lighting for example, was used throughout the film to create a dark, shadowy allusion of impending shady situations. Other than lighting, the use of flashbacks and noir-esque subjects such as criminal situations and some less than healthy relationships helped in making the movie such a success. The important thing to remember about this film is that at the end of it, it is a story about a woman who managed to succeed in life despite a myriad of horrible obstacles constantly getting in her way. At the end of the film, Mildred Pierce has proved to the other characters, and to those viewing the movie, that being a strong, independent woman is something that is important but what's equally as important to know is that people are human, they make mistakes, and they're constantly trying to make the lives of the people they care about better even when those people are horrible human beings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Thriller From Beginning to End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not like any typical film noir, but I feel that it can stand up against most. Michael Curtiz, the director, is fantastic as always. Joan Crawford does an excellent job as the title character, and we can see her transformation from a housewife into a successful business owner, only to be undermined by the very people she cared for the most. The real twist that ties the beginning murder is something special, and it provides one last real shock to the audience at the end when they mystery was solved. I would recommend this film to someone who wanted to see an example of a film noir, but not the typical answer of the Maltese Falcon. This is a more than suitable replacement, and a great watch for anyone interested in crime thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an all around dark film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie that opens with the typical woman working at home in the kitchen is Mildred Pierce. The movie shows the man keeping his wife away from the world and better in his home keeping it the way he wants it. But this movie changes all of that when a divorce is about occur. Mildred is left alone with kids and just about no money. What is a woman of this time to do this time. Well she looks for jobs goes to interviews...but nothing except when she goes to a restaurant to be served she finds work instead. This is the beginning of the entire set of flashbacks for the movie. -Seriously like 90% of the movie is in a flashback just about anything that isn't an opening scene or scene in the police station is flash back. I guess it does add mystery to the whole film.Remember this is film noir, so for most of the film is dark with very low lighting. Some parts of the flashback there is better lighting because it is during the day and in a positive setting. Other than that the film holds the dark feeling as Mildred Pierce fights to keep her restaurant business and stay successful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi, my name is Nick Altomare and recently I watched Mildred pierce in my history of American cinema class at Hudson valley community college. This is a very upsetting but honest movie. Joan Crawford is an amazing actor. She displays many real life qualities and is a great example of an American woman. This film incorporated many elemental parts of an interesting plot and exhibits lighting and the use of flashbacks very well. The film has a very noir fashion. The events take place chronologically and voice over narration is used. It shows how independent and powerful women can be. I enjoyed this movie but it was a little too serious for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Story and Film Noir-(ish)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is not a classic Film Noir; but it is equipped with extensive use of shadows to suggest the darker undertone of the movie. It also has the classic fem-fetal that ends up being the down fall of the main character. However,in this story I would have to say it brings a strange angle to who the fem-fatal can be. It has the down fall of the main character but it is not a male detective as it usually is in a classic Film Noir. For this reason and a few others I do not consider it a classic Film Noir but it is close in that it barrows many aspects from the Film Noir genre of movie making.Beside the aspects of Film Noir the story was decent. It is deceptive in the beginning with many misjudging who the killer is going to be. It also draws the audience in with the character development allowing some to feel attached to the characters throughout the progression of the film.' Overall my last thoughts are that this was a decent film and if you like older almost mystery film it is diffidently worth checking into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bummer of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I basically hated every single person in this movie except for Mildred. Mildred was so strong, and worked so hard to give her daughter everything she could ever want, but she always wanted more. The men in Mildred's life were horrid. They mistreated her and used her. I loved Mildred though. Her strength and ability to survive were so admirable. I came to the ending wishing Mildred would have killed them all, but I am pretty cool with Monte being dead and Veda going to jail. From a movie stand point, this was an excellent film. Great build up to the ending, and a fantastic cast of characters, even if I did hate most of them. There was no happy ending here, as so often there isn't in life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred Pierce, a movie ahead of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce surrounds a strong female lead, which was uncommon for a movie made in the 1940s. This movie grabs its viewers in the first two minutes with a murder. Why and who we don't know yet, but we are already interested and asking these questions. This movie falls under the Film Noir genre, and checks off most if not all of the usual characteristics that a Film Noir has. The alienated lead is none other than Mildred Pierce, majority of Film Noirs have male leads, not to mention that this movie was made int he 1940s when women usually weren't looked at as strong and independent. The female fatale in this movie was Mildred's daughter, Veda, which is also different from most Film Noirs, usually it is the leading mans love interesting that takes on this role. Redemption is also a large element in a Film Noir, and for Mildred Pierce this happens in the end when she if freed from questioning and ultimately freed from her awful daughter Veda, who is finally held accountable for her actions. And lastly the movie is filmed with a dark and angular style, which sets the tone for the movie and gives us hints on how we should feel for whats about to happen. One scene that stuck out to me that used this type of filming was the scene when Wally Fay was locked in Mildred's house, he was frantically running around trying to get out, all the lights were off so there was lost of shadows, making the scene seem even more dark and dangerous. Mildred Pierce was an intriguing movie that kept the audience's attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analysis for Mildred Pierce (1945)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This happens to be one of the darkest films that I have ever seen. In terms of how dark it is, there is a lot of darkness in it, because it is a film noir. I don't like this film as much as the others, because I found out that there were many parts that I shouldn't see after I saw it the first time. The flashbacks led me to doing this. I noticed how sad the scene was when one of Mildred's kids passed away. It got worse from there. The part with Veda and Mildred having harsh words scared me when Veda slapped Mildred in the face. When I saw it, I went, "I can't watch!" However, this doesn't mean that it's really bad. It's good in terms of the acting, the lighting effects, and the flashbacks. I find it one of the greats because of those reasons. Sadly, I also find it one of the worst films that I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released in 1945, Mildred Pierce must of been one of the best movies that year. I was surprised at the great performance of Joan Crawford, as the leading actress. Filmed in black and white, you would not notice the difference from color because the plot pulls the viewer in from the beginning. Mildred really shows how much a mother loves her children, and would do anything to support them and keep them happy. To walk you through the story of the film it had a lot of flashbacks. The flashbacks was one of the tools to allow you to, experience things as they were and relieve things you did not see coming. After seeing this some would cry, some will laugh as they see the betrayal, tragedy and revenge take place. Over all great no wonder Joan Crawford won an Oscar for this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Audiences seem to have been taken in by the sentimental story of a mother who would do anything for her daughter. The title character faces hardship and loss like one might expect in a melodrama, including the tragedy of having a young child conveniently die of pneumonia so that Joan Crawford may be afforded a four-star hankie moment. But it is neither this setback nor her troubled marriage that generates as much sympathy as the relationship she has with an ungrateful older daughter, played by Ann Blyth. In fact, Miss Blyth is so good at causing problems and keeping our attention, that the picture could just as easily have been called Veda Pierce.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Closer Look at Two Social Themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to recap the plot nor echo consensus points from the 200-odd other reviews.What makes this movie notable is not just the fine acting and colorful characters, which are present in spades. What I admire is how the script also manages to work in social themes that are both daring and ahead of their time. Namely, as Mildred climbs the ladder out of housewifely boredom, she has to confront not just a greedy, designing daughter, an unfaithful husband, plus a sleazy family friend, but, given her new status, she must now also confront the twin challenges of independent women and social class. The screenplay's feminist theme may be soft-pedaled but is meaningfully present. That is, in order to establish her restaurant chain, Mildred has to navigate her way through the man's world of business. It's a testament to performer Crawford's bold side that's she's able to act out dealing with men as business equals in the convincing manner she does. Themes dealing with a woman's place in the business world were not exactly common in Hollywood of the time. But then, neither had been women as riveters and blue-collar workers. But working women became common in 1945 because of the war, so why not women as entrepreneurs. In that important sense, the movie is part of a groundbreaking wave brought about by changing social conditions.But even as a successful business woman, Mildred has to endure the prejudices of social class. After all, it is a string of hash houses that she runs. So when Veda marries into old money, the matriarch Mrs. Forrester comes around to let Mildred know that pedigree is more important than a successful rise from the lower classes. So, no matter what Mildred may accomplish, it will never be good enough. It's easy to see grasping little Veda as a Mrs. Forrester in the making, only much more ruthless.On a slightly different level, Monte represents 'old money' gone to seed. He lives in a big empty mansion, where by his own words, he's perfected the art of loafing. He's now perfectly content to live off the money Mildred gives him under the pretense that it's only a loan. After seducing Mildred, he takes up in secret with Vida. What he can provide directly to Vida and indirectly to Mildred are the refinements, tastes, and etiquette of the upper class to which Vida aspires. Part of Mildred's appeal as a person is her general indifference toward social status. However, she remains vulnerable through Vida's selfish aspirations. Of course, themes concerning social class were much more common at the time than feminist ones. Nonetheless, Mildred's status is powerfully conveyed, such that whatever her personal failings, which are many, her guts, brains, and composure are admirable at any social level. She may be 'new money' but at least she's earned it. Oddly, however, none of the major characters in the movie is without serious flaw, which makes this an unusual movie from an audience standpoint. Mildred, of course, comes closest, but her blind attachment to Vida despite the girl's clear contempt for 'waitresses' of any sort amounts to a key flaw in her judgment. There're also those key early scenes where Mildred appears to have a clear hand in the break-up of her marriage, which may or may not be a character flaw given the abilities she later proves to have but are being frustrated at the housewifely level.All in all, I guess my only complaint with the movie lies with that very last 'heavenly' scene that's way over the top. Otherwise the production is pretty well modulated, given the many melodramatic temptations.In sum, the production manages to weave its many complex aspects into a surprisingly coherent whole, which aside from Crawford's award winning performance is a big reason why the film has remained so popular, even some 60-years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Mother's Undying Devotion To Her Daughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1945 - This "rags-to-riches" Joan Crawford vehicle is a classy Chick Flick (about a mother who goes to the greatest lengths to satisfy her snotty, self-centered, teen-aged daughter). It certainly packs a considerable-sized bite when it comes to its dramatic story-telling.Tears. Joy. Tragedy. Betrayal. Revenge.Mildred Pierce's well-crafted story immediately pulls the viewer into its tangled web of deceit and double-crosses. And it retains that compelling grip right through to its final, climatic twist-ending.Told mainly in flashbacks (with voice-over narration by Joan Crawford), Mildred Pierce's story tells the tale of a devoted mother and house-wife, who, after divorcing her two-timing husband, proves that she can become independent and successful in the world of business. But through all of her toil and trouble she cannot win the approval of her spoiled-rotten daughter.Filmed in b&amp;w, Mildred Pierce features a really first-rate cast headlined by Jack Carson, Ann Blyth and Bruce Bennett.Joan Crawford's performance (playing the title character) won her an Oscar for "Best Actress".This picture was adapted from the novel of the same name written by James Cain whose other notable works include - Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denial and sacrifice as the two pillars of maternal love ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today is Mother's Day, the worldwide celebration of the most unshakable and universal of all the love-related feelings, something reconciling both nature and culture, something called maternal instinct, and that, from our human perspective, we can define as a mixture of irrational love, self-sacrifice and visceral attachment for the best or the worst. And it's more often the worst that draws the line between paternal and maternal love. Indeed, if a boy commits a crime, the father might turn his back while the mother would still believe her son is misunderstood, that society spoiled him or that she's the one to blame. In a world lead by mothers, the notion of fault would always be denied. Because that's what mothers are meant to: taking all the blame for us, asking nothing in return except a share of love, respect and recognition, and even sometimes, love is enough. "Mildred Pierce" is a story that pays tribute to this sense of denial and sacrifice that governs most mothers' actions. And although it was unintentional, it's a nice coincidence to review this particular film on this occasion. Adapted from John M. Cain's novel, the movie opens with a murder in the great noir tradition; a rich playboy is shot and utters "Mildred" ?dying words we suspect to be misleading. Mildred Pierce walks on the Santa Monica bay, her heart filled with a sort of 'what have I done?' guilt, but deeper and subtler, a something anchored deep down in her soul. Joan Crawford pushes the expressiveness of her eyes to highlight the bitterness and lassitude of a woman who did the best she could but failed. The irony is that the cause of her troubles was the very driver of every decision she took: Veda Pierce, played by Ann Blyth, the most memorable bitch ever to grace the silver screen after Eve Baxter, and Mildred's daughter. Paraphrasing a famous Bette Davis' movie, "Mildred Pierce" could be retitled "All About Veda".One of the most cynical delights of "Mildred Pierce" is the confrontation between two diametrically opposed characters, linked by the most sacred bond. Joan Crawford starts as the typical courageous mother who must satisfy the needs of her two daughters, much more Veda with Ve- like in venal and venomous. After her divorce, she has no other choice than working harder to pay Veda's piano lessons and fulfill all her capricious needs. When her younger daughter dies from pneumonia, Veda becomes the center of Mildred's universe. She uses her waitress-job to exorcise her demons and finally, the pay-off comes when, with the help of Wally, the jovial and debonair associate played by Jack Carson, she opens her own restaurant, the first of a successful chain. In the process, she meets her soon-to-be- husband, Monte Baragan, the suave gentleman who's shot in the opening scene.The business works, she hires her former boss, the sarcastic and wisecracking Ida, played by Eve Arden (the film shines thanks to its solid acting ensemble). But no matter how hard she tries, whatever she buys to the ungrateful Veda is never enough to buy her respect or satisfy her gold digging. The truth is that Veda despises her mother for being a waitress, from filling the house with cheap furniture; she has contempt for her background, and can't only count on Monte's help and some devious schemes like pretending to be pregnant to obtain a financial settlement from a marriage. Veda's ambitions have no limits, and the conflict with her mother almost reaches a no-return point with a slap that doesn't come from the expected person. "Mildred Pierce" is not just a mother vs. daughter chronicles, it's an interesting take on modern material such as arranged marriages, divorces, teen sex and women's independence, with an exquisitely dark screenplay that probably swept off some unnecessary parts from the original novel, while the clever direction from Michael Curtiz and the shadowy cinematography provided the perfect film-noir atmosphere. The film is renowned for featuring Joan Crawford's signature role, earning her the Oscar for Best Actress after she was fired from MGM, but although I was sensible to the poignancy of her role, I thought she was so melodramatic at times that Ann Blyth, could easily steal her thunder by remaining so horribly phlegmatic.A great villain always makes a film, the more you hate him or her, the most chances you have to appreciate the film, and "Mildred Pierce" is no exception. Veda is so openly venal, so straightforward and honest in her dishonesty that we're tempted to transfer part of the guilt on her mother. In fact, from the beginning, we know the worst is to come and Mildred's education is obviously responsible for the disaster awaiting them. Maybe that was the very guilt Mildred felt in her first scene, the main problem with maternal bond, it can never lead to hate or contempt, if it's not pride, it's guilt. Veda is the illustration of motherhood as a double-edged sword.But maybe I'm being unfair with Joan Crawford who carries the emotional force of the film, her performance is pivotal and efficient, and I think her personal background has something to do with the energy she put in the film. Joan Crawford is notorious for having had one deep regret in her life: never having children on her own, and it's only fitting that she played one of the most inspirational mother of Cinema's history, and fuel the film with this frustration that tormented her for the rest of her life, and that planted the seeds of her behavior with her adoptive children. I guess Mildred Pierce is a figure to admire, but the right maternal attitude would be somewhere between "Mildred Pierce" and "Mommie Dearest". Indeed, when it becomes excessive, maternal love can become as potentially dangerous as love, but who am I to judge? (this review is dedicated to my mother and my soon-to-be-mother wife)</fullReview>

I personally was not familiar with film noir, and this was a great example for me to watch. The use of hash lights, darks and shadows made the film mysterious and set the entire mood. The film noir just added to the great storyline of the film, the characters definitely portrayed the personalities they were trying to come across. Veda did a great job acting here part although you just wanted to slap her at times for her selfishness to her mother that tried to get her everything she wanted. Michael Curtiz is a great director when it comes to film noir, I feel he knows exactly when to use lights and darks to make the scene complete. Overall Mildred Pierce is definitely a movie to watch!

It tells the story of a woman, Mildred Pierce (Joan Crawford) and the struggle she undergoes when she discovers her husband is cheating on her. She asks for a divorce and for the job of their daughters: Veda (Ann Blyth) and Kay (Jo Ann Marlowe), a job her husband doesn't want anyways claiming that Mildred has ruined Veda by spoiling her rotten. Mildred opens up a restaurant and works very hard to give her daughters everything the could possibly want, but Veda appreciates none of it. She tells her mother that it's embarrassing that she owns a restaurant and then pretends to be pregnant with a man's baby to trick his family into giving her $10,000. Upon her discovery of this, Mildred rips up the check and kicks Veda out what I wish would have been for good. Veda manipulates her mother right up until the very end. And even when Mildred is willing to cover up for something so terribly awful, Veda still is ungrateful and ready to tell her mother just how little she thinks of her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crawford earns her Best Actress award</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is a 1945 drama directed by Michael Curtiz and stars Joan Crawford as the title character. The story opens with Monte Beragon, Mildred's second husband (Zachary Scott), being shot dead in his beach house, and Mildred then running away from the home. Mildred is then interviewed at the local police station, and the film represents a flash back of Mildred's life from her first divorce to the murder. Mildred is initially devastated by her first husband's affair with a local woman, but decides to proceed with the divorce. Having been a housewife during her marriage with no work experience, Mildred opts to enter the work force so that she can provide for her two daughters. At this point in the film, the story focuses on Mildred's efforts to succeed financially and shower her daughters with all the amenities they desire. Consequently, a conflict with her with eldest daughter, Veda (Ann Blyth)?she becomes spoiled with the trappings of wealth and constantly fights with Mildred. The struggles eventually lead to consequences for Mildred, and end with the death of her husband.This is an early Joan Crawford movie showing her acting range, and leading to an Academy Award for Best Actress. At a time when few women were successful in business ventures, Crawford was well cast in this movie to provide a strong-willed character that was determined to succeed. The movie runs 111 minutes, and uses voice-over narration to provide the audience with the story leading to the opening scene murder. A minor surprise to the audience is the identity of the murderer, disclosed in the last scenes of the movie.</fullReview>

The characters in the film, made the plot better as far as what they were meant to do. The way that the camera and angles were set made the Noir come to life; with the extremely dark shadows, and silhouettes, the music, and the lighting on certain characters when it was their time to shine.

		<shortDescription>Great, Suspenseful Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was really great! I was able to follow it through it's twists and flashbacks. The main characters were distinct and memorable. They all seemed to have their own quirks. Ann Blyth's character Veda was really something, I'm not sure I could watch another movie with her in it and not compare it to this role. I had guesses as to where the plot was going to go, but then I'd find out I was wrong. I kept being surprised, which kept my attention. I think I just really liked how the story wasn't typical or what I had anticipated. It had some elements of noir, but not very much. I believe it was the very beginning and end of the film where it became stylized in that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred Pierce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie to a certain extent. I thought it had a good plot, but the one daughter, Vida, made me so angry! She was so selfish and conceited. Her mother, Mildred, did so much for her, and it ultimately cost her her marriage. But Vida never appreciated it and always made her mother feel like she wasn't doing enough for her. Her mother even is willing to take the fall for a murder wrap for her! I suppose thats what makes a good film though, if it evokes emotion in its viewers. The film as a whole is done beautifully though, from the cinematography, to the editing. This would also be considered a film noir. There are some great moments of low-key lighting that really help play up the dramatic feel of some scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred Pierce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a bleak film that depressed me more than anything. The atmosphere was well constructed though because it's one of the few Noir's which contain a darkness in them that's capable of flowing out of the screen and into your living room. The melodramatic heartbreaking story and the way it's told and the acting helped to bring that in a nice package. I assume if there's quality soap operas out there somewhere even though I've never seen one this is what they'd look like. The daughter and Monte were extremely repulsive characters, I felt sorry for Mildred as she kept staring at the camera with that near-cry look. Made you feel like looking out after her and showing her that good people exist. It sure as hell wasn't a film with what I'd consider a happy ending or anything remotely similar to it, in fact it kind of reminded me of Tarantino's Jackie Brown which kind of left you hurt and empty too. I won't give it out but I feel like for Hollywood especially right after World War 2 this was a step in a new direction, I don't know why they made something like this and whether or not it was popular at the time but it's very depressing even for today's standards which actually haven't really changed have they?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything about this movie is beautiful. The movement of the camera, the shadowing and lighting, the composition; it's all beautiful. I simply cannot find another word to describe it. Joan Crawford was a very talented woman, there was never a dull moment when she was on screen. She gave a very cruel, sort of evil beauty that not many other women can deliver. The story itself was very captivating. We become very caught up in the characters lives, and wind up shocked when the daughter unknowingly confesses to the police. Overall - very well made movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Ernest Haller should receive a lot more recognition for his cinematography. He simply knew how to work a camera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A twist on film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to most film noir movies "Mildred Pierce" features a female leading role in lieu of the standard smooth tough-guy character found in most other films in this genre. Call it being spoiled by the variety of plot twists found in todays movies but the plot of this film and the intentionally misleading aspect of the police investigation was made painfully obvious early on. This is no fault of the movie itself though, it is simply due to the fact that the style of the "unsuspected murderer" has been done over and over since. This movie is only of note because it was one of the earlier works. The movie does, however, shine in terms of execution and camera-work. The acting was tremendous especially in the form of Veda (Blyth) who really captured the entitled, snobby demeanor of the upper crust of society. Overall, any fan of film noir will find this up to par with others of the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was phenomenal it was entertaining right up to the very end. The older daughters feelings towards the mom is weird because she wasn't raised in a high class society so to feel that she is entitled to the is weird, yes the mom spoiled her but not to the extent that she has to act stuck up. It's odd how the marital system was as to why mildred couldn't just get a divorce when she wanted to but I guess its a good thing that she didn't because they got to maintain a relationship in the end. It was sad what happened to the younger daughter it was a devastating part of the movie. The ending of the movie was not expected it was a shocker because the actual killer is someone that you actually don't like because of their attitude, if you haven't seen this movie as of yet go and see it now</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool, unique film-noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce, 1945 Mildred Pierce is a cool, unique film noir. The reason I say it's unique is because our typical, noir protagonist is a female character. Joan Crawford plays a great role as "Mildred Pierce," a hardworking pie baker turned successful restaurateur, and Ann Blyth steals the show as Mildred's nasty, greedy daughter.The film is filled with illustrious sets, brilliant lighting, and those deep dark shadows that give film noirs that amazing feel. The acting is on point. All the main characters really play significant roles in the film and many show additional complexity and progression as the movie goes on.A downfall to the film for me was the lengthy flashbacks. It was crafted really well and the flashbacks really do tell the story, but it felt like some of the scenes were overdone or drawn out too long. All in all, it's a great film noir. See it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of a hard-working mother's continual desire to be approved by her unappreciative, spoiled daughter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like how the the film started with the scene where Beragon falls to his death and utters Mildred's name as his last words. It sets the scene and makes the viewer wonder 1. who his killer was and 2. who Mildred is.The film goes from there to show flashbacks of Mildred's interesting life. It was different to see the main character as a hard-working mother as opposed to the other films I've seen from this time period in which the men were the main bread winners and the women were housewives. Mildred's daughter, Veda is an unappreciative young girl who desires material things that are out of her mother's financial reach. Mildred continually tries to please her daughter, but Veda can't look past her mother's common background. This is a moral lesson of unconditional family love and love for materialistic belongings. In the end Mildred finally gets a backbone and stands up against her brat of a daughter. It serves as a sort of justice for the hard-working Mildred.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of Joan Crawford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce probably can be considered Joan Crawford's best work. A drama set back in the black and white Hollywood genre era of 1949 is well directed, and a polished drama. The acting is excellent and the characters are slick with sophistication.Mildred is an ordinary haus frau with a lot of energy that she puts in her home catering business and running an efficient but small house. The blights in her life seem to be her love life. Her husband is busy with extra martial affairs which eventually lead to a divorce. Her eldest daughter, Veda seems to be conceited and snobbish, her only concern is climbing the social ladder for money. Her youngest daughter, Kay is a sweet playful tomboy, who unfortunately Mildred losses thru tragic circumstances. Desperate to hold on to Veda and to better her life financially from her ex husband, Mildred throws all her time and energy into the restaurant business. For awhile, things are happy until she meets spoiled, rich playboy, Monte Beragan. Monte charms Mildred as well as her daughter, Veda. But Monte in time goes back to his old gigolo ways and Veda gets more spoiled and snobbish. Can Mildred find martial happiness with Monte and domestic family bliss with her daughter? Or will it lead to tragedy and murder? Look for another fine actress, Eve Arden, who plays the wise cracking friend for Mildred. Again, a classic black and white masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fatale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Serving as my first conscious-viewing of a "film noir," Mildred Pierce is certainly a fantastic introduction to the genre. The movie contains all of the decided characteristics of a film noir, such as severely low-key lighting, a wicked femme fatale, and the notions of the prevalence of good and downfall of evil. I had high expectations of the film, being that it was directed by Michael Curtiz and Casablanca is among my favorite films, and Mildred Pierce pretty much met those expectations. The film employs really nice bits of mise-en-scene, such as the use of clouds of cigarette smoke to signify the thickness and tension of a given situation. Also, the editing and storytelling complement each other nicely, implementing flashbacks to provide information. Lastly, the acting was above average in Mildred Pierce. I found myself connecting to the characters in various ways: empathizing with Mildred and cursing Veda.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was such a good example of what a good, film noir movie should be. I'm not a big fan of Joan Crawford, but this part was perfect for her not so varied acting talents. Ernest Haller was a phenomenal cinematographer. My favorite scene that exemplifies his talents is when Mildred is wearing a mink, and shes wielding a gun, and Mildred comes upon Monte and Vida kissing. It's such a remarkably dramatic scene and it's one of those shots that will stick in my head forever. He darkens everyones profiles so it gives the scene an extra film noir dimension. It's such a phenomenal scene that really just sets the whole movie for me. Michael Curtiz does a wonderful job of keeping the movie balances. There isn't many boring shots and the whole movie just keeps you interested in what happens to Mildred.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film made by Michael Curtiz, this movie focuses on the murder of a man and the main female role is being questioned about it. As much as I want to describe the events of the movie, I would like to discuss the things about the movie that were spectacular. This film shows the relation between a hardworking mother and her selfish daughter very well and even explains how this relation exist as the daughter deserves only the best and that she doesn't need to work hard for it. The movie also shows how Mildred Pierce does her best to aim for the top as she climbs the ladder of success. This movie is very good for a Noir film and deserves its place in the hearts of many. It's just that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really was quite different from the usual movies you would see during this time. For one thing having Mildred pierce going from house wife to successful business women was not like the usual role of women. Though they made sure that there was the spoiled rich girl (mildred's daughter) who used her mothers love for her to her advantage. she would manipulate her mother into giving her money and even manipulated her step father against her mother till she shot him. Now for the filming itself, they did an excellent job! the movie was told in all flash backs as Mildred is telling police who killed her husband. they used a lot of night scenes and dark rooms like clubs and bars. the editing was mostly fade into besides when there were more serious scenes then it was jump cuts. over all I thought the movie was good had a lot of twists and turns to keep you guessing and just when you knew who the killer was something made you change your mind!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce (1945) is a scandalous mystery that constantly has its audience on the edge of their seats. This post-war flick is directed by Michael Curitz and stars Joan Crawford and Jackson Carson. Joan Crawford plays an exceptionally great role, and creates a strong bond between her character (Mildred Pierce) and the audience. The tragic death of her daughter Kay and the promiscuity of her daughter, Veda, grabs the audience and doesn't let go. Veda spirals into progressively worse behavior and as the story plays out, the audience just wants her dead! The ending of the film is shocking and relentless. The movie has many things in common with the famous film Casablanca, which isn't a surprise because they have the same director. All in all, Mildred Pierce is a must see murder mystery!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flash of Mildred</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For starters I really enjoyed the fact that like Citizen Kane, Mildred Pierce is told in flashbacks. As the introduction begins with Mildred being interrogated in a police station after a mysterious murder. This is an excellent way to catch the audiences attention right in the beginning of the film. For some reason I immediately felt curiosity to what was going on in the film. I also enjoyed how this film was put in perspective of a working mother. You see Mildred working hard her entire life just to ensure that her daughter does not go through the struggles she did as a child. Ironically this eventually leads to a spoiled daughter who takes everything for granted and has no respect for her family (until later on in the film). In my opinion this idea of a family struggle is one seen very often even today. That just goes to prove that a movie from the mid nineteen forties can still be related to life today, the future of the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Using long and involved flashbacks, "Mildred Pierce" is a cautionary tale of parental overindulgence. Curtiz uses the high drama of black and white exceptionally, especially in the scene where Mildred comes upon Veda and Monte at the beach house; their faces coming from darkness into light is superb.Just about everything was very well done in this movie ? the acting, the lighting, the camera work, the props; the only small criticism I have was the ease of determining the killer's identity. Perhaps the twists provided by the plot were new enough to audiences in 1945 to provide some surprise, but even if not, the movie easily stands on it other merits as a superlative example of the golden age of the Hollywood studio era.</fullReview>

This movie also gave off a lot of emotions because of her selfish ungrateful daughter. It made me upset to see at young, her daughter despised her mother because of the job she had and to know her mother tried to give her what she wanted when they didn't have anything. In all this was a pretty good film noir movie, it had drama, suspense and romance. It was well put and said in chronological order in unraveling the death of the man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was a good mystery film. It had a strong plot that included a "who done it" mystery that kept you guessing as to who the actual killer was. Its first shot starts off with someone getting killed, and from then on the viewer is wondering who did it, and why. The story was filled with drama and suspense and seemed to be a good example of film noir with its dark scenes, subject matter, and tone. I also think it did a good job of showing how dysfunctional Mildred Pierce's family was and what a brat Veda was. This conflict added to the overall tension in the film. In addition to a strong plot, the film had excellent acting, especially Joan Crawford as Mildred Pierce and Ann Blythe as Veda, her daughter. Joan Crawford is believable as the hardworking and decent Mildred who dotes on Veda and struggles to make it as an independent woman. Ann Blythe does an equally credible job as Veda, who is nasty, conniving, and money hungry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mildred Pierce" is one of my favorite Film Noir Melodramas. Joan Crawford as the self sacrificing but indulgent mother is wonderful to watch. Not only is she beautiful to watch but she shows such depth of emotion and vulnerability as she tries to provide the best for her spoiled and narcissistic older daughter, Veda. Veda,the master manipulator, somehow thinks she belongs in high society even though she is middle class and is ashamed of her mother. This is a movie that starts from the end and works forward to the beginning to reveal the mystery. I love the way Michael Curtiz directed this movie. He gives us a great story, wonderful and interesting characters, great dialogue, and some great comic relief. Eve Arden and Butterfly Mc Queen are funny with their one liners while Jack Carson is annoying and Zachary Scott is kind of weaselly as the evil, narcissistic aristocrat. This is a movie I never get tired of no matter how many times I watch it. The part of Mildred was originally written for Bette Davis but she turned it down and then Joan Crawford took it and gained the Academy Award. also, i like the non-linear time line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mildred Pierce" hits you hard with an unbearable look into the life of one woman who, after years of stress and disorder, is left only an empty shell. For a film noir that waded into the soap opera genre, it's certainly not bad. Lighting and story seems fluent to the image of film noir, and that characters were easy to recognize and easy to figure out what they're capable of. It's the plot that really hits me. A story about a parent struggling to give anything and everything to their child seems alright, but it works at a more interesting take when the child becomes what the parent never comprehends. All the title character wanted to do was live an easy life, but when your child believes that "want" surpasses "need," it becomes a gross display of misfortune and distress. Some of the characters come off as dangerously close to flat, but they always have something on their minds that can seriously affect the title character, either positively or negatively.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my first film Noirs that I know of watching. I have heard of film noir, but never really paid any attention to it. Mildred Pierce directed by Michael Curtiz was a funny and dark film. I found it to be intriguing in the fact that I was always wondering who committed the crime? who murdered Monte. I could not stand the daughter character (Veda). I was almost outraged with the greedy, social climber of a girl. I found her annoying and dramatic. I felt like I was getting more upset than the other characters in the film. I did enjoy some parts of the film though; I particularly found the character named Wally to be most hysterical. I liked his loud sense of humor even when the scene itself was not a laughing matter. I also like the character Mildred. She was a hard working woman and I commend her for that. One of my other favorite scenes was when they take Mildred to see Veda. She is a performer and has no real money? I think it can be referred to as karma, but of coarse the mother Mildred takes her back in. I also enjoyed the use of flash backs to present time. It was easy to follow and the film itself had a life of its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is a rare film noir with a woman as the star of the film. Joan Crawford's exceptional performance as the title character, Mildred Pierce, shows why the film was willing to go against the grain. Crawford's ability to act with a great range of emotion was the strength of this film. She is at various points vulnerable, strong, stern, ruthless, determined, warm, funny, and lovable. Crawford's performance was the best, and most recognized of her long, successful career. Ann Blythe also turned in a strong performance as Pierce's daughter Veda. Blythe was the embodiment of an innocent looking beauty with a heart of stone. The film was true to the film noir style, and fairly formulaic, but it was highly enjoyable all the same. The men in the film were sharp, and the women, specifically Crawford, made this a movie that should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, this film is, as my title states, very dark. This was my first opportunity to view a film noir style of movie, and I was very pleased. The excellent cinematography, with its use of lighting and contrasting shadows, set up the ominous tones of many of the more important scenes. It also helps to add to the films polished feel and adds in no small way to the overall verisimilitude. In addition, the plot of the film is especially well-done. By showing the murder at the outset of the film ,it leaves the viewer to sit on the edge of his or her seat throughout the film's entirety, just begging to know what happened. In my opinion, very few films have that kind of power or ability to grab an audience and keep them there. Onto the acting. First rate all the way. As a viewer, I felt for the characters, especially Joan Crawford. However, each of the actors did a superb job of truly getting into the mindset of their character and bringing them to life on the screen. It is easy to see why this film has stood the test of time the way it has. Finally, I truly enjoyed the, for lack of a better word, gritty feel of the film. While the film is obviously well done, and has a very polishes look, the "feel" of it, or more to the point, the dark aura surrounding the characters as they went through the story. I would highly recommend this film to others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this film a lot. It is very interesting because a large majority is told between two very long flashbacks layered between three sections of real time plot. Mildred (Joan Crawford) leaves her cheating husband and sets out to provide a better life for her daughters. Money also comes into the equation as to why Mildred kicks her husband out (he loses his job and can no longer provide an "acceptable" life for the family), in addition to his infidelity, and this becomes a major theme throughout. Bert Pierce, Mildred's husband, sees his wife's desire to spoil their children with material goods, thinking it will bring them happiness, and he expresses his displeasure with that notion. The eldest child, Veda, buys into this idea very much, and this only hastens Mr. Pierce's desire to leave.As Mildred begins to thrive on her own in the restaurant business, she begins spoiling the children via lavish spending on entertainment and toys, only making Veda's expensive taste and already large ego expand further. At one point Veda disgustfully rejects an expensive dress her mother scrounged up money to buy, and it is here that we start to see her true character. Shortly thereafter, Mildred's younger daughter, Kay, becomes sick with pneumonia and eventually succumbs to it. Kay is the innocent one who genuinely cared when her father left, opposed to Veda who was concerned that the family would no longer be able to afford a lavish lifestyle. Kay is seen as the virtuous one and the viewer sympathizes with her.Eventually Veda becomes so taken with her "high class" life that it consumes her. She slowly moves in on her mother's new boyfriend and sleeps with him behind Mildred's back. When Mildred walks in on the two kissing she confronts them. Veda states that Monte, the man in the middle of this, will leave Mildred and marry her. Upon hearing this statement, Monte claims that he never intended on marrying Veda because she is a "Spoiled tramp". Veda becomes hysterical and ends up shooting down Monte. Veda goes to prison and Mildred's name is cleared.The whole clash between Veda and Mildred really drives the movie along and is a source of great suspense and entertainment. Veda is such an extremely hate-able character because of her disregard of anything that is not deemed good enough for her. I believe that there is an underlying message in the movie: money does not buy happiness. We see Veda's downward spiral fueled by her greed and selfishness, and in the end Mildred, the protagonist, work through her troubles and come out on top in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The elusive search for happiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mysterious beginning of Mildred Pierce sets the stage for a thoroughly entrancing and visually appealing masterpiece. The film's opening of a man being shot in a lavish living room is made all the more suspenseful because we do not know why it happened, or who did it. A few scenes later when Mildred's friend searches the same now forbidding seeming house (made so by the angles with which it is filmed and overbearing silence- but for her friend's voice calling out as he seeks her) only intensifies the suspense.As the story is told in flashbacks, the audience sees firsthand Mildred's beginnings as an average housewife, but through hard work becomes successful, shedding her aprons for fur coats and along the way cultivating a very femme-fatal appearance and attitude. Happiness however does not come with the wealth she accrues, and the constant belittlement by her tyrannical daughter leaves her a shell of a person. Though the ending of the movie reveals that Mildred is not the murderer, there is again little happiness and in the true "film noir" way we see that Mildred's guilt over raising such a monster will never disappear, and the innocence of her former life (once as a happy wife and mother) will never be reached again.</fullReview>

I am not a huge fan of Joan Crawford because I am not that familiar with her work. Well, she gained a new fan once this film had ended. She is incredible in this role, and what a deviant role it was. Ernest Haller does some amazing cinematography that really sets the tone of the film. I recently had learned of how the "noir" films came to be and found that really interesting while watching this film. Jack Carson was fun to watch. His comic relief worked every time. The story has many twists and turns and leaves you wanting more each time a corner is turned. Knowing of Crawford's own history with her daughter floated around in my mind while watching this. The dynamics between the on screen relationships between mother and daughter are frightening and makes you wonder. See this...great story, great acting, I will watch it again soon..l</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throughout the movie, both characters had its ups and downs trying to win each other and/or try to make a better living for themselves. Most of the story has nothing to do with crime, and is instead about the efforts of Crawford's character to better herself. in an effort to be successful, she starts a popular restaurant so she can remain in the good graces of her relentlessly snobbish daughter. Mildred Pierce is a classic flashback film noir mixed with typical soap-operish elements of the woman's picture or as they call "weeper," including a strand of a typical murder mystery often told by flashback. when a story is often told with a flashback, you might have to consider paying close attention to every little detail so that the piece fit with no complications.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That I Really Liked... 'Mildred Pierce'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclaimer: English is not my native languageA damsel of her time, Joan Crawford, who also won the Oscar for Best Actress for this film, plays the titular Mildred Pierce. In the opening scene a man is shot 4 times and he utters his last word: "Mildred". In the next scene Mildred is seen trying to kill herself by jumping off the bridge, until a police officer interrupts and shoos her away. Later she is summoned by the police and told that her husband is dead. And the killer is already behind the bars. She sees the killer, but couldn't believe *he* could have done that. The police ask her why and her explanation takes the audience into the flashback. We then come to know that although Mildred is a housewife and her husband doesn't earn much, she wants her two daughters, especially the older one, Veda, to get everything and anything she wants in her life. Mildred's husband is already is in love with another woman and hence leaves the house at a time when the debts on the family have increased considerably.From that point on, Mildred takes a solemn vow to take the responsibility for her daughters and the story kicks on.In short, this story is kind of a kaleidoscope on the American culture, its darker side where nothing appears to be a fairy-tale. Although Mildred Pierce is the protagonist of the film, the high-octane performance is delivered by her daughter, Veda, played by then 17 year old Ann Blyth. When you see her performance, certain words like "evil" and "despicable" will automatically come into your mind. At some time, even these words will look minuscule in front of her. She is everything which you do not wish should be in a girl.After going well into the first half hour of the film, I wasn't interested who the killer was anymore. I was interested in what would be the fate of the characters involved.I also like the film for its quick witted and memorable quotes which will remain in my mind for a long time.This film is directed by Michael Curtiz. Although he is best known for his magnum opus "Casablanca", "Mildred Pierce" is, arguably, better directed film where every character in the film delivered their best performances till date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I write this, I am watching Mildred Pierce on AMC. Few reviewers here indicate that they have read the novel. Not surprising. I myself have seen many novel-based films without reading the original. What surprises me is that no reviwer has noted that the novel involves NO murder whatsoever. This is hardly a spoiler, since the murder is revealed in the opening scene of the movie.By the late thirties, Cain had "graduated" from crime stories to more ambitious novels about gay opera singers (Serenade) and frumpy housewives striving to transcend failed marriages and hobbled by ungrateful offspring (MP). Like Mildred herself, Cain's reach exceeded his grasp. And like Hammett and Chandler, he never again equaled his early work.Mildred Pierce is an interesting novel--almost a satire of middle class California strivers--but not one obviously suited to the cinema. It would have taken Orson Welles at his "Ambersons" height to make a faithful and compelling adaptation of Mildred Pierce as written by Cain.Credit producer Jerry Wald with understanding that movie-goers expected a murder in a Cain story and would leave the theater disappointed if the film proved to be only a well-crafted melodrama. Wald and screenwriter Ranald MacDougal brilliantly created a cinematic Oreo that sandwiches a squishy center that roughly follows the novel between two crisp, dark cookies of violence and betrayal. This gave the movie the dark sensibility that the audience had come to expect from a Cain film.As others have noted, Mildred is far more noble in the film than in the book. In the latter, she is, business success notwithstanding, the frumpy mediocrity that Veda judges her to be. To his credit, Cain is brutal to Mildred (and to every other character) on this score. In the end, this diminishes the impact of her downfall on the reader. The novel remains interesting mostly as a commentary on depression-era California, a promised land without the promise.The movie is in many ways better than the novel. It moves more fluidly and has an effective payoff that the novel lacks. Crawford, Blyth, Arden and Carson are all excellent in their roles, with special kudos to the latter two. It is true that the male leads, Scott and Bennett, are fairly wooden, but so are their characters in the novel itself. It is hard to see how either could pique, much less hold, the interest of a Mildred as dynamic as Crawford's. A flaw to be sure, but not fatal.In the end, Mildred Pierce works better as a film than as a novel, in no small part because it is less ambitious. By abandoning the larger undercurrents of the novel, the film is free to exploit the simple cinematic elements that make it so effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another gripping Hollywood adaptation of a James M Cain story, "Mildred Pierce" takes Joan Crawford on a real roller-coaster of a trip in which she tries everything to earn the respect and love, perhaps not in that order, of errant daughter Veda. The journey sees her leave her first husband, a decent man who sees the faults in his daughters, Veda in particular and its source, the smothering love of the mother, flirt with and use for her own ends her husband's erstwhile business partner and relentless admirer, played with élan by Jack Carson and then fall for the status and surface charm of a failed "name" Monte Beragon, played with decadent fading charm by Zachary Scott. On top of that she takes a job as a bottom-rung waitress but picks up enough smarts to set up a restaurant empire and become a self - made successful businesswoman. And yet nagging at her and driving her is her altruistic but totally misguided love for her selfish scheming daughter, played tartly by Ann Blyth, always on the make for herself and who never misses an opportunity to put her mother down. The saga ends murderously in a typically Cain-like climax late at night at Beragon's beach house where even under the severest provocation Crawford attempts to clean up her daughter's mess in exchange for one more promise that this time she'll change. Crawford's unswerving devotion to such an obvious bad egg as Veda does stretch credulity at times as does as her ability to string three men along at once but hey, this is pulp fiction and make no mistake, so swallow hard and just go with it because this is a great film noir, employing typical genre techniques as the camera work throwing shades here and there on Crawford's face, a whodunit from front to back interlaced with flashbacks. Eventually at the conclusion Crawford gets the monkey off her back and tries once again with her first husband in a brief redemptive scene, but that's almost irrelevant compared to what's gone before. "Jack of all trades" Curtiz does a fine job of teasing out the human story from between the numerous plot-folds and there's some fine playing in the supporting roles besides Crawford's grand-standing effort - particularly Eve Arden as Mildred's world weary friend and restaurant manager Ida and Carson as the guy who can get everything except Mildred. The dialogue, as you'd expect, is sharp as a tack with nary a wasted scene and the shocking scene between Blyth and Scott at the climax must have had the censor hovering over his scissors. Like almost all the characters here the film is on the edge which is exactly where it takes you to on your seat as you watch. How ironic that the doting mother portrayed here was vilified in real life by her own daughter. Mommie Dearest indeed.</fullReview>

Bearing more than a distant resemblance to Fanny Hurst' s tear-jerker (which was filmed in the thirties by Stahl and remade by Sirk in the late fifties),though the mother:daughter relationship is much more dramatic in Curtiz's film:whereas Bea and her daughter went though simple love rivalry,the problem of Veda and Mildred is much more complex: Veda is ashamed of her mother,because she feels (maybe her paternal heredity) her place is not in her mother's modest house.When her mother succeeds in business (restaurants ),-always the last refugee for the woman love is denied to (see also "Only yesterday" "Mannequin" and of course "Imitation of live;in "Written on the wind" ,all that is left to Dorothy Malone is black gold business)-,things get even worst: Mildred becomes a parvenu,a nouveau riche,nothing to do with the (even if he is broke)aristocracy Monte epitomizes.Superlative performances by Joan Crawford and the rest of the cast.In "Imitation of life" (1959),it's the black girl who parades around ;in "Mildred" ,it's the spoiled daughter who does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Left by herself with two young daughters Mildred Pierce, Joan Crawford, goes on to become an extremely successful businesswoman opening up a string of restaurants along the Pacific coast where the customers just can't get enough of the food and services. Mildred lives for her two daughters Vada and Kay, Ann Blyth &amp; Jo Ann Marlow, doing everything she can to make their lives as comfortable as possible for them. Sadly Mildred overlooks Vada's addiction to both money and becoming a member of the blue blood California society that leads to the deserter that she's confronted with at the beginning of the film.Unique rags to riches type story that has a woman achieve unparalleled success in the business world but proved to be a total failure in her personal life. It's when her husband Burt, Bruce Bennett, gets canned from his job as a real-estate agent Mildred out of desperation goes out and gets a job as a waitress and works herself up to owning the restaurant that she at first worked in. It's later when her younger daughter Kay is struck down and dies from pneumonia that Mildred makes it a point to do everything for her surviving daughter Veda which in affect turned out be her Achilles heel.No matter what Mildred did for Veda she was never appreciated by her spoiled and back-stabbing daughter who, at the age of 16, went as far as getting married behind her mothers back. It's then that Veda blackmail her husbands Ted Forrester, Jon Camton, rich parents in having the marriage annulled telling them that she's pregnant and getting a cool $10,000.00 to keep that fact from being public. Mildred later finding out that Veda lied about her pregnancy not only tears up her $10,000.00 check but throws Veda out of her home.Still trying to win Veda back Mildred goes so far as marrying her former lover the now bankrupt but still blue-blooded playboy Monte Beragon, Zachary Scott, in order to have Veda, who's just crazy about the guy, come back to her. A shocked and depressed Mildred had earlier found out that Veda was doing a song and dance act, with drunken sailors and soldiers grouping and whistling at her, at one of her restaurants run by another of her former lovers Wally Fay, Jack Carson,and marrying Monte was the only way to get her out of that gig. Blinded by her concern for Veda Mildred signed away one third of her restaurant franchise to Monte who immediately squandered it away, to support his playboy lifestyle, having herself get bought out by her other partner Wally Fay. The movie comes full circle, in what we first saw when it started, with Mildred's confrontation with Monte at her beach-house that not only lead to Monte's murder but to the identity of the person who murdered him.More of a soap opera then a film-noir type of movie "Mildred Pierce" has in it one of Joan Crawford's, in which she won an Academy Award for best actress, best and most sympathetic performances. Joan wasn't worried in playing a woman with a teenage daughter which a number of likewise, and top drawing, actresses turned down to their later and bitter disappointment. In the movie Mildred sadly found out that being successful in the world of business doesn't guarantee success in the world of parenthood as well as having a successful marriage. When love gets in the way of logic and common sense it can, and in many cases will, turn what it's directed on to end up being a total and complete disaster which is exactly what happened to Mildred in her relationships with both her husbands, Burt &amp; Monte, and her rotten to the core daughter Veda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred, the housewife with the mean right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To quote what has been said about Joan Crawford, she was a movie star first and an actress second. This is certainly true when you look at her work in her MGM films, where mannerisms took center stage in lieu of emulating real emotion. Her role in "Grand Hotel" is a perfect example of this acting style where she plays coy and at the end sobbing her heart out. Not really the greatest performance of all time.When she moved to Warner Bros. she didn't do anything for a year until this script landed at her feet. She jumped at the chance to play the housewife, Mildred Pierce, who goes from virtually broke to becoming a shrewd businesswoman, all for the sake of taking care of her daughter(s). It was one hell of a good move because not only does she give a performance that still can grab your attention today, but she also won the Oscar.The movie starts out like the typical film noir, a murder has been committed and we think that the most likely culprit is Mildred. She tries to frame another for the deed but is caught in the lie by the police. The police are actually not stumble bums here as is usual in these types of films.The movie then turns into a soap opera where we learn that Mildred's self sacrifice for her daughter, Veda (Ann Blyth in a performance that crawls deeply under your skin as the bitchy daughter) when Mildred learns that Veda has been screwing both her and her stepfather (one literally).Not to give away anything more but this setup caught me totally by surprise and the way it is revealed is one of the truly marvels of denouement in American film history. The film falters a bit in the interval scenes with the by-play between Wally Fay (Jack Carson) and Mildred. He is too darn nice to be the rogue he is made out to be and the red herring here is that Mildred's ex-husband, Bert (Bruce Bennett) is made out to be the cad but turns around at the end.The scenes that are awesome are the ones where Ann Blyth and Crawford interact. They are the best reason why you should see this film. The director, Michael Curtiz was a mean SOB but he was instrumental in working actors to some of their best work in their careers, including Jimmy Cagney, Erroll Flynn and here Joan Crawford.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fine melodrama about a woman driven to succeed so she can provide for her spoiled daughter. In the Oscar-winning title role, Crawford gives perhaps the best performance of her career. Blyth is effective if somewhat wooden as the daughter from hell. Carson, Scott, and Bennett are good as the men in Crawford's life while Arden has the best lines as a wise-cracking restaurant worker. This is the second of three terrific films made in the mid 1940s based on novels by James Cain ("Double Indemnity", "The Postman Always Rings Twice"). It's an entertaining story, well crafted by the veteran Curtiz, although Mildred's blind dedication to her bratty daughter is not totally convincing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you stop to analyze the way the picture ended, it all makes perfect sense, but boy, what a twisting and convoluted way to get there. The film had any number of mis-directions that had this viewer wondering how it would all play out, particularly with the opening set up. Though as the picture progresses, pieces of the puzzle fall into place so that by the finale, the one character you really want to see get her just desserts is dealt with satisfactorily. I actually got a kick out of Veda's (Ann Blyth) sob story to mother Mildred Pierce (Joan Crawford), the weapon she was wielding going off accidentally six times. "I didn't mean to do it...but the gun kept going off over and over again." The irritating thing is that a defense like that might actually work today, since it's becoming rare for anyone to take personal responsibility any more for their own actions. I can see now why the film is held in such high regard. With it's effective screenplay and flawed characters, "Mildred Pierce" offers a stunning look at a woman who finds something within herself to beat the odds and attain the heights of success, only to be blinded by the unbounded love for a child who rejects her station in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce (1945) is a fantastic film! I absolutely loved it, and the twist of events at the end of the film made it all the more enjoyable! I think that Joan Crawford was just perfect! I thought through the entire film that it was her who killed her husband. She was so easily able to play a victim, since she is now a widow, a vulnerable woman, and yet she was able to take the blame for the incident so well. I loved the part when she was told by the police that her husband had been murdered. She didn't even shed a tear. If that were me?I would be weeping on the floor. That impression made me think that it were her who had killed him. It was only later did the audience find out why she didn't cry. The very dramatic twist and turn of events in this film made it very interesting and entertaining. I didn't really want the film to end. Other aspects of the film that I absolutely loved were the great use of cinematography. The lighting crew did a great job of using the fill light, backlight, and the key light in almost every scene to highlight all the actors/actresses' faces. It was absolutely beautiful to watch. Overall, this film was one of the best that I have ever watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By the end of this movie, you may wish Veda had been eaten by alligators....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This really is a variation of the biblical story of Cain and Abel, of how the mother of two daughters favors the eldest, a beauty, over the other, who dies tragically, and how the eldest daughter ends up betraying her mother anyway. It is the ultimate Joan Crawford movie, and turned Ann Blyth from sweet musical ingénue into extreme bitch. Joan is Mildred, a hard-working washer woman who also bakes pies for extra cash, neglects her husband (Bruce Bennett) which makes him turn to another woman. She divorces him, moves onto becoming a waitress (with Eve Arden as her boss!), and ultimately the owner of her own Pacific Coast Highway restaurant which becomes a smashing success. The new man in her life (Zachary Scott) is obviously a cad, and Blyth (as Veda) doesn't appreciate anything Mildred does to make their lives better. This leads to several confrontations with both mother and daughter getting slaps from each other, making their relationship dwindle into hatred, although the thin line between love and hate for Mildred remains vulnerable.A pre-cursor to "The Bad Seed's" Rhoda, Veda is the grown-up version of that psychopathic child, polite and sweet on the surface, yet filled with the venom of a thousand vipers. She loves nobody but herself (and perhaps money), and goes way beyond snobbism when she tells her mother off for resorting to being a waitress when the money really starts coming in. "I took tips and was glad to get them", Crawford's narration tells the audience. To see her go from frazzled housefrau to sophisticated restaurant owner and watch Veda never be even the slightest bit impressed really reveals a lot about Mildred's insecurity which had a lot more detail in the James M. Cain novel and the later mini-series.But it is the Joan Crawford movie which remains the most well known when the name "Mildred Pierce" is spouted. She allowed herself to become a little frumpy in this, her first major picture under her Warner Brothers contract, and even opposite stars like Ingrid Bergman, Greer Garson, Gene Tierney and Jennifer Jones, it was clear that the Oscar this year was sure to be hers. Blyth, too, is outstanding; Her character goes beyond just being amoral, yet she is certainly not one dimensional. Blyth shared a supporting Oscar nomination with Eve Arden who delivers her share of wisecracks (especially at Veda's expense) but also provides a strong shoulder for Crawford to turn to when things get out of control. Jack Carson is also strong as another one of the men in Joan's life, a far cry from his usual bombastic character, yet certainly no shrinking violet.This film is certainly ripe for parody, most famously on "The Carol Burnett Show". Joan's "Andrews Sisters" hairstyle is often imitated by drag queens, and even though she removed the Adrian shoulder pads, the shoulders seemed to remain intact. There is a grittier look in her from her last MGM film (1943's "Above Suspicion") and this, just two years later. It makes me wonder if the film might still be as famous had director Michael Curtiz cast his first two choices, Bette Davis and Barbara Stanwyck, as opposed to Joan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film ahead of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considered a film noir classic, Mildred Pierce is also one of the most watchable films I've ever seen. Directed by Michael Curtiz, who directed other notable movies such as Casablanca, it is a beautifully stylish film with outstanding locations and sets. Mostly, though, it is a great story about one very interesting and complex character, namely Mildred Pierce. The contrasting light and shadows work well in key scenes. When Mildred separates from her first husband, the accomplished homemaker and mother channels her drive and imagination to become a highly successful businesswoman. Like many people, she is spurred by a desire to give her children the best she can, expressed by gifts and lavish spending. Her personal life is complicated by the relationship with her children, especially the elder daughter Veda. The title role is performed by Joan Crawford, a powerful woman with ambition, and a shrewd business sense. Her daughter Veda is performed by Ann Blyth, a young woman whose lifestyle depends on her mother's deep pockets; yet she despises the fact that her mother has to actually work hard to supply her with material possessions. Jack Carson is Wally Fay, friend and business associate; the one man who has the intelligence and strength to be a good match but he can never win her hand in marriage. Eve Arden is Ida Corwin who takes on the role of mentor at the local restaurant and becomes her operational right hand. She is superb in adding her dry and sarcastic sense of humour, which always struck me as her hallmark in her 1950's television series Our Miss Brooks. This movie is a chronicle of Mildred's triumphs and tragedies. Mildred Pierce is a truly outstanding movie with a character ahead of her time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is awesome because of tough female protagonist Mildred who doesn't take complaints from anybody even her spoiled daughter Veda. I was shocked at how many times Mildred let Veda slap her around and still go back and want to love her though, Veda just seemed bad from the start. There were times when I wanted Mildred to really just go off and forget her daughter all together, she was doing completely fine without her. I was absolutely shocked when I found out Veda was getting with her mom's ex husband... that made me actually mad. The soft facial shots of all female characters from movies in the 40s are absolutely stunning, the head shots have a soft glow to them that just cant be replicated anymore. I also think that Joan Crawford was an excellent casting choice because she has enough range of emotion in her to play the tough, put together business woman, and desperate mother willing to do anything for her child's love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crawford Picks Up the Gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce (1945) **** (out of 4) After twenty-years in the business and eighteen-years at MGM, Joan Crawford went over to Warner where she's make this her first picture and this would win her the only Best Actress Oscar in her career. In the film she plays the title character, a housewife who is forced to work as a waitress after her husband leaves her. Through hard work she manages to start a chain of restaurants but even this isn't good enough for her spoiled daughter (Ann Blyth) who she most wants to make happy. Director Michael Crutiz was without question the perfect choice for this picture because he could handle just about any type of picture and this one here has quite a few different genres going on. For starters, the opening is going to remind you of some of the best film noirs out there but once we hit the flashbacks we've basically got a story about a hard working mother, an ungrateful daughter, various men and of course some melodrama. All of this is thrown into the mixer and it comes out perfectly thanks in large part to the direction but also the performance of Crawford. It's easy to see why she wanted this part so much and it's easy to see why it brought her career some much needed fire that it needed. The performance is simply flawless no matter what type of emotion the actress needs to play. You believe her early in the film when she's the housewife. You believe when she's the struggling single mother. The scenes where she is hurt by her daughter's actions contain some of the greatest acting you're going to see from the legendary star. Crawford really eats up this character and delivers something quite memorable. Blyth is also wonderful in her role of the brat daughter and I think everyone who watches this film will want to slap her. The supporting group are all excellent as well with Zachary Scott, Jack Carson and Eve Arden really standing out. Bruce Bennett is also very good as the first husband. You can tell Warner went all out with this picture. There's a brilliant score, beautiful costumes and the sets are just flawless. MILDRED PIERCE might be melodrama but it's of the highest quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I typically don't like watching old films but this one really blew me away. It was the first Film Noir I'd ever seen and it certainly made me want to see more. The acting was amazing, especially Joan Crawford. The love her character felt for her children really came across as genuine. You were definitely always rooting for Mildred and I think that's because Joan did such an amazing job. The plot of the film was also very gripping. I couldn't believe all the shocking twists and turns that it took.It was very interesting the way the film started out because you thought they showed you the end but it was some clever trickery. I was completely surprised by the ending, I never even saw it coming. The best kinds of films are the ones that keep you guessing and Mildred Pierce definitely kept me guessing. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would recommend Mildred Pierce for those audience members who are 30 and up. Joan Crawford is wonderful in this film. I think this is one of her best performances. The are also good performances form Jack Carson, Eve Arden and Ann Blyth; all of whom make a good supporting cast. The film is a good dramatic murder mystery. However, it is fairly predictable with how the story ends and what really went occurred. The movies' pace is somewhat slow, but I guess that's the way mysteries are paced. This is one of those films which can describe how a child can twist a mother's love and maternal protection. You'd better have your popcorn already made because you will not want to leave your seat for this movie. I give it four thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to watch Mildred Pierce for a Cinema class that I'm taking, and I'm sorry to say that it wasn't my favorite. While I do like Film Noir and very much enjoyed the new style of direction (especially the very dark lighting), I found it pretty dramatic and not all that interesting a film. I think that it could have been a lot better. Nevertheless the cinematography was technically pretty good, and setting aside the plot elements that made it pretty unbearable for me it had an element of realism that was very nice and very mysterious. I felt like I was playing clue. Perhaps not what I went to a Cinema class to do, but somewhat enjoyable, either way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Mildred Pierce was a good film, I thought it was well done, it was a really good 'noir' film, the shadow affects they used really impressed me. The story line was great, I was kept guessing through out the entire film, I kept expecting Mildred to stand up for herself at different times, but she didn't. Also through out the entire film I thought that her ex-husband was a real piece of work, but in the end I thought he was the most sane of the men and wished he had stuck around. I was REALLY surprised to find out that Veda was the one who killed Monte in the end...my jaw literally dropped, so I thought this was an excellent film that kept you hanging. I will admit that I thought Mildred was ridiculous when it came to her daughter, however her intentions were understandable and moving, but still there comes a time where you got to say no.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is just so much about this movie that I absolutely loved. I love a good mystery and enjoyed the process of trying to find out who committed the murder throughout the film. Everything about this film was so skillfully done, emotions were greatly depicted, and it all was very believable. There were several times throughout the movie where I just wanted to backhand the daughter, she really managed to get on my nerves for a fictional character. The plot twist at the end after being led to believe that Mildred was the murderer just threw me completely off guard, and it was very skillfully executed. The sudden inlet of light when the detective opens the window was also a very nice touch and very symbolic of justice being served. I am definitely recommending this movie to my relatives.</fullReview>

I'm sure Veda's precocious flirting and hanging around with Mildred's male friends all the time was very racy for 1940s Hollywood.The only complaint I have is that Butterfly McQueen appears throughout the movie and gets no screen credit, while Veda Ann Borg shows up once for about two seconds yet is in the opening titles.A great movie, a little sappy but that's why I love it.</fullReview>

I didn't think it was nearly dramatic enough when the girl died and I didn't see much point to her death anyway. The best part of the movie was the black maide who was hilarious.

The first and small concern is the maid played by Butterfly McQueen, her voice is the most annoying and disturbing thing I have ever heard. I can see her in a comedy but when it goes from steep drama to that unexpected shrill voice it not only startles the viewer but annoys them. My second gripe is with the amount of Gold-digging lay-a-bouts there are, it upset me to see everyone feeding of Mildred and her being okay with it. I give the movie a ten out of ten but i give the diggers a three. Other then those opinions I loved everything about the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>not many films from the 40's have the gritty realism and power that this film has. 1 of the greatest performances of all time and one of the greatest films ever made. Joan Crawford dominates the screen as a housewife, Mildred Pierce who has an unfaithful husband who walks out on her and her 2 daughters. So she proves him wrong by showing him she can do fine all on her own, she then lands a job as waitress, but it barely covers ends meets. But she keeps working hard all in order to give her and her daughters a better life. Especially her cruel and deranged daughter, Veda who always wants more than what she has. But then Mildred owns a SUCCESSFUL restaurant chain and gets huge success. And then finds love in the buildings owner, all is well. Until Veda becomes money hungry and begins to steal money from the whole restaurant and then things get crazy on a dark night in the beach house... This film is a very tragic story of a woman who gets it all, but not for herself but for her awful, unappreciative daughter. Amazing story, a classic film noir and an example of incredible acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is a great film that teaches several moral lessons to its audience. First, is the lesson that with enough determination and hard work, a woman can do anything a man can do. This film really breaks the gender barrier with a female hero who climbs the ranks in the restaurant business. This film also explores the moral that inner beauty trumps over physical beauty any day. Ann Blyth performs perfectly this lesson. Her snoody and snobbish personality make here completely transparent on the screen. This film also portrays the dark side of success and materialism. Characters like Monte and Veda show that their obsession for material wealth is not a better alternative to an honest life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not one of Michael Curtiz his best known movies but it certainly ranks among his best. This 5 time Oscar-nominee and winner of one is a great powerful movie, that is driven by its story and fine characters and actors that are portraying them.This movie definitely has a great story, that is made so great due to its overall realism. The movie could had easily turned into a melodramatic one but the movie mostly stays humble and small with its emotions and situations. Due to this the movie mostly has a realistic feel and look over it. It features ordinary people, who through the cause of the movie turn into completely different people, due to some tough and unfortunate circumstances. It's a solidly written and constructed movie, that develops nicely throughout the movie and is being told in the right way and pace. The makes the story and the movie in general work out as an effective and powerful one.The story gets driven by its characters, that are all greatly written and perfectly cast within the movie. Eve Arden and Jack Carson are two examples of some great supporting actors within the movie, while Joan Crawford also plays a great role as the movie its main lead, which also won her an Oscar. Also former Hollywood cute faced beauty Ann Blyth got perfectly cast as the most horrible- and femme fatale type character of the movie.The movie is a thriller with some film-noir tendencies. It's story, which for most part gets centered around a murder, which gets shown in the beginning of the movie, is typically noir like, with all of the well known ingredients in it. Yet I would call the movie more Michael Curtiz like than film-noir like really. The movie Curtiz his signature written all over, with its compositions, use of shadows and performances from the actors.A really great and effective movie that deserves to be seen and known by more! It's among Curtiz his best movies in my opinion!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The unappreciated genius of Curtiz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the celebrated directors of the golden age of Hollywood perhaps the most neglected and under-appreciated is Michael Curtiz, ne Manó Kertész, born in Budapest in 1886. Curtiz never earned the adoration of the Cahiers du Cinema critics or for that matter their Americans successors; unlike his contemporaries Howard Hawks or Alfred Hitchcock, there seems to be no recognizable theme or definable point-of-view in his work. As a long-time Warner Bros. contract director he was just as capable of turning out a second-rate low-budget Western one day, a crime thriller the next, as he was of directing his two masterpieces "Casablanca" and "Yankee Doodle Dandy." At his best, and there is no better example of his high-style than "Mildred Piece," what distinguishes Curtiz from all the others is his great talent for staging actors in a set and then moving the camera with them. In "Mildred Pierce" his restless characters are always on the move, never still, and neither is his camera. The B&amp;W cinematography by Ernest Haller is full of shadows, silhouettes, long angles, camera moves. This film justifiably earned Joan Crawford an Oscar in 1945. Curtiz delivered it to her home in person but did not win one himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Stuff from the director of Casablanca</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Curtiz's skillful direction has often been overshadowed by the tremendous star power radiated in his most well-known films. Unlike many other directors of his era, his films seldom bear any "signature" or "stamp". Like the best actors who disappear into their roles, you can't really "spot" his great direction, but it's all here: the lighting, the close-ups, the the pacing, etc.This is my favorite of the three well-known film versions of James M. Cain's novels. (The other two being Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice. He also wrote the novel on which the 1982 Pia Zadora flick "Butterfly" is based, but let's not hold that against him.) It's a favorite because it has the sharpest dialogue AND the most compelling conclusion. This is thanks to screenwriter Ranald MacDougall--with a little help from William Faulkner and Catherine Turney.Of course the most memorable part about this film is the tempestuous mother-daughter relationship played by Joan Crawford and Ann Blyth. Crawford really allows Blyth to shine in her meaty role; it's probably the most generous she had ever been with a female co-star, as far as sharing the screen. The images and characters in this film are so indelible that Carol Burnett couldn't resist parodying it on her television show. And even after seeing it lampooned, it still holds up as a classic. A true MUST-SEE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred Pierce : Never a dull moment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first. Bruce Bennett who plays Mildred's suffering ex-husband turned 100 this past May! Happy belated. (D:02/24/2007)One of many movies I have checked out from the library and I have to admit,given the title,it sounded like it would be boring. Not so. I have never actually watched a Joan Crawford starring vehicle but this turns out to be nothing like I assumed it would be. Just like books ladies &amp; gentlemen,never judge a DVD/VHS movie by it's cover!In the beginning of this film,rich but throwing away his money Monte' Bergon,Mildred's current husband,is shot point blank four times. We "think" we know exactly who did it but there in lies the underlying truth we don't see until the end. Yes,I'm being purposely vague,because I think it best for those who read this to watch from the beginning without really knowing what to expect.The characters in this range from somewhat likable to downright cruel. Mildred's oldest daughter Veda is being spoiled rotten by her mother and her husband Bert can't make her see that. Veda is selfish,stubborn and completely unappreciative of her mother's efforts. Mildred,no matter how abusive her daughter is,still wont give up on her!Bert on the other hand is keeping company with a "neighbor" lady. Daughter Kay is a tom-boy and like most kids,in her own world. The story is not just of "who killed Mildred's husband?" but also showing how independent Mildred becomes once separated from her husband. Although despite making a success out of a restaurant and opening a chain of them,the money is mostly for the snotty Veda.The revelation at the end of this movie I will say "is" surprising and for the time,shocking.Joan Crawford won the Academy award for this performance and deservedly so. Along with this movie,on the DVD's "flipside",is the Turner Classic Movies documentary about the real Joan Crawford.If you know very little about her besides the over-acted,"Mommie Dearest" from 1980,then watch this after "Mildred Pierce". It's a real eye -opener to a very competent actress. (END)</fullReview>

Blyth especially does not overact (and that's saying a lot) and when she turns on Mildred, its totally believable. If Vida is a monster, Mildred gave that monster life (and a wardrobe no sixteen year old should be allowed to have). Zachary Scott and Jack Carson are the men of the piece and each is adequate, at best. Its a womans picture, through and through - not that there's anything wrong with that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is an interesting movie: first, Joan Crawford--enough to scare anybody; second, melodramatic--talk about a bunch of trashy-acting people; third, not a bad movie at all. This is not noir, but rather the hard-boiled genre. Slightly sordid events take place and are taken care of in a pragmatic fashion. Not pretty, but realistically, these things do happen and life goes on. By now, you've guessed it: we're talking sex. A lot of it goes on in this movie, along with smoking, drinking, hanging out in disreputable bars, blackmail, and eventually, murder. With the movie production code firmly in place, all the sex is off-camera and all the morally bad people pay a heavy price, as required.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Mystery/Melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A solid blend of mystery and melodrama, "Mildred Pierce" is probably best remembered for Joan Crawford, but it also has a talented supporting cast and some good atmospheric sequences. The mystery story is fairly simple in itself, but it provides for some interesting thoughts and observations on the characters, their relationships with each other, and their motivations, and this gives it some depth beyond the story itself.Crawford must have reveled in playing roles such as Mildred, and her character here is complex enough to give her a chance to do quite a bit with the material. She certainly carries most of the picture, but the supporting cast members are very good as well, and they are essential in complementing Crawford. Ann Blyth succeeds in her role as Mildred's scheming daughter, even holding her own in her scenes with Crawford.The production is good as well, and it is somewhat interesting in that it takes what at first appears to be a film-noirish story, and casts it more as a melodrama. In any case, the combination works pretty well.</fullReview>

I get hooked from the very opening, (although I could do without her one daughter dying.) Eve Arden is always a delight, but unfortunately she doesn't have much to do except to add some comic relief as she usually does. It's too bad that Ann Blythe didn't do more movies.

		<fullReview>Joan Crawford in the non-acting sense is well known for being the caddy and witchy (not sure what you can say on here) "Mommie Dearest" type. I think Ann Blyth's Veda pulls a couple more punches than dear Joan here. The fact of the matter is that the fruit doesn't fall far from the tree, so Joan's Mildred still holds her own. What you get here is a real Hollywood vehicle, if you think about what else was going on at the time: "Double Indemnity" made noirs big, so this is part film noir and the wartime weepers, such as "Since You Went Away", mainly made for women, were big, so you also get some fine melodrama. The result is surprisingly good. It seemed a bit inconsistent and forced at times, but watching Mildred's life evolve and keeping one step ahead of the conniving is a recipe for at least some enjoyment.</fullReview>

One of the factors in that style of film making is that none of the main characters are up to any good - they all have some hidden agenda and/or some dark secret."Mildred Pierce" fits under drama, soap opera, etc. Mildred is the antithesis of a film noir character. She is, indeed, ruthlessly ambitious, even deluded. But all of this energy is put forth not for herself, but for her daughter.

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films with Strong Female Leads</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best mystery-psychological melodrama features with strong female characters. It is now considered a film noir although it is a mix of the traditional melodrama. It has great lines right from the beginning as the protagonist considers jumping into the ocean and a police officer walks up: "Just cause you feel like bumping yourself off, I'd end up with pneumonia and that ain't fair." As a film noir, this one takes place in the upscale locations of Santa Monica, west of Los Angeles, away from the city.SPOILERS From the opening credits viewers are prepared for things to come. The opening credits have the tidal waves erasing the credits; already hinting at something deeper about the philosophy of the film. Just as the waves erase the credits on the sand, the viewer is reminded of the brief time we spend on this world. Is it a hint about our legacies in this world, that they will be eventually drawn into the ocean of nothingness. Will our accomplishments count for anything?The film begins in media res on a dark night at a beach house where gun shots ring out and a man falls speaking the name "Mildred" for the last time. Is the man revealing a clue about the plot? The murder occurs in front of a mirror where we see bullet cracks left.Next we get a night time crane shot of a pier area shops and a woman walking past them to the edge of the pier. After Mildred's failed attempt to kill herself; even suicide is impossible in this noir gem. The characters must face the consequences of their actions; no one is off the hook.The film shows us a broken world where death and sex are inextricably intertwined. It is a world where you have the wide open spaces not found in L.A., but the characters are just as limited in their movements and opportunities.It is also a world where we have strong women taking control of their lives. Unfortunately, it does not bode well for the mother or the daughter. When Mildred first splits from her husband, Wally pushes himself in. Mildred responds with two fiery come-back lines: "You don't by any chance hear opportunity knocking?", "Wally, you should be kept on a leash." Mildred will have to transcend her previous homemaking position to the sole matriarchal leader of the family.Unlike other Film Noir films, this one is not about romantic love. It is about a single mother struggling to get ahead. As the argument begins with the first husband, cheating is on the plate, but so is the eldest daughter Veda's (Vee-dah) expensive tastes and insatiable desire for more material goods. The love for the daughter drives the plot of the film.The role of women; begins with the submissive mother taking charge and overcoming the social restrictions of the period. We find a single mother overwhelmed by debt who works hard and succeeds in the restaurant business. Mildred is conscientious and adept at spending her money, but no one else around her is. Her daughter Veda and second lover/husband Monte Baragon lead to her demise. Mildred even marries Monte, but she does so against her better judgment in order to lure Veda back to live with her. Monte belongs to a wealthy socialite family, but he is just an unproductive sponge leaching out of the remaining funds hoarded by his past ancestors; he contributes nothing.From the beginning Veda is portrayed as an egotistical, self- concerned daughter. At first, she is likable in the sense that one forgives her for her naive view of the world and self-pretentious attitude as a phase in youth. But quickly, we realize it is not a phase, something really wrong has happened to her where fantasy and reality are no longer distinguishable. Mildred loves her unconditionally, but the mother's love is not returned in the same way: "I love you mother; I really do, but let's not be sticky about it." Mildred tries to compensate for the distance between them by providing Veda expensive gifts of clothes and piano lessons. The film presents the problem of consumerism and a cynical view of love between mother and daughter. This film shocks the audience by the portrayal of such an indifferent and callous daughter; it threatens the family values by the disintegration of the husband-wife relationship and more disturbingly, the mother-daughter relationship. The daughter seeks endless satisfaction in the newest fashions and becomes a status- seeker. Veda constantly puts down her mother for her humble origins, but Veda refuses to see herself as descending from her mother. Veda lives in a world where she sees herself as an orphan, as a woman born into the wrong family; she sees herself destined for high class life without ever working for a dime.Mildred Pierce is a great psychological drama and film noir that stands the test of time. It provides a fascinating window into the past and a mirror to flaws that persist in the human condition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that leaves you feeling energized and hungry for more. It is a masterpiece. Joan Crawford is amazing. She is a precise actress, very dedicated to the role. This film sucks you into the story, completely engulfing you in the magic of the plot as it unfolds. It is dramatic and suspenseful. One of the great things about this film is that is not predictable at all. Some other Film-Noir that I have seen tend to be pretty obvious about the direction they are going in. Mildred Pierce has a very unpredictable nature to it, making it stand out as a movie. Other that the acting and plot, the camera work is the other amazing element to this film. Michael Curtiz is a master of lighting a framing. Just as in Casablanca (an earlier film by Curtiz) this film has brilliant dark scenes with wonderfully lit areas. The emphasis is placed on the faces of the actors, highlighting the emotion. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce was not what I expected. It was so much more, and whenever that happens it's a good thing. While some argue its inclusion, Mildred Pierce was my first official Film- Noir. I've seen other Neo-Noirs and films inspired by the Film-Noir genre, Mildred Pierce is the first that would fit the classical definition. The melodramatic beginning was exactly what I expected when the film began, but how engrossing the film was on as whole is what surprised me. This film has deep characters; even the femme fettle role of Veda is far more complex than one would initially believe. It's with these deep characters that we are given dialog that flesh out a story that always keeps you guessing.My favorite thing about Film-Noir is the lighting and Mildred Pierce doesn't disappoint. Although there are a number of scenes (the restaurant comes to mind) in which high-key lighting is used, much of the film still revolves around high contrasting shadows, which helps create the depth needed. I have already added this classic film to my library and look forward to watching it again. While the story is straightforward there is complexity to it that require repeat viewings in order to appreciate the subtle themes founds throughout.Instant Favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched with my 92-YO Mom expecting a 'chick flick' . Don't want to rehash points other reviewers have made. Excellent. There was no murder in the novel. I think adding it to the film made it a 'noir' film of 1940's style and broadened the audience base. Technique reminded me of "Sunset Blvd" where film opened with murder and went backwards to unfold story leading up to the murder. Liked that Joan Crawford's character was 'nice', sometimes smiled, and Crawford was very striking in contrast to what we think of her "Mommie Dearest" persona. Jack Carson was a little different in that while his character was typically affable, character was a bit of a 'heel'. Great cast including some uncredited types like Butterfly McQueen (really cute and nice) and James Flavin as police (surprised?) Nice that Joan Crawford won an award. She deserved it. Worth watching at least once and then studying it as to techniques (sp?)</fullReview>

Although very successful she is unable to win the affection and appreciation of her oldest daughter. This film revolves primarally around the murder mystery of her second husband. We are taken back to the very beginning all the way to the truth lit end. the film portrays Mildred's rise to success and along the way, her other failures as a mother and failures to herself. She struggles between giving her daughter everything she couldn't have growing up, and finally putting her foot down as her behavior spins out of control from spoiled to violent.Over all a really fantastic film.

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce directed by Michael Curtiz was a phenomenal movie. Both this movie and Casablanca directed by Curtiz are some of the better movies I have seen from this time period. Joanne Crawford was also really good in this movie and she won an Oscar for it. It had a lot of suspense and drama throughout the whole movie. The type of person Joanne was in the movie is someone that many women would look up to. She had a lot of drive and determination to what she wanted and to open up her own restaurant. She didn't let anyone get in her way, but she did also face many obstacles throughout. I liked how they started the movie with ending and did flashback with Mildred while she was being interviewed. They gave the whole story in a flashback. The relationship between Mildred and Veda the daughter was also your typical mother- daughter relationship. Veda wanted to be independent and didn't want her mom controlling her. By trying to be by herself, it got her in a lot of trouble at the end that her mother couldn't get her out of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred Pierce Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mildred Pierce" is the type of movie where you don't want to stop watching because something better and better keeps happening. In the beginning of the film when Bert leaves Mildred, there is definitely a sense of uncertainty among Mildred and her daughters. However these feelings are quickly dissolved when Mildred makes something out of herself. The thing that I thought was the most interesting was that the most hated character of the film is without a doubt Veda Pierce. Throughout the film, her true self of being a spoiled brat is slowly revealed to the audience and is quite significant to the film. Veda is a message and a lesson to the audience: if you spoil your children too much, you may have a child that resembles Veda. Other parts I enjoyed about the film was the actual story. The classic success story is shown in Mildred Pierce (with the exception of Veda and a few other things). There was also great acting among the characters, each serving their roles incredibly, especially Wally Fay. Overall I thought this was a fantastic movie and would recommend to anyone.</fullReview>

I think Michael Curtiz directed this movie very well just like Casablanca.This movie really had you on your feet as a viewer right from the start. At the beginning you thought is was Mildred who did it but in reality it wasn't. This movie is very powerful because it displays a lot of flashbacks and that's tough choice to make when making a movie because it can cause viewers to not be able to follow the plot.

		<shortDescription>Mildred Pierce - My Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect from this film, but I was very well surprised. Not that female leads are bad, quite the contrary, but I didn't expect such complex characters from an era where women weren't as well respected. Maybe I exaggerate in that statement, but this movie was extremely well done and I admire it greatly for demonstrating people in this way.Every character was likable in at least some aspect, which is important for the audience to identify with each individual. In a way, I identified with every single character in there at least in minor ways (no, not with Veda; if I did, then be terrified). I found that so profound that I was able to like every character and see their flaws yet still appreciate them even when they did horrible things, like Pierce's late husband and Veda. Maybe it was because I saw some of their history before everything crapped out on them, but regardless the amount of detail put into each character despite their circumstances was quite a rare occurrence.I didn't quite understand Pierce's attachment to Veda, however, even from the start. I'm assuming it had to do with her being a devoted mother and only wanting the best, which was said, but even still I found it hard to believe that a good mother and person like Pierce would dive so low as to support her daughter in situations like the ones in the movie. If I were the mother, I would have dropped her like a sack of potatoes, or if not drop them fry them and eat them with ketchup. A lot of it was outrageous, but at the same time believable if that makes any sense. I guess in a way it's not unheard of that people would do crazy things for love, and because Pierce was the person that she was she took every fall. I admire her a bit for that, because I suppose I see myself in her. My heart went out to her.Along with a few rare films I've rated this high, this is one of them. An astounding movie capable of gripping the emotional psyche as well as its ability to capture those emotions in stunning photography. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a real fan of this movie, mostly because we have a strong female protagonist, especially during such difficult times, on scene and off. The story drags you along really well, in my opinion. They lead you to think that she was the murderer all along, but instead, it was someone you didn't really expect. Though once we found out, all the signs were obvious. That's a pretty well done plot if you ask me. I loved the story, the characters, even the crappy guy friend that was always trying to win the mother's heart. I only liked him because he fulfilled his role correctly, if you asked me about it. During some parts of the movie, I honestly wanted to yell because God, how can one mother have such patience for a bratty child? It's terrible that the younger one passed away. It's also ironic for Crawford to play such a loving and caring mother, in comparison to what we have seen in Mommy Dearest. This movie is definitely good for a second run, or maybe even more. Loved it.</fullReview>

The movie included everything from drama to suspense and added a little romance as well.Mildred Pierce, played by Joan Crawford is a housewife who files for divorce from her husband Bert during the 1940's. She is the mother to two daughters Veda and Kay. Veda is a snobby teenager who has a love for pianos; and Kay is a tomboyish girl. During the divorce, Mildred retains custody of her children. Mildred aspires to open up restaurant in her name, with the help of her friend Wally, she succeeds at.The movie has some twist and turns and you are left wondering what the outcome maybe. And as the movie comes to a close, you think you know how the movie will end, but some may be shocked when the twist occurs. I have to say I will definitely recommend this film to all my friends.</fullReview>

The look of the film also stands out, it has the classic noir feel with all the dark shadows used and the spotlights in important charters/scenes. The negatives about this film is there were some scenes that were just pointless and didn't relate to anything and just felt like fillers that they didn't need and just dragged on at points. Those are the points of the film that worked and didn't and overall Mildred Pierce gets an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different take on a film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film primarily for its distinction from other film noirs. Rather than the usual male criminal, the titular Mildred Pierce is a typical housewife who finds her calling in protecting and supporting her family. Other details are met in order to qualify "Mildred Pierce" (1945) as film noir, such as a murder-mystery plot, a femme fatale, betrayal, and so on. But I enjoyed watching this film because of its differences. Okay, also to be in awe of how beautiful Joan Crawford was. It's hard to tell if this is a valid point, but I feel as if this film wouldn't be as glamorous and mysterious if it were in color. The black and white appearance gives it a cold feeling, which is subtly very convincing as the plot becomes dangerous and thrilling. I think if this film were to be made now, it would be at least considered to be purposely black and white, like "The Artist" (2011), for example. Either way, it's well-written, the cinematography, while not overly artistic, gets the point across, and it helps to broaden the spectrum of classic melodrama.Overall, a remarkable film about a strong-minded, able-bodied mama-bear, who fights to preserve a stable (if a little unhealthy) lifestyle for her family.</fullReview>

Curtiz "paints with light" as a dark story unfolds about a mother who only wants to give her daughters (and after Kay dies singular Daughter) the world. Despite Mildred's treatment in the film she is no frail maiden. She is tough and willing to do what she must. Ann Blyth shines as the despicable Veda Pierce. She is the perfect baby-faced counterpart to Crawford and she very much passes as a blood relative. The costume design in the film is amazing and the parallels between Mildred and Veda and done perfectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me this movie was outstanding. I loved the plot. The make-up and costume designs in this film were not very elaborate. However, the costume design was just enough for the film. Not too rugged and not too overdone. The cast that was chosen for this film was great. They all played their parts very well. I have to say the young girl who played Mildred's daughter definitely got the audiences adrenaline going with her tactics. The mother's character really displayed the ideal role of a single parent. There were so many relate-able messages that was in this film. These messages range from the relationship of mother and daughter, the struggle to success, never giving up in a fight to conquer, and the discovery of love not really being what it seemed. Again there are so many other messages that can be deciphered from the film, these were just a few examples.This film can be viewed as intriguing from not only the young but the old as well. The lighting in this film adds a lot of dramatic quality to it. There is a lot of shadowing and dark light used for those scenes where things get highly dramatized. I must admit that the ending results of the mother- daughter relationship gave me a sigh of relief. Magnificent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumph over old time biases</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is a 1945 film noir drama directed by Michael Curtiz and staring Joan Crawford Mildred Pierce. Hollywood has a bad reputation for putting women on the back burner in terms of their general representation in American cinema. Even in 2013 sex appeal can and is still widely used as a way of female exploitation. Thankfully, every once in a while we receive a performance that puts the misogyny in its place and reminds us that women can tango with the boys. Joan Crawford embodies this characteristic. Though she is put up against opposition, and though things may not work out perfectly in the end, her performance is a perfect example of strong women in American cinema. Just as important as Crawford's performance is the style of the film. This is total noir, no if, and, or but about it. Curtiz loves to play around with shadows, and it really shows in this movie. They give a much needed sense of grittiness to the atmosphere of the movie, after all a story about overcoming gender boundaries wouldn't be the same in even lighting. At the end of the day, its a great film to watch if you would like to feel guilty about being a man... but seriously this movie really stands out as barrier pusher for women in Hollywood. After all, what would happen to rolls like Beatrix Kiddo, Marge Gunderson, or Jackie Brown if it wasn't for Mildred Pierce? 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vintage Hollywood Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In terms of technical film-making, "Mildred Pierce" is near-perfect. The film was directed by Michael Curtiz, one of the preeminent directors of the Golden Age of Hollywood. After a string of unprecedented successes in the late thirties and early forties, Curtiz jumped on the post-war noir bandwagon and made what would become one of the most acclaimed films of his career. The film's dynamic opening scene reveals the end of its story, and then details the events leading up to it. This device is commonly used in modern movies, but I have rarely seen it used as well as it's used here. Keys scenes showcase cinematographer Ernest Haller's brilliant black-and-white photography. Shadows surround and follow every character, showing that everyone has their demons. Of course, much of the film's notoriety comes from Joan Crawford's performance as the eponymous lead character. Her character is the center around which all the other characters orbit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this film! Every part of it kept me interesting and wanting more. The story was easy to follow and the characters were easily distinguishable. Though all of the characters were very different from one another, they meshed together wonderfully. Joan Crawford does a great job as the title character with her ability to portray emotions effortlessly and her character was one who could easily be relatable to. I was rooting for her and her ex-husband to reconnect throughout the film and I was not disappointed. Veda was a sensational antagonist! She was practically dripping with hatred and pure evil. The actress did a great job portraying her and honestly, I don't think the film would be the same without Ann Blyth playing her. I hated and loved the character mostly because she was so nasty and mean, but the actress was so darn good at showing it.The lighting and cinematography in this film was gorgeous. I loved the harsh lights and darks that were present throughout. It's clear as to why this was a classic representation of film noir. The use of mirrors and shadow throughout was stunning and the fluid camera motions made it nicer to watch. I also like how the story started at the end and then continued into a flashback. And of course, the surprise twist at the end is really great. I won't spoil it, but I was so absorbed in the film that when it happened, it actually threw me for a loop and temporarily broke my concentration. Really great film. I would highly recommend it to any classic movie fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall Mildred Pierce was a good movie that really had me anxious because she was such a pushover when it came to her daughter Vita. If I ever talked to my mother the way she did I would get more than just slapped. It's unbelievable how much crap that girl got away with and if I were Mildred I could have slapped her in the face more than once in that one scene. The end really had me speechless when she did what she did to her mother but when the investigation finally ended I was so happy because she finally got what she deserved. She was such a spoiled rotten brat who wanted everything in the world to herself I was so happy when she threw herself under the bus. Even my whole class was outraged at the treatment she gave her mother. Well besides that point the overall photography of the movie was good. The lighting was very good and everything was clear, concise, and visible. The dramatic shadows in the scene where Mildred found Monte with Vita really helped the overall mood where Mildred felt completely betrayed by both her husband and daughter. And during the moment where Mildred was about to call the police on Vita it added to the drama the scene was attempting to imply. The sounds were also very clear. It sounded appropriate, not echoy unlike other movies I previously saw. Overall I give this movie two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is just an amazing movie. To me, it's one of the movies that define the 1940s. The cinematography is dark and mesmerizing, and the whole story being told in flashback is very engaging. I can't think of another film noir at the time like it. What makes this movie so great is the characters. This is one of the best casts I've ever seen in a movie. The characters are so well written, so different, and so complex, that the emotions just leap off the screen. There are a lot of great characters, but the best performances come from Joan Crawford and Eve Arden. Eve Arden is amazing as Mildred Pierce's greedy daughter. She's such a horrible person, but that's what makes her so interesting. Joan Crawford is great as the title character, giving possibly the greatest female performance of all time. She's intelligent, she's hard working, she's loving, she makes her own decisions, and that's a breath of fresh air. She's a strong female character, but she doesn't come off like she's trying to prove something to men. That's a problem a lot writers have to this day; not being able to make a strong female character. Either they're horribly stereotyped, or they're only strong to prove a point to men. It's very rare to see a strong female lead that's just doing what she does naturally. I think the best thing about this movie is the relationships the characters all share. Like I said earlier, the characters are all very complex, and their on screen relationships feel all too real. You really get to know these characters, and you know where each of them is coming from. Some of them are kind of terrible people, but you understand why. In the end, Joan Crawford defends her horrible daughter, and you wonder why; but then you realize if you were in her position, and you had the same experiences as her, you'd do the same. It really is one of the greatest set of characters of all time, and great characters make a great movie.</fullReview>

The characters were all very interesting from one another and very different, but they all balanced each other out. Mildred seems to be a round character in her flashbacks(innocent) ,but flat outside of her flashbacks because in her flashbacks she was surrounded by flat characters. There were noir elements in this movie from low key lighting used to the shadows on the fire place flickering up onto the walls and when Mildred is on the dock there is only one thing lite up while the rest is very dark.The flashbacks help us put the pieces together and understand the film better. Mildred's flashbacks seem to show a lot of emotion in them, but seem to be dream like at times. The whole movie there is the mystery of who killed Monty. the police aren't sure who did it, but Mildred does. The movie leads you to character who kills the man through the flashbacks of Mildreds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The irresistible Joan Crawford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To many, Mildred Pearce is not a piece of film noir but I believe it has all the necessary elements to be considered one, and not only that but one of the greats. Directed by Michael Curtiz, he proves once again that he is a versatile director with such a colorful resume going from films such as this one to Casablanca. The film's strongest aspect is in it's writing. Each character is written intelligibly and most are quite likable, even the darker characters such as Veda are written to be villainous. Who ever thought you could find a vileness in a sixteen year old girl? The writing is only as good as the actors who make it breathable. Joan Crawford radiates in the title role, to the extent that we wonder how far she will go in order to please her daughter. I tip my hat off to Jack Carson who plays Wally Fay, a scheming character who's attempts at Pearce prove to be all but futile. He somehow managed to make his character a bit likable and humorous even if he's not always meant to be. This is a film that will entertain, even by today's standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for Milred Pierce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie; I don't think there is one bad thing I can say about it. I had never heard of this movie before and thought it would be just another mediocre movie from the 1940's, but I was wrong. Mildred Pierce portrays women in a completely different way. It shows how powerful and independent a woman can be, and that if she really wants something she will get it. Mildred does not let a cheating husband and a broken heart stop here; she is determined to do what it takes for her girls. The acting is phenomenal in this film; no one breaks character; not even for a second. Joan Crawford does an excellent job playing the strong, independent, loyal mother, Ann Blyth does an outstanding job portraying a stuck up spoiled snob, and Jack Carson never breaks the role of the upbeat and self-concerned Wally. On top of great acting the movie holds a story that keeps the audience very interested by having a few small stories inter locking with each other. The use of flashbacks also works very well with this film and helps the audience understand what is going on. The ending was by far the best part, giving you the "oh my god" "no way" feelings, although I had a feeling things would end up the way they did. There was not one moment of the film that I caught myself getting bored; I truly think it was a very fascinating film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred Pierce (1945)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is about a mother (Mildred Pierce) who becomes single and has to raise her two daughters by herself, the older (Veda) being selfish and snobbish and the younger (Kay) being a cheerful tomboy (who dies from ammonia). Mildred's goal is to be able to giver her daughter everything she wants, which just makes Veda more selfish. Her daughter gets so selfish she tries to take Mildred's husband, but ends up killing him when he refuses. I give this film a 9 out of 10 because it was considerable better than i thought it would be. The filmed seemed almost boring from watching the trailer, but after watching the film I knew I was wrong. i definitely recommend watching this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is often called a film noir, but it is really not. For a film to be called film noir there needs to be a gritty realism to it. This is merely melodrama. Film noir penetrates deeply into character. This film is propelled not by character exigencies but by the Dumbest Possible Action theory, and also by having any real world issues too easily solved, as well as that old Hollywood standby- style over substance. But, because the work is immanently melodramatic, the foregrounding of style over any deeper elements, actually makes the film more enjoyable as a guilty pleasure. And, on that score, Mildred Pierce is terrific. No, it is not a film filled with cosmic profundities nor with great performances for the ages. But, it is a film loaded with charm and appeal, and a 'who cares if it's over the top?' attitude that damns any claims of pretense, and frees the film into being itself, that guilty soap opera that you love, but don't want anyone else to know you love, unless you tell first. Go ahead, now. It's your turn!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic mystery with a great lead actress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was excellent in that it has you hooked from the moment it starts! The first scene involved a shooting in a noir-type film shot where not much is seen and the camera is placed in clever angles to avoid seeing who did the crime and such. Overall the film had great photography everywhere and did a great job in the many dark scenes lighting up the actor's faces and bodies. A good amount of the film is shot in a police station and what I enjoyed was the seemingly endless angles of shots that were taken in the police station. The camera moved all around to show the police station and the sheriffs at work as well as the detectives. The sound was great as well as all of the special effect sounds (thuds, gunshots, etc).Overall I really enjoyed this movie and would even consider re-watching it because it's hard to follow the first time around seeing as how the entire movie is a flash back for the most part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curtiz masters a film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Curtiz is probably better known for his work with Casablanca, which is in no doubt a great film. But I'd have to disagree with most people and say that Mildred Pierce was a better work. I thought there was just more to this film than Casablanca with the sets, lighting, costumes and writing etc. Casablanca was great and I liked it and thought Curtiz did well on that too but I thought Mildred Pierce was a bit better.Mildred Pierce gives us another film noir classic full of suspense and drama. We come to hate Veda (Blyth) through her wonderful, yet obnoxious acting job as the daughter of the flawless Joan Crawford as Mildred Pierce. Veda is greed driven, and we are lead to think shes undergone a change, but she has not, and ends up falling in to the arms of her Step-father.Mildred Pierce played by the great Joan Crawford was convincing, heartwarming, and moving. Her character was flawless in the movie and she portrayed her that way. Mildred wanted the best for her family (seen by satisfying her daughters wants,which is costly in the end), she opens up a successful restaurant, and is real and likable unlike her daughter and her newest husband.Through a wonderfully written storyline and script, we side with Mildred and cheer her through, and it takes a whole 111 minutes, to unfold the whole mystery behind the murder. It is worth every minute and is totally worth the ride. We end in a hope and sense of triumph as Mildred triumphs over her own struggles with her daughter, husbands, and restaurant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superior Noir Melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film noir melodrama, Mildred Pierce is perhaps most famous for being the movie that sensationally rescued Joan Crawford's career and brought her back to box office success and the stardom she had experienced in the 1930s. Her performance in the title role won her the Oscar for Best Actress. The story, adapted from a James M. Cain novel, is straightforward enough: Mildred's love for her daughter Veda (Ann Blyth) leads her through a series of catastrophes which she not only survives but uses to transform herself into a highly capable, wealthy and successful businesswoman. Unfortunately Veda is so thoroughly selfish and grasping, the more she gets the more she wants, as Mildred eventually realises (not before time, we the audience are thinking!). The story begins with a murder and is then told in flashback for much of the film's running time, as we gradually learn of the events which led to this violent climax. Crawford's melodramatic style works well in a movie which combines soap opera with noir thriller. Directed by Michael Curtiz and shot in classic expressionistic style by Ernest Haller (whose cinematography was also nominated), with a memorable score by Max Steiner, the film is a triumph of the talents who produced it. As the men in Mildred's life, Carson, Scott and Bennett all play their parts well and Ann Blyth is suitably repulsive as the daughter from hell. But the most telling line in the movie is left to Mildred's business associate Ida (a peerless performance by Eve Arden): "Personally, I think alligators have the right idea. They eat their young."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raising Cain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chronologically this was the fourth adaptation of a James M. Cain novel and the second from Hollywood (the first two were European) and it definitely raises Cain a notch higher than the previous years' Double Indemnity - and given the Indemnity was a collaboration between Billy Wilder and Ray Chandler that is quite an achievement. I note there are a large number of comments on IMDb and I haven't had time to read them all so it's possible that I may replicate some points. One of the things I enjoyed was the fact that the plot was so 'meaty' as well it may be with three major male and three major female roles plus another half dozen strong supporting characters including the uncredited - even here on IMDb - Butterfly McQueen. For a Hungarian Michael Curtiz had a surefooted grasp of American mores and keeps the movie rolling along at a fast clip. Crawford was at the height of her powers and her performance was well worthy of an Oscar; Eve Arden turned in her usual 'wisecracking broad' performance - always a delight, whilst Zachary Scott made the most of the dubious charmer. One to justify the 'they-don't-make-'em-like-that-anymore' tag. More's the pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling female-centred noir...Cain and Curtiz make a good combination...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While much of James M.Cain's steamy, trashy, oh-so-enjoyable hard-boiled novel MILDRED PIERCE is diluted (thanks to the Hayes Code) in the Curtiz-directed film version, much of the plot is tidied up and the script, and film, is much tighter and better for it. "Box-office poison" actress Joan Crawford was cast in the title role, and won an Oscar for her performance. The film is easily Crawford's best- never a great actress, she was instead a great star, and MILDRED PIERCE is probably the best example of this.Curtiz's direction is admirable in this well-made Cain adaptation, and the great black-and-white cinematography, full of shadows suggesting ambiguity, is a real plus for this film noir. The film, while nowhere near perfect, is nevertheless quite compelling, with Mildred, a housewife turned career woman, sacrificing everything for the love of her spoiled, vain and pretty much venomous daughter Veda (Ann Blyth, Oscar-nominated and absolutely infuriating). For her troubles (clothes, music lessons, money) Veda pays her back by sleeping with Mildred's rat of a second husband. Yes, she's one little bitch, that's for sure.The film, pure melodrama with a noirish bite, is well-cast with a number of solid supporting players. Jack Carsob, Eve Arden, Zachary Scott and Bruce Bennett all add considerable class (or with Scott's slimy second husband, none whatsoever)to the Warners production. This noir is unusual in that it is a female-driven narrative, with Crawford providing the voice-over narration (the film is told in flashback after a particularly exciting opening), and the two women, mother and daughter, having most of the available screen time.Overall, it's a pretty good film, not great (it slides into melodrama quite often and seems to take a little too long driving it's point home), but definitely worthwhile. While Celia Johnson (BRIEF ENCOUNTER) should have had her hands on Oscar that year for her phenomenal work in the Lean film, Joan does give you value for money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like this movie, you MUST read the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. I first saw it on WTBS (the SuperStation) one morning during summer vacation in 1981. Everything about the lighting, the plot, the dialog, and the fashions completely captivated me at 14 years of age.I've seen the movie many times and, a few years ago, finally read the book.The story and plot follow along parallel lines. The movie screenplay is a watered-down (though still excellent) version of the book, thanks to the production code. As I read the book, I was so shocked as the more intricate plots in the book developed that I kept gasping out loud again and again. I seriously wonder if a truly faithful version of the novel would have any possibility of being filmed even today.Here are a few contrasts between the characters and story of the movie and those of the book: Joan Crawford's Mildred is a bright shining light of a woman who sets her mind to bettering herself and becomes successful. The Mildred of Cain's novel is mostly depressed, neurotic, and frumpy. She obsesses about Veda almost to the exclusion of everything and everyone else (there's more about this below).The movie Veda, played so well by Ann Blythe, is an ambitious young woman who milks most any situation for what she can get. The brilliantly talented yet sadistic harpy in the novel is one step away from being a sociopath. Compare the movie's Veda, who at one point is a washed-up singer in a dockside saloon, to the book's Veda who is discovered to be a coloratura soprano, lands her own lucrative radio contract, and performs at the Hollywood Bowl.The power relationship between Mildred and Veda shifts pretty dramatically from the book to the movie as well.Whereas Crawford's Mildred seems to have a genuine motherly concern (if a tad obsessive) with Veda's approval, the book's Mildred is deeply obsessed with Veda in a way that feels creepy and almost incestuous.While Veda has power over Mildred in the movie, that only goes so far. Crawford's Mildred does eventually say no to her daughter. But in the book, Mildred never says no. And the result... well you really need to read this book.By the way, the character of Ida is an amalgamation of two characters in the novel. I much prefer the Ida of the movie to either of them (but that's my preference for Eve Arden showing).One of the best contrasts has an interesting historical insight.In the novel, Mildred's restaurant opens around the time that Prohibition was ending (the movie time frame doesn't have any clear markers except that we generally know it's set in the 30s). The historian in me was fascinated by the little details that Cain includes in the novel about getting the bar set up and functioning as a profit-maker in the restaurant.Mildred is heavily lobbied by her best friend and neighbor (one of the characters that Ida is created from) to start selling liquor in her newly opened restaurant. And, in contrast to the steely, decisive Mildred portrayed by Joan Crawford, the Mildred of the book worries and hems and haws about selling liquor, afraid that she might look bad in Veda's eyes. And, in the book, Veda must always have what Veda wants.Mildred is, however, finally convinced by her friend to sell liquor and, of course, she makes a killing.In the movie, Prohibition is never mentioned. Several characters have drinks served from the bar on the night the restaurant opens, so we know by inference that Prohibition is over by that time in the story.Really, truly... read the book. And then watch the movie again. You will not be sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the same level as Casablanca.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Curtiz was brilliant. This movie is underrated, in comparison to some of his other work. The greatness of this movie only validates the legacy of the golden age of Hollywood. This is because Mildred pierce is almost never mentioned in the lists of the greatest movies of this era. That era of movie-making was so great, that movies like this were common.Joan Crawford was dominant in her performance. She conveyed vulnerability, selflessness and tenacity throughout the movie. It is interesting to note, that Bette Davis rejected the opportunity to play the lead role. I believe that they were the only two actresses who could have excelled in the role of "Mildred Pierce." Max Steiner's musical score was outstanding as well. For those of you that know very little about his legendary career, he did the musical score for classics like king Kong, Casablanca, and now voyager.Unfortunately, Joan Crawford's movies are not as renowned as those of her contemporaries. This one however, is vintage Crawford, punctuated by her Oscar win for best actress for her performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is all you have heard.... and</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>then some...Mildred Pierce was made in 1945. Crawford is excellent as the mother who rises to the top, then falls. Initially a loving mother and wife.I confess as to being mystified as to the attraction of Mrs Biederhof- Bruce Bennnett was Crawford's husband unemployed, who treats her badly and leaves her stranded with two young daughters.Kay dies of pneumonia and Veda is the only daughter left. Naturally Mildred tries to nurture this relationship. Veda instead gravitates toward Wally (well portrayed by cynical Jack Carson). Ann Blyth is very good as Veda, angry at her mother, wanting a better life, she takes her mothers cars and gifts showered on her, but never gives Mildred the true unconditional love of a real daughter.Zachary Scott is Monty Beragon, a playboy who spends his time decorating the scenery. Pierce is attracted to him, inexplicably. Eve Arden has a few good lines, which we have heard reiterated many times such as ..."Now I know why tigers eat their young"...Some interesting noir sets, a Malibu beach house where someone is shot. Overall Crawford of course delivers and provides us with the crescendo she never disappoints and audiences love her for it!. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James M. Cain's tough pulp fiction was the stuff Hollywood could easily turn into film noir of the first class. They did it with THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE and here with MILDRED PIERCE.And JOAN CRAWFORD's tough shell (vulnerable inside) was the perfect embodiment for the title role, a hard-working, decent woman who wants a good life for her ungrateful daughter, Veda, (ANN BLYTH in an Oscar-nominated supporting role) and tries to avoid the machinations of two men on the make--JACK Carson, who has a heavy crush on her and ZACHARY SCOTT, the man with the snake oil charm who secretly lusts after her daughter.For comedy relief--what little there is--we have EVE ARDEN (Oscar-nominated in supporting role), who has some of the sharpest one-liners any scriptwriter ever gave her. "Personally, Veda's convinced me that alligators have the right idea...they eat their young." BUTTERFLY McQUEEN has her standard servant role and BRUCE BENNETT is sincere as Mildred's ex-husband who stays loyal to her in times of need.Michael Curtiz directs it in very polished style, beginning with the murder and the police station scenes and then turning to the flashbacks for the complete story. Reliable Max Steiner is on hand with a good score.MILDRED PIERCE came along at a time when Joan Crawford had left MGM and was hoping for a good script at another studio. Fortunately, it turned her into a bankable star again, brought her an Oscar, and she had several more successes at Warner Bros.Trivia note: Shirley Temple was considered for the Ann Blyth role at one point. Bruce Bennett celebrates his 101st birthday this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is full of fascination. The plot is interesting with a good twist. There are some great characters, all very well acted. Other reviewers have rightly praised Ann Blyth, Jack Carson, Zachary Scott, and of course Joan Crawford.One of the interesting features is the light the film throws on life in California in the period. It's been given something of the usual glamour Hollywood treatment, of course (e.g. all rooms in houses tend to be larger than in real life), but we see a lifestyle with modern features that would not become general in other western countries for some decades to come. It makes 1945 seem not that long ago.Another great feature is the lighting. It's as if everyone was trying to cut down their electricity bills by having as few lights on as possible. However, the lights that are on always conveniently shine precisely across the faces of the main characters, especially if it's Joan Crawford.On the downside, it's not very easy to believe in the so-called poverty of Mildred and family (before the restaurant empire). The Pierce house is in a street of very attractive detached homes, and doesn't appear in the least run down. Mildred herself never convincingly seems to be down to her last dollar. She claims to have been desperate for a job, but it all looks rather easy. Joan Crawford always had to look and act like a star. Despite her well-acted anguish later, I'm not sure she should have had an Oscar for her part. Maybe it should have gone to Ann Blyth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film noir classic is about a hard-working woman (Mildred Pierce of course, played by Joan Crawford - she really shows her talent in this) who would do absolutely anything for her daughter Veta. This movie shows her life and how she built up her restaurant from working as a waitress. The acting is superb, no complains there - I was especially impressed with Ann Bylth (I already knew Miss Crawford was a brilliant actor) who plays the manipulative, selfish, money hungry daughter who doesn't appreciate her mother one bit.I found it a bit predictable sometimes, like I knew who was the murderer all along. It did not surprise me at all, but this didn't stop me watching the movie and thoroughly enjoying it! I loved how the movie was set out and how it was retold, sort of backwards, it was very effective. The lighting, tone, acting, settings and overall 'feeling' all make this movie make it an essential to any film noir/melodrama lover... because it certainly is dramatic.One thing that slightly annoyed me - through no fault of anyone really - was that the police were completely illogical! Just because the main suspect's gun was used does not mean the main suspect did it... anyone could use his gun. Don't know what I'm talking about? You should probably watch the movie.. I recommend it.Mildred Pierce is a movie that keeps you on your toes.. I had the strange sensation of wanting to shout, "MILDRED, DON'T YOU SEE?" or, "NO, Mildred, NO!"

		<shortDescription>The beginning of Cain's decline?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS ?YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"Mildred Pierce"(1945),based on the novel of the same name, is one of three works by James M. Cain that were filmed in the 1940s; the others were the novellas "Double Indemnity"(1944) and "The Postman Always Rings Twice"(1946). This is the least suspenseful of them and this is achieved only through the use of a series of three flashbacks. If told as a straightforward third person narrative it would have had little impact. Cain did write the novel in the third person and admitted that in retrospect it was a shortcoming that caused it to lack bite. The film was directed by Michael Curtiz and the screenplay was by Ranald MacDougall.Mildred Pierce (Joan Crawford) is a hard working businesswoman whose husband has left her with two young girls to bring up. Mildred uses her housewife skills at cooking and baking together with a forté for organisation to establish a chain of popular family restaurants in Southern California in the early years of WWII. The war itself plays no part in the film but there are a couple of topical asides alluding to the war such as the shortage of nylon stockings. After the younger daughter dies early on from pneumonia the elder daughter, Veda, (Ann Blyth) becomes the centre of Mildred's love but by the time she is in her early teens has become a spoilt little brat. Mildred has little financial acumen and relies on her business partner, whom she has known since childhood, Wally (Jack Carson) for advice. Carson fits the part well and this is one of his better screen performances. He had worked as an Estate Agent with Mildred's husband and fancies his chances with Mildred as soon as she becomes separated and makes a clownish pass at her every time he opens his mouth. She remains aloof and eventually marries a wealthy playboy Monte Beragon (Zachary Scott).As the film opens we hear a series of gunshots in quick succession and then see Beragon falling to the floor, dead, inside his coastal mansion. A car standing outside is then seen accelerating rapidly away. The film uses the propaganda technique of the juxtaposition of unrelated scenes to give a misleading account thereby casting suspicion on Mildred. However about halfway through the film I could not help comparing the character of Veda with the real life tragedy of Lana Turner's daughter and the killing of Lana's husband in 1958. I then realised that it was Veda not Mildred who was the murderess. Truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction. Mildred is basically a good woman and is not portrayed as being in any way evil. It is here that the film differs substantially from Cain's story in that there is no murder in the original. In the other Cain films the lead role is a femme fatale, an essential film noir element who plots with her lover to murder her husband. In my opinion, without the femme fatale Mildred Pierce is definitely not film noir which requires an almost impossible to follow convoluted plot whereas that of Mildred Pierce is straightforward. Other missing elements would typically include a private investigator, a crooked gang-master and darkly lit outdoor scenes. To have been a film noir the character of Mildred's daughter Veda would have to have been developed into the main lead.Some final thoughts: The 17-year old Ann Blyth gives an exceptional performance as Veda and steals at least one scene from Crawford. Eve Arden as Mildred's restaurant manager cum girl Friday (Ida Corwin) turns in her usual stereotyped 1930s 'tough dame' performance. Not a film to be missed although not the best of Cain's work; written in 1941 it probably marks the beginning of Cain's decline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred, you smell of Crisco</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who saw Carol Burnett's brilliant take-off of this film called "Mildred Fierce," it's almost impossible to view this film today without a few laughs. Burnett's satire aside, "Mildred Pierce" is Joan Crawford's greatest rags to riches story and her greatest triumph. The film is based on the James Cain novel with a few differences. In the book, that brat Veda is a very successful coloratura soprano. I think Mildred tries to strangle her, after which Veda claims that she lost her voice and gets a lot of mileage out of it.Besides Crawford, Mildred Pierce benefits from its able director, Michael Curtiz, and a top cast including Zachary Scott, Ann Blyth, Jack Carson, and Eve Arden, who is very funny. Crawford does a great job in this highly entertaining film that one can see over and over again. Warners treated Joan well for a time afterwards, with "Humoresque," "Possessed," "The Damned Don't Cry," "Flamingo Road," etc. I actually prefer these films to a lot of what she did at MGM.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hollywood melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MILDRED PIERCE Aspect ratio: 1.37:1Sound format: Mono(Black and white)A downtrodden housewife (Joan Crawford) works hard to become a successful restaurateur in order to accommodate her spoiled daughter (Ann Blyth), leading to betrayal and murder...The movie which netted Crawford her first and only Oscar and revitalized her flagging career is a top-class melodrama, beautifully constructed by screenwriter Ranald MacDougall (from a novel by James M. Cain) and photographed in moody black and white by ace cameraman Ernest Haller (HUMORESQUE, REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE). Aimed at the market for so-called 'women's pictures' which had proved especially popular during wartime, the movie contains all the ingredients of a modern day soap opera, piling on the agony for its beleaguered heroine who emerges - broken but unbowed - from the subsequent wreckage. Crawford is strong and confident in the title role, and she's given excellent support by an outstanding cast, including Blyth (KISMET, THE HELEN MORGAN STORY) as her vicious, mean-spirited offspring, character actor Jack Carson as a wily businessman who pursues Crawford romantically and loses out to a succession of unsuitable paramours (including a deceptively suave Zachary Scott in one of his first screen appearances), and Eve Arden in a hilarious turn as Crawford's friend and business colleague who doles out the wisecracks like candy (after being leered over by Carson, she retorts: "Leave SOMETHING on me, I might catch cold!"). Attentive viewers will be amused by some eyebrow-raising (not to mention censor-baiting!) dialogue which hints at a lesbian subtext in Arden's character! Director Michael Curtiz (ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES, CASABLANCA) orchestrates the dramatic highlights with visual aplomb - the confrontations between Crawford and Blyth are particularly strong, though Crawford's stubborn devotion to such an ungrateful daughter seems faintly ridiculous at times - and the sumptuous production values represent Hollywood craftsmanship at its finest. Beautiful, doom-laden score by Max Steiner, incorporating a number of cues heard earlier in NOW, VOYAGER (1942), and vivid, expressionist set designs by Hollywood veteran Anton Grot. Butterfly McQueen (immortalized forever in GONE WITH THE WIND) appears uncredited as Crawford's maid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I TOOK TIPS AND WAS GLAD TO GET THEM!!!!"This movie is very delightful but you have to take it as very flavored very much in its very quaint way. That's what's so fun about it. Of course, I identify with Veda. Mrs. Biderhof was distinctly common! And if you are going to buy something it might as well be the best! How can you argue with that! It's the icky stickiness of these characters that makes them so adorable. That Veda is a little barracuda! And let's not forget if it hadn't been for Veda thoughtfully and caringly humiliating her mom about her waitress uniform, the silly cow would never have had the notion of opening up "mildred's". She admits that it was only after that P whipping that she thought "Why not open a restaurant?" Next thing you know the savvy gal is on track and choo chooing away! "Oh and you must see our booths there are 10 booths at 4 places per booth that makes 40 places!" How successful she became clever woman with her little girl behind her, that's right!! Oh but the movie has tender moments! Another awesome line is when Mildred mentions her 1 daughter and Monte says "I thought you had 2 daughters" "Kay died." "You've had your tough breaks but you're gonna be a big success now!" I mean most of this movie is pretty ludicrously expressed even though Dark Truths are depicted and that's what makes it so rich. If you Pooh Pooh and can't stand the film at least watch the chapter in which Mildred and Veda have their confrontation on the staircase. Veda: With this money I can get away from YOU! From you and your CHICKENS and your pies and your KITCHENS and EVERYTHING THAT SMELLS OF GREASE! I can get away from this SHACK with its CHEAP furniture. And this town and its DOLLAR days, and its women that wear UNIFORMS and its MEN THAT WEAR OVERALLS. YOU think just because you made a little money you can get a new HAIRDO and some expensive clothes and TURN yourself into a LADY. But you CAN'T, because you'll NEVER be anything but a common FRUMP whose father LIVED OVER A GROCERY STORE and WHOSE MOTHER TOOK IN WASHING!!!!"If you love this movie you MUST read the book. The book is so different and so brilliant and they two complement each other. It's so amusing how Hollywood had to "clean it up" by . . . introducing murder, basically. It's fantastic to see movie read the book and savor the spaces between them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Everybody has a mother"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce has sometimes been described as a film noir told from a woman's point of view. It's a neat little summation, but it does the picture a disservice, and really stems from the misunderstanding that film noir is a genre in its own right, as opposed to the mode and style of a certain era. Mildred Pierce is first and foremost a drama of strength and integrity in its own right.Like most dramas, the bulk of its weight is in its performances. This was the only occasion upon which Joan Crawford won an Oscar and, to be fair, probably the only time she merited it as well. If you read up on Crawford's private life, it appears she was engaged in some kind of acting almost all the time ? seducing her directors, making her children call her "Mommy dearest" while abusing them behind closed doors, all smiles and kindness in her interviews. It seems that now that she had been placed in the realistic role of an ordinary person as opposed to a chorus girl or a society dame, she was able to carry her finest shamming and crocodile tear-shedding onto the screen. It really is an outstanding performance. Crawford runs the gamut of emotions, each of them appearing painfully real. But what is perhaps the icing on the cake ? and this goes beyond mere affectation ? is that she truly makes us believe in Mildred's well-meaning innocence towards her daughter. You can see it, for example in the fond way she looks out at Veda returning to the fold.And it's solid performances all round in this picture. As the manipulative daughter, Ann Blyth makes herself convincingly obnoxious, conveying snobbishness with a little twitch of her nose that makes you want to reach into the screen and slap her yourself (although I do wish they had cast Shirley Temple in the role as originally planned ? that would have given it an intriguingly dark twist, and I'm sure she would have been as good as Blyth, if not better). Eve Arden, with her deadpan delivery, provides comic relief from the most innocuous lines. And Jack Carson, normally a light comedy actor, does his greatest dramatic work, keeping the essence of his usual swaggering buffoon type, but toning it down so he resembles a regular human being. This was probably director Michael Curtiz's influence. Curtiz was always looking to scale down the performances of his cast into something tastefully subtle and realistic.Such an attention to actors was unusual for a director like Curtiz, who on the surface at least was very much a technician, interested in lighting, arrangements and camera movement. And yet there is always a fine balance in a Curtiz picture, and one that by this point in his career he was able to strike with professional precision. On the one hand, he was able to ladle on his arty indulgence, and this is very obvious in various attention-grabbing moments and the general clutter and complexity of every shot composition. And yet on the other hand Curtiz was totally dedicated to bringing out story and character without losing his audience in the fanciness of his images. In one of his most elaborate shots, during the early scene where Crawford meets Carson at his bar, he has the camera track across to the singer at the other end of the room, pulling our attention towards her. But to disguise the move, he has a couple walk across the frame in front of Crawford and Carson, and the camera then follows them, smoothing out what would otherwise be a very distracting manoeuvre.Mildred Pierce then is not the feminine equivalent of, say, The Maltese Falcon or The Big Sleep, fast-moving yarns with wise-cracking dialogue, full of bums and badasses. It's far too real-world, not nearly stylised enough for that. Besides, all those PI noirs were really just amoral versions of the old 30s gangster flicks. And in its own way, Mildred Pierce is a darker, less moral take upon all those dramas of divorce and blackmail from the previous decade. It is more than anything like a dysfunctional retelling of Stella Dallas. And it works incredibly well. By stripping out all those Legion of Decency niceties and really pushing at the extremes of what was acceptable taste, Mildred Pierce is all the more hard-hitting and compelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Strangest of Films Centering on Strong Leads Who Obliterate Female Stereotypes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think Doris Day could have ever starred in a film based on a James M. Caine book. Caine wrote about the darker sides of the feminine sensibility quite removed from the stereotype of the pure virgin whose "reason d'etre" is to become the stay-at-home wife working in the kitchen, having children, and waiting for her husband. Love them or hate them, Caine's female characters are ambitious, sexual, driving, sometimes amoral and even occasionally criminal. In Mildred Pierce, Caine grabs the idea of the stereotypical American Female, turns it on its head, smashes it, and finally burns it up until it is such a crumbled mess on the floor that it no longer even remotely resembles what it had been in the first place. This darker view of womanhood was somewhat challenged by the likes of Doris Day in her films of the 1950's but could not overshadow the femme fatale of the 1940's. Thank God.In Mildred Pierce, the title character (played by Joan Crawford in the film of her career) is the strongest, the toughest, the most intelligent, the most hard-driving, and the most ambitious of the entire cast. As we learn, we find that her drive is motivated out of necessity rather than greed or social status. Right behind her is her daughter Veda who turns out to be almost as strong-willed as her mother, yet her desires center around money, luxury and recognition. Simultaneously, most of the males are wimps. These men if men they can be called are not exactly pawns, but rather they are direction-less and irresolute individuals, vulnerable to Pierce and her daughter Veda. The males cling to the advantage that their sex still had in the 1940's but they can sense it is slipping away from them. Mildred Pierce is a new breed of woman, willing to take matters into her own hands. They cling to Mildred often because of what she can provide for them rather than a desire to take care of her, ultimately reversing the traditional roles of men and women.The opening scene gets you hooked immediately, and I'm really giving nothing away as what follows happens in less than the first minute of screen time. A nicely dressed man in dinner clothes is shot and killed at some kind of vacation house at night. We don't know who he is, why he's there, or why he's been murdered. And we don't see who killed him. The film cuts to a car outside the house where a woman who looks one helluva lot like Joan Crawford gets in and drives away. She eventually returns to the scene of the murder with another man who appears to be someone she knows very well. She then locks him inside the house and makes a hasty getaway. Evenutally there is an investigation and Crawford is brought to a precinct for questioning. It is there she tells her story that began four years before the events at the vacation house. Most of the film is as flashback.Her story begins with Mildred's life as a devoted wife of the rather spineless Bert Pierce and mother of two beautiful daughters, the younger a tomboy and the older having refined tastes. For her hard work and loyalty, Mildred loses her weak-willed husband who is a failure in the business world. He feels guilty for not being able to provide for his family so triangulates with another woman, presumably to escape from his obligations and his shortcomings. We gradually learn their eldest daughter Veda longs for luxury and aspires to become a member of the rich and affluent. She feels dissatisfied at her middle class life. After separating from her husband, Mildred joins the workforce and eventually opens her own restaurant business, all the while resisting the pursuits of sex-hungry and money-hungry males. She rarely fulfills their sexual appetites but often gives them money. One of Mildred's suitors, Monty, is a moneyed do-nothing who wants Mildred's affections but doesn't want the responsibility that goes with it. Then her daughter becomes closer to Monty while she is simultaneously dating a wealthy boy from the upper-crust. Her beau is as wimpy as the other males but he has millions.This film is completely engrossing, absorbing, and unpredictable thanks to a first-rate screenplay and an absolutely tour-de-force performance by Crawford who stays completely in character. Even when she engages extraordinary behavior, for some reason she projects complete honesty. The stay-at-home wife and mother trans-morphs into a being far more intelligent and resourceful than most of her male counterparts, with the exception of only one character. And she is always at risk while the males in her life don't quite know what to do with themselves. Ann Blyth as the beautiful yet materialistic and ulterior-motivated daughter Veda keeps with up with Crawford stride-for-stride. She, like her screen mother, is no stereotype wall flower. She has the savvy and shrewdness to manipulate situations to achieve what she desires. These women are anything but white-gowned blushing virgins. If she saw this movie, Doris Day must have wept.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred Pierce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Michael Curtiz (Casablanca), I didn't know anything about the plot of this film, but I was very interested once I got into it. Basically Mildred Pierce Beragon (Oscar winning Joan Crawford) is told by the police that her husband Monte (Zachary Scott) has been murdered, and through a long flashback you find out how and why it happened as she tells her story. Basically Mildred finds out her husband Albert 'Bert' (Bruce Bennett) was constantly seeing Mrs. Maggie Biederhof (Lee Patrick), and she demands a divorce. To keep the money coming in, Mildred took a job as a waitress, and when she feels ready, she decides to open her own restaurant, with the help of Realtor Wally Fay (Jack Carson). After the death of her daughter Kay (Jo Ann Marlowe), success with the restaurant was the only thing she was determined to continue, and she manages to make a chain. She had an affair with owner of her original restaurant property, Monte, and they later get married, and live together with a maid and of course Mildred's living daughter Veda Pierce Forrester (Oscar nominated Ann Blyth). Veda is very badly spoilt though, Mildred married Monte to give her a third of her businesses, but it later became clear something was going on between Veda and Monte. So in the present day, at the police station, it has been proved that the murder was committed not by Mildred, jealous ex-husband Bert or Wally, but daughter Veda, when Monte said she didn't have the guts after what they'd been through. Also starring Oscar nominated Eve Arden as Ida Corwin, Moroni Olsen as Inspector Peterson and Veda Ann Borg as Miriam Ellis. This film apparently saved Crawford's flagging career, but she didn't go to the Oscars in person, she just heard it on the radio, and got all the press into her bedroom afterwards, I think this true scene was featured in Mommie Dearest. Anyway, she is brilliant as the emotionally drained (both in the good way and bad way) mother, her supporting actors also give great performances, it is just a very watchable classic film noir melodrama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Screenplay. Joan Crawford was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The suppressed woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How will Mildred Pierce succeed in a male-dominated/patriarchal world? She will be forced to take on the characteristics of the men who control it. Unfortunately, Mildred never makes a complete transition to a man and ultimately fails in her endeavor. She has a strong desire to be the loving mother who gives her daughters everything, as well as the drive to be the primary caregiver (partially out of necessity) through her entrepreneurship.  In situations where Mildred is successful at one thing, she fails at the other. For example, when her business is booming, her home life dwindles and Veda continues to grow more apart from her and closer to her male sugar daddies (Monte and Wally). In fact, the opportunity/necessity for Mildred to start her own business grew out of the fact that she was a single parent in a failed home. She doesn't hesitate to kick her husband out and she doesn't take long to decide how she will cope with the lack of income. Eventually, the tables are completely turned, as she takes on the responsibility of providing for Monte. Her very active position in the relationships and her ability to cope well with being on her own (individuality) indicate male characteristics in Bachofen's theory. Secondly, Mildred fails when she attempts to be what is typically characterized as feminine. During her weekend jaunt with Monte, she is out of touch with everyone, including her husband and children. It is during this weekend that Kay becomes deathly ill with pneumonia. She comes to Kay's side just in time to hear her daughter's touching last word, `Mommy.' The death of Kay, Mildred's tomboyish daughter, comes to foreshadow Mildred's final downfall. Kay, representative of the male side of Mildred, dies, as will that side of Mildred in the end. What message do female viewers take from this film? Succeeding in a male-dominated world is impossible. Even the temporary success of women will be thwarted by men, forcing women back into their secondary positions. We can clearly see this in the film's final scene. Mildred is back with Bert, the man she wanted to escape from so badly. She is someone's wife/woman again and she's going to return to the same domestic chores the women in the Hall of Justice are doing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1945 dialogue, tragic flaw, and the use of shadow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching this 1945 "classic" (which I didn't really love or hate), I noted or pondered three elements. First, the style of scriptwriting. It may be obvious, but things like dialogue have changed so much over the years in Hollywood cinema in terms of realism. Every character in this film, no matter what their personality, is quite witty and conversations between these characters, if not (or sometimes even when) melodramatic, tend to be verbal sparring matches. Scriptwriters of that time also were more blatant (less naturalistic) in the way they used dialogue to point out themes in a film. The question is, does one admire the carefully planned, structured, and timed dialogue of old, or that which strives to feel like dialogue one would hear in real life?I also wondered how different people feel about the title character, and how we are supposed to feel (from the filmmakers' viewpoint). For myself, she was not despicable, but her tragic flaw, her spoiling dedication to her selfish daughter rendered her difficult to identify with. When a main character acts in ways you completely disapprove of, you tend to look upon misfortune that befalls the character with a "serves you right" attitude, compared to the empathy you feel while watching a character you feel you understand. So, I wonder if some who watch the film understand Mildred's weakness to the point where they not only feel her pain throughout, but maybe even feel her tearful joy in the scene when Veda decides to come home. A person like me of course was busy scolding Mildred and warning of the bad that would inevitably come out of the situation.***********SPOILER AHEAD*****************The last thing I noted was a stylistic element; the use of shadows, chiaroscuro, etc. This film would truly suffer from colorization, for the tone is set from the beginning through the use of darkness to suggest the shadowy feel of the story. Mildred walking on the pier, sitting in the police station telling her story, etc. The most effective use, however, is while we are finding out the truth about the murder we saw at the beginning. First, Mildred walks down the stairsThe last thing I took note of was a stylistic element: the use then walks into the light; we then see what she sees, the shadows of Veda and Monte, who come into the light once they realize Mildred's presence. The temporarily impenetrable blackness of the three moving figures is positively spooky; so, while communicating other ideas one can easily figure out (coming into the light, etc.), the use of shadows lends the film a mood which enhances the seedy, film noir-ish aspects within its melodrama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another user argued that "Mildred Pierce" is not film noir. Technically, it's a classic 1940's 'Woman's Film'-- that is, it's about a woman, and the struggles she faces because she's a woman, aimed at a female audience.However the film *does* use many film noir devices. For example, the voice-over narration of some parts, the absence of chronology in the storyline, the inevitable downfall of the protagonist (that's not a spoiler, it's the first thing that happens), and the dark, atmospheric nature of many of the shots are all classic film noir characteristics.For these reasons, fans of film noir are likely to enjoy the film, and its classification as film noir is justified.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the finest films to come from the Warner Bros. studio in the 1940's was this 1945 classic for which Joan Crawford won her only Oscar for Best Actress. The story is classic soap opera at its finest, with Crawford as the title character, a women determined to make a life for herself and her two daughters after her husband leaves her. Her eldest daughter Veda, played by Ann Blyth, is a vain, selfish child who worries what others will think if they find out that her mother is, as she puts it "a common waitress". Eventually Mildred makes it and begins her own restaurant chain, but Veda becomes even more selfish. Veda even gets married to a young man she doesn't love, then lies about being pregnant, forcing the young man's wealthy family to pay her $10,000.00. The scene with Crawford and Blyth, where Veda reveals that she is lying about the baby, is still one of the most mesmerizing scenes ever put on film. Quite simply a film that definitely deserves to be called a "classic".</fullReview>

A very materialistic and simultaneously confused child, ' Veda Pierce' came to life by another excellent performer Ann Blyth.By all means I liked the movie for its good cinematography, strong screenplay and the story.

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. Joan Crawford gave the best performance in her life as a mother who does all she can to provide for her children after her husband leaves. Unfortunately she has a very selfish spoiled daughter who does not appreciate anything her mother does for her and the daughter that adores her dies of pnuemonia.It is said that Veda's rotten personality was shaped by her mother's constant doting, but I beg to differ. I think that Veda was rotten from birth and probably in need of psychiatric help as well. What other reason would she choose to sing in a seedy bar instead of appreciating the fine life her mother gave her and all because her mother wasn't born into money like Monty Baragon. Mildred Pearce worked very hard to be wealthy and any daughter should be proud of her mother. But not Veda. Being a descendant of royalty was what Veda really wanted.But all of that aside, Mildred Pearce was an excellent movie. The performances of Jack Carson, Ann Blythe, Eve Arden and Zachary Scott were excellent. The actor who played Bert did pretty well but I think he could have taken more acting lessons. But the performances of the other cast members were so good that he didn't hurt the picture of all. In fact, I loved his character.This film is a must see for all lovers of movie classics.

		<fullReview>Many film lovers will identify a watershed movie that signaled Hollywood's drift away from Hays Office values and censorship, and MP is a good candidate -- I propose the precise moment when Veda Pierce announces she is to have a baby out of wedlock. Today, to achieve the same impact and to show the same degree of degradation, young Veda Pierce would have to have ended up as a stripper rather than as a cocktail singer. But what is surprising is the degree of impact and relevance that MP retains.Observe the timeless issues this wonderful film explores: female dissatisfaction with domesticity; the need to juggle work and children; the battle of the sexes; the need for self-advancement and self-actualization. And consider the other dimensions which make this a uniquely American moviegoing treat: how inherited wealth dampens the work ethic; is fast food good or bad?; what role there is, if any, for lazybones in a workaholic society; sexually harassing males, and how women are forced to work alongside them.A women's picture this may be, but from an era when Hollywood treated the genre as a worthwhile field deserving of the best scripts and directorial resources. No Oprah-esque simpering here; it is laced with bite and testosterone from the sound of the opening gunshot. The much underrated Joan Crawford knew this was the role of her lifetime and gave it her all, but with surprisingly effective understatement. "Mildred Pierce" is now out on DVD, and all should see it, and learn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce the movie is only secondarily about a woman named Mildred Pierce. First and foremost it's about an actress named Joan Crawford who at that point in her career was entering the "I have survived being fired by Louie B. Mayer, and now I am emerging as an icon" stage. Crawford was, by the time of Mildred Pierce, a franchise operation, or like a popular canned product, so familiar to moviegoers that you knew you could utterly rely upon it--if that's what you liked. And in Mildred Pierce, you get the real Joan-the image, the eyebrows, the Mount Rushmore face, the will power, the stance, the furs, the held-in angst, the stoic suffering, the sacrificing, and finally the overcoming. Wohh, Daddy! Movie heaven! Or so audiences were taught to think in 1945.Never mind that the film has an air of rank artificiality about it from first to last. Never mind that nearly all the characters are pasteboard. Never mind that the clunky, downmarket script rarely rises above the level of turgid soap opera or dares have a single line of dialogue that wouldn't pass muster with the masses of lower-middle-class audiences who sat in most of the seats in one of the hundreds of Warner Brothers theaters. Never mind that Anne Blythe's role as Veda, the scheming, duplicitous daughter, forces her to behave like one of those wind-up doll jokes: turn the key and she mechanically betrays you, over and over and over... Why Crawford as Pierce would ever love a creature as rotten as Veda is never explained. Unless of course Veda reminded Mildred of Joan Crawford. What a triangle that would have made.None of this is to say that the film doesn't have some interest-value. Jack Carson, normally an actor I back away from, manages to inject a certain pathos to the role of the ever untrustworthy Wally, a man who just can't seem to help himself when he commits his next act of betrayal or next attempt to sexually exploit the nearest female. The cop on the beat who stops Joan from jumping into the freezing water beneath the pier has a couple of wry moments, and the cold and misty pier set itself is impressive. Zachary Scott is more or less believable as Monty, Joan's second, ne'er'-do-well husband, and he has some good lines, particularly when Joan offers to give him a load of cash in order to get rid of him and he says "Thanks, Mildred. Now I know what it feels like to be tipped." And the noir lighting, as many fans of the movie have noticed, is first rate (even though Mildred Pierce is nothing more than a noir-wannabe, one with way too much sunlight, scenes of California beaches, restaurants that are cheerful and busy and profitable--and of course the leading lady's wardrobe. No wardrobe like this ever made it into any noir that I'm aware of).But none of the above-mentioned elements can save the film from itself. The scenes at the police station would likely induce laughter from today's audiences. For example, the unctuous chief of detectives, explaining modern crime-solving to Joan by way of a tinker toy analogy and with great solemenity, as if communicating some awfully complicated procedure to a retarded seven-year-old: "You know, Mrs. Berrigan, being a detective is like, wellllll, like making an automobile..." Minutes later, when the prime suspect---her first husband---is marched into the office to Joan's gasps of "No! No!," the chief, again in his undertaker-like presentation style: "Yes." (Pause) "He did it." (Pause) "Your first husband." (Pause) "Pierce." Loud audience gasps all around, one imagines.This is just skimming the surface, though. Several things swamp the picture in tedium, big-time. First, as already indicated, the movie obsessively focuses on Crawford, whose willed nondisplay of emotion is apt to induce widespread sonambulism throughout the theater. Possibly she had Garbo in mind and hoped to have the same effect on audiences. The only problem with that idea was that plain-Jane Joan was no Garbo. She had no mystique; in Mildred Pierce she looks most at home wearing an apron and wiping a fine sheen of sweat from her face while emerging from a hot kitchen. This is intriguing?The situation with the largely immobile Crawford visage was made worse by a closely related difficulty that no amount of script-doctoring could surmount. Unlike the leading character in the James M. Cain novel, the screenwriters crafted their Mildred Pierce as an inhumanly noble, patient and ever-understanding female, a sort of Culver City Mother Theresa type. Confronted with this paragon of selflessness, one might well wonder, Does an over-controlled goody two-shoes like this ever assume any but the missionary position in bed? Unlikely. (In the book Mildred is so often in and out of the sack with various bedmates that a turnstile might have been in order.) In the flick she's an elevated, yawn-inducing symbol of virtue reminiscent of nothing less than the Statue of Liberty, but with a better wardrobe.Worst of all, parts of the script were written at different times by an endless conga line of screenwriters (including, briefly, William Faulkner), while producer Jerry Wald chose bits and pieces from as many as a dozen treatments and gingerly dropped them into the film like a twelve-year-old experimentally dropping odd-ball items into a stew and hoping for the best.The overall result is a picture that doesn't work, whose parts don't convincingly cohere. More than anything else Mildred Pierce, the movie, projects a cold, eerie sense of anonymity. It's like an impressive, fully furnished house with all the interior lights blazing, but where there is no sign of human inhabitants and no owner to be found. It's one of the most unpersuasive films from Warner Brothers I've ever watched. From beginning to end, you never, ever forget you're watching a movie. Apart from a moment here and there, it doesn't draw you in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joan Crawford is magnificent in this film. So is Ann Blyth ( a revelation given the sweet little things she wasted the rest of her career playing). So is Eve Arden. But the men - it makes you wonder why the women bother! What a great couple Crawford and Arden would have made. Maybe all the good male actors were off fighting WW2 but surely there were more interesting guys around than Zachary Scott and Bruce Bennett, both lousy actors and unattractive physically and personality-wise. How much better Crawford would have been with something decent to work against. It is only Jack Carson, who I suspect we are not supposed to like, who shows any spunk at all.Still what a film! Ridiculously over-long, but directed perfectly by Michael Curtiz (maybe his second best film after "Casablanca"?) and the cinematography of Ernest Haller is sublime - the use of deep focus and lighting are amongst the best of all time. Great Max Steiner score too. The resonances with the stories of Crawford's real-life mothering only enhance the scenes between her and Blyth.Now just try to imagine the film with James Stewart as the husband, and Tyrone Power as the lover!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Typically overheated vehicle for Joan Crawford, a comeback movie for her at the time, one she lobbied hard for, eventually winning the Best Actress Oscar. James M. Cain's novel about a penniless single mother who works to make herself a success, losing control of her daughter in the process, was ripe opportunity for any actress to emote; Crawford takes the role over-the-top with rigid relish, shoulder-pads intact. She doesn't quite carve out an original characterization here, instead offering us another portrait in the Joan Crawford gallery (which is intriguing nonetheless). One can almost sense her go-for-broke determination, which certainly propels the movie through its standard soap clichés. Director Michael Curtiz gives the picture a rich, film-noir feel, Eve Arden is wonderful in a small part but, ultimately, this is just a notch or two above superficial melodrama. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a brilliant movie directed by Michael Curtiz. The movie was filled with drama, suspense, crime, mystery and romance. The entire movie was greatly written and directed to keep the audiences attention from the start to the finish. Throughout the movie you feel bad for Mildred, played by Joan Crawford because of how she is treated by her husband and older daughter.The best quality of the movie is the lighting. How it is used in specific scenes to portray suspense or help us develop feelings for the character at that time. Shadow lighting is used a lot especially when zooming in and out on Mildred. The use of three point lighting is used a lot throughout the movie and so is key and fill lighting. The use of different lighting throughout the movie was just beautiful. Capturing all the effects of individuals facial expressions was extremely brilliant.The twists within the movie kept the movie very interesting and it gave you an appreciation of how much someone could love another person so much that they sacrificed their entire life for them and everything in it.Love lost can always be regained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred the Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce, a comeback film for star Joan Crawford, brought her a well-deserved Oscar for best actress of 1945.Crawford, as Pierce, portrays a woman whose marriage to her husband, nicely played by Bruce Bennett, falters.Left with 2 children, a vicious older daughter played in a superb memorable performance by Ann Blythe and a younger daughter, Pierce must fend for herself.Learning the restaurant business in a hurry as a waitress, Pierce soon goes into business for herself. Along the way, she meets up with Wallie, played well by Jack Carson, as an adviser, and Monte Berrigan, a shrewd, cunning, gigolo forever remembered by Zachary Scott.Monte knows how to show Veda a good time. Too good;in fact.Veda fights with mom, tries to swindle her new husband by claiming she is pregnant, and slaps her mother when the latter finds out that she is not pregnant.Later, thinking that Veda will return if she marries Monte, Pierce does so, and in addition to the marriage, makes Monte a partner in the restaurant business.Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. How about a mother who finds out that her daughter is carrying on with her step-father? When confronted, Veda states that Monte will divorce her mother and marry her. When Mildred storms out, Berrigan calls Veda a tramp and proclaims that he'd never marry her. Shot dead for this statement, Veda pleads with her mother to save her stating that it's just as much her fault that the killing occurred.The film was shown in flash-back sequence where Mildred confesses to the killing but the cop is not buying the confession.An all-star cast including Eve Arden, as the fast-talking, wise-cracking Ida, are perfect.What a mother wouldn't do for a child is the theme of this movie. The film has all the emotions depicting a broken marriage, the death of the younger daughter, a fast-talking gigolo, an ungrateful, impossible daughter beyond control, and that money can't solve all the problems.****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce (Joan Crawford) performs spectacularly in this edge of your seat classic movie, proving once again why she is considered one of the best. During a time when many women were restricted in their endeavors due to social stereotypes, Mildred is a force to be reckoned with not allowing anyone to get the upper hand on her?well anyone but her daughter, Veda (Ann Blyth). All Mildred's ambition and motivation is merely the product of her need for Veda's love. Veda's love however is solely devoted to herself and her own desires. Going to any means to achieve Veda's love will Mildred make the ultimate sacrifice? I give "Mildred Pierce" and Joan Crawford ten stars for their dramatic scenes and inspiring originality. "Mildred Pierce" became a classic must see movie the moment it was released!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joan Crawford's big, Oscar-winning comeback from being labeled Box Office Poison as exquisitely chronicled in Mommie Dearest, Mildred Pierce is a fine jewel in a noir setting. A chillingly sordid tale of a woman, Mildred, who sacrifices everything to give her ingrate of a daughter, Veda (played to perfection by Ann Blyth), the best that money could buy. Manipulative Veda, never one to be satisfied so easily sets her sites on her own stepfather, Mildred's husband, the ineffectual and foppish Zachary Scott."Alligators have the right idea?they eat their young," says Professional Best Friend, Eve Arden, who is delightful, as is Professional Ninny, Butterfly McQueen, as supporting players in Mildred's grand scheme. And as Mildred, Joan is Joan To The Bone, struggling up from utter tackiness to even greater tackiness with her string of pie and chicken restaurants, all for the greater glory of Veda. But Veda isn't impressed with Mildred's money and its smell of grease. She fakes a pregnancy to blackmail money from a boyfriend, runs off to become a hoochie dancer, and seduces her mother's husband, all on short order. And then things go from bad to worse. And the movie goes from divine to sublime.</fullReview>

All the elements that constituted the trademark of the studio are here: the bigger-than-life star (Crawford), the crafted- if not anonymous- direction by veteran Curtiz, the Max Steiner score, and the story with noir elements twisted beyond craziness. The gallery of characters in this one is memorable, a staff that challenges the most inventive soup opera: the gigolo, the pimp, the materialistic daughter turning prostitute, the sick daughter, the asexual friend. The split ensemble against the unmovable Mildred. The good Warner Bros' films are portraits of the `American Nightmare' and this is one of them.</fullReview>

Then they separate and leaving Mildred to raise her daughters on her own. Elder daughter Veta (played by Ann Blyth) goads her mother about their lack of money and in response Mildred opens a small restaurant. And Realtor Wally Fay (played by Jack Carson)advises her while making numerous rebuffed passes and introduces her to Monte Barogan (played by Zachary Scott)whose property becomes the first chain of restaurants. Meanwhile Mildred has an affair with Monte. Then money- hungry Veda pretends to be pregnant by wealthy Ted Forrester, which reminds me of Fargo (in a sarcastic way) in the part of this review where it says she pretends to be pregnant in which in the movie Fargo Frances McDormand's character was actually pregnant but Veda in this movie was not actually pregnant what a coincidence (not). What was Director Michael Curtiz even thinking while making this pointless bucket of slop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred And The Daughter From Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mildred Pierce" is one of the best of Classic Hollywood film-making, a period when a movie goer can sit and become engrossed with the story, the characters, the costumes. This film has everything: light comedy, drama, and mystery.The mystery starts right at the beginning when a man is repeatedly shot, his last word being "Mildred." Just when you begin to wonder who "Mildred" is, you meet her, on the brink of despair. You soon find out that the dead man was her husband. We see through flashbacks that things for Mildred wasn't as rosy. Her first husband, Bert (Bruce Bennett)leaves her. Not letting this get her down, she takes a job as a waitress so she can learn the restaurant business. Soon she has a chain of restaurants (Imagine a IHOP.). She even finds a new man, Monte Beragon (Zachary Scott), who sold her the site of her first restaurant.There is a reason why she does this: Her daughter, Veda (Ann Blyth). Veda is the daughter from hell. Incredibly selfish and greedy, she constantly treats her mom like garbage, only wanting money and to live in the lap of luxury (She even tricks a boy into marriage just to have money!). Everything that Mildred does is for her spoiled brat of a daughter. Soon, her life starts to spiral out of her control. The end result is in the murder of Monte. But who murdered Monte and why? The answer is pretty surprising.Joan Crawford gives an incredible performance as Mildred, the constantly put-down mother. However, you can't watch this film without wondering about Crawford's own relationship with HER daughter! Comic relief provided by Eve Arden as Ida, her former boss now Manager at her restaurants. She has some of the best one-liners in the film ("Personally, Veda's convinced me that alligators have the right idea. They eat their young!"). Also funny is Jack Carson as Wally, who tries throughout the film to get after Mildred (At least twice a week, according to him.).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curtiz, Cain furnish Crawford with luxury '40s vehicle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rumor has it that both Bette Davis and Barbara Stanwyck were considered for the mid-40s film adaptation of James M. Cain's novel of Depression-era ambition and twisted mother love, Mildred Pierce. Stanwyck would have created a sensation, but Joan Crawford, who finally copped her Oscar for this role, doesn't do badly, either -- it easily ranks among her best work (which, as time goes by, wasn't all that bad).Sick of her domestic prison, baking pies for wealthier women, Mildred throws out her husband and pins on an apron for a paying salary in a cafe. She has a knack for the food business, and soon opens her own fried-chicken-'n'-waffles shack so she can buy stuff for her snooty, avaricious daughter Veda (Ann Blythe). But nothing Mildred does can keep the smell of kitchen grease from the Veda's delicate nostrils, so Mildred marries an "aristocratic" wastrel (Zachary Scott) for position. But does that keep the little witch happy? Well...Cain was one of the more sensational writers of his day (such a strong writer that he still reads well today, when even Steinbeck and Hemingway are looking a little long in the tooth); his novels furnished texts for three key films of the freighted forties: Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity (the pick of the litter), Tay Garnett's The Postman Always Rings Twice (stagey and a bit overrated), as well as this, which still offers unalloyed delight and meticulous craftsmanship. In keeping with the homicidal theme of the other two movies, the scripters of Mildred Pierce incorporated a murder plot quite missing from the book; yet it works surprisingly well, giving rationale to the elaborate series of noirish flashbacks out of which Curtiz constructs the story. In the process, many of Cain's alkaline social observations fall by the wayside, but what the hell; the book's still in print. In its depiction of the inchoate aspirations and driving demons of a slice of the Southern Californian restless middle class just before wartime, Mildred Pierce is one of the pinnacles of movie-making in the 1940s, probably the most accomplished decade in American movies.</fullReview>

Her children are dreadfully spoilt by her. But only one of them is affected by it, the oldest one Veda who is the biggest bitch on earth. She's not like Scarlett O'Hara who we all know is really a bitch or one of Bette Davis famous characters like Julie Marsden of Fanny Skeffington but who really we all love. Veda Pierce is just a complete bitch. I hate her. Anyway Mildred gets a job as a waitress and over the years works her way up and in the end has a run of resturants. She's now rich. Over the years the younger daughter who we liked, who had spunk has now died. Veda has become even more dreadful. There soon comes an ancident that causes Mildred and Veda into a huge argument and they don't speak to eachother. So Veda gets a job as a singer in a sleezy bar. Mildred soon begs her to come back home once she's discovered the way of her daughters lifestyle. But Veda says "your lifestyle isn't good enough for me". So Mildred marries a man who has the lifestyle her daughter wants just so she'll come back to her. In the end she does, then after a couple of months she discovers that they've been having an affair with eachother. And after Mildred discover's this she storms out of the house and then the husband turns to Veda and refuses to marry her calls her a cheap little tramp so in anger she shoots him. Then of course Veda begs her mother to help her out of the situation.Watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joan Crawford was made for movies. There's something so extreme, so garish about her face that it almost seems right when punishment is inflicted on her.And what manners of misfortune visit her as Mildred Pierce! There's more misery packed into its 109 minutes than you'll find in a week's worth of Lifetime weepers.Yes, this is the kind of movie where a character coughs three times and then two scenes later dies of pneumonia. Lots happens in Mildred Pierce, but it remains dramatically inert; most scenes consist of two characters talking about another.Talk, talk, talk. The people in Mildred Pierce tell each other what they're going to do (or what they've just done) and make pronouncements about themselves at every opportunity. It's a wonder any of them can stand each other for five minutes, much less the years the story covers.I understand that James M. Cain, who also gave us Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice, considered his novel a departure from his usual fare. But this exposition-filled adaptation gussies up what's fundamentally a straightforward women's drama with seedy, sordid intrigue and a whodunit.You can call Mildred Pierce a film noir, but that doesn't make it one. It's *shot* like noir, but in every other respect is a standard melodrama. Michael Curtiz, who just three years before had delivered all-time classics Casablanca and Yankee Doodle Dandy, no doubt made the movie he wanted to. It just doesn't stand the test of time. What heralded contemporary movies will play, 60 years from now, like this Mildred Pierce does? Two other demerits for Mildred Pierce: Its racist, comic-relief treatment of Butterfly McQueen- at one point, we're even supposed to believe that she doesn't know how to answer a telephone! The actress, well-known by 1945 for her performance in Gone With The Wind, goes uncredited; a slight at the time, Mildred Pierce is so now unintentionally funny that this omission seems almost merciful.And the second black mark is Crawford's rep as Mommie Dearest. Since the movie hinges on the inherent awfulness of Mildred's daughter and yet can assign neither blame nor credit to Mildred's parenting, it's almost impossible for the knowing viewer not to invoke Ms. Crawford's alter ego. (No wire hangers here, though.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joan Crawfords popularity while at M.G.M. was on the decline, so after Crawford was asked to leave M.G.M. she quickly found a new home and that new home, as everyone knows, became Warner Brothers Studio, where Studio Boss Jack Warner decided it was time that "Qyeeb "Bette", Bette Davis, was given a little competition. Davis' star at that time was on the decline to the point that she would show how far she would go to make a movie work in "Beyond the Forest" which isn't a bad movie at all and has become a camp classic! In Bette Davis' daughters, book "My Mother's Keeper" by B.D. Hyman, she related that Joan Crawford would send her gifts, and not just for her admiration of her talent, it went a little further than that, but Davis would send the gifts back stating that she didn't have the time to respond with gifts to Joan, and that this is what caused her to turn viciously on her children as related in Christina Crawfords book, "Mommie Dearest". Latger on when Joan and Bette filmed "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane", the gifts and Davis' refusals of them surfaced once more! So, Joan Crawford wanted to do "Mildred Pierce" awfully bad, but there was one fly in the ointment -Michael Curtiz who didn't want her in the movie at all! He made a vicious wise crack about her being a no talented bum actress with her high fuh-looten airs and her shoulder pads! So, Crawford told Jack Warner that she would gladly test for the role to show Curtiz that she "was" a talented actress, and after Curtiz saw the test, he was so impressed with what he saw that from that time on the two of them got along, and, of course, their collaboration would lead Joan Crawford to win the Academy Award Oscar for the best actress of the year which did not set very well with Bette Davis since she was offered the part and turned it down. It's my own opinion but I'mm sure that one thing that might have ticked Bette Davis off, although there is no mention of it, is that the theme from "Now Voyager" is used in Joan Crawfords love scenes! The question is, since Davis had admiration for Max Stiener, the films composer and the composer of probably most of Bette Davis' movies, why did he do this? Now, what about Little darling, vicious, murderess Veda? Well, the actress who wanted to play the role very badly was Shirley Temple, and she said so in her autobiography of her life, and she almost got the role. There have been rumors persisting throughout the years that Shirley Temple "did" film some of the scenes and was fantastic playing the murderess Veda and that they are still kept under lock and key in the 20th Century Fox film vaults, but, whatever happened, it was decided that Shirley Temple's "Good Ship Lollipop" image would be damaged forever if she completed the movie, but if she "had" made the movie, it could well be that not only Joan Crawford would receive and Oscar but Shirley Temple as well. As a result, Ann Blythe got the role, and, as we all know, was so slouch in the role.I have never been a fan of Joan Crawfords, but there are two movies I've always loved watching her in, "Mildred Pierce" and "Torch Song" in which she returned to M.G.M. to be in a musical. Quite a good dancer, but her songs were dubbed by India Adams which were the songs that were deleted from "The Band Wagon" with Fred Astaire. I guess the reason for my reaction to Joan Crawford is that she was just too masculine for any man to fall in love with, and it shows in these two movies, especially "Torch Song"! "Mildred Pierce" is an excellent film, and it's like going to the opera except the actors are thiner!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crawford vindicated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not entirely sure that this film wasn't written by Joan Crawford's ghost. A humble but hardworking woman sacrifices everything for her daughter, to be met only with spite and ingratitude -- "Christina, I mean, Veda, I'm seeing you for the first time, and you're cheap and horrible!" Oh, and all the men around her are either spineless or slimy -- my, my, what a girl has to put up with to make it in the movie, I mean, the restaurant business. But no matter. This is a great film, both on a cinematic and a camp level. Joan is beautifully photographed, which makes those silent-film histrionics she retained from her early career move bearable. Her best moments are all without dialogue -- walking in the rain, despondent; listening to that heinous daughter complain about the cheap dress her Mom bought her after baking cakes for half the neighborhood; resisting the advances of her weasel gigolo fiancé with a raised glass and a firm jaw. Stylistically, it's an odd hybrid of film noir and "woman's picture." The movie qualifies as a film noir because the screen is almost constantly edged in darkness, plus, the dialogue and story are underpinned by a cynical knowingness about human nature. The only character in the film who is oblivious to Veda's evil is poor Mildred, and even hers is a willful blindness ("I'm seeing you for the first time" indeed!). It's a "woman's picture" because it could only be a woman's story -- men (especially not in the movies) don't conquer through sacrifice and compromise, which is just what Mildred does. All the men in her life are so ghastly you have to wonder if our Mildred isn't a bit tempted for a roll in the hay with her devoted, slightly mannish assistant, Eve Arden (who doesn't seem to have ever played anything but a wisecracking sidekick, but hey, find a niche and fill it). But the best performance in the film really is Ann Blyth's. Producers originally thought she might be too sweet for the role, but it's that seeming sweetness, which turns saccharine then bitter, that makes Veda a compelling villain. If Veda had been too shrewish or vixenish, the movie would have been thrown way off kilter. So rent this movie and see if you don't reconsider your opinion of Joan Crawford. Like Mildred, Joan fought hard for success, and did a lot of things she wasn't too proud of. But how else was a woman supposed to succeed in a pre-feminist, capitalist society?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'll Never Forget Her."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce is a story that could've worked had it not been completely misdirected by not a restraint of emotion, a tempered control of emotion, but an offensively negligent lack of emotion. I don't know if James M. Cain wrote the original novel the way this film is scripted, but there is a flaw that redefines the word "flaw" in this wreck of a film.I promise that I will not give away or reveal any spoilers or any twists by discussing the following plot points: We have Mildred Pierce, played by Joan Crawford, a housewife who dotes on her two daughters while her husband cheats on her. They soon divorce, leaving Mildred to raise their daughters by herself. The older daughter is constantly saying thoughtlessly snobbish things about their lack of money and high social position. In response, Mildred proposes opening a small restaurant. A flirtatious hot shot real estate agent and old friend of Mildred's advises her and introduces her to a mysterious and seductive man, Monte, whose property becomes the first of a chain of restaurants. Mildred's younger daughter dies of pneumonia. Mildred has an affair with Monte. The money-hungry older daughter constantly exploits and uses and steps on everybody she feels fit to in order to get to the top of the social ladder and get away from her mother, but her mother will do all she can to keep her happy. I'll stop there.Let's pull back and focus on the scene wherein Mildred's younger daughter dies of pneumonia. Once again, this is not a spoiler, because the film begins at the end, and it is indicated that Mildred only has one daughter now. So, the daughter dies, Mildred leans on her for about ten, fifteen seconds, leaves the room (LEAVES THE ROOM!!!!!!!!), and says the words, "I'll never forget her." WHAT? I never use capital letters when I review films on this site, but I've never been so angry before when commenting on a film. The screenwriters actually thought that a mother, one that they wanted to portray as caring and sensitive and possibly vulnerable because of her unending love for her children, would ever lament their extremely prematurely deceased daughter by saying, "I'll never forget her." Then, anyway, she's back to work making money for the snobbish, shamelessly selfish daughter who doesn't deserve it. Later, the Monte character asks Mildred, "I thought you had two daughters?" Mildred replies that one died. Monte apologizes. Mildred says, "Let's not talk about it." Is this realistic one iota?!?!?!?!?! NO! From this point on, I didn't care the way the story was supposed to make me care. In fact, I did the opposite, because it would be one thing if she were a victim of unconditional love, but it's not at all in her character to be hopelessly vulnerable like that if she could treat her younger daughter's death with such disdain, like she was a favorite couch that went missing. Mildred seemed tugged not by the other characters by way of her deep love but by the contrivances of the script by way of unknowingly forcing it, completely unaware of the cruel lack of real emotion it has.The film rapes us by infuriating us with a story that would frustrate us in that good, entertaining way if it were well-written, but instead drives us insane because there's no reason to care for anyone. Everyone in it is bad at the core. We only hate the villains and are frustrated by the decisions and mentality of the emotionally devoid character design of Mildred.I will grant that Joan Crawford gave a wonderful performance, for what it was worth. I will also grant that Anne Blyth was effectively wicked as Mildred's shockingly horrible older daughter, yet it has been said that she was playing herself and the reason her career was so short-lived was because she could never play anyone else. What murders the film, on top of the one misdirected, badly written scene that manages to tangle up the rest of the movie, is Bruce Bennett, some washed up schmuck some unwitting dope of a casting director managed to dig up to play the husband. I have never seen worse acting in a mainstream movie. I honestly have not ever seen worse acting in a mainstream movie. This man could screw up a fried egg. I wouldn't hire him to play a Storm Trooper. I can't believe that it was possible in the silver screen era to get away with such atrocious acting, because even today, the worst actors are not even this bad. They at least try. This guy was so bad, it was like watching a scarecrow puppet show.This is the most overrated hunk of chaos I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred Pierce (1945) **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joan Crawford won her only award for the title role here, but her performance wasn't anything outstanding in my view. Indeed, while I found MILDRED PIERCE to be well photographed and directed, it never appealed to me on a personal level. I have nothing against "chick flicks" as a general rule or anything, but this one was really more of a woman's film about how a strong-willed housewife can divorce her husband, regain her individuality in this dog-eat-dog world of ours, and then set out to be a successful businesswoman all on her own. That's great for Ms. Pierce, but it didn't make for very interesting viewing for me. I did enjoy the confrontation scene when Crawford matches wits with her spoiled rotten daughter, but that couldn't make up for the way Crawford allowed the kid to walk all over her during the course of the rest of the movie. ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the the cinematography was great in this film, I did not enjoy it. Right off the bat Veda comes off a an annoying spoiled brat and she does a great job off keeping it up through out the whole movie. Not only is she a spoil brat buy she signal handily ruins her mothers life. Being someone who is very close to there mother and has a very nice loving mother this made me very angry and probably is the main reason why I didn't enjoy the film. I also felt that this film made men out to be filthy pigs who only care about money and sex. The two main male characters who Mildred has relationships her ex husband and Monte cheat on her, Monte has the nerve to with her own daughter. Wally is made out to be a sleaze ball always making advances towards Mildred.The things I did like was the great cinematography. There lots of dark shots the only there faces light up like when Mildred catches Monte and Veda. I think just because of who I am and my values drew me back from enjoying this movie but would recommend it to people who like old murder mystery films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>liked everything but the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there were many things that I enjoyed about this movie very much, I did not enjoy the story. It was interesting for Mildred to be the 'lone' woman in a film noir as opposed to there being a 'lone' man and I commend Curtiz for making that jump, but otherwise I did not enjoy the story. I thought that Veda was a very spoiled girl, which made it difficult to like her character, and I have never been a Joan Crawford fan since reading Mommie Dearest that even if I tried to like the plot and story, I don't think I would have. On the other hand, I thoroughly enjoyed the cinematography (which is what I look at in most movies anyway), and I thought that the lighting really made you feel that it was Mildred against the world. I understand how many people enjoy the movie, and the acting was very well done, even Crawford's, but I definitely didn't enjoy sitting through it, and would much rather watch Curtiz's much-better-done Casablanca.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I could give this movie a negative score I would. You can figure the movie out the whole way threw. If you have nothing better to do with your life than watch a spoiled little girl act like a brat for and hour and a half please rent this movie. This happens everyday and it drives me crazy and its whats wrong with this world. Little brats that feel like they're owed something but don't contribute a things.The movie was awful!! The filming was fine but the storyline... what a joke. If you could'nt read past it then there is a major issue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildred Pierce was not my favorite film, it was boring and really hated to watch it. Veda was really annoying and was one of the reasons why I wanted to turn off the movie. Yes I know she is a known villain but come on how annoying can you be for two hours? I just thought they could have picked someone else to act in this movie. If they did i would of LOVED it. But I was a trooper and finished the film. I thought it was a boring plot, it didn't jump at me. The sounds were alright more towards so-so. I didn't see any camera work that I was really impress with. I thought it was just an average film that I would recommend no one to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is it about people and old films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read a couple of the reviews for this film and they are all stunning. And to all you people out there who love old films I'm sorry but this is a below average crime thriller. The film attempts to be really clever and attempts to keep the audience guessing but the twist is just so obvious. Of course the daughter was the murderer. The fact that the film is old does not make it a good film. The black and white is not the a quality mark. The film sucks on all fronts. As I said the plot is ridiculous, the acting is some of the worst I've ever seen and the characters are boring and completely uninteresting. The scene with the small children continues to make me laugh because even by the standards of the time for children that is really bad acting. This tendency that old movies are great or classic is a general thing. Now movies like Casablanca or Citizen Kane I can understand because these films are classic but this piece of garbage, you have got to be kidding me.I am told that the film was really provoking for its time and to that I can only say: I don't care! The fact that the film WAS provoking just proves to show that the film isn't any good today. As I see it for a film to remain good it has to be good now and forever. Examples of this could be Godfather or Alien. I'm sad to say that Mildred Pierce did not stand the test of time and therefore my final grade is: * out of ******</fullReview>
