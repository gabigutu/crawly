		<fullReview>West Side Story, one of my personal favorite movies of all time and without a doubt my favorite musical. Why do I love this film so much? Because of it's high energy, great actors, terrific songs, awesome dance numbers, and beautiful love story. As an updated Romeo and Juliet story, we visit the streets of Manhattan, two gangs of different ethnicities, Tony and Maria, the two fall in love by are torn apart by the gang's hatred for each other. Sounds pretty basic, not to mention we have dancing gangs, they don't really fight, they just dance, yeah again sissy, but not in this story! The crew and cast put their heart and soul into this film and it truly paid off as this is the best picture of 1961.In the streets of Manhattan the Jets, led by Riff, and a rival gang of Puerto Rican immigrants, the Sharks, led by Bernardo begin to rumble. The police arrive and tell the "hoodlums" to get off the streets. The Jets discuss challenging the Sharks to one last all out "rumble", that will decide who gets control of the streets, and they will deliver the challenge to the Sharks at a dance later that night. Riff decides that his best friend Tony, a co-founder of the Jets who has left the gang to work at a local store, would be the best member of the Jets to present the challenge to the Sharks. When Riff visits Tony at the store, Tony initially refuses Riff's request to meet with the Sharks, but he later changes his mind. At the bridal shop where she works, Bernardo's sister, Maria complains to Bernardo's girlfriend, Anita. Maria believes that Bernardo is overprotective, never allowing her to have enough fun. Bernardo arrives and takes her to the dance. At the gym, the Jets, Sharks and girls are greatly enjoying themselves, but the rival gang members and their girlfriends remain apart. Tony and Maria see each other, become infatuated, almost going into a trance-like state and begin to dance, then embrace in a kiss. Bernardo pushes them away from each other and orders Maria home, and tells Tony to stay away from his sister.Tony discreetly visits Maria outside the fire escape at her home and they confirm their love. The next day at the bridal shop, Maria sings to her coworkers about how happy she is. Tony arrives to see Maria, she pleads with Tony to prevent the rumble altogether, even if only a fist fight is planned, and Tony promises to do so. At the the rumble, the fight begins between two rival gang members. Tony arrives and tries to stop the fight, but is met with ridicule and mockery from Bernardo and the Sharks. Unable to stand by and watch his best friend be humiliated, Riff angrily lashes out and punches Bernardo. Drawing their knives, Riff and Bernardo fight each other, their duel ending with Bernardo killing Riff. Enraged, Tony kills Bernardo with Riff's knife! Tensions are now at an all time high as both gangs want to get even and Tony and Maria's love is being torn apart by all the hate.West Side Story is truly a special movie, I personally don't know why it's not on the top 250 IMDb movies, if you are going to watch a musical this is the one that I always recommend. We don't get musicals to this big scape any more, they don't have the same heart as West Side Story had. The actors are absolutely incredible, it's so weird when I watched a documentary on this movie, apparently Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer hated each other, but I guess that must help during the lust scenes because hate and love are practically in the same category when it comes to passion. But the true stars of the film are Rita Moreno as Anita and Russ Tamblyn as Riff, great performances from the both of them. West Side Story is a movie that has no flaws what so ever and anyone who wants to argue me on that, feel free to send me a message.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Uncompromisingly Great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I think I've seen just about every musical there is from the forties to the seventies, I'd never seen West Side Story until last night. An amazing omission on my part, as having seen it, I just think it's simply wonderful.I bought the DVD "on spec" in a CD/DVD exchange store in Sydney for $10. I've had it in my hand a couple of times before but have always put it back on the shelf. This time I went through with the purchase and am now wondering what could have come over me, not buying it before.Those here who have said you really need to watch it on the Big Screen are absolutely right. In my case I watched it using a video projector throwing the image, big, bright and beautiful, onto a 12 foot screen. The photography used the wide screen format uncompromisingly. There was no caution here to frame the action for possible television cropping, or even much consideration given to a 2.35:1 "Cinemascope" presentation. Super Panavision's aspect ratio is not as wide as Cinemascope's 2.35:1, and every square inch of screen space was used for one or another important element of composition.Bernstein's music is a tour de force. Having watched On The Town only a few days back, it was interesting to contrast the two musicals. On The town is, of course, 15 years or so older than West side Story, but a comparison between the two scores is chalk and cheese. You could tell that Bernstein was holding himself back in On The Town. It wasn't his project. The numbers were almost self-censored. But West side Story was his baby, and it shows.The sheer brilliance of the music, the enchanting daring of it, its raucous atonality coupled with sweetness of melody are awesomely impressive, as show-stopper after show-stopper is thrown onto the screen to continually up the amazement quotient, time after time. I played West Side Story loud, very loud. The surround sound knocked my socks off from the opening aerial ambiance of Manhattan streets to the orchestrations themselves. I remember Bernstein in the documentary about the concert version of West Side Story saying, aside to the camera, after "Cool, Boy" was recorded, "You know, this is pretty good..." One of the great understatements, even if coming from the music's creator.See this film. Play it loud. Watch it on a big screen if you can. If you do you may, like I did, sit there thrilled, swinging your head from one side of the Super Panavision screen to the other, trying to take in the overwhelming avalanche coming at your eyes, your ears and your heart. It was an almost perfect transfer from film to DVD: color, sharpness, depth. It's been a long while since I've watched a film with a silly grin on my face right through, sometimes gasping at the sheer knock-out brilliance of what film-making can be at its best. West Side Story was one of those times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dynamic and exhilarating landmark musical offering a still-topical spin on the age-old "Romeo and Juliet" story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a testament to the musical and theatrical brilliance of "West Side Story" that this teenage urban love story, set to Shakespeare's classic "Romeo and Juliet," has survived its outmoded 50s-style book (Arthur Laurents) replete with "Dead End Kids" posturings and corny, streetwise lingo (I still cringe when I hear the word "daddio"). For nowhere will you experience such electrifying, jaw-dropping choreography (Jerome Robbins). Nowhere will you thrill to a more exhilarating, passionate, full-throttled score (Leonard Bernstein, with Stephen Sondheim providing the libretto). And nowhere will you find a more dynamic, better-crafted musical that arguably surpasses its Broadway stage predecessor from overture to finale.Maria, a lovely, innocent Puerto-Rican girl ("Juliet") and sister of a formidable gang leader, falls for an opposing though reluctant white-skinned gang member Tony ("Romeo") with tragic results. Set in a tough New York neighborhood where the two disparate groups, the Jets ("the Montagues") and Sharks ("the Capulets"), battle for street territory armed with knives, zip guns and rocks, the determined love affair sets off a calamitous chain of events that, in the end, manage to instill hope in diversity. Topical enough?The strength of "West Side Story" is that it does not try to hide its stage roots. It still unfolds like a musical play. The film is expanded but the talented cast is not dwarfed by on-location surroundings or panoramic camera work ("South Pacific" fell victim to this). On the contrary, the cast lights up every single playing space with sure-footed aliveness and plenty of 'tude. Co-directors Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins stay true to the original, having the sense not to alter or butcher the score ("Man of La Mancha") or haul in a slew of new, untried songs ("On the Town", which actually worked for that musical). In a particularly "Wise" move (sorry), two numbers were repositioned to enhance or intensify the narrative flow. In the film version, the "Officer Krupke" number sparked by a goofy Three Stooges-like levity, is moved earlier into the proceedings BEFORE the serious rumbles start, serving neatly as a light and humorous anti-establishment statement. The tightly-coiled, finger-snapping "Cool" number is pushed way back, giving both song and situation a heightened impact as it goads and ignites the Jet's feelings of pent-up rage and retaliation AFTER their leader is murdered. Smart move, daddio.The late Natalie Wood has been crucified by critics for her ethnic portrayal of Maria ever since day one. It was not because of any political incorrectness at the time (reigning Hollywood white glamour queen goes Latino) for that hot issue didn't erupt until decades later. It was her limited range as an actress. But over the years, I have grown accustomed to Wood. Yes, despite the melodramatic leanings, the necessity of vocal dubbing (by the incomparable Marni Nixon), the flawed Puerto-Rican accent and the general overuse of Coppertone, I still feel for this Maria. What Wood does offer is utmost sincerity and heartfelt poignancy. So I'm one person who has gotten off the Natalie Wood-bashing wagon. Richard Beymer is another matter. An extremely weak, uncool choice for Tony, his toothy, freshly-scrubbed, chipmunk-like mug and awkward gait reads more like library assistant than gang member. Who would have thought Beymer would be the one to dazzle us much later in the totally cool and offbeat "Twin Peaks"? Still, Wood and Beymer commit themselves 100% and manage to create a credible, if not charismatic, love duet that doesn't get in harm's way.Since the film's emphasis is really on dance, it's the flashy second leads who provide the real firepower. Rita Moreno's smouldering Anita ("The Nurse") is a spitfire of anger and attitude, while George Chakiris as her Shark leader boyfriend Bernardo ("Tybalt") demonstrates slick, controlled menace. Both Oscar-awarded here, Chakiris, in his debut, proved a lightweight acting talent himself, never finding a role like this again. Russ Tamblyn as Riff ("Mercutio"), the recently inaugurated leader of the Jets, is a hotbed of jaunty, scrappy impatience. Both he and Chakiris are riveting as they demonstrate poetry in motion, leading a pack of Edward Villela-like tough guys into athletic, gravity-defying dance moves."Romeo and Juliet vs. the 'Hood" should be required viewing for all grade-school children solely on the basis of art and education. The adults already know the value of this treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm REALLY shocked this isn't in IMDb's top movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exceptional musical about the gangs--the Jets (Americans) and Sharks (Puerto Ricans) battling it out for a small section in the west side on NYC. Tony from the Jets (Richard Beymer) falls in love with Puerto Rican Maria (Natalie Wood) whose brother Bernardo (George Chakiris) belongs to the Sharks. Can their love survive? You probably know the answer but I won't give it away.An incredible musical--the songs have become legendary and the dance numbers are easily the most energetic and incredible ones ever caught on film. It was (partially) shot on location in NYC which helps and is full of color and life.Unfortunately there are problems here: Natalie Wood hated Richard Beymer--and it comes through loud and clear. There's a unbelievable lack of sexual chemistry between them and Wood gives a rare bad performance. Beymer is tall, handsome, muscular--and a total blank as Tony. The poor guy is trying but Wood's attitude obviously bothered him. Still everything else about the movie is great. I have a few minor quibbles: How did Tony know where Maria's apartment was?; "I Feel Pretty" is actually hilarious--check out Wood's "dancing"; the "Cool" number is great to look at but brings the movie to a screeching halt.But everything else works. Chakiris and Rita Moreno are just fantastic as Bernardo and Anita--their dancing and acting is just perfect--they richly deserved those Academy Awards they won. Russ Tamblyn is also very good as Riff (leader of the Jets) and shows some incredible dance moves. And look for John Astin in a hilarious bit at the dance.All the dances and numbers are good and the lip syncing is pulled off by Beymer and Wood pretty well. But the show stopper is "America"--that number comes right out of the screen at you full force. The lyrics are sanitized from the Broadway show but who cares? It still works.This won 10 Academy Awards--including Best Picture and Best Director(s). A true classic musical. I've seen it tons of times and I never get tired of it. A must-see. I give it a 10 all the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could hardly have failed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note the opening credits. I use the term "credits" loosely, because there aren't any. There's just a reddish orangish title card which changes colour ever so slowly while they play the overture. Now THAT takes courage. Obviously Wise was certain that Bernstein's music provides so much interest on its own that it would have been redundant to do anything but play it. And he was right. Bernstein simply wrote better music than any other Broadway composer of his day - much better music - and whether or not "West Side Story" contains his very best music, it's his very best musical. It would take a special effort to make a bad movie out of it.In fact Wise handles things very well. We get the same silent sweep over New York that he later gave us over Austria in "The Sound of Music" - the sweep that says, "I'm going to show you New York" (or Austria, as the case may be). The filming and the colours are stark and intentionally artificial: it does feel as if we are being shown a city. Performances are all fine.Of course, most of what makes this film great was already present in the musical. But what's wrong with that? Surely Wise shouldn't HAVE to spin straw into gold. A wise man - sorry - just accepts it with good grace when he is handed gold to begin with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An artistic triumph of the first magnitude...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shakespeare's classic 'Romeo and Juliet,' is transported by Robert Wise, beyond the conventional movie musical, to modern-day New York City... Shakespeare's Montagues and Capulets become two rival teen-age street gangs: the 'American' Jets and the Puerto Rican Sharks... The two young idealistic lovers enhance the attractiveness of two nice kids, caught in racial and ethnic barriers... They are victims of the intolerance, misunderstanding, and mistrust that seem to be ever-present in human society... The film (nominated for an incredible 11 Academy Awards) took home an incredible 10 Oscars including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (George Chakaris), Best Supporting Actress (Rita Moreno), and Best Direction (Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins). The opening of West Side Story is very innovative... As the overture plays, an abstract design on the screen changes color and becomes a breathtaking aerial view of the island of Manhattan... The camera finally swings down to the West side of New York, where the Jets are snapping their fingers as they walk the streets... Their hated Puerto Rican rivals, the Sharks appear, charged with aggressive energy... Both gangs compete for the control of the poor and filth neighborhood... Jerome Robbins's powerful choreography captures the explosive tension boiling in the big city slums... The streets (with their flick knives and razors) come alive with athletic young dancers... The tender lyrics and poignant music complement and balance the tough nature of the choreography... The songs advance the plot, and illustrate the action... They range from jazzy and feverish to lyrical to comical, and they are all richly evocative of the film's moods and characters... In "Maria," Tony gives voice to his feelings about the girl he has come to love... In "I Feel Pretty," Maria describes her own reactions to the miracle of love... Before their lives turn bleak, the two lovers express their joy in soaring music: Tony with his hopeful 'Something's Coming,' Maria with her entrancing 'I Feel Pretty,' accompanied by Anita and her teasing friends... Their love blossoms out on a poignant scene in "Tonight," and at a bridal shop ("One hand, One Heart") when both affirm their love for each other by celebrating a mock marriage ceremony... 'West Side Story' is a beautiful work of art with spectacular music and energetic dancing... It is surely the finest dance musical since 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.' The principal dance numbers are all terrific... The propulsive movement of Riff and the Jets as contrasted with the free movement of Bernardo and the Sharks... Rita Moreno is spitfire as Anita... Her skillful dancing and Latin temperament are perfect for the character of Anita, a fiery lady who leads her girls in an exciting mambo dance... "Life is alright in America" is possibly the most triumphant sequence of the film... A welcome tone of mockery is introduced, and the 'mambo' atmosphere makes you want to jump out of your seat and dance...'West Side Story' is a calculated milestone in screen musicals... It breaks new ground in its depiction of contemporary social issues in a musical... The motion picture explores with deep emotional resonance, a world of hate, violence and prejudice... It challenges all of us to struggle for understanding and justice... History will remember Leonard Bernstein as the most important American musical force in the 20th Century... He is one of the greatest conductors that has ever lived... In 'West Side Story' his superb music communicates directly with the heart...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In An Era of Great Musicals, "West Side Story" Was Among the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When they say they don't make movies like they used to, this is the sort of film they are talking about. Despite its flaws (and there are some), it is easily one of the best musicals ever made. Beginning with the overture and the opening scenes of New York City, circa 1960, it almost screams "classic." Some have criticized Natalie Wood's Maria (her dubious accent and the dubbed-in singing) or Richard Beymer's Tony (his slightly smarmy interpretation of the ex gang member gone straight), but the fact remains, their wholesome, fresh-faced characterizations defined the roles. And you simply can't top the film's instrumental score, its great songs ("Maria," "Tonight," "America," "I Feel Pretty," "A Place For Us," "I Have a Love," and "Officer Krupke"), its excellent choreography, or its very effective cinematography. Rita Moreno, as Anita, delivers what was probably her best performance in the movies, in particular her dancing and singing in "America," while Russ Tamblyn, as Rif, the charismatic leader of the Jets, is seldom given the credit he deserved. Natalie Wood on the rooftop, anticipating another meeting with her newfound love, is a vision of grace and innocence, while George Chakiris as her brother Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks, is very convincing as the persecuted immigrant/mean-spirited hoodlum. And its not as if these are the only actors who did a great job. A number of the other supporting roles are delivered with memorable professionalism, too. In fact, the cast as a whole is superb. This movie poignantly (if simplistically) explores the purity of first love, while tackling intolerance and racism head-on, avoiding the tired, politically correct clichés that movies of today too often wallow in. Despite the simplicity of the story, it is always an emotional experience, no matter how many times you've seen it. While it is true that the Academy Awards have become very politicized, and no doubt always were to a degree, this movie snagged ten of them when great movies were being turned out almost as often as mindless pap is today. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a now 50-year old, I first saw 'West Side Story' when I was about 7. It may have been the first movie I ever saw outside home (actually at a drive-in--remember those?), and it's certainly the most memorable of movies I saw during that time of my life (although 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'The Music Man' are right up there too). In fact, as I watch the DVD now, I'm reminded why when asked, I typically cite it as my favorite movie of all time. The story is hundreds of years old, and now with the onset of drive-by shootings, the threat to the community presented by the Jets and Sharks seems a little dated, but then there's the amazing Bernstein score, and the fabulous Robbins' choreography, heartbreaking songs by Sondheim like "One Hand, One Heart" and "I Have a Love," innovative camera work by director Robert Wise, and unforgettable performances by the luminous Natalie Wood and the phenomenal Rita Moreno.I'm not old enough to have seen the original Broadway play, but I saw a recent revival, and the movie even improves on the play by moving a couple of musical numbers around so they fit better with the plot. Great movie musicals are few and far between these days ('Chicago' sold well--I couldn't quite deal with Richard Gere as a song and dance man); I wish there was another 'West Side Story' in store to entertain me for the next 50 years of my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First time to watch? Get ready to have a feast for the eye, the ear, and ultimately the heart!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WestSide Story is an American icon, that reveals how today's world became global, that every modern democratic country of the Earth has every different culture mixed to live together in peace. So as you might guess WestSide Story is one socio-political movie that symbolizes post-modernism. This masterpiece also reveals the most frightening question that non-Americans -and undemocratic- keep in their mind, but afraid to ask: "What if America has never been existed?" Once you watched WestSide Story, you'll realize how post-modernism changed the world, that racism and vendetta are no longer conceptual.As a matter of art, WestSide Story combines a walloping score with exuberant choreography and spectacular screenplay to create a transcendent fusion of Realism and Fantasy, that will forever be a feast for the eye, the ear, and ultimately the heart. As a matter of movie concepts, the story line has the perfect progress beginning with the introduction of the two confrontational 1950s' New York city gangs, continuing with the love occurring between a girl from an immigrant group and a boy from a fanatical nationalist group, ending with the death of the gang leaders and the lover boy. When the story begins to progress, it becomes more and more fascinating through focusing of the lovers struggling to come together. There we admire successful acting of Rita Moreno(supporting actress), Susan Oakes and George Chakiris. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the truly great musicals of all time, its a shame that those who do not care for musicals have to vote to bring it down. If you do not care for musicals, then you should not vote a "1" just because you do not like ALL musicals. That aside, a great musical score with a great story to back it up. Leonard Bernstein out does himself in this movie. This is definetly a movie to see; an classic for all time. Like its trailer says, "West Side Story does not grow old."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still dynamic, after all these years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a late Saturday night. I'd done my chores and decided to relax with some needlework before crawling into bed. Looking over my tapes, I decided it was time to visit West Side Story again, after some years. It was a fine choice. I would catch myself with my hands idle, as my eyes tracked the dancing, the most dynamic part of the film. I reveled in the Sharks on the rooftop and the gymnasium dance. "Cool" was cool, as always. This is a musical that doesn't try to transcend itself. It just lets the music and dancing speak for itself (and offkey singing along is allowed at home). I've always felt that Richard Beymer was the weakest of the actors, and nothing has changed my mind. But he's easy to ignore in comparison to the outstanding performances of George Chakiris, Rita Morena (who dominates the screen and steals all her scenes), Russ Tamblyn and the rest of the supporting cast. I'll leave the experts to make the minute comparisons to Romeo and Juliet, and to the critics to point out all the flaws. I'll just say, let yourself drift back to the 50s, break out the popcorn and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 70-millimeter delight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when this film ran on NBC television about 25 years ago. After being beefed up with commercials, it had to be shown in 2 parts over two nights. I only saw it in the theater once when I was about 12, and had forgotten many visuals which were cut off on the television screen. So let me just say that the smartest thing MGM-UA could do is present a widescreen, 70mm DVD. It has a gorgeous restored picture (important for visual effects like the dissolve of Natalie Wood spinning around in the bridal shop which blurs and multiplies and finally erupts into multiple dancers who converge at the gym, or the first time Tony and Maria see each other against the blur of the dance competition on opposite sides of the screen) and pristine sound- probably the most gorgeous score ever composed by Leonard Bernstein. There are, of course, stage purists who scoff at the movie (and its many ghost singers), but I always thought the film's adaptation was superior to the stage show because it gave the story a more breathless, one-act pace. Some songs are reshuffled and re-staged from the original libretto, and the background score is given something of a theatrical makeover. And the dancing, of course, is peerless-- whether it's the "Cool" dance with the Jets in a low-ceiling garage, the "America" battle of the sexes with the Sharks, or even the delicate rooftop dance performed in Act 2 by Natalie Wood- bewitching in a white dress and re-living the moment she first fell in love herself. None of these wonders can prepare you for the mind-numbing, emotional, climax. A tour-de-force film show, clocking in at 152 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viewing WEST SIDE STORY last night on TCM for the first time in years, I realized what an impact this made on film musicals with its innovative use of dazzling choreography and high-flying camera-work that made it a cinematic experience rather than a stage-bound one.Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins directed this poignant and powerful musical with a talented cast of performers--Natalie Wood at her dewy-eyed loveliest as the Juliet-like heroine and Richard Beymer doing his best to bring some heart-felt passion to the role of the Romeo-like Tony, but he's too refined to be believable as an ex-gang member. At least he does have some chemistry with Natalie and obviously put his heart and soul into his performing. The voice dubbing for both is done skillfully, but I would have preferred a stronger voice for Beymer.Rita Moreno (not Chita Rivera as another commentator named her) and George Chakiris are beyond reproach as Anita and Bernardo--and all of the gang members do superb footwork and acting as the Jets/Sharks. Most impressive is the actor playing Ice (Tucker Smith) who figures prominently in the finger-snapping "Cool" number. This is the quintessential 1960s musical with some expert choreography (the rooftop version of "America" is a standout) and stellar work from everyone in the cast. Leonard Bernstein must have been proud of this film version of his Broadway musical. Robert Wise's firm control in blending the music with the "book" is craftsmanship at its finest.By all means, a musical that deserved all of its Oscars!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One could talk about this movie forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers: This movie is the timeless movie. No matter how many times I watch the Jets (or Sharks) moving or dancing over the streets, I never get tired of it. The prologue is one of the best, with the Jets surveying their turf, the others gets out of the gang members path as the music speeds up, one can really feel "this is their street and they love it". Enter Bernardo, and the music tones down to a more strained note.. "this is the enemy." Bernardo goes and gets his own friends, and the music speeds up as the Sharks moves across the Jets sign, a clear challenge. Then it continues on, until the inevitable fight at the ballpark, from which the story continues, and the rumble and the aftermath approaches.Even though I was no fan of the Tony/Maria story, I can watch this movie with absolute anticipation every time, due to all the other characters: Ice: the cool-est gang member ever, Anybodys: the persistent tomboy who wants to be a jet, Bernardo: a chilly adversary and Action: the brooding gang member with anger issues.And the songs.. Cool, Officer Krupke, The Quintet, the Jet Song.. if they don't keep you captured at the screen.. well, nothing will.All in all, a masterly done movie, where the music is as much a part of the success as the actors/characters.See this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard for me to write a review about West Side Story because all the superlatives have been written and said over and over again. What I think the main contribution of West Side Story to our culture is to interest urban American youth of the Fifties in both the classics and the American Musical Theater. A typical boy or girl going to Andries Hudde Junior High School and Midwood High School from 1959 to 1965 as I did was acquainted with the music and lyrics of West Side Story from radio, records, and television and if you saved up for a Broadway seat.You might not have gotten Oklahoma, you might have thought Carousel was quaint and you sure thought South Pacific was for your parent's generation, but West Side Story spoke to you. It was about young people just trying to belong, if you will looking for a place, in time and space for us. And wonder of wonders not only could the American Musical Theater speak to you, but when your English teacher told you about the guy who wrote the story that this was based on, well maybe that guy who writes in incomprehensible English, that William Shakespeare guy, maybe he had some other relevant things to say. West Side Story promoted literacy and taste for a generation and you can't get a higher accolade than that.It's a difficult production also because it involves skill in acting, in dance, and you've got to have a great singing voice to deal with Leonard Bernstein's music and Stephen Sondheim's lyrics. They got a really great cast together on Broadway with Larry Kert, Carol Lawrence, Chita Rivera, and the rest. They all sang and danced and acted these Shakespearean based roles beautifully. Unfortunately there wasn't a movie name in the lot.Acting and dancing can't be faked on the silver screen, but singing can be dubbed as it was for leads Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood. A lot of Rita Moreno's songs were dubbed as well though that America number is all Rita. She'd actually done musicals before, The King and I and The Vagabond King remake are two of them. The voices of Jimmy Bryant and Marni Nixon fit them perfectly.West Side Story is pretty, witty, and bright and the witty part comes from two ensemble numbers Officer Krupke done by the Jets and America done by the Pyerto Rican Sharks. Listen very closely to the entertaining social commentary made by Stephen Sondheim. These numbers together with the accompanying Jerome Robbins choreography are some of the best examples of all the components of a successful musical working together.The ballads like Tonight, I Feel Pretty, A Place For Us, require almost opera like voices to sing them. I'd get either the Broadway cast album or the cast album for this film as a must for a recording collection. I happen to have a bootleg recording of Judy Garland and Vic Damone doing a selection from Garland's TV show. It is beautiful and priceless.One other thing about West Side Story that is endearing for me. Pay close attention to the role of Anybody's. It may be the first time that a transgender individual was portrayed in a major motion picture, let alone one that was the Best Picture of 1961. IMDb gives very little in the way of information about Susan Oakes the actress who played Anybody's. But her performance is nothing less than a harbinger of what Hilary Swank did as Brandon Teena in Boys Don't Cry.Like the kids from Romeo and Juliet and 16th century Verona, Italy, West Side Story is about young people just trying to find a place in time and space, finding a new way of living away from the dumb prejudices of their elders. They almost break free too.West Side Story won 10 Academy Awards including a joint Best Director Oscar for Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise, Best Supporting Actor and Supporting Actress for George Chakiris and Rita Moreno and a flock of technical awards. It set a standard for stage and screen to be both entertaining and contemporary.And it's so pretty, witty, and bright.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The most beautiful sound?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The classic Hollywood musical, though popular with public and critics in its day, now seems to have more detractors than admirers. The screen version of West Side Story has found itself under attack from both sides, not only from "serious" film fans who consider all musicals to be frivolous and unrealistic, but also snobbish appreciators of the stage original like Keith Garebian, who described it as a "Hollywood vulgarisation"*.It's fair enough that West Side Story is something of a sacred cow for Broadway fans. Leonard Bernstein, although not as prolific as Gerschwin, Berlin, Kern, Rodgers or Loewe, placed himself on a par with these giants of musical theatre with this one score, a mix of edgy jazz and heart-wrenching melody. The Arthur Laurents story has enough bold changes to make the Romeo and Juliet tale work for the modern era, while still retaining the forceful core and emotional impact of Shakespeare's play. Then there is the choreography of Jerome Robbins, turning aggressive tension into dance moves, with complex layers and patterns that seem almost contradictory but work harmoniously. But what is really special is how all these things weave into each other. Bernstein's score references and repeats itself; for example the oft-heard whistle, the opening line of "Ma-ri-a" and the start of the baseline for "Cool" are all the same three notes. The choreography picks up on every subtlety of the music, and blurs the lines between dancing and fighting. Even the dialogue has a kind of snappy rhythm to it, allowing the talkie scenes to flow straight into the musical numbers.Walter Mirisch, who acquired the filming rights, knew what he was doing when he handed the project to two directors, Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise. Robbins had directed it for the stage, and there was really no-one better to ensure his own choreography survived intact for the screen version. However with no experience behind a camera, it was unlikely he could have tackled the whole thing single-handed. Robert Wise was the perfect partner for him, a highly professional and dedicated screen director, who had never done a musical before but had proved himself sensitive to rhythm and movement in pictures such as This Could Be the Night and I Want to Live!. Between them, Wise and Robbins have reproduced the synchronicity of the stage show, as well as extending it in a cinematic dimension.In the location-shot "Prologue", the camera becomes a part of the choreography, beginning with those jerky pans in time with the Jets' finger-clicking. This I believe was largely the input of Robbins, who was apparently fascinated by what cinema could do. He does some great work with colour, such us the red background that suddenly comes into view in that first close up of George Chakiris (Bernardo). As well as the dramatic scenes, I understand Wise was solely responsible for directing the less dance-orientated numbers such "Something's Coming", "Maria" and "Tonight". His approach is subtler, but he still cleverly merges image and music, keeping the camera close for the quieter moments, then pulling back as the song becomes bigger, allowing the backgrounds to become part of the tone. Wise also holds up the musicality elsewhere. One trick this former editor uses is to ensure that at key moments consecutive shots are jarringly different in colour and arrangement, which keeps that jagged rhythm going in image as well as sound.One major source of controversy was the changes to the cast. It was a fact in Hollywood at this time that non-singing actors would be cast in the lead roles, to be dubbed by non-acting singers. It's a shame I admit, but it's reasonable. Natalie Wood was a marvellous dramatic player and experienced movie actress, adept at emoting for the camera. Richard Beymer is not an exceptionally good lead man, but he is good enough, and at least looks the part. Still, one thing that couldn't be faked was dancing, and all the gang members are necessarily played by professionals in this respect. What is great about these supporting players is that they make dancing, singing and acting become one. Russ Tamblyn, George Chakiris and especially the magnificent Rita Moreno all dance in the way their character should move. Moreno, using her own voice for all but one number, continues to spit out her lyrics just as Anita would, treating each song as a piece of drama.But there are still one or two things for the theatre snobs to nitpick over. There is the re-ordering of several songs to take place at different times. This was done to keep the lighter songs in the first half of the picture and keep the darkening of mood towards the end consistent, and it works for the film. Bernstein apparently did not like this recording of his score, but it doesn't seem to have done the picture any harm. And there are of course those who will automatically object to a screen adaptation of anything on principle, but let's face it ? we don't really need to address that here do we? All of which leaves us with just the whinges of the pretentious film fans, who seem to think that cinema is only about "auteurs", film noir, nouvelle vague, the art house and bloody Stanley Kubrick. There isn't much to say to this bunch. All they need is to lighten up, stop being afraid of a little music and dance, and realise that gritty realism isn't the only way to make a point.*In his book, The Making of West Side Story, which is about the Broadway production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>West Side Story shines with filmic vigour, seldom displayed in cinema since its first performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The enchantment and hypnotism of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is distinctly united with Arthur Laurent's West Side Story in this cinematic rendition that materializes one of the greatest musicals to ever possess our screens. Screenwriter Ernest Lehman and directors Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins devote themselves to Shakespeare's masterpiece and the passion it holds, with solid commitment. West Side Story is an illustration of the relationship between texts, as it is a contemporary reiteration of Shakespeare's tragedy. Tony (Romeo) and Maria (Juliet) have fallen in love, undeterred by their feuding households and the conflicting gangs in which their commitment lies. In a real Romeo and Juliet manner, the star crossed lovers rebel against conventions and risk everything, including death, to be with each another, which opens up, not only the plot, but the heart of the story. West Side Story mirrors topics from Romeo and Juliet as it parallels a prohibited love and a heartrending end, as Ernest Lehman puts his own take on Shakespeare's play to construct a modern, unique romance. To the films praise, West Side Story hasn't abandoned intricate matters. The dialogue delves into the pointlessness of juvenile conflict along with discrimination encountered by foreign nationals, as two cultures come face to face, in the battlefield that is Manhattan. West Side Story delves into conflict among two gangs of juvenile delinquents with contrasting ethnic cultures. The young 'Sharks' from Puerto Rico are continuously tormented by 'The Jets', a Polish-American blue collar labour group. With opaque themes, meaningful melodies, and the spotlight on social dilemmas, a critical revolution in American theatre is born. Vicious encounters are acted in sweeping, cat-like dance, elevating towards a pounding upsurge as Bernardo's sister Maria falls in love with Riff's former accomplice Tony. West Side Story's attitude towards aggression is indeed distinctive. The film is more or less bloodless, with the knifing and gun firing acts unadulterated. Each brawl is extremely formalized and unconnected with realism, as feelings are displayed through dance, throughout the casts' mission of hunting and assaulting one another. Nonetheless, there are genuine perceptions of danger to certain displays, attributable to impressive dance compositions and the discordant attainment Bernstein creates, as the audience not only to see the violence, but feel it. The intensity of visually striking displays where individuals are killed is indisputably reduced, as this method empowers a grittier tale to be conveyed amidst its melodious structure.West side story begins as the camera falls majestically on New York City and meets 'The Jets', an assembly of deprived teens, lurching eagerly about a dilapidated playground. Their figures step delicately and passionately in constant automatic outbreaks of dance. This introduces West Side Story as a musical, displaying a captivating blend of love, misfortune, brutality, music and dance. The introductory finger-clicking arrangement is without a doubt, one of the greatest usages of dance ever known to cinema. In the emergence of the beat, an eager passion races through the juveniles resilient, supple bodies with electrifying dance routines, directed by Jerome Robbins together with the liveliness of the narrative. West Side Story pleasures in parts which are greatly missed from contemporary films, being one of the greatest musicals ever fabricated. Bernstein's film is unarguably impressive, composed of around twelve songs, with love songs such as 'Somewhere' and 'Tonight', instantly known. Leaving aside the pliés and pirouettes, West Side Story centres itself around a star-crossed romance, hidden amidst feuding families along with the effective disposition of clashing street gangs. This au courant showpiece, which parallels with Shakespeare's classic Romeo and Juliet, appears as modern today as it did during the films initial deliverance in 1961. West side story, which starred the beautiful Natalie Wood (Maria) alongside the charming Richard Beymer (Tony) as ill-fated sweethearts on opposing sides of a Manhattan acrimonious dispute, lives on to be one of the most courageous and fervently convincing musicals of all time. West Side Story achieved ten Oscars, including Best Directing for Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins. Aesthetically, the film is a delight. Whilst the attention of the viewer is of course on the music, Daniel L. Fapp and Robert Wise provide the big screen with an exclusive appearance which reminisces on, but does not exactly duplicate Manhattan's West Side throughout the 1950s. Each scene in this film has legitimacy and honesty, obtaining a clever, stylish management of a comprehensive thesis. Ernest Lehman's dialogue is charming, extracted from Arthur Laurent's book, with Wise's directing being authentic and film-wise, creating an efficient blend of austere and desiring characteristics. From the spectacular introductory footage of Manhattan to the endings concluding act, West Side Story shines with filmic vigour, seldom displayed in cinema since its first performance fifty-two years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>West Side Story (1961) - Tonight! Somewhere! America! Maria!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the popular Broadway hit, "West Side Story" is one of the most amazing musicals ever put to film. The retelling of the classic "Romeo and Juliet" story, is told into a story involving the duel of the Sharks and the Jets in the west side streets of New York, and how one small romance affects everything. First off, every single song in the movie is amazing, and they are always great songs to sing over and over again. The incredible direction of Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins helped make this musical into a beautiful portrait, and Robbin's choreography was super catchy, and it's really hard to dance to, and that's the fun about it. And the incredible cast including Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer, Russ Tamblyn, Rita Moreno, and George Chakiris was all super spectacular in every way, and this was a stellar cast, and their singing is so powerful. Also, the cinematography is fast-timing, the editing is fast paced, the art direction is super, the sound is remarkable, the music is powerful, and the finale brings enough suspense, drama, and romance as an end to this most powerful musical. With its catchy music, and incredible storyline, "West Side Story" is an amazing musical with amazing music, cast, and an epic power that brings everything together. "West Side Story", in my review, "a frolicking and powerful musical, a perfect movie for everybody to enjoy".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>West Side Story is one of the greatest movie musicals in the history of Hollywood. The story is timeless, the dancing highly energetic and innovative, the acting strong, especially that of Russ Tamblyn who gives one of the great performances in movie musical history. The music and lyrics are classics and the dialog is strong, relevant and entertaining. This movie withstands the test of time. It could be released today and play to an audience. The choreography is stunning. It's like Grease, except that this movie is not a parody and is the original thing. The ethnic tensions, the intensity of the dialog, the snappy dancing, the actual time line of the story itself, condensed into a 24-hour period, makes for an exciting movie that keeps the audience engaged. One thing about this movie, you won't be bored. This movie is also unique in that it succeeds not through the leads but through the incredible supporting cast whose powerful screen presence makes this movie work, and work well. George Chikaris, Rita Moreno and Tucker Smith are great. One can only wonder how Larry Kert would have done in this movie. (Mr. Kert is the actor who originally performed the role of Tony on Broadway). There are some who criticize this movie but what is there to criticize? If you like movies with great music, wonderful dancing and a compelling story, watch this movie.One other point: regarding the song "Tonight", this play takes the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet and propels it to new heights of dramatic power, transforming the poetry of Shakespeare into a musical number that is not only enjoyable, inspirational and memorable but iconic, especially the version as performed by the original performers of the song, Larry Kert and Carol Lawrence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leonard Bernstein, composer of the music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed Natalie Wood of course, talented stunningly attractive actress. Richard Beymer too... However, of all the reviews I have read here, hardly a one makes mention of the composer of the music in the film, Leonard Bernstein's music... The melodies are beautiful and romantic beyond compare. Bernstein was a genius, a great composer and conductor of orchestras... Stephen Sondheim had penned the lyrics, but the music came from Bernstein. Well known in the world of classical music, as a conductor he had championed a number of classical musicians, and he was a powerful prominent force on the International and New York orchestral music scene. A man of supreme importance in the field of classical music interpretation. I guess we could say that in the world of "popular music" he will be best remembered for his work here in West Side Story... This music is lovingly crafted by Leonard Bernstein, the master...

		<fullReview>If you have seen "West Side Story" on video or on a TV screen that is all fine. But, wait until you can see it on a huge Wide Screen in a real theater.You could finally see all the background and such items like flower pots on the tenement fire escapes or read the store signs along the streets. The close ups of the faces was the prime plus! This movie made great use of the close-ups.Everyone knows that this is a retelling of William Shakespeare's Play Romeo and Juliet. Natalie Wood as the lovely Maria from Puerto Rico represents the Capulet Family. Richard Beymer as Tony represents the Montagues. It is a pleasure to see Ms. Wood's pretty face although her practiced Spanish accent was a little too forced. And, credit must be given to Marni Nixon who provided the singing voice for Maria's songs. Still, we would all like to have a girl friend like Natalie Wood. Richard Beymer played a tragic Tony and member of the Jets street gang well. Jimmy Bryant must be given credit for Tony's singing voice. Russ Tamblyn stole many of the scenes with his dancing prowess and as Tony's friend Biff. Just when Tony tries to get out of the gang, Biff pulls him back in! {Just the same line Michael Corleone said in the Godfather III! There must be some secret command in movie writing that you can never leave a gang and if your try your character always ends up dead!} Rita Moreno and George Chakiris play Anita and Bernardo much better than Maria and Tony as far as the actual acting goes. Real passion and screen presence. No wonder Ms. Moreno is a hit in the HBO Series, "Oz." Betty Wand must receive credit for Ms. Moreno's singing voice.Character actors Simon Oakland as the police lieutenant and Ned Glass as the candy store owner, Doc, showed why they are always favorites in the movies that they were cast to play. Solid professional performances here.The entire Jet's gang membership is well blended. These "teens" are funny, musical, and dance well. The funniest music of the whole movie is the "Dear Officer Krupke" number making fun of William Bramley as the local cop on the beat. Listen to the lyrics and you will know why we still have teenage delinquency, because one agency passes the buck to another agency.Serious credit must be afforded the late great Leonard Bernstein for his musical score. After all, this is a musical play on film!Yes, there is nothing like seeing a movie the "old-fashioned" way on a large Cinemascope theater screen!...As Siskel and Ebert would say, "Two Thumbs Up!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hold my hand and we're half-way there... Hold my hand and I'll take you there...." Even though I'm not a big fan of this particular genre of film. I found West Side Story to be so impressively produced that it somehow transcended far beyond being just a mere "Musical" in the strictest sense of the word.West Side Story is literally bursting at the seams and filled to capacity with vivid imagery. This highly-energized film clearly captures the vibrant atmosphere of the late 1950s, where rival youth gangs get their prejudiced, little noses out of joint and prepare to rumble in the streets of NYC.With its memorable music and songs, dazzling choreography, striking sets and superb direction by Robert Wise, West Side Story is truly a triumph on every level.This film is a magnificent achievement that (back in 1961) set a whole new standard for modern-day movie Musicals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>West Side Story-A Romeo and Juliet Musical Tale West Side Story is a Rome and Juliet musical set in the early 60s directed by Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise. Set in modern New York City, West Side Story begins by introducing us to the Jets (Shakespeare's Montagues), a white gang of juveniles who immediately begin the scenes with a choreographed number. As they're dancing continues they run into some young Puerto Ricans who are introduced as the Sharks (the Capulets). The rivalry between the two gangs becomes apparent through a carefully choreographed fight between the two that involves many intricate dance moves that give the illusion of a fight. The creativity right there is enough to understand why West Side Story won ten out of the eleven Oscars it was nominated for.As the rivalry between the Sharks and Jets becomes clear to the audience, the leaders of the two, Riff representing the Jets, and Bernardo representing the Sharks, decide it is best to settle their differences in a rumble where the winning gang will gain control of the streets once and for all. Riff decides he must obtain the help of his best friend and former Jet member Tony, a handsome young man who has given up that life to work in a shop. Though resistant at first, Tony finally agrees to accompany the Jets to a dance that night where they will present the Sharks with this proposition. It is there that Tony sees Maria for the first time and they both fall in love, however Maria is the younger sister of Bernardo and so the tragedy begins.I must admit I was skeptical the first time I had seen this film because I wondered how in the world would a gang rivalry be portrayed through dance and music, I mean love okay, but anger and violence? Boy was I wrong! The quality of this film truly is one of a kind. The choreography keeps you thrilled and is truly breathtaking at times. West Side Story would also not have been such a credible film without the participation of it's actors.Natalie Woods does a splendid job at portraying the female lead Maria, a young Puerto Rican girl struck by love when she first sets eyes on Tony who represents everything her brother and his gang detest. Two actors in particular, however, certainly out shined both Natalie and Richard Beymer who plays Tony in my opinion. Rita Moreno as Anita, couldn't have done a better job at bringing a strong Latin element to the film that Maria lacked. We really get a feeling of Puerto Rican pride every time Anita appears on the screen and the same goes for Bernardo played by George Chakiris. The chemistry between Chakiris and Moreno bounces off the stage, as if you had known this couple your whole life. Had the storyline not been so strong, you almost forget about Maria and Tony and completely focus on Anita and Bernardo especially in the "America" scene.As a skeptic, the only thing I found unsettling at the end of West Side Story was how quick Maria and Tony fall in love! After all the singing and the dancing and the heartbreak, once the credits started rolling I sat there thinking "Wait, what? They barely met each other at a dance!" Then again that goes to show how captivating the film is, if only near the end did I ask myself such questions. Officer Krupke really did a good job getting under my skin, but then again that just goes to show how well of a job actor William Bramley did in portraying a dirty, prejudice cop.Overall, West Side Story is definitely something to get your mind out the High School Musical gutter we have going on now a days. This is acting , dancing, and singing at it's best with out a doubt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just watched West Side Story, for the first time since about 1966. When I saw it in 1961, I was already familiar with the music, as my enlightened parents bought me the stage show album (I'm not sure, after all these years, how I came to know about it back then, but it was certainly a hot item amongst my music-oriented mates in 1957!) Enough has been said in previous comments to make it unnecessary for me to review the film yet again, so can I just add one thought - there is a moment, right at the end, where two Sharks spontaneously step forward to help three Jets carry Anton off, which creates one of the most moving endings of any film ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie summarizes everything that was great and everything that was rotten with mainstream white society in the 50s and early 60s.Sure, the music is great in WSS. There is dancing and singing. Romance and action. Drama and tragedy. This is a movie about the American dream, about immigration, discrimination and the issues that foreigners faced. There is a sort of unbridled and innocent passion with which this movie celebrates American culture. West Side Story (1961): Classic, perhaps. But timeless?Looking under the glitz and Hollywood glamour, behind the curtain, you start to notice how artificial and contrived this production was. You notice that out of the dozen or so Puerto Ricans characters, perhaps 2 or 3 were actually played by Latinos. The rest were just white actors with silly putty on their face using bad accents. I noticed other peculiar flaws. As talented as Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer may have been, why did they need voice doubles during the singing? Of course, half of these high school students are played by mid to late 20-something actors, but oh well, that's to be expected even today.In the end, the film just comes off as plastic and white-washed to me. This was a movie about white Americans and Latino Americans, but it was made by white Americans for white Americans. This was a movie that sheltered, middle-class Americans could watch to make themselves feel 'multicultural' in the 60s.WSS is sweet, pure, innocent and enjoyable, but also synthetic and naive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, relevant, yet flawed film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start off with the good. Leonard Bernstein's score is absolutely impeccable, nearly unrivaled in the realm of musical theater and film composing for its cohesiveness and beauty. The orchestra packs a punch, but also supplies needed gentleness to tender moments. Each note fits perfectly into the scene, especially when there's a quarrel between the two rival gangs. Nearly every song is an instant classic, from "Maria" to "Tonight" to "Cool." On top of that, the music scenes themselves have remained in the American consciousness for decades. The Sharks' humorous adoration and mockery of the American Dream in "America" still resonate deeply today, while the Jets' not-so-nice ode to the oafish Officer Krupke digs deep at what makes a kid "go bad" like them. Dance in West Side Story is used to its stylistic peak. The choreography is insanely tight. Watching the Jets and Sharks duke it out with dance on stage is simply a delight and definitely a highlight of the film for me. The dance at the gym is a prime example of just how stellar a scene can be when both the music and the choreography are finely tuned to perfection. I can say with much confidence that those are my two favorite elements of the entire movie. In addition, every shot is filled with gorgeous color. You could analyze its usage till the cows come home and still find more to say. That being said, the film has quite a few flaws that prevent me from haphazardly calling it a masterpiece. Despite what other reviewers say, I find West Side Story's pacing to actually be too fast at times. The whole story takes place over a two day period. Now, within those two days, relations between the Jets and Sharks go from a tense calm to explosive hatred and bitterness. Tony and Maria meet at the dance at 10pm, and by the next evening they're singing about getting married! The two say barely any words to each other, and yet they're dead set on being together for eternity. So much so that when Tony kills Maria brother Bernardo, she isn't even the slightest bit mad at him after a minute or so! Give me a break. And will someone please explain to me why Tony doesn't so much as shed a tear when his best friend Riff dies in front of him? Such a timeless fight scene is nearly ruined by Tony's complete lack of character. Granted, the overall picture is perhaps more important than the little details, but some are just too glaring to ignore! While there are some good performances here (Rita Moreno's is fantastic), there's some pretty poor, ham-fisted acting here and there too, particularly on the Sharks side. This is mainly due to the fact that almost none of them are actually Puerto Rican or even Latino. Most of the Sharks are so bad at their accents that they sound Italian, Maria and Bernardo included. The actual Spanish they utter amongst themselves is at times laughably bad. The dialogue between most characters is pretty good at its best, but unbearably cheesy at its worst. All in all, West Side Story is a film that everyone should watch for its incredibly important message. Its subject matter was daring for its time, and some of the characters lines are still a bit edgy (Life is alright in America / If you're all white in America). Despite its lackluster Latino representation, the film raises some daring questions about race and represents the Puerto Rican-American community with respect and truth. When I put some of its glaring flaws aside (and completely block out Natalie Wood's horrendous accent), I can still enjoy West Side Story quite a lot, and even get teary-eyed at its powerful conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The drama is nothing compared to its dancing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Shakespeare's infamous 'Romeo and Juliet,' is revitalised by director Robert Wise as he takes it from the stage to the silver screen in the, if not equally infamous, 'West Side Story'. As a film that has had much acclaim I was already familiar with its storyline and some musical numbers, although having never seen it. I had high hopes. I love a good musical. 'West Side Story' received an outstanding eleven Academy Award nominations. It would go on to receive ten of these including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor and Actress for George Chakaris and Rita Moreno respectively, and Best Direction for the dynamic duo of Robert Wise and principle choreographer Jerome Robbins. I was expecting perfection. Perhaps it was for this reason that I was unfortunately left feeling deflated and ultimately disappointed.That being said, I do not want to let my disillusionment cloud my objectivity. The film was not all bad ? there were pleasant aspects. The choreography by Robbins is sheer genius. I do not envy the gruelling efforts the cast and crew made to create this excellence. The stories of Robbins need to create perfection in every take are well known. His inability to say 'Cut!' did ultimately lead to his removal from production due to financial impracticality but his assistants proved loyal to his vision and every step we see is his. Robbins displays innovativeness far out ranking any of his contemporaries. The notable scene whereby the gangs run toward a tall chain-link fence and manoeuvres themselves barehanded upwards and over onto the playground below in one fluid motion is not only incredible to behold in the moment, but you cannot help but wonder how many times the poor actors, not stuntmen, were forced to carry out this sequence to give it it's effortlessness.I also found the retelling of 'Romeo and Juliet' itself to be utterly refreshing. I enjoyed the setting's transference from 16th Century Italy to the more familiar Upper West Side New York. The Montagues and Capulets become two rival street gangs - the second generation European immigrant Jets and the Puerto Rican Sharks struggling to find their place in the world. While I find fault with the actual names of the gangs and dub them corny, the perpetuation of the young adults as victims of racial barriers evokes empathy in the viewer and an understanding of the feud not present in Shakespeare's play due to purposeful ambiguity. The removal of the parents from the plot and the casting of a young Rita Moreno as Anita to mirror the role of the older Nurse serve to make the film more appealing for a younger audience. These simple plot devices come together to make William Shakespeare approachable and take away the impossibility of coming to terms with his extensive literary catalogue.Be all that as it may, I cannot hide my belief that this film was anti-climactic. I found the dialogue uninspired and bland. It was corny, and not in a tongue-in-cheek kind of way. As a Disney lover, I am a big fan of cheesy fairy tale romance. That being said, I cannot hide my disdain for the interchanges between the two leads Maria (Natalie Wood) and Tony (Richard Beymer). Firstly, there is a sheer lack of chemistry between the two lovers. Beymer is cripplingly insincere due to his incapability to carry the role of leading man let alone portray the role of a reformed gang leader. I am unable to find them to be a credible couple. I do not root for them. In terms of casting, on the other hand Rita Moreno's portrayal of Anita saves the show. She is utterly deserving of her Oscar. She exudes a charisma, magnetism and passion in that role that puts on display the numerous flaws of Beymer and Wood for all to see.While I can admire the bold move to rewrite Shakespeare's tragic ending of mutual suicide, I cannot help but wonder if perhaps to have had Maria shoot herself would have saved my view of the film. While this film does indulge on tragedy through violence, murder and an attempted rape, I cannot help but say I was unmoved. The film lacked the same powerful ending that 'Romeo and Juliet' has. The death of Juliet in the play is critical to the play's success. It embodies the play's message of love and intensifies its moral - intolerance creates only sorrow. I understand that it played into the character development of Maria in becoming a confident and independent woman, but I do think her death could have given the movie the strong conclusion it so desperately needs. The hint of reconciliation between the Jets and the Sharks is utterly contrived and does not do anything to add a satisfactory climax. If anything, it only serves to underline American cinema's need at the time to provide feel good cinema and a happy ending.Overall, the film's drama is nothing compared to its dancing. The leads are overshadowed by Rita Moreno. The gangs are parodies. The ending is lacklustre. It is for these reasons I would give it only three-and-a-half out of five stars. For a film with such potential and such acclaim, I truly had expected more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WEST SIDE STORY is everything a musical should be - epic, colourful, heartfelt and packed to the brim with rousing music, singing and dance numbers. Loosely based on ROMEO AND JULIET, this tells of the tragedy that arises when two people from opposite sides of the street fall in love.The story is brought to lively and vivid life by Robert Wise, one of the era's most reliable directors, and the transfer I watched makes it look absolutely stunning, with the huge street backdrops adding a really unique feel to the various choreographed numbers. Put simply, this is one of the most memorable musicals of all time because it stands alone in look and feel to all the rest.The cast are fine, typically better at the singing and dancing than they are at the acting, but then that's where it counts. Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer are the headliners with the romantic storyline, but I found the ethnic support from George Chakiris and Rita Moreno to be even stronger - and the energetic Russ Tamblyn, of course. In any case, there's nothing to dislike here; this is a classic for plenty of reasons, and all of them are good.</fullReview>

This is that movie...Be prepared for an emotional roller coaster effect too. You will do it all here...When I first seen this movie, it was years after it came out on the big screen. It advertised two gangs going at it and me and my two pals thought..wow, lets give this a look. It starts out decent enough until one of the Jets does a ballerina move and I squirmed in my seat. Since when do gangs dance around town? Got past that to finally understand the message and how it was presented too. Seen it 30 times since then and will see it again. Everyone in this movie played their parts to the hilt when it was their turn. The dancing required was exhausting and repeated over and over until they got the perfect scene filmed. The excellence that went into this film is extra-ordinary and brings to the viewer a superior experience bar none. They do something at the end of the movie that I thought was brilliant. The closing credits are written in graffiti all over walls, posts and fences. It was like a show in itself and was accompanied by music too. Get the drinks, the snacks, the popcorn and a comfortable spot...You will be served up entertainment in large portions...enjoy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In pure form, as it is set among culture clashing working class youth in New York City, "West Side Story" is one of the greatest American musicals. Less discussed, it also captured the beat (or rock) revolution happening simultaneously (the original 1950s Broadway show), thanks to a score by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim alongside choreography by Jerome Robbins that transcends genre by creatively blending the traditional and revolutionary. Decades later, musicians continue to swipe or acknowledge the show in some fashion, with Michael Jackson's "Beat It" and "Bad" perhaps the most famous examples.Alas, a ten is not always perfect...First of all, there is nothing wrong with casting outside of ethnicity - if Sandra Dee were convincing in the part, she should allowed to play the Puerto Rican teenage heroine. As the big-name, highly paid "star" of the movie, Natalie Wood (as Maria) is the easiest casting target. She essays the role acceptably, but not exceptionally. For something of this magnitude, something significantly more than acceptable is needed. It also hurts that Ms. Wood looks more like Richard "Tony" Beymer's sister than lover...Marni Nixon and Jimmy Bryant make beautiful music together.The more believable relationship is between Rita Moreno (as Anita) and George Chakiris (as Bernardo). And the real emotional dynamic is always between the "Shark" and "Jet" leaders - Mr. Chakiris, Russ Tamblyn (as Riff) and, later, Tucker Smith (as Ice). Consequently, the film's dramatic peak is the final scene between "Bernardo" and "Riff" rather than the one between "Maria" and "Tony". Watch the smaller characters "Anybodys" and "Doc" for great subtext. Moving the story close enough for opera, every production number is a highlight. In a better place here, "Gee Officer Krupke" may even sum up the entire century.********* West Side Story (10/18/61) Robert Wise : Jerome Robbins ~ Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer, Russ Tamblyn, Rita Moreno</fullReview>

It tells the story of two rival gangs and two people Maria played in a star making role by Natalie Wood and Tony who fall in love and come from different backgrounds. This film won a stunning 10 Oscars one off the all time record including best picture. The musical sequences are great, the acting is top notch and the direction. I just saw this film for the 1st time today and thought it still has cultural references for today's generation. I recommend this to any fan of film, especially those who love musicals.

Under Wise's sure-handed direction and Robbins's energetic choreography, this is a majestic experience from start to finish. Perhaps Wood and Beymer seem a bit weak in the leads but this is only because, by comparison, Moreno, Chakiris, and Tamblyn are so good in the key supporting roles. With the marvelous music by Bernstein and lyrics by Sondheim, the film is chock full of memorable songs. Highlights include the sweet "Maria," rollicking "America," tuneful "Tonight," effervescent "I Feel Pretty," and funny "Gee, Officer Krupkee."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Shakespeare and the musical endure--especially together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that "West Side Story" is based on Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" is one of those knowledge tidbits that people seem to pride themselves on, but the truth is that the classic tragedy of star-crossed lovers is most of what makes "West Side Story" strike a note with audiences. Add to that story an impeccable score written by musical theatre legends Stephen Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein, some vivid choreography by the legendary Jerome Robbins and you have something that can capture the hearts of almost anyone.In 1950s New York City, the streets are owned by the gangs: the Jets, good old American bad boys, and the Sharks, Puerto Rican immigrants. Though generally both sides are all talk, no actual action, that all begins to change when an "ex" Jet (because when you're a Jet you're a Jet all the way) named Tony falls for Maria, little sister of the Sharks' leader Bernardo. Their secret affair grows amid a forthcoming rumble that promises to change all their lives."West Side Story" nearly swept the Academy Awards, taking home statues for 10 of its 11 nominations. From a modern perspective, it's hard to see why at first, but when you get down to it, it's very clear. Robbins, who also directs, (alongside Robert Wise), creates a Manhattan that could only exist in a fairytale. Not that it's magical or enchanted, but it intentionally lacks any historical/locational context outside of the costumes and hairstyles. The streets of the city are empty except for the gangs--nothing seems to happen outside of their little world. What this does is set us up to watch that world come crashing down as the tragedy ensues.Robbins creates that world with a long opening sequence of gang members dancing and fighting with elegant grace. It comes off as odd, but it really sets the desired tone for the film. Everything is a song and dance. Robbins' choreography is sharp and popping, adding to the excitement of the film. The music is phenomenal, providing a wide range of styles that create a wide range of emotions. From the aggressive, vibrant "Dance at the Gym" and "America" to the youthfully optimistic "Maria" and "Somewhere," there's various moods all throughout this film. The costume and background colors (reds and purples for the Sharks and blues, golds and oranges for the Jets) reflect this at points too.The acting is certainly not the film's best aspect, but it shouldn't go unmentioned. Oscar- winner Rita Moreno plays up the fantastic part that is Anita, Bernardo's girlfriend; Natalie Wood outshines her co-star as Maria. In general, the characters of the film are rather one- dimensional, so actors like Richard Beymer (Tony) can get away with having only a love- struck look on his face the entire film. At the same time, the one-dimensionality is part of creating the fairytale illusion. You know that by film's end these characters are going to be more complex.What it comes down to, however, is that the story will get you every time. It's the reason "Romeo and Juliet" has resonated through centuries: seeing the tragedy unfold when you know these kids were just monkeying around is very sobering, especially after the whimsical, musical journey that is the major portion of the film. It's an inescapable emotional trap: even though you see how ridiculous Tony and Maria's love is, you care about the story unfolding and the hate and prejudice bothers you. It's as if out of nowhere, this fun, cute little musical evolves into something that resonates tremendously as a period piece and warning about intolerance in general. It's the stuff classics are made of.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"West Side Story" has an eternal sort of resonance in its theme and story, which we can thank Mr Shakespeare for, but also stands as a powerful product of its age and location. It is classic Broadway and classic Hollywood in its most urban musical style, often harsh and dangerous, but containing enough old-style production-number work to satisfy traditional film-musical aficionados. The opening sequence is one of the best film openings of all time, and the dancing (and direction of the dance sequences) incredibly exuberant and yet clear in its purpose. There is little cross-cutting and fast-editing here, yet the dances have all the energy of any modern music video. The film also interestingly has supporting characters who outshine the leads. Unlike many other comments here, I have nothing against either Natalie Wood or Richard Beymer in these parts; they are in many ways given an unfair deal in their very characterization (which I regard as something of a weakness in Romeo and Juliet, upon which the film is based). Their characters are simply not as interesting as those around them. Under the circumstances I think they do as good a job as they can. "West Side Story" is best seen on a big screen in 70mm if you get the chance!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Consistently ranges from impressive to awesome. Dark and brooding throughout, the edginess in some scenes is truly something and in a dramatic sense it still outdoes any other teen angst movie I can think of, including "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Rumblefish". The music is breathtaking with at least three show-stopping numbers. America is the best, cleverly combining two things: pro/anti America and the battle of the sexes ? hilarious and exhilarating. Tonight combines four-things going on simultaneously ? has such a thing ever been done before or since? The orchestration is rich and lavish, such as the mambo number ? it has to make sudden massive drops to avoid drowning the voices. Nathalie Wood is a Murillo Madonna and Rita Moreno is chilli-hot. The tension builds and sustains right through ? even after the rumble when things might be expected to flag it turns the screw immediately with another stunning number "Stay Cool, Boy" and then the scene in which Moreno almost gets raped. Phew. Makes all other musicals look childish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are certain films which absolutely demand to be seen in an actual movie theatre, toweringly majestic films that are profoundly diminished without the contribution of the big screen experience - films such as Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, The Ten Commandments, Ben Hur, and more recently, films such as The French Lieutenant's Woman, The English Patient, Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, etc. I've watched movies on my TV screen at home, in fact, that made me wish I had experienced them in a theatre - The Unbearable Lightness of Being springs to mind; I remember watching it and imagining the entire time what it would have been like in a theatre. Fortunately, one of the films that I did have the thrill of seeing the way it was meant to be experienced, in all its larger-than-lifeness, on the big screen, is West Side Story.This movie changed my life, plain and simple. I was born and raised in NYC, where the film takes place, but I was never a fan of musicals, on screen or in plays - it just seemed ridiculous to me when people would burst into song at the laundromat, say, and while it's true that yer basic street gang doesn't exactly perform brilliantly choreographed dance numbers in their neighborhood playground, today or at any other time in history, in West Side Story it works, it makes sense, you're swept along into the reality of the piece effortlessly. Because of the dazzlingly flawless execution of the material, West Side Story transcends.I was fortunate enough to see the film in an actual theatre, more than once, and I've seen it at home as well - when I first broke down and bought a DVD player a few years back a friend of mine, knowing of my deep connection to this movie, got me a copy (widescreen, of course). It took me weeks and weeks to finally put it in and attempt to watch it because I didn't want my memory of the experience to be tarnished - in fact I secretly thought it was almost blasphemous to watch such a exquisite masterpiece on a TV screen. I was pleasantly surprised, then, to find out that the film actually plays very well in this format.It's the story, the overwhelming emotion of the story, that comes through, ultimately, and while it obviously doesn't have the added dimension of the movie theatre experience, this timeless classic can be seen and appreciated at home. Allow me to rephrase an old adage : 'Tis better to have seen it small than never to have seen it at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WEST SIDE STORY was by chance. The picture was up for a rent. Seeing it for the first time, I thought some scenes were somehow not necessary. However, this masterpiece( as it can be rightly called ) was a sure good one.THE PLOT: A typical Romeo and Juliet drama set between arch rivals the Jets and the Sharks. The Puerto Rican SHARKS leader Bernardo has a love for his precious sister Maria. Riff, the JETS leader is strong and good-willed in his own way. When the SHARKS' Tony falls for Maria, it's like fish meeting water all the way. The Romeo and Juliet like encounters between the two. The passion they have for each other etc is profound and quite impressive. When a fight kills the leaders of the two gangs, mysterious events happen and the love cycle continues to struggle till the last moment it can.A Robert Wise picture is always very lively and heart-felt. We are reminded that love is a force of nature and it's not in the power of a human being to pull it apart. WEST SIDE STORY somehow triumphs with it's redeeming sense of love. Though in my eyes, a little unoriginal, (in terms of the familiar Romeo and Juliet romance) It succeeds by pulling at your heartstrings hard and tenderly.8/10. = A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is excellent! Based on the hit Broadway musical, which is a modern update on the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, it still is a hit, even after its premiere 46 years ago. Natalie Wood (singing by Marni Nixon) and Richard Beymer are the two star-crossed lovers, and they are great (even though they didn't get along off-screen). Rita Moreno is AMAZING as Anita, Maria(Wood)'s friend, as are Russ Tamblyn as Tony(Beymer)'s friend Riff, and George Chakiris as Anita's boyfriend Bernardo (both Moreno and Chakiris won Oscars for their performances). Jerome Robbins' choreography is a highlight of the film, as are those wonderful songs (AMERICA, TONIGHT, COOL, and GEE, OFFICER KRUPKE). The direction is by Robert Wise (who won the Best Director Oscar for THE SOUND OF MUSIC) and Robbins (who shared the award for this film with Wise).This Best Picture winner is one of the greatest films ever!

		<fullReview>Did you know that most fans of the 1961 classic musical, West Side Story, are young teens? Why do so many high schools perform this play? Why do so many drama teachers that I've talked to teach entire units on it? Why have I seen boys cry or get inconsolably upset when they don't get the chance to be Riff or Tony? Because West Side Story is a timeless masterpiece that speaks to all generations. It involves true emotions of love, hate and revenge. Yet, their is a familiarity to it. At some point in time we've all felt like at least one or two of the characters. We have all lived to see something we regret, something that leaves us to shocked we cannot find words. West Side Story, its music, the dancing, the unforgettable characters...it all adds up. Its not a movie, but an experience. No 1,000 word summary could ever sum up what you feel as you watch.

		<fullReview>West Side Story(1961) is in my opinion the best of the Romeo &amp; Juliet inspired films because it deals with the themes of tragedy and war. It is also a great musical that is filled with great acting and breathtaking music. The film could be considered as a continuation of Rebel Without A Cause(1955) with the appearence of Natalie Wood. Natalie Wood gives the performance of her life as Maria and Rita Moreno is terrific as the girlfriend of Bernardo. This film would play a major influence in the careers of Martin Scorsese and John Woo. West Side Story(1961) is the best Shakesphere adaption not done by Akira Kurosawa. The best scene in the movie is at the dance hall when all the people in there are blured out by color except for Maria and Tony who look and fall in love with each other. Robert Wise did a excellent job with the story and the direction was perfect. I first saw this film in school as it made an impression on me with its sad and tragic ending for it is Tony's death that brings peace between the Sharks and the Jets. West Side Story is the perfect movie for the hopeless romantic all over the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasn't sure what to expect, definitely glad I saw it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mom likes to boast how many times she saw this movie when she was growing up. In those days, one could buy a ticket for a movie and watch the movie several times on a single admission. Needless to say, she's seen the movie more than 30 times. To me, I figured it would be some sappy love story in which I would have no interest. After taking a Shakespeare course in college and seeing two Romeo and Juliet films (Franco Zeffirelli's classic plus the modern Leonardo DiCaprio version), I decided that West Side Story was worth watching. I'm glad I finally watched it. I caught bits and pieces of the movie in the past, and I just thought it was a bunch of singing and dancing, but when I finally sat down to watch the film, I realized that the singing was actually part of the dialogue; it gave the movie a whole new meaning. The choreography of the dance and fight scenes was awesome; the special Oscar for the choreography was well deserved. The film also parallels the story line of Romeo and Juliet very well, so knowledge of R&amp;J will add even more appreciation to this film. Definitely worth 10 out of 10, not to mention its 10 well-deserved Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Marvel in Dance, Music, and Emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Oscar-winning film bubbles over with the best of Leonard Bernstein's high-energy music and Jerome Robbins' innovative jazz-ballet choreography. It stirs the winsome performance of Natalie Wood as the Puerto Rican ingenue Maria (no matter that Wood doesn't provide her own singing and is not much of a dancer -- she is breathtakingly perfect in the role) in a doomed romance on the desperate blue-collar streets of New York -- the result is cinema magic. And heartbreak.Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" served as the framework for the original stage script. Filmed on location, "West Side Story" is a brilliant musical and contains powerful performances from Rita Moreno and George Chakiris (both won Oscars). Its songs, particularly "Somewhere," "Tonight," and "America," are haunting classics."West Side Story" was very cutting-edge with its superb dance numbers and its unflinching treatments of prejudice, murder, and love lost -- it still is relevant, maybe even more so, in today's world. Entertaining and tragic, it's a strong film that is suitable for most ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can I explain what a great film this is? Story by Shakespeare, music by Bernstein, lyrics by Sondheim, choreography by Robbins. Who can beat that combination? The songs are as memorable and fitting as the setting and story construct are to the plot: love of the wrong person ends on tragedy, as it always has in literature for thousands of years. The sets, the acting, the direction, the writing, the story, all combine to produce one of the all-time great tension building events in the cinema. The only problem is believing these guys are still in their late-teens. This is a movie for all the ages to come. If there is a person who hasn't seen this film by now, they ought to be hunted down, tied to a chair, and forced to see every single frame of it. And if you haven't seen it yet... well...

		<fullReview>This movie was Best Picture the year I was born. It also happens to be my favorite. This picture evokes so many emotions, where does one start in describing it. I think Bill Shakespeare himself would have been proud of this Romeo &amp; Juliet adaptation. Jets &amp; Sharks, Montagues and Capulets, Tony &amp; Maria, Romeo &amp; Juliet, the cross references are masterfully executed. The combination of the music and lyrics seems to have been made for each other.I never tire of this movie even after seeing it 60 or 70 times. There are many messages which unfortunately still apply today. Troubled youth, dysfunctional family life, racism, xenophobia to name a few.I wish there were outtakes of this move as it must've been lots of fun for the cast members in making it.Check out Natalie Wood in the scene where Tony comes to her after the rumble. Wow ! What a scene.Another GREAT scene is when all parties are singing "Tonight" prior to the rumble. The music , lyrics and timing is just incredible.What a great movie..I LOVE IT !!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Musical Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love this film. The dancing, the music, the over-the-top melodramatic acting, the language and the story. West Side Story is fourth on my all-time list and never fails to move me.The music is what makes it great. It was light-years ahead of its time. It's dischordant and edgy in a age when straight-ahead tap dance numbers where the musical norm. Leonard Bernstein did his best work here. The scene which (in the musical) is called Quintet is unparalleled genius. The scene jumps from the Jets to the Sharks to Tony to Maria to Anita and back again, all people singing of what they long for "Tonight". For the musicians out there, lengthy sections of this piece change time signature every bar. It both summarizes and advances the plot while at the same time, foreshadows disaster. There is no other scene like it in movie history.Its not a perfect film. Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer lack the chemistry that could have made this the greatest film of all time. But the gangs and the girlfriends more than compensate. They are what make this film so watchable.The choreography does not tire either. Nearly four decades later, West Side provides us with dance sequences that would still fit the bill today - most notably the prologue and the "America" scene.This is not only a film worth seeing and owning but a fabulous stage production that must be seen as well. **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If another billion great movies are made,"WEST SIDE STORY" will still get a ranking as one of the greatest movies of all time. Somewhere in the dictionary there may be a word that is significant enough to describe this majestic work but one would be hard pressed to find it. I can think of little to add to what other IMDb users have said far more eloquently. Suffice to say,that as long as human beings have hopes, dreams and emotions then this film will never be forgotten.Peace and quiet and open air do wait for Tony and Maria somewhere.Namely the hearts of everyone who has responded to this,the greatest musical of them all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The choreography, dancing and on location photography create excitement, but the story, an update of Romeo and Juliet, is trite, sugary and uninteresting. Ultimately, aside from the singing and dancing, the film really drags with far too many characters and caricatures crowding the screen making the star crossed lovers Tony and Maria peripheral characters which may be a blessing because Wood and Beymer are a dull pair and Beymer is not persuasive as a former gang leader even if the Jets are the Dead End Kids with ballet training. Oscar winners Rita Moreno and George Chakiris give the only memorable performances. A poorly paced 2 and 1/2 hours, the ending is more relief than tragedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking, Inspired, Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The accolades for "West Side Story" are numerous, including ten Oscars--and they are deserved. Featuring a cast that could dance and perform the gymnastic choreography of Jerome Robbins, the film is a modern reworking of the Romeo &amp; Juliet story, with ethnicity--instead of family bloodlines--serving as the source of conflict.Tony (Richard Beymer) and Maria (Natalie Wood) are the couple that unexpectedly meet and instantly fall in love, despite their family allegiances to the Jets and the Sharks, ethnic gangs that war daily over the concrete-covered "turf" of their neighborhood. In their dedication to love, the lovers wish to rise above the petty conflicts, but fate will not allow them to exist.The moral of this story is "Hate kills" and it explores the behaviors of ethnic groups that refuse to listen to each other. The irony is that both groups are from immigrant populations--just that some arrived in America earlier. As depicted in the film, authority figures are either clueless or themselves bigoted.This is a groundbreaking musical, driven by the modern rhythms and New York sensibilities of Leonard Bernstein. The lyrics by Stephen Sondheim are clever, pointed, and perfectly integrated into the narrative of the film, sometimes conversational. Perhaps better than any film before, the music and dance in "West Side Story" advance the storyline and define its characters.Using a strong color palette and sets that break the neighborhood into a patchwork of paved boxes connected by a maze of alleyways, the visuals--including the wonderful costumes--provide strong statements about cultural differences and similarities. Aerial shots sometimes make the performers look like they are merely tracing courses they are destined to follow.The dancing is athletic and balletic, with stylized fight scenes. One can clearly see how this film influenced--at least in part--"Grease", "Dirty Dancing" and the dance stylings of Michael Jackson. Though she is sometimes criticized for her performance, Natalie Wood delivers a heartfelt and lovely portrayal of Maria. The performance of Ned Glass as Doc, the store owner who is the voice of reason, also deserves mentioning. He makes a small part resonate. One other person who deserves more recognition is Marni Nixon, who voiced Maria and other characters in the film. The quality of her singing voice elevates this film as it has many others before.I wish I had seen this film when it premiered. I can just imagine what it must have been like to leave the theater, having been moved by the story, humming the tunes, and blown away by the visuals. I know I would have gone back to the theater again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, this is a movie that I legitimately enjoyed. I had to watch this in my music class, and like a lot of the kids, I thought it was gonna be some really stupid movie that I would have to "watch". I was delightfully surprised at how cool it was! The songs were catchy, the characters are well done, the romance between Tony and Anita are done very well, and direction from the late Robert Wise made this movie musical a smash hit, and my favorite musical aside from Grease. This is one of the very few movies that I like to watch again and again (the others being Die Hard and Back to the Future). If you happen upon a copy of this movie, I strongly suggest you buy it, because you will get what you pay for. One thing I'd like to mention as well. If you've been paying attention to Steven Spielbergs page, specifically the Director portion, you'll notice that this movie will be remade under his direction. I'm more sad than happy, because let's face it. It's gonna suck. Stick to the original! 100/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love is forever and ever dramatic and tragic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a myth, like the musical it comes from. It has been alive and a success as a musical for more than 50 years and about the same for the film when it became a VHS tape and now a DVD. It is doomed to be a lasting success, hence a classic in its genre and field.Of course it is a rewriting of Romeo and Juliet but with a twist, i.e. the two young people are simple young people and not members of the aristocratic families of an ancient city. They are second or third generation immigrants in New York of European origins, the jets, versus the first generation immigrants from Porto Rico, the Sharks. The girl is a Porto Rican and the boy is a New Yorker. In fact the first fight is very similar in a way to what happened in Shakespeare's play. Riff is killed by Bernardo, Bernardo is killed by Anton and there is the twist. Chino picks up the vengeance of Bernardo and runs after Tony and he will shoot Tony in the arms of Maria who will survive. Tony's body will be taken away by members of both gangs.The context is completely different and the New Yorkers are very good at mocking other people, cops, judges, head shrinks and social workers and at depicting their fate as the most dramatic and tragic alienation, exploitation and dereliction. They all are born Mercutios. They are the victims of the smoke of tobacco and other stuffs, the fumes of alcohol and other wines, the beatings of their fathers and other parents, etc. They are just discrete on the sexual part because of the time (1961 for the film) and the targeted audience that has to be a family audience even if it is Parental Guidance on my DVD.There is not much to add to this since the twist does not really change Shakespeare's lesson. Bigotry, racism, hate and a few other of these subhuman passions are dominant with simple people in any society and they guide their passions, feelings, actions and reactions. These simple people can kill in a mob and even individually when such emotions take hold of them. And after that there is nothing left for the survivors to do except to cry and suffer in silence if possible.But this film, then VHS tape and now DVD brings up a completely different discussion. The musical was for an elite audience, that of the Broadway theatres. The film was for a wider public though the cinemas needed to be equipped in wide screens, color projectors and sound systems of quality. It anyway reached a wider audience than the play. The film amplified the success of the musical. The VHS tape came later and in fact was the cause and amplification of the first revival twenty years later. The DVD was in the same way the cause and the amplification of the second revival of the musical some twenty more years later. Each revival went along with a vast tour in the USA and Canada but also all over the world, especially the second since many cities are now equipped in special large halls for such super productions.But the live musical and the DVD are not the same.The live musical takes you into the magic of a show on a stage with lights and sets that are supposed to fascinate you, with actors, singers and dancers that are supposed to mesmerize you and a music that is supposed to charm you. But you are sitting in one place and cannot move and you can at best use special binoculars to zoom on some actors or singers but then you lose the wide picture. A show like this one is of course entirely nourished with conventions in the acting, the singing, the performing, and so on, of every single artist on the stage or in front of the stage or anywhere else in the house. Conventions and trade-unions that can at times dictate the rhythm of the show. The spectator is supposed to let him/herself slide into that magic and enjoy both visually and auditorily but the heavy machinery that produces the lights, the amplification and the various physical elements of the show take you for a real dance and you may fly into the show. The very strong sentimental scenes and situations may carry your emotions away too. But that will remain moderate due to the distance between you and the characters.The film, VHS and then DVD are free of such constraints, at least for you. This film uses a real location, New York itself from the very start wince we come from the sky to land in the street of the West side of Manhattan after a slowly zooming overview down into the streets from the sky. This real location is of course an enormous change because of the liberation it provides the actors, singers and dancers. They have space, they can move, climb, run, and do many other things without any limits, or nearly none. They can play basketball in real conditions. They even have cars in the street and the cops come into the various street situations with their cars blinking blue end red like some bleeding heart.The second change you perceive from the very start is of course the great mobility of the camera. You can shift from one angle to another instantly and that creates movement in the picture and on the screen since you are constantly capturing the situation from a myriad points of view. This acceleration of the camera's movements and multiplication of shooting angles really project you into the action or suck you up into it if your prefer and you are a lot more involved in the action, in the film. You are no longer a simple voyeur. You are part of the action itself.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Startling and Still Finger-Snapping Cool Especially with Jerome Robbins' Dazzling Choreography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no getting around the fact that this 1961 musical melodrama is a monumental work by theater masters at their peak - Leonard Bernstein's timeless music; Stephen Sondheim's clever, character-driven lyrics; and above all, Jerome Robbins' dazzling choreography, an unprecedented blend of ballet, jazz and modern moves that uniquely belong to this show. Fortunately, all of this is beautifully captured on the pristine 70-mm print and audio transfer found on the two-disc 2003 Special Edition DVD. What's more, the cinematic translation of the Broadway hit co-directed by Robbins and veteran Robert Wise shows a film that not only conveys the vibrancy of the original show but adds dramatic texture in the reshuffling of its renowned songs in order to better propel the familiar storyline.The home turf Jets and the recently arrived Puerto Rican Sharks are at war in the tenements of New York's Upper West Side in the late 1950's. The ethnically divided rival gangs are already at a boiling point when Tony meets Maria across a crowded floor at the community dance. The problem is that Tony is a founder of the Jets who quit to work as a stock boy at Doc's candy store, and Maria is the coddled little sister of Bernardo, the Sharks' leader. Needless to say, things don't go well for the teenaged lovers but not before the respective sides confront each other with the most athletic, macho-driven dance moves not seen since Gene Kelly's golden MGM period. Starting with the highly dramatic overhead shots of Manhattan, the prologue is justly celebrated as a stunning expression of Robbins' genius in formulating dance moves that fluently convey the gangs' swagger and menace.As the story settles on the core romance, the movie maintains its momentum and high energy through the memorable score, in particular, the three powerful ensemble pieces - "America", in which the Sharks boys and girls playfully but pointedly argue the merits of living in the U.S.; the "Quintet" with its dynamic cross-cutting showing the diverse shades of anticipation for the final rumble; and "Cool", in which the revenge-driven, post-rumble Jets plot to find Tony before the Sharks do. The slower tempo songs have long since become a part of the established American songbook. What holds the music and action together is the strongly individualistic visual style set forth by Daniel Fapp's color-saturated cinematography (the reds really pop) and Boris Leven's impressive production design (only the prologue was filmed on location). Even though Arthur Laurents' original book and Ernest Lehman's screenplay have retro-hip dialogue that now sounds quaint next to today's youth-oriented movies, the story still maintains a dramatic gravitas that has certainly worked since Shakespeare's day.Although obviously not a Latina, 22-year old Natalie Wood is still picture-perfect as Maria. Carrying most of the pathos of the love story, she completely nails the final tragic scene with tear-jerking aplomb. Less successful is the toothy Richard Beymer as Tony, looking too freshly scrubbed and acting too na?ve to be credible as a former gang leader. Yet despite the obvious vocal dubbing, they play their duets with poignancy. Russ Tamblyn, already a longtime film veteran at that point, plays Tony's best friend Riff with gusto and shows off his amazing acrobatic dancing skills with fervor. George Chakiris, a far more polished dancer than Tamblyn, is a searing presence as Bernardo, though the best all-around performer is a fiery Rita Moreno as Bernardo's fast-assimilating girlfriend, Anita. Singing (with one notable exception), dancing and acting up a storm, she lends a scene-stealing energy too infrequently used in a film career that goes back to 1952's "Singin' in the Rain". The rest of the dancers perform in nova-like bursts with amazing precision and synchronization.The first disc of the 2003 DVD contains the movie itself and surprisingly comes with no commentary track. While this is an unfortunate omission, it is more than offset by the second disc's main attraction, an hour-long documentary called "West Side Memories", which is about as good a retrospective making-of feature as I have seen on a DVD. Almost all the surviving contributors to the film are interviewed albeit briefly in some cases - Wise and Lehman (both of whom died just last year), Sondheim, Laurents, Beymer, Tamblyn, Moreno (especially sprightly) and a couple of the Jets, Tony Mordente (Action) and Harvey Hohnecker (Mouthpiece). Interspersed throughout is not only footage from the movie but production stills and home movies recorded by one of the dancers, Robert Banas.There are nuggets galore in the documentary, for instance, remembrances of Robbins' choreographic brilliance, taxing perfectionism and insensitivity to the budget (which led to him being fired midway through filming); Wood's valiant but wavering singing voice (which was subsequently dubbed by the oft-used Marni Nixon); and the dubbing of Moreno's and Tamblyn's voices for key numbers. The other extras are not nearly as interesting - a five-minute montage showing storyboards translated into the actual shots; the original intermission music interlude; a couple hundred production stills in a clickable format; and four separate trailers. The biggest extra is actually a hefty scrapbook that includes the entire text of the screenplay and other related material essential to only the most die-hard of fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was junior high school student, I first watched this movie. Then I was moved and excited.I thought that I wanted to become musical actor. So this movie gave me big emotion. I would like to tell you why. First of all, storyline has strong impact. The story gives us important message. I heartily learned fighting repeat next fighting, and take love. Secondly all the dances and the song numbers are very nice. The dances are energetic. So character's feelings appear so much by dancing. For example, when character is angry, dance is aggressive. When character is fall in love, dance is beautiful. The dances make the scale of story large. Music also helps storyline. This movie produced a lot of wonderful music."Tonight" "Maria" "America"....I often hum to myself. These songs make fell happy.I think every people watched this movie will feel something and will about important things. Now many wars and conflicts happen in the world. Therefore I'd like that many people watch this movie and feel important things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical Context of West Side Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considered a classic on stage and on screen, West Side Story is the musical tale of two lovers Maria (Natalie Wood) and Tony (Richard Beymer), each of different race, who must fight prejudice, stereotypes, and poverty on the streets of west side Manhattan. Set in the late 1950s, directors Jerome Robbins (who also choreographed) and Robert Wise depict the tensions between the Jets, second generation white European immigrants, and the Sharks, newly arrived Puerto Rican immigrants, who are fighting for a piece of the street in the midst of this love story. It is during a dance that Maria and Tony meet and fall in love, but they are torn apart by her brother and leader of the Sharks Bernardo (George Chakiris). Using this as an excuse, the Jets' leader Riff, played by Russ Tamblyn, challenges Bernardo to an all out, once-and-for-all fight to decide who will rule the streets.The movie highlights the suspicions and racial tensions occurring between different ethnic groups in 1940s and 1950s America. During this time, many Hispanic immigrants were coming to the country, both legally and illegally. The largest group during this time, however, were the Puerto Ricans, who were actually American citizens. Most immigrants moved to New York City, which still contains the largest Puerto Rican community in the world. Puerto Rico was originally a Spanish colony but was lost to the United States during the Spanish-American War in 1898. Later, in 1917, the US Congress gave Puerto Ricans American citizenship, creating no barriers for immigration. But they were now also eligible for the draft during World War I. 1917 also paved the way for new immigration laws, which stated that people must be able to read and write at least one language. During the years of the Depression, Puerto Rico was hit especially hard because it had grown dependent on one crop, namely sugar. The collapse of its price value produced widespread economic and hunger problems. Many influential leaders then advocated for the separation of Puerto Rico from American control. The years between 1940 and 1960 saw the largest increases of Puerto Rican movement, as many as 545,000 came in search of jobs and new opportunities that America was known for having.Both Robbins and Wise worked hard through the script, choreography, lyrics, and stage presence to establish the tension between the white Americans and the Puerto Ricans. European immigrants who had been living in the US for a while often saw the intruding Latinos as taking over the neighborhood, taking good jobs away from the Europeans who had been there first. They spoke Spanish and maintained their own culture, which the whites saw as anti-assimilation and as "weird." This is shown in Officer Krumpke's (William Bramley) comments on how the "PR's" (Puerto Ricans) are corrupting the neighborhood and dirtying the streets and in Bernardo's taunts that he needs a translator to understand their words. The use of ethnic slurs, such as "Pollack or Spic," also adds to this tension.Many immigrants who moved to the United States came with dreams of a new life, filled with opportunity and riches. However, their hopes were often smashed as they met a hostile environment of prejudice and hard times, finding poverty here, as well as, in their home land. The juxtaposition of their idealistic dreams and the harsh reality of the situation is found in the musical number "America," sung mainly by Anita (Rita Moreno) and Bernardo. Parts of the movie were filmed on location in west Manhattan in a condemned part of town that was going to be torn down and rebuilt, recreating a poverty stricken neighborhood where many Hispanic immigrants were forced to live.While the directors successfully showed the tensions between the Jets and the Sharks, they neglect to portray that the Puerto Ricans were actually American citizens. While Officer Krumpke does vaguely acknowledge this right, it would be more clear if there was better emphasis on this event. Another suggestion that may help the audience understand the historical context would be to add more Puerto Ricans in the background or surrounding areas as to signify that this was a time of great Puerto Rican immigration, causing the tensions of the time.Watching West Side Story is as enchanting on screen as on stage, affording the audience a closer and sometimes more in depth view of this world that the stage cannot offer. The songs and music make one want to dance and sing with the characters, as many have heard these classic songs before. Once again, Jerome Robbins has created amazing choreography that encapsulates the violence and stress of hard times in New York City, especially during the stylized fight scenes. The plot is a take-off of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, so the audience is mostly aware of storyline. Most people, as well, enjoy rooting for the "star-crossed lovers" who must fight against social issues and familiar objections, reveling in their late night rendezvous and romantic interludes. While probably cutting edge at the time it was made in 1961, the cinematography is outdated for today's audiences. However, the picture is a fun and entertaining way to spend an afternoon while learning about the racial prejudices of the time.Overall, West Side Story portrays the racial difficulties and social problems plaguing immigrant groups in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s, especially among Hispanic and European groups. Yet, it proves that these problems can be overcome through the romance of Maria and Tony, and their ability to see past racial lines. The music is captivating and catchy, and one quickly understands why this story on stage and on film has become a classic American musical. This movie is worthy of 8 ? stars for its romantic storyline, wonderful music, and its portrayal of immigrant life in the US. West Side Story shows that while a new life can be difficult, it can also come with amazing opportunities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>West Side Story creates its own wonderful realilty in a world of concrete, brick and wonderful music and dancing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>********POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD***************************************** "West Side Story" is a tragic love story which is told with drama, singing and dancing. The movie begins in an unusual way: with an overture and colorful but indistinguishable art work on the screen. Nothing is wrong with your DVD player or VCR. The scene will come into focus after several minutes of listening to the musical overture. The movie opens with interesting panoramic views of New York from the perspective of looking down on the city. One gets the impression immediately that this could be a 'pretentious' film. And someimtes it is. Humans show up on the concrete landscape of New York. They are young men, apparently from rival gangs. They dance, they sing, conveying their thoughts symbolically through dance and lyrically in song rather than through dialogue. Two policemen show up and there is some dialogue. These are two rival gangs, one of white immigrants, and one of Puerto Rican immigrants. Often, the two gangs seem more like rival dance troupes than genuine street gangs. The two gangs, the Jets and the Sharks want to rumble. A rumble is set up for the next night, after a community dance. The leader of one gang tries to get his friend, Tony, who was a former leader to come back to the gang and fight in the rumble but Tony who now has a job wants nothing to do with it. Tony even encourages the gang to fight with 'skin' and not use knives, rocks or guns. At the dance, Tony meets and falls head over heals for Maria, the sister of the leader of the Puerto Rican gang. The dance is amazing with unbelievably great dancing on display by members of both gangs. The photography and special backgrounds are also terrific during the dance sequence. Unfortunately, Maria's brother takes an immediate dislike to Tony who has dared to show an interst in his sister. Maria naively talks Tony into going to the rumble to attempt to stop it, with disastrous results. The movie is full of amazing and delightful dance sequences and tremendous songs. The dramatic impact of this movie kicks into high gear when Maria's brother is killed by Tony at the rumble after killing Tony's best friend. Both gangs are angry and are in a state of chaos as they scatter from the scene of the rumble. Maria learns that Tony has killed her brother, yet in her sorrow and grief, still loves Tony. Maria plans to meet Tony and run away with him, but in a climactic scene, Tony is shot by the police and Maria embraces him while he dies. It takes the death of Tony and the tears of Maria to bring the two rival gangs together and stop their hatred at least for the moment, and hopefully indefinitely.This is one of those movies that you must experience first hand to know what it is like. It is definitely a musical, but it definitely not your average musical. It may not be for all tastes, but to give it anything less than a 9 or 10 would be unfair because it is so unique and full of wonderful elements. I thought that "Moulin Rouge" was a truly cutting edge and great musical, but I must admit that "West Side Story" was also innovative and daring, and made forty years before it. You won't forget it after you've seen it, and songs and scenes will undoubtedly linger in your mind long after it ends. Songs like "America", "Maria", "Somewhere" and "Tonight" are not easily forgotten. The choreography is nothing short of spectacular! This movie puts "Chicago" with Renee Zelweiger, Catherine Zeta Jones, and "Richard Gere" to shame, especially the dancing. One wonders what all the hullabaloo about "Chicago" (2002) is for after seeing "West Side Story." The story within "West Side Story" is much more compelling and touching. The songs are better. Simply stated, "West Side Story" just works and gels together much better. Watching West Side Story requires a commitment, though. West Side Story is two and a half hours long. The first half hour to hour of the movie may have you wondering if you like this movie or not the first time you see it. But once this excellent film pulls you in to the world of the Jets, The Sharks, and their girls and once you buy into their reality, the intensity never lets up. I give this amazing film 91/100 points. Natalie Wood is beautiful. Richrd Beymer is the boy next door with a big heart. Their love story will touch you. Rita Moreno is a spitfire. Russ Tamblyn is a firecracker. Simon Oakland and Ned Glass are terrific in supporting roles. After you've seen "West Side Story" all the way through once, you'll be able to go back and enjoy and savor the entire movie and the astounding one of a kind reality which it creates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without serious rivals as the greatest musical film ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The incredible choreography and the soaring melodies are the centerpiece of this dynamic, standard-setting epic musical. In my opinion the choreography is at its greatest during the Dance at the Gym sequence partly because the background music is so contagiously brilliant and the best song (not the most POPULAR, mind you) is the TONIGHT QUARTET that last note is so incredible you just can't but wish you were up there with the cast singing right from your soul. Natalie Wood has been crucified by the press since day one for her lack of emotion in the part but it works just fine in reality. These days she's gotten more criticism over the fact that she's as Puerto Rican as Doris Day and maybe she is but I still prefer her in the part rather than Audrey Hepburn (whom I had read was offered the part as well as CLEOPATRA and THE SOUND OF MUSIC). They should have aimed all the backlashing reviews exclusively on Richard Beymer. The part calls for a love-struck, can't-see-any-other-perspective-than-my-girl's type of boy but Beymer's Tony is a bloodless whimp. The great performance in the film is Rita Moreno as Anita. She has even more nerve and determination than George Chakiris' Bernardo. Her final scene at the end of the film is summed up as raw, resonant and outstanding. Chakiris is more calm, cool and only so amped up in the Rumble scene. He plays the perfect Latino teen of the 50s, nothing ever really bothered him until his territory was invaded (i.e. his sister). The other standouts in the cast are Susan Oakes as the lovable, determined tomboy Anybodys and Russ Tamblyn as the fun-loving, acrobatic Riff. They both give underrated performances, maybe because they looked and played like two typical kids for their day.As a film, WEST SIDE STORY is better than the original play. Carol Lawrence who played Maria on Broadway looked more Italian than Puerto Rican, Larry Kert was too old to play Tony and Chita Rivera as Anita didn't have enough vocal power to sing. It came to the stage the same year as THE MUSIC MAN (the corniest, most sickeningly-sweet film I've ever seen) and WEST SIDE the play only won two Tonys (no surprise, the film version is better) and MUSIC MAN took home the Lion's share of awards. When WEST SIDE came to the screen it took home ten Oscars (more than any other musical film has before or since) and MUSIC MAN came out a year later and only got two Oscars (ha! ha!). Just goes to show how wrong the theater critics can be about a bad play saying it can't be made into a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ten Oscars Say a Lot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent version of a fine stage musical. Although the sequence of events was changed, and a couple of musical numbers were switched to reflect this, it is still a superb rendition of this Robbins-Laurents-Bernstein-Sondheim masterpiece. Maltin's review, though he does give the film 4 stars, says that the leads (Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood) 'lack charisma'; I disagree. I think they do a fine job of portraying the two young lovers; they are '12 feet off the ground'; terrified; excited; and looking forward to a future that, on some level, they know they don't have. Yet, they strive for it anyway. They act like two young lovers who are confused yet elated, and optimistic against all logic. The music, singing, and dancing could hardly be better. Great a stage play as it is, the canvas of the motion picture screen gave the makers a truly large place to paint this story; and they do an outstanding job.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>West Side Story is an exception in few exceptions. I am not a musical fan, but this is a big exception. This film has more than just songs and dances (which are really well directed by Oscar winners Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins), there is a lot of drama and romance, much taken from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It shows 2 communities in New York's West Side that always never get along and rumble, except for 2 people, Tony and Maria who fall in love in a time of hate. This, along with a great musical score and songs by Leonard Bernstein make this a landmark with It's memorable songs and actors. Winner of 10 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Director(s), Supporting Actor and Actress and a special one for Robbins choreography. Well done (for once) A++.</fullReview>

It was the first musical I ever saw, and it opened up my eyes to the joys of musicals and the classic films of Hollywood.The romance is heartbreaking and the Leonard Bernstein-Stephen Sondheim score is one of the best ever written.

		<shortDescription>One of the Great Musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been numerous films, from "Broken Arrow" to "Snow Falling on Cedars", which have made use of the Romeo and Juliet theme of two lovers from opposite sides of a divided community. "West Side Story", however, does not just borrow Shakespeare's basic theme but also follows the outlines of his plot, while turning it into a musical and updating it to the New York of the fifties. The Montagues and the Capulets become two rival street gangs, the Jets (white) and the Sharks (Puerto Rican). The two young lovers are Tony, one of the Jets, and Maria, the sister of the Sharks' leader Bernardo. Apart from the lovers' parents, most of Shakespeare's main characters have their equivalents in the film. Bernardo is Tybalt, Riff (Tony's close friend and the leader of the Jets) Mercutio and Tony's elderly employer Doc Friar Lawrence. Maria's older confidante Anita has some of the characteristics of Juliet's Nurse, but she has another role as Bernardo's girlfriend. Many of the important scenes from the play also have their equivalents; thus the dance in the gym parallels the Capulets' ball, the scene on the fire escape the balcony scene, and so on. "West Side Story" is not simply a musical; it also deals with two important social issues, racism and juvenile delinquency. The two issues are, in this context, seen to be connected. The influx of Hispanic immigrants into New York at this period led to friction between them and the established population, even though many of that population were themselves of recent immigrant stock. Many of the Puerto Rican characters complain of having met with prejudice and discrimination, which reinforces their own prejudices against white Americans. Bernardo resents being referred to as a "Spick", but he has no compunction about referring to the Polish-American Tony by the equally derogatory term "Polack". The witty number "Gee Officer Krupke" humorously satirises fashionable psychological and sociological theories about the causes of delinquency, but the film also puts forward a theory of its own. Membership of the racially exclusive youth gangs is portrayed as being a means of strengthening one's sense of racial identity as well as one's sense of one's own importance. The Jets' slogan "Little boy, you're a man; little man, you're a king" has been described as encapsulating in one line the seductive appeal of fascist ideology. When the two gangs clash, they are not motivated merely by youthful aggression but also see themselves as defending the honour of their respective communities. The film is therefore both a tragic love-story and a piece of social commentary. This dual nature is reflected both in the look of the film and in its music. The songs fall into two categories. Those dealing with the love of Tony and Maria are generally traditional melodic ballads such as "Tonight" and "A Place for Us". There are also, however, a number of songs which comment on social issues, and these, such as "Gee Officer Krupke", "America" or "The Jets Song" are harder-edged, characterised by more modernistic harmonies and rhythms and witty or sardonic lyrics. Besides two distinct styles of music, the film also makes use of two distinct palettes. The more tender scenes between Tony and Maria are mostly shot against a dark background relieved by pale whites and yellows. In those scenes dealing with tragedy, violence or strong emotions, (such as the dance at the gym or the "rumble") hotter colours, particularly reds, predominate. When, after Bernardo's death, Tony and Maria sing "There's a place for us", the red light in the background casts an ominous shadow over their love, at odds with the optimistic words they are singing. In the tragic final scene Maria, previously seen in white or yellow, wears a red dress for the first time. This final scene is the only occasion on which the plot of the film diverges markedly from Shakespeare's. This was presumably done in order to increase the dramatic tension. Like Romeo, Tony wrongly believes that the woman he loves is dead. At this point those viewers familiar with Shakespeare will probably assume, as I did, that the film will end with Tony committing suicide in despair and Maria following him. Then Tony sees Maria, realises his error, and for a brief instant we hope that a happy ending is after all possible, only for these hopes to be dashed almost immediately. This brief revival of hope does, however, add to the emotional power of the ending. I felt that the two leading roles could have been better. Richard Beymer makes Tony too bland, the sort of young man who would be more at home in the Boy Scouts than in a gang of street fighters. There was nothing particularly wrong with Natalie Wood's Maria except that she seemed rather one-dimensional, charming and sweetly innocent but lacking depth. I found myself regretting that Audrey Hepburn (the producers' first choice for the role) had not been available. Despite that reservation, however, this is one of the great film musicals. Leonard Bernstein's score is brilliant and the song lyrics are both witty and pertinent, often driving home the film's points as well as, or better than, the spoken dialogue. The ensemble dance numbers are the most powerful and energetic of those in any musical that I have seen, with the possible exception of "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers". Although there had been a growing trend in the fifties to use the musical as a vehicle for more than just lighthearted amusement, "West Side Story" was the film that, more than any other, showed that it was possible to use the genre to combine entertainment with social comment. The contrast between this film and Bernstein's previous film musical, the fluffy "On the Town", shows how much the genre had developed in only twelve years. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story on the West Side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Possibly the greatest musical ever told retells the "Romeo &amp; Juliet" scenario for the late 50s/early 60s era of youthful teenagers.Set in said era (late 50s, early 60s), two NY based gangs of street teens - the white gang known as the Jets and the Hispanic gang known as the Sharks,battle each other time and time again for the right to rule the streets, much to the annoyance of the local cops. The Jets leader, Riff (Russ Tamblyn) has hadenough and decides to challenge the Sharks leader, Bernardo (GeorgeChakiris) at the local nightly dance to one last brawl (or "rumble") to settle things permanently. For support, Riff asks his best pal and co-founder of the Jets, Tony (Richard Beymer), who has been growing away from the gang and hero of ourmusical, to come along and Tony reluctantly agrees for old times sake, but he's got a feeling that there's something much bigger in store for him.Enter Maria (the late Natalie Wood), Bernardo's little sister. Maria is a bit naive about the ugly side of America, partly because she's young and partly because Bernardo won't let her go out anywhere. Well, he brings her to the dance with his girlfriend Anita (Rita Moreno) and his chosen suitor for Maria, Chino, and at the dance, among the frenzied dancing, Maria spots Tony and vice versa. Theresult: love/lust at first sight. Tony and Maria try to carry on a secret affair while their friends, family and peers clash with each other over the relative pros and cons of American life and battle for the right to hold the street. Things take an ugly turn when Maria asks Tony to stop the rumble to protect Bernardo and Tony (being as stupid as he is) tries to, but the result is that a fight breaks out between Bernardo and Riff which ends in Riff's accidental death at Bernardo's hands.Enraged, Tony grabs Riff's knife and stabs Bernardo and all Hell breaks loose before the gangs are driven off from under the highway by the sound of sirens.Maria learns the truth from Chino and later from Tony. She forgives him and they plot to run away while the Jets new leader, Ice (Tucker Smith) advises them on how to stay calm under the pressure. Then a tomboy tells the Jets that Chino's out to kill Tony and the Jets try to protect Tony. Maria manages to win thesympathy of Anita for her plight and gets Anita to go give Tony a message at the drug store he works at, but the Jets won't let her through and get a little too rough with her. After being rescued by Tony's boss Doc, Anita lies that Maria is dead, which leads Tony on a suicide binge until he sees Maria from across the playground, thinking at first that it's only in his mind. But when he realizes that its her, they run to each other but Tony is gunned down by Chino. After Tony'stouching death, Maria curses the stunned members of both gangs for theirpettiness and cruelty towards each other. Members from both gangs pick upTony's body and carry it away while Chino is arrested and Maria follows them, heart broken but hopeful.Yeah they took some liberties with the play, but this is a damn great film. Good music, colorful sets, and lively dance numbers combined with the racismmessage to elevate above other musicals. The acting is also good and wellsuited to the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only is this the greatest Musical ever, but it pulls off the desirable feat of being filmed as the greatest Movie Musical ever. In fact, as movies go, in my book it's second only to The Godfather.West Side Story makes an immaculate combination of singing, dancing, acting, and plot to craft the supreme form of entertainment. The vocals are great, the songs are BEAUTIFUL - Jet Song, MARIA, America, TONIGHT, Cool, QUINTET, OFFICER KRUPKE, A BOY LIKE THAT, Somewhere - All some of my favorites. The choreography enhances these soaring melodies with visual poetry. The actors emote their characters so well - especially the supporting and Natalie Wood. Even dubbed, the singers are fantasm! And the story - what's better than a simple Romeo and Juliet transposed to West Side New York? 10 and beyond!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not that "West Side Story" doesn't deserve its resilient popularity; just that I don't understand it.Tony loves Maria. Maria loves Tony. They kiss and sing about it. Tony's gang hates Maria's brother and his friends. Ditto the other way around. They dance and sing about it. All this is played out roughly along the lines of Shakespeare's "Romeo And Juliet", for two and a half hours.I kept looking at the clock."West Side Story" has many problems. The central romance between Natalie Wood's Maria and Richard Beymer's Tony is dully written and blandly performed, while the acting around them is stagy and broad. The script is smothered in cliché, especially when attempting to mimic teenage patter. Too many of the songs by Stephen Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein are inert, unhummable and fail to stir. Co-director Robert Wise labors to give his film a gritty texture, but this is totally undercut by the choreography of the other director, Jerome Robbins. It's hard to buy a street fight where battles consist of pirouetting and leapfrogs.There's no denying "West Side Story" was a big hit, and resonates with many today. It definitely showcases Wise's versatility. I didn't like his other Oscar-winning musical from four years later, "The Sound Of Music", but for an almost completely different set of reasons.The film does look great, decently shot and sumptuously detailed. There are three songs on the soundtrack even I like: "Maria", "America", and especially "I Feel Pretty", which make their mark and move things along nicely. Russ Tamblyn as the leader of the Jets, Riff, stands out with his acrobatic dance moves and his way with a line as he prepares for another gang war:"We fought hard for this turf, and we ain't just gonna give it up...I say this turf is small, but it's all we got."Perhaps the biggest issue I have with "West Side Story" is the way it staggers after significance, from the opening titles (Saul Bass is usually so much better) to the closing scene where what's left of the cast assembles at a darkened playground to lick their wounds. Again and again, the stabs at greatness clash with the artificiality of the musical form and the staginess of the acting and direction. It seems a bad idea to mix backlot sets with real street shots of Manhattan; if "West Side Story" was going to work, at least for me, it needed to either dive more deeply into the fantasy side of the story or else be conceived a whole different way.Of course, that wasn't a problem with the Broadway musical, where artifice and big showstopping moments are part of the accepted vocabulary. On film, though, it all rings a little hollow."Loving is enough", Maria tells Tony near the end."Not here," he replies.He means the mean West Side streets, but I thought for a moment about the movie camera. Maybe it's just me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poignant treat for audiences, fans of musicals or not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some classic films have gotten no critical acclaim on their release; others have gotten huge critical success yet have fallen in popularity in recent days. One such is West Side Story. Resulting in one of the profoundest films of all time, West Side Story gathered legends of the present and future from all genres: famed director Robert Wise (Sound of Music) and legendary Broadway choreographer Jerome Robbins** at the helm, prolific composer/conductor Leonard Bernstein with his iconic score, and Stephen Sondheim with the lyrics in his big break. Though it has fallen in popularity and ratings in the past years, Robbin's memorable characters of Tony, Maria, and the teenage gangs of Manhattan merging with notable dance sequences offer a poignant treat for mature audiences, fans of musicals or not.With the united, recurring finger snaps put to Bernstein's blaring and catchy score in a nine-minute prologue, we meet two rival teen gangs, the Puerto Rican Jets and the Caucasian Sharks, and, distinguished by the keen cinematography, their two dear and beloved leaders, Bernardo (George Chakiris) and Riff (Russ Tamblyn), respectively. Furthermore in this scene, we witness a brawl between the fuming gangs rendered in spectacular choreography, setting the plot and subsequently building a foundation for future elements towards the frightful "Rumble," an all-out war between those gangs. Next, the Jets arrive at a Shark's dance to intimidate the Sharks, but they involuntarily strike a spark between two young attendees, Maria (Natalie Wood), sister to Sharks chief Bernard, and Tony (Richard Beymer), best friend of the Jet's Riff, resulting into a "love at first sight" against family and racial differences.This film, a possible PG-13 in today's principles, has not much in question regarding negative content but rather in its material on sex and race that borders offensive. A spin-off from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, it deals with the deep racial issues between the Puerto Ricans and covetous Jets, emphasized by strong hostility, various, sharp and inventive racial slurs, suggestive comments and mild swears. Just before the "A Boy Like That" number, the two main characters wake up together in bed, implying a sexual interaction, and in a building of tension, Anita, Bernardo's sister (Rita Moreno), is almost raped by the Jets. Also, as mentioned before, darkness hangs over the film throughout, especially during the second half.Effortlessly, Wise, Robbins and Bernstein smoothed the thick line between the light and depressing. Establishing the standard for modern film- musicals, West Side Story won George Chakiris and Rita Moreno Oscars (justly), beginning Moreno's journey to the EGOT***. However, the nominations for lead actor and actress were noticeably missing. Although not diverting, Richard Beymer appears tired and drunk throughout while Natalie Wood's mock accent has been criticized duly as discriminatory. Also, because of Hollywood censors, the creators unfortunately could not include the lover's suicides as depicted in Romeo and Juliet. But taking that out as a legitimate excuse, West Side Story formed strong characters that left me pensive.I like how the creators make you witness both sides of the episode. First you root for the Jets, then the Sharks, then both, agonizing like a lesser character once saying: "Why do you kids live like there's a war on? When do you kids stop? You make this world lousy!" West Side Story, hits deep with the significant characters yet doesn't bother much about unimportant ones. The Honorary Oscar-winning choreography isn't just a show-off of the dancer's techniques; in my favorite number, "Cool," an exhilarating release after the death of the Jet's leader that depicts their pain and agony through grunts and shouts, the sharp choreography enhances their emotions. Let's just hope that Robbin's work of genius in West Side Story hopefully may procure its ancient acclaim with a re-release someday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Christmas coming up,I started to keep a look out for any films which my dad mentioned he was interested in seeing.Whilst watching a clip show on TV,I was surprised to discover that my dad did not have West Side Story on DVD,which led to me deciding that this X-Mas it was time to step into the west side.The plot:Wanting to expand on their turfs,gangs the Jets and the Sharks fight against each other in a ground war.Ignoring the half-hearted attempts by the cops to stop them fighting,the gangs start to attack each other in an increasingly deadly manner. Traditionally staying apart on the dance floor,Jet member Tony catches a glimpse of rival Shark Maria and falls in love with her at first sight.Spotting Tony,Maria soon finds herself falling in love with him,which leads to Maria and Tony having to go to war with their own gangs. View on the film:Opening with the Jets and the Sharks diving across the stage,directors Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins (who got sacked over being a "perfectionist" for the dance scenes,which led to filming being delayed and the movie going over budget)treat both gangs in a lavish manner,as ravishing ruby reds and fading blues come between the star-crossed lovers,with Wise &amp; Robbins heating up the feud between the gangs with an extreme stylisation,as flashes of blood reds are cast against the troubled gang members.Along with the dazzling appearance,Wise &amp; Robbins present the dance scenes with a dashing elegance,thanks to firmly held wide shots allowing the viewer to catch every rapid-fire dance move.Whilst having to make changes to the script to please the ratings board, Ernest Lehman adaptation is still able to offer street smart songs and rosy melodrama.Keeping Tony and Maria separated by the gangs,Lehman does very well at building anticipation for the lovers to join together,which Lehman than brilliantly breaks into a million pieces.Featuring references to rape and drugs,Lehman does not shy away from painting the gangs/lovers in a negative light,as each side stokes up tensions and introduce new elements (such as knives and guns) into their turf war.Although he was far from happy with his performance, (and did not get on with his leading lady) Richard Beymer still gives a very good performance as Tony,who Beymer shows is unable to fully sand down the gang edges he has for his first love. Joined by a wonderful Rita Moreno, (who decades later starred in the stunning HBO series OZ) Natalie Wood sadly never appears fully comfortable as the Latino Maria,with Wood being very fond of overusing "big hand" gestures.Keeping the tension between them off screen,Wood strikes the blossoming romance with a passionate note,with Wood filling Maria's eyes with love and sorrow,as Tony &amp; Maria's romance ends on the west side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent choice of changes from the Broadway production and great directing choices make this brilliant in every way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great theater can make you smile. Outstanding theater can make you weep, and in the case of "West Side Story", it isn't just the tragedy of the story but the way it is told through song and dance with Leonard Bernstein's music, Stephen Sondheim's lyrics and Jerome Robbins' choreography. Bring on Robert Wise to take on the dramatic sequences (sharing credit with Robbins) and you have a great start already. Casting choices for the leads aside, everything else meshes, turning into a film that 50 years later is sure to impress. A recent Broadway revival also managed to bring the Broadway show back to life, utilizing the changes of certain songs for mood and emotion, particularly switching the location of "Gee Officer Krupke!" and "Cool" to different acts than the original production to increase tension and bring the audience even deeper into the story.Also recently on Broadway, "West Side Story's" original source, "Romeo and Juliet", was altered to suit racial tensions, but while that was an important part of "West Side Story's" legacy, it was unnecessary for "Romeo and Juliet". Here, late 1950's/early 1960's Manhattan is utilized as the playground for two gangs of different backgrounds: the mainland born Jets and the Puerto Rican natives, the Sharks. Neither gang is devoid of sympathy and unlike "Romeo and Juliet", there is certainly no villain. Riff of "The Jets" is certainly decent, yet misguided, and all Bernardo of "The Sharks" wants is to be accepted into his new land and make a home with his sister Maria and girlfriend Anita. It is obvious by their manners that Bernardo and his pals probably tried to be cordial to the Jets but individual prejudices got in the way to prevent that. Even so, the Jets are products of their upbringing, and while the gang is obviously violent and the newcomers hot-tempered, neither one can be blamed other than what society had pushed them into becoming.Jerome Robbins' choreography is prevalent from the start, the opening airshot of Manhattan and surrounding eras pouring into the close-up of the gangs at war. The dance is masculine and exciting, and there is never any evidence of any of these men being any less than macho. Even the rumble later on is disturbingly choreographed, as is the post-rumble "Cool!" where the Jets prepare to go on after tragedy has struck. To lighten things up, Robbins has the fun but tense "Dance at the Gym" (hosted by none other than "The Addams Family's" John Astin!) and the hopeful "America", changed from the original all-female version to include the male Sharks as well.Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood have been riddled with attacks of miscasting, and I do agree that they are not the most magnetic of screen lovers. The heat, however, does come on when Rita Moreno (replacing Chita Rivera as Anita) and George Chakaris get together as Anita and Bernardo, and their chemistry is intense yet playful. During the "Quintet" reprise of "Tonight!" it is Moreno's preparation for Bernardo's arrival that reveals the sexual passion she feels and makes what happens even more tragic. Moreno and Chakaris deservedly won Academy Awards and years later, Moreno was deserving of even more praise when she comically spoofed her image as an untalented Latina singer in "The Ritz". I'm sure many a gay man jumped out of their seats in laughter when she guest starred on "The Nanny" and started a scene with Fran Drescher by saying "A boy like that to kill your brother..."High praise, too, for Russ Tamblyn for his role of Riff. Having won screen immortality as "Tom Thumb", he is outstanding here as the very likable Jets gang member who seems at times torn over the hatred between the two groups yet unable to get away from it because of unmentioned pressures from his own pals. Each member of the gang stands out in one way or another, and when they have the rival gang dance, you can feel that there is a tension in these rebels without causes that even they can't understand.As the professional creative debut of Sondheim, he writes masterful lyrics even though as he states some of them don't sound like something a Puerto Rican girl would stay. (I'm referring to certain lyrics in "West Side Story"). But take "Tonight", "Something's Coming", "One Hand One Heart", "Somewhere" and even certain lyrics of "I Feel Pretty", you have one of the all-time classic musical theater scores that did more to advance that genre of live entertainment than any other show of its era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Review: West Side Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My film review is on the very popular 1961 musical 'West Side Story' directed by Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise. It is a story about two young characters from rival gangs in New York City who fall in love with one another. It is a modern adaptation of the romantic tragedy, 'Romeo and Juliet'; there are a few differences in the two plots but a lot of similarities.When I first started to watch 'West Side Story' I didn't like it. I thought the beginning was very long and dragged out as the two rival groups danced in the middle of New York. The music and the dancing were very repetitive. It didn't really tell much about the story like other Romeo and Juliet stories would. There was no talking for the first fifteen minutes which I thought dragged it out even more. You didn't learn much about the characters like their names, why they were fighting or even where they were from. However you knew as soon as it begun that it was a musical, as the boys fought in the court yard the music went along with their actions. The first song sang then tells you a bit about the New York gang, how strong they are and how they won't let anyone take their ground.There are a lot of similar scenes in this Musical like there is in 'Romeo and Juliet', however in this story they use modern English and even some Spanish. There is a dance scene which is a lot like Zefirell's 1968 film. The dance scene is very colorful and it is where Tony and Maria meet for the first time, they dance and kiss but unfortunately Maria's brother does not like this and sends her home. Everyone dances in two circles like they did in Zefirell's version. There is also a version of the famous balcony scene in 'West Side Story' but with a modern twist, instead of Maria being on a balcony she is looking down at Tony from the fire escape stairs off her apartment block. I find this really interesting as it modernizes this scene up and since there is so many versions of the balcony scene out there it's just nice to see a bit different.There are very similar symbols in 'West Side Story' than there is in Zefirell's 'Romeo and Juliet'. Circles comes up a lot throughout both movies, at the very beginning of 'West Side Story' there is a bird's eye view of a child drawing circles on the ground in the basketball court where the two gangs first meet, we then see it again in the dance scene when the girls and boys dance in two circles this is exactly Zerfiell's dance scene. Another very common symbol is hands, throughout the musical we see Maria and Tony use their hands a lot to express their feelings. In the "balcony scene" they touch each other's hands and say how cold they are. Then when Tony is leaving they reach out their hands to each other as if they don't want to leave each other. The ending of 'West Side Story' is very much like the ending to 'Romeo and Juliet'. Riff gets killed by Bernard accidentally, Bernard is very shocked when it happens and you can see he regrets it as soon as it happens. This is just like when Tybalt kills Mercutio in 'Romeo and Juliet'. Then Tony kills Maria's brother Bernard, just like when Romeo kills Tybalt.I like the characters in this musical, Maria is played by Natalie Wood, Tony is played by Richard Beymar, Riff is played by Russ Tamblyn, Anita is played by Rita Moreno and Bernard is played by George Chakiris. They are good actors and fit the characters really well. I think they are all a good age to play this version of 'Romeo and Juliet'. They aren't as young as the cast Zefirell had for his film. I also quite liked the music in 'West Side Story' the songs were really good and catchy and told the story even better. I like the fact Robbins and Wise made this adaptation into a musical. Since there are so many versions of Romeo and Juliet out its nice to see a completely different way of watching it.In all I liked this film, I thought it was really interesting the way they had the Spanish gang and the NYC gang against each other. The way they changed it into a musical made it even more interesting, it kept me more entertained than the play or the film would.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unparalleled use of the medium in a Hollywood musical........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unburdened by the restrictions inherent in a stage production,the movie version of "West Side Story" swoops down onto the streets of 1960s New York.Streets that are throbbing with music and vitality,hope and love and sadly - hatred too. Through this concrete jungle stalk the two tribes,Riffs and Jets,whose animosity has spanned decades.Then as now this is no "One Nation" city. When members of these warring factions fall in love,tragedy results. "West Side Story"'brings a freshness and energy,joie - de - vivre and sheer "cool",in the jazz sense of that much - abused term,to a familiar plot. It has the most wonderful choreography,an outstanding score and imaginative photography to bring to the party. From the opening whistles far below the skyscrapers to the end titles presented as graffiti,the film is a constantly surprising visual delight. The mixture of music and images is so compelling that the lacklustre lead performances don't really seem to matter unduly. Concentrate instead on the remarkable Miss R.Moreno whose performance in "America" has never been bettered in my opinion. It is a film to be enjoyed in youth and savoured in old age. Thank you Mr Bernstein,Mr Sondheim and Mr Robbins,you have created an immortal piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern Romeo and Juliet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reason why I like this movie is foremost because it forms a sort of transition between the old fashioned musical of the '30's and 40's mostly and the more modern ones, that we also still know and see these days. This movie is from a time that the genre wasn't that popular anymore and not a whole lot of musical movies got made during the '50's and '60's. After the acclaimed success of this movie there was a small revival again and this movie pretty much set the standard for the more 'modern' movie musical.This is a real musical alright. The movie doesn't ever pretend to be a 'real' movie, which means that the movie is going for a totally theatrical approach instead of realistic cinematic one. The entire movie basically consists out of singing and dancing, so also the acting is something totally different from what you would normally see in a normal movie, that is still trying to be somewhat more straight-forward and serious with its story and drama. Also the entire movie obviously looks like it got shot on a large stage, as opposed to outside in a real city. It's all done very deliberately and I must say I liked this approach to the genre.This was the first musical movie Robert Wise directed and only 4 years later he made his second musical movie, "The Sound of Music", which perhaps is even better known than this movie already is. Thing I'm always amazed by with Robert Wise movies is that he often picks a genre and then does something totally new and original with it. He did this with science-fiction and horror for instance and with musicals with this movie. He was still being helped though this time by choreographer Jerome Robbins, who co-directed. It earned them both the Oscar for best director and the movie itself won 9 more Oscars, including best picture.And this really is one fine directed movie. Not just with its choreography and all but also really visually. It has a great style over it and the movie is picking some really fine artistic approaches, visually, at times. It's visually less impressive though how the Puerto Rican look like people who had fallen asleep while trying to get a tan. No, the make-up just isn't very good or convincing looking. Even the fake accent often convince more than it.The story that it follows is basically like a modern update of the Romeo and Juliet story by William Shakespeare, though mostly only just with its main concept. The movie still uses plenty of story of its own and comes up with plenty of stuff to still consider the story good and original on its own. But because the movie is not being realistic in any way, the drama of the story also falls sort of short in my opinion, as does the overall message behind it.The movie also features some real classic songs, that I'm sure you've heard before. Not all songs are great but for a movie that features so many songs, that is also virtually impossible. Most of the actors are obviously at home within the genre and know how to sing and dance. The two main leads though are being played by film actors Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer, who's singing also got dubbed.A first great step into the direction of 'modern' movie musicals.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love and Hatred on the Streets of Manhattan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love and Hatred on the Streets of ManhattanI have never been a fan of musicals. I always thought that they were, in general, boring and senseless; however, it is well known that there is an exception for every rule, and I have to admit that my mind changed when I had the opportunity to enjoy the film West Side Story. Although it is a film from older days, actually from back in the 50s, it is impressive because of the energy that transmits and the colorfulness of the scenes.Based on the all times love story Romeo and Juliet, West Side Story was brought as a modern version of Shakespeare's work of art into the streets of Manhattan, where two gangs from different ethnicity, the Jets (Americans) and the Sharks ( Puerto Ricans), fight for territory and respect on the streets. The dilemma starts when Tony, and ex member of the Jets, falls in love with Maria, a charming,innocent Puerto Rican girl who is also the sister of the Shark's leader. Their love is definitely not accepted by Bernardo who is overprotective with his sister, and that will never accept an American ex-jet in his family.The two lovers express their love to each other through a very deep and romantic music more than once. But a chain of events will lead to a tragedy that will change the course of their lives and their pure love.The drama on West Side Story is pretty good, but the most amazing and enjoyable parts are the music and dancing. Music varies in accordance with the characters and the moods. We can perceive lyrics when the lovers sing expressing their feelings to each other, or a Latin mixture as seen on "Life is Alright in America", performed by Anita. Music is stronger when the gangs are fighting. The dancing is absolutely awesome. The choreographies were electrifying. I can assure you that if you see this film, your feet will be moving under your chair. The cast in general was very talented. Rita Moreno (Anita), in my opinion, delivered the best performance on the movie. I particularly enjoyed her singing and dancing in "Life is Alright in America". Her skillful dancing and her Puerto Rican accent made a perfect combination for entertainment. "I feel pretty", performed by Natalie Wood (Maria) was hilarious. George Chakiris (Bernardo) did an incredible job also. In general, the cast was very professional. Tony is an exception to the rule from my view point. I think his performance was weak and his appearance and manners did not have anything to do with those of a gang member.In despite of some goofs that can be noticed along the movie, like not even a speck of blood found after a body has been shot or stabbed, the film was in general well written and directed. The combination of drama, music and dancing was perfectly managed to describe emotions, feelings, prejudices, and violence. I would give this film a rating of eight out of ten. I definitely recommend this musical. Even if you never cared about musicals, this is worth seeing one. It is a good opportunity to change your mind like I changed mine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>West Side Story- so much history and prestige comes with that name. As someone who loves musicals of all kinds, but had never seen this one (born way after release), I had some nervousness watching it. Does it live up to it's praise? Mostly...Everyone knows the story: Two rival gangs the Jets (American) and the Sharks (Puerto Rican) battle it out over control of a small West Side of Manhattan. In the midst of this war, though, Tony(Richard Beymer) and Maria(Natalie Woods), two teens from opposite sides, fall in love. Can their love survive the war that is killing all else in it's path? I guess you'll just have to watch and find out.The music is wonderful and the choreography is gorgeous. The singing left some to be desired, particularly Richard Beymer's vocals. Natalie Woods had her vocals recorded over, and they are decent. The best vocals come from Rita Moreno. Most of what's best about this movie comes from her.Ms. Moreno won an Oscar for her performance as Anita, and it was well deserved. She completely steals the show and I only wish we could have seen more of her. Her performance is probably one of the most powerful I've seen. She has more than one scene that I will not soon forget. Her performance alone would make the show worth watching, but George Chikalis is equally strong as her brother, Bernardo. The two leads, Beymer and Woods, are fine, but nothing too special. Natalie Woods deserves some respect for her final scene. It is quite passionate.West Side Story is certainly not the best musical ever made- not even close, in my opinion. It is, however, a classic that will live on most likely forever for it's tragic story and wonderful music. Not to mention Rita Moreno- don't get me started again! 7/10 stars...Jay Addison</fullReview>

The story of rival gangs in NYC, and the love story akin to Romeo &amp; Juliet; Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood are the lovers or rival gangs. George Charkiris and Rita Moreno are brother and sister of another rival gang. The music is fantastic by Leonard Bernstein and written and directed by Jerome Robbins and Arthur Laurents.

		<shortDescription>The Jewel in the Crown: a true Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead!If Rebel Without A Cause was the first film to examine juvenile delinquency and its effect on teenagers in the 1950's, then West Side Story just magnifies that even more and cements it into the Hollywood pantheon.West Side Story is a true masterpiece of film making. So often, that word gets overused in trite describing other unworthy films over the years, but here it is true. A film that won a record ten Academy Awards including Best Picture and set the standard for a new generation of film making, West Side Story examines the topics of passion, hatred, dignity, family warfare, and love all on a grand scale.Recently, I was fortunate enough to see the film in a Cinemascope Widescreen format, and what a treat it was. For as long as I can remember, West Side Story has been one of my all time favorite films. Still, when I describe my fondness and affection for it, I can not give one solid reason as to why I love it so. Perhaps it is because of the beautiful score by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, a score that in my mind is unsurpassed in the annals of American Musical Theater to this very day. Or perhaps it is because of the breathtaking choreography and direction by the show's original creator, Jerome Robbins; a true master of his craft who kept sections of his cast quarantined from one another to induce the tensions of intolerance, hatred and discontent among the many characters of this, his magnum opus. Or perhaps it is because of the brilliant set and costume designs of Boris Leven which actually transport us back to the slumsof the Upper West Side of New York City, circa 1957. But, all in all, it is the acting in this film that has stayed at the forefront of my brain throughout the years.Natalie Wood gives in my opinion the performance of her career as Maria, a young Puerto Rican girl whose first taste of love is tempered by the already strong hatred that is brewing between her brother Bernardo's (played exquisitely by George Chakiris in a role that gave him an Academy Award) teenage street gang the Sharks and their American counterparts the Jets. The Jets are led by Riff (played innoculously here by Russ Tamblyn) and are the domineering force on the streets of their neighborhood, their "turf". Maria's quiet, low-key existence is shaken when she meets Tony (played by Richard Beymer in a role that was almost tailor-made for his acting abilities and yet that isn't saying much), an American boy who is also one of the founders of the rival gang, the Jets at the Dance at the Gym. In short, they meet there, they have their first kiss and calamity ensues. The remainder of the film takes us back and forth between the opposing gangs and their ways of life. We see the Sharks dancing gaily upon a rooftop, led by Anita (played to sheer and utter perfection by Rita Moreno in a role that gave her an Academy Award) extolling the praises of life in America and minutes later we see the Jets assembled outside the neighborhood druggists performing a slapstick almost vaudvillian routine in sarcastic response to the lawfulness of their "favorite" Policeman, Officer Krupke. Set within all of this is a gorgeously vivid love story that is set against fire escapes and bridal shop dress dummies. Both stories of Love and War combine to mesh together in one of the most heart-rending and powerful finales that I've ever seen in a musical.Even though West Side Story is close to forty years old by this time, its message of true love against all odds continues to touch first time filmgoers and seasoned veterans alike almost as if they are seeing it for the first time. To quote from the score of the musical that quite possibly has touched me the deepest in my entire life:"When love comes so strong, there is no right or wrong, Your love is your life"My rating: 4 stars...without a doubt</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so thrilled when "West Side Story was named the second best romantic movie of all time by AFI last year! Because I missed some of the show and they got to the top ten I was convinced that I had missed it or it hadnt made the list ......When they got to # 2 and the music started I was the one dancing in the street!. I don't care if the movie was dubbed and it took nearly 40 years to admit it.I have had a crush on Richard Beymer for years and have found myself championing his performance in West Side Story for ages.(Not that he needs it). I was watchin the movie for the umpteenth time ,and decided to look up reviews of the original stage play...I found many similar comments about Larry Kert's performance that were so familiar to Richards.Then it hit me.... There is not an actor who has ever played Tony that could have done any more with the part.Its the way its written. Tony,like Romeo is a fish out of water, searching for something that no one understands. So give that a rest,ok! George Chakiris and Rita Moreno pretty much do steal the show, and Russ Tamblyn looks like he's having so much fun...The character I really like the best is Anybodys,the girl Jet wannabe,and no I am not a tomboy. When she rescues Tony from the Sharks after the Rumble....(I think her name is Sue Oakes ,and I never saw her in anything else. Ned Glass as Doc and Simon Oakland as Krupke are also excellent. Thank you AFI for picking this favorite of mine. As one of the ads when the film first hit TV said, Unlike some movies, West Side Story grows younger.</fullReview>

I liken it to a sports fan trying to appreciate the opera. But, I enjoy this movie every time I view it. As a kid I thought it was a great movie ruined by the gang singing and prancing around.

		<shortDescription>The Best of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who have nothing will do everything in their power to protect it, even if all they have is territory, in which case they will claim ownership by planting a metaphorical flag in the middle of it and marking the boundaries. And, forever after, anyone invading their `turf' had better have a good reason, because within this imaginary domain a peer status is also established, and to some-- especially the ones at the top of the pyramid-- this becomes all they have or will ever hope to have in their entire lives. But there is one thing that will ultimately, at least for some, supersede this delusional monarchy, and that thing is universal: Love. Which is exactly what happens when a young couple from different sides of the street fall in love, in the landmark musical `West Side Story,' directed by Robert Wise, with staging and choreography by Jerome Robbins. The streets of New York City are the setting for this contemporary version of Shakespeare's `Romeo and Juliet,' the drama of which plays out within the confines of a microcosmic world which encompasses a sparse few city blocks and is ruled by rival gangs, the Jets and the Sharks, who are constantly vying for territory and whose soul purpose in life is protecting their turf. Tony (Richard Beymer) is a former Jet, once one of their leaders, in fact, but has left it all behind in an attempt to get on with his life. His best friend, Riff (Russ Tamblyn), however, is still the leader of the Jets, who are currently embroiled in their ongoing fight with the Sharks. Maria (Natalie Wood) is Puerto Rican, and her brother, Bernardo (George Chakiris) is the leader of the Sharks. And when circumstances bring Tony and Maria together and they fall in love, it sets the stage for tragedy on a grand scale, all of which is captured on the screen in this film, the most celebrated musical of all time. When a movie earns ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director (Jerome Robbins also received a special award for choreography), it clearly indicates that this is a film of extraordinary merit. And this one is-- by anyone's measuring stick. Told through the magic of music, presented through the dramatic and driving Oscar winning songs and score of Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, Shakespeare's tragic love story becomes a transporting, memorable experience that is at once a sweeping visual extravaganza while at the same time an intimate chronicle of the romance between the star-crossed lovers, Tony and Maria. Lavishly staged, the film evokes a true 1950's sensibility while retaining the agelessness of the passion at the heart of the story. The production numbers are dynamic, from the quietude of the enthralling and poignant `Maria,' and the perky, uplifting `I Feel Pretty,' to the energetic `Dance At The Gym' and the thundering, dramatic strains which accompany the rumble. This is an example of filmmaking at it's best, brought to fruition through the talents of Wise, Robbins and a superlative cast and crew, whose many and varied individual contributions are too lengthy to mention here. This may not have been Natalie Wood's greatest role, but she is nevertheless unforgettable as Maria. She is charming and beautiful, with riveting, dark eyes that speak volumes about her character. Her accent is passable, if not perfect, but most importantly her natural ability as an actor enables her to create a very real, believable person in Maria. There's an endearing vulnerability about her, yet in her eyes you find the pride and determination that makes Maria strong. It's a solid performance, and just one of the many reasons this film was so well received. This was without question Richard Beymer's day in the sun, career-wise, and his portrayal of Tony is credible, but fairly lackluster. If a weakness in the film could be singled out, it would be his performance; still, he does well enough, but in the end his work here is average, to say the very best. As his buddy, Riff, Russ Tamblyn comes across much better, and makes the most of showcasing his considerable talents in what is one of his most memorable roles, as well. The performances that really steal the show, however, are turned in by George Chakiris as Bernardo, and Rita Moreno as Maria's friend, Anita; both of whom deservedly received Oscars in the Best Supporting categories for their work here. Chakiris, with his dark, good looks has never been more convincing or better in any role, and he has a commanding presence especially in the production numbers. And Moreno is in a class all her own as the fiery Anita; she dominates the screen whenever she is on, especially during the dance at the gym and in the rousing `America.' She is such a vital presence in this film, and along with Chakiris, more than helps in bringing the music and story to life.  Also in supporting roles that add so much to this film and demand to be singled out, are Tony Mordente, as Action; Tucker Smith, as Ice; David Winters, as Arab; and Eliot Feld, as Baby John.  The additional supporting cast includes Simon Oakland (Lieutenant Schrank), Ned Glass (Doc), William Bramley (Officer Krupke), Bert Michaels (Snowboy), Susan Oakes (Anybodys), Gina Trikonis (Graziella), Carole D'Andrea (Velma) Jose De Vega (Chino), Jay Norman (Pepe) and Gus Trikonis (Indio). An emotionally involving story underscored by a blood-stirring soundtrack, `West Side Story' is without question one of the all time great movie musicals, thoroughly entertaining and presented with the kind of flare that is rarely even attempted anymore. Within the genre, it's the best of the best, the realized vision of a group of extraordinary artists. Earning Oscars, as well, for Cinematography, Costumes, Art and Set Direction and editing, this is a prime example of the true magic of the movies. I rate this one 10/10. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start this off, why on earth did they make the intro of the film so long for what, 14 minutes? They probably want to keep the viewers waiting while I bloody wanted them to get on with it! Seriously they should've known to reduce the time and not be fooling with it! Anyway I really enjoyed the film but what really was a tearjerker was the 'Taunting scene' and Tony dying from being stabbed by Maria's suppose to be fiancé Chino. God it would make you feel like your eyes are burning with rage, it just is very hard and distressing to look out. This is a very very rough story. I wouldn't show this to younger viewers because this can be a frightening experience to look at, even the racism to experience, the near rape scene and the stabbing involved in this film!

The casting couldn't have been better, the music is played virtuosly and flawless. Some changes to the original script make the story even more fitting. Nothing ever came so close to the Original Romea and Juliett story. So i keep on and keep on watching this, my entire life, thats for sure.What I really don't understand how this movie is not in the all time 250 and get's far worse ratings than todays Marvel Comic Blockbuster Movies. Partly because there are people here giving it 1 Star arguing they just don't like musicals in general. Partly because people don't seem to appreciate quality movie making as they used to do.So don't believe the rating, this movie did win 10 Oscars for a reason and is one of the finest you will ever see, i promise!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Choreography plus Directing equal success!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>West Side Story's success can be summed up thanks to three areas: the direction, the choreography, and the music. Though I'm not crazy for the film, I recognize the what it does right and I fully embrace what it masters. Film scholars and novelists say that everything produced in either medium draws ideas from Shakespeare's penned plays. West Side Story not only draws inspiration from Shakespeare's most recognizable play, but it almost acts as a remake of Romeo and Juliet. Too bad it doesn't hold the merit Romeo and Juliet does, but what revamped, modernized remake lives up to the quality of the dated original?As I stated earlier, the thing that allows West Side Story to be hung in the hall of great movie musicals is the dazzling choreography. It's the best choreographed film of all-time; name any musical or action movie, it doesn't hold a candle to West Side Story's accomplishment in this area. You could see the hours it took to create and polish each dance move; effort is key here. The dancing itself is performed by very talented theatrical actors who hit every mark perfectly. West Side Story bounces from ballads to dance numbers, which maybe is a good thing to allow the audience a moment to breathe from the overwhelming, rich extravaganzas.The direction by Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins is what elevates the movie and shows off the quality within the actors and off the page of the script. It's an insanely watchable movie that never complicates the viewer or makes them squirm. I was completely content because the direction strained out all the feelings I sometimes express during a movie such a discomfort, straying thoughts, and restlessness. Wise and Robbins make sure the audience is with them through every musical note that's played. It's stunning direction that creates a fresh and crisp feeling, which leaves the film with a beating pulse long even after you leave the theater or put the DVD back on the shelf.You may have never seen West Side Story in any form before, neither on stage nor through cinema, but I guarantee you have listened, danced to, or caught songs from the film in your head. "I Feel Pretty" is the classic song, expressing how love first affects a person. "America" succeeds as a strong dance and singing number creating a scene of exuberance. "Gee, Officer Krupke" is a hilarious sequence with intricate staging. Epic, emotional levels are reached in numbers such as "A Boy Like That/I Have a Love." And an adorably romantic scene is crafted in "One Hand, One Heart." Combine catchy, deep music with the extraordinary choreography, West Side Story results in having many show stopping scenes.Acting in a musical is sometimes judged by how well the actor performs whatever musical number they're faced with. The singing and dancing are what is judged, not the acting. Darker musicals are usually successful in letting actors show their acting abilities as well as perform the songs to the best of they are capable of. West Side Story doesn't sacrifice its actors at the expense of music, yet only shows darkness selectively in the second half. Rita Moreno is the performer of West Side Story that will WOW your eyes out of their sockets. She is outstanding! There is so much of Anita throughout the film at different levels. Moreno creates a complete character if there ever was one, and she places at the near the top of the Supporting Actress list in history. George Chakiris is good in his role, but the real showcase of the supporting actors is Russ Tamblyn, who fires his vitality at you in every scene he's in. Natalie Wood succeeds inconsistently and unfortunately makes the lead character bland at time.Like I said Natalie Wood's humdrum interpretation halts from the overall quality at times, Richard Beymer who plays her romantic opposite is abysmal. Not only does Beymer detract from what West Side Story has going for it, but distracts the viewer from the greatness that's made around him. Beymer never convinced me once. In fact, the supporting cast trumped the leading actors, which made me dread the moment I knew the story had to switch from ensemble-driven sections to the lead couple scenes.West Side Story also tests out new methods of storytelling which doesn't support the overall quality it could have going for it. While most of the songs shimmer with greatness, there are the occasional few bad apples. The aspect that really keeps me at arm's length with West Side Story is the lack of affection I have for the source material. Though the direction plows through a lot of my distaste with it, traces of the musical I'm not a fan of obviously must appear. The way West Side Story tries to tear down the ethnic walls of society backfires as well.West Side Story has an amazing pace to it, I rarely looked at my watch and the film flew like a newly licensed teenager driving their parents car. Considering how much I actually liked the story that was being told, the film kept me focused and never slowed down. This is another hats off to the directors. They knew exactly what they wanted and attacked it with clarity. It's decorated with bright colors with almost a theatrical feel to it. Though it suffers through many obstacles, West Side Story accomplishes an incredible amount with its directing, choreography, and acting from Rita Moreno. Some of the film may not work, but what does work is breathtaking!Rating: 8.5/10Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The casting director should have listened to Natalie Wood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The major problem with this picture is the painful lack of chemistry between the two leads, Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer. Wood was very young (23) and just not accomplished enough as an actress to hide her anathema toward Beymer. She wanted her lover at that time, Warren Beatty, in the lead and thought Beymer should be fired. I have to concede she was right. He is oddly graceless and clunky in this part. Kind of a dork. Certainly not believable as a gang member. I'm no fan of Warren Beatty, but the film would have been a lot more compelling if he'd played the lead. There was not an ounce of real passion between Tony and Maria. All their scenes together are duds, and that detracted terribly from the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic, But Hard to Watch Today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Musical about two youngsters from rival New York City gangs who fall in love.I understand this film won 10 Oscars, and I understand why. It truly deserved them. The opening dance scene ranks as one of the greatest scenes in move history and the choreography is almost unbelievable. Not to mention the film stars one of my favorite people, Russ Tamblyn (who I know from "Twin Peaks" but you might know as Gideon from "Seven Brides For Seven Brothers").I do feel the film does not hold up well today, though. It runs long, drags a lot, and many of the songs could be cut short or cut completely, adding nothing to character development or the plot. And the biggest mistake was casting Natalie Wood. I understand she added a known name to the picture, but she did not do her own singing, barely danced, and is obviously not Puerto Rican. I simply cannot understand who decided that the film would benefit from her inclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sing in the Moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is shot in Manhattan but 'takes place' on the filthy streets of New York City. The movie is about two gangs who want the same turf. During the film, two of the gangsters from opposite sides fall in love and it causes conflict on both sides.Throughout the movie they burst into song and sometimes it's not at the right moment. It is totally out of context. But in the movie when boy meets girl they instantly fall in love and want to be together forever. The girl, Maria, has an older brother who is the leader of the Puerto Rican gang, the sharks, and has chosen her boyfriend for her. But as the girls break out into song they sing that they are in America and are free to do what they want. He forbids Maria from seeing Tony but they go behind his back. Also through the movie Riff, the gang leader of the Jets, is trying to figure out a plan on how to keep their turf against the Sharks. When he finds out he??. you have to see the movie: )It is one of the most famous, classical films I know. The movie had a mood that was irresistible. You couldn't help yourself from continuing to watch it. The dancing in the film was very dramatic and had a lot of energy in which I liked very much. The music was interesting.What I did not like about the film was that sometimes the singing wouldn't be at the right time. For example at the end when Maria is singing. I'm not sure if I liked the music they picked at times either. I also did not like the fact that some of the scenes were still staged. For example at the dance where Tony and Maria are dancing together. I liked how the actors played all the characters. Natalie Wood did a fine job at playing the roll of Maria. And as the roll of her older brother Bernardo, George Chakiris, did a fantastic job being a gang leader. Russ Tamblyn did a wonderful job playing Riff, the gang leader of the Jets. He made me believe that he had all the fellows under control, even when they got out of control. In addition, Richard Beymer playing as Tony, made me believe he was really in love with Maria. He showed a lot of passion for her in the movie. Rita Moreno did an amazing job playing the roll of Anita. The girlfriend of Bernardo. When she was acting and showing her feelings toward everything that happened, she made me believe that she really felt that way. My overall view of the film is that it was a great musical but some things could be changed. I hope some day they will redo it and change some of the mistakes. I would pay money to go and see it. I would rate this film an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the modern day Romeo and Juliet tale of two lovers who try to overcome the rivalries between the gangs they are from. The are also themes of the gang hostilities themselves, the relationships between other central characters such as the gang leaders and the sentiments of socially disadvantaged youth trying to find their own way in the world. This is all brought to life with the help of some original and memorable songs, including 'Tonight', 'America' and 'I Feel Pretty', to name but a few.I absolutely adore the stage version of this musical, so I was eager to watch the film. Obviously it stayed reasonably true to the script, although it was disorientating to hear a few of the songs sung in completely different parts of the film. The other problem is that it has not aged well. Many of the colours (both set and costume) just look garish today. Additionally, some of the acting seems a little overcooked, especially from Tony, the male lead.Having said that, the overall messages of the story, as well as the fantastic songs, do provide for enjoyable viewing and it is incredibly moving. However, (and I really am not being snobby!) I would recommend a trip to a theatre to watch it on stage if you want to get the full impact of this musical.</fullReview>

There was too much dancing,singing, and running too actually understand this film. The actors were good and Maria was hot and Tony was good. Everyone else, were all deadheads and made the movie a bore. Both the sharks and the jets were too violent. On the commercial it said "Unlike other classics, West Side Story gets younger." The reason for this is because it would not be fair for it to bring the other classics down with it in a blaze of pain. It will never be a classic with me.

Ever.It makes your heart soar with joy - with the songs "I Feel Pretty" and "America." It gives you satire which is as current today as it was in 1961 - with the song "Officer Krupke." And it gives you the most devastatingly beautiful, romantic, and moving songs ever written in "Maria" and "There's a Place for Us." Leonard Bernstein and all persons associated with this film are forever heroes of American culture for giving us this film.

		<shortDescription>Romeo &amp; Juliet musical-style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who have nothing will do everything in their power to protect it, even if all they have is territory, in which case they will claim ownership by planting a metaphorical flag in the middle of it and marking the boundaries. And, forever after, anyone invading their "turf" had better have a good reason, because within this imaginary domain a peer status is also established, and to some-- especially the ones at the top of the pyramid-- this becomes all they have or will ever hope to have in their entire lives. But there is one thing that will ultimately, at least for some, supersede this delusional monarchy, and that thing is universal: Love. Which is exactly what happens when a young couple from different sides of the street fall in love, in the landmark musical "West Side Story," directed by Robert Wise, with staging and choreography by Jerome Robbins. The streets of New York City are the setting for this contemporary version of Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet," the drama of which plays out within the confines of a microcosmic world which encompasses a sparse few city blocks and is ruled by rival gangs, the Jets and the Sharks, who are constantly vying for territory and whose soul purpose in life is protecting their turf. Tony (Richard Beymer) is a former Jet, once one of their leaders, in fact, but has left it all behind in an attempt to get on with his life. His best friend, Riff (Russ Tamblyn), however, is still the leader of the Jets, who are currently embroiled in their ongoing fight with the Sharks. Maria (Natalie Wood) is Puerto Rican, and her brother, Bernardo (George Chakiris) is the leader of the Sharks. And when circumstances bring Tony and Maria together and they fall in love, it sets the stage for tragedy on a grand scale, all of which is captured on the screen in this film, the most celebrated musical of all time.When a movie earns ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director (Jerome Robbins also received a special award for choreography), it clearly indicates that this is a film of extraordinary merit. And this one is-- by anyone's measuring stick. Told through the magic of music, presented through the dramatic and driving Oscar winning songs and score of Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, Shakespeare's tragic love story becomes a transporting, memorable experience that is at once a sweeping visual extravaganza while at the same time an intimate chronicle of the romance between the star-crossed lovers, Tony and Maria. Lavishly staged, the film evokes a true 1950's sensibility while retaining the agelessness of the passion at the heart of the story. The production numbers are dynamic, from the quietude of the enthralling and poignant "Maria," and the perky, uplifting "I Feel Pretty," to the energetic "Dance At The Gym" and the thundering, dramatic strains which accompany the rumble. This is an example of filmmaking at it's best, brought to fruition through the talents of Wise, Robbins and a superlative cast and crew, whose many and varied individual contributions are too lengthy to mention here.This may not have been Natalie Wood's greatest role, but she is nevertheless unforgettable as Maria. She is charming and beautiful, with riveting, dark eyes that speak volumes about her character. Her accent is passable, if not perfect, but most importantly her natural ability as an actor enables her to create a very real, believable person in Maria. There's an endearing vulnerability about her, yet in her eyes you find the pride and determination that makes Maria strong. It's a solid performance, and just one of the many reasons this film was so well received.This was without question Richard Beymer's day in the sun, career-wise, and his portrayal of Tony is credible, but fairly lackluster. If a weakness in the film could be singled out, it would be his performance; still, he does well enough, but in the end his work here is average, to say the very best. As his buddy, Riff, Russ Tamblyn comes across much better, and makes the most of showcasing his considerable talents in what is one of his most memorable roles, as well.The performances that really steal the show, however, are turned in by George Chakiris as Bernardo, and Rita Moreno as Maria's friend, Anita; both of whom deservedly received Oscars in the Best Supporting categories for their work here. Chakiris, with his dark, good looks has never been more convincing or better in any role, and he has a commanding presence especially in the production numbers. And Moreno is in a class all her own as the fiery Anita; she dominates the screen whenever she is on, especially during the dance at the gym and in the rousing "America." She is such a vital presence in this film, and along with Chakiris, more than helps in bringing the music and story to life. Also in supporting roles that add so much to this film and demand to be singled out, are Tony Mordente, as Action; Tucker Smith, as Ice; David Winters, as Arab; and Eliot Feld, as Baby John. The additional supporting cast includes Simon Oakland (Lieutenant Schrank), Ned Glass (Doc), William Bramley (Officer Krupke), Bert Michaels (Snowboy), Susan Oakes (Anybodys), Gina Trikonis (Graziella), Carole D'Andrea (Velma) Jose De Vega (Chino), Jay Norman (Pepe) and Gus Trikonis (Indio). An emotionally involving story underscored by a blood-stirring soundtrack, "West Side Story" is without question one of the all time great movie musicals, thoroughly entertaining and presented with the kind of flare that is rarely even attempted anymore. Within the genre, it's the best of the best, the realized vision of a group of extraordinary artists. Earning Oscars, as well, for Cinematography, Costumes, Art and Set Direction and editing, this is a prime example of the true magic of the movies.10/101961 151 minutes CC.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why can't Hollywood make pics as great as this anymore? It used to be that you had to be able to sing and/or dance and have talent along with maybe being good looking. Now you don't even have to be good looking to make it! True Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer were dubbed, and Rita Moreno was dubbed for "A Boy Like That" and "I Have a Love", but those that they selected for the dubbing process had voices virtually identical to the actors' speaking voice and they selected well-trained singers for the dubbing. The leads for this pic were superb and the supporting cast is first-rate, especially Rita Moreno's Academy Award Winning performance as the fiery Anita and believe me she totally deserved that Oscar! No one has ever given a finer performance as Anita in stage productions. George Chakiris deserved his too, but I also think that Russ Tamblyn should have at least been nominated. I don't understand how Natalie Wood's beautiful performance was ignored by the Academy, especially since she labored so hard to achieve the Puerto Rican accent. The score is some of Leonard Bernstein's best and the lyrics are some of Stephen Sondheim's greatest; the choreography by Jerome Robbins is eye-popping, especially in those scenes of greatest intensity.Great picture; wonderful acting, wonderful numbers, great choreography, great music. You must see this movie! It's some of the greatest!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Problems with Authur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may a trifle late in the day to criticize this popular work, but I've always had problems with it, and continue to do so. Since it's been so widely hailed and lauded, I admit to now feeling a little guilty about my negative feelings. Nonetheless, they still persist.On a personal note, I had the pleasure of residing in mid-Manhattan, New York City, between 1956 and 1961. The whole time I was there, I read or heard nothing of the "ethnic problems" that the "Jets and Sharks" act out in Authur Laurent's play. As far as I know, the Puerto Ricans and "Anglos" got along just fine. While there may have been an occasional minor skirmish between a few individuals in certain Bronx or lower Manhattan neighborhoods, they were rare, isolated incidents, which hardly made press.Therefore, it was a bit of a start to see Laurents use these quite compatible real-life groups as "dramatic foil" for his "Montague-Capulet" counterparts in his "Romeo" mod treatment. I still recall sitting in the audience the third week after "West Side" premiered on stage at the Winter Garden Theater on Broadway, and being rather repelled by what Laurents had done in terms of "ethnic exploitation." Frankly, I didn't like that particular element at all, in spite of its admittedly brilliant over-all production. (It also was awkward for me, in that I happened to personally knew a number of the dance-cast members from their studying ballet at the June Taylor Dance School a few blocks away.)When this work was transferred to film, I again saw it shortly after it opened in a Broadway movie house with gigantic screen and booming stereo. Of course, the productional effects were overwhelming--yet that annoying "exploitation element" persisted--and does so to this day.As far as I'm concerned, there was never nor is now little or no basis in reality for the depiction of the "Jets and Sharks" in terms of these particular ethnic groups, in New York City or its boroughs. As a result, I've never completely "bought" the fundamental premise of Laurent's "Shakespeare updating." Thus, my appreciation of "West Side Story" continues to be decidedly diminished. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply one of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>West Side Story is simply one of the best musicals ever; from the soaring melodies of Leonard Bernstein fused with Jerome Robbins choreography to an old Shakespearian tale updated to another era, it is all a sublime viewing experience.If viewing this post chronologically, mine would follow that of the previous poster whose lack of NYC knowledge and misunderstanding of the era in which this is filmed contribute to his failed appreciation.Anyone knows you won't find gangs in Forest Hills Queens; though the West Side is slightly gentrified today, the Spanish Harlem has moved uptown to Washington Heights around the GW Bridge; in 1960 this WAS reality on the West Side of NYC, albeit, without song and dance; then again, this IS a musical ! My only complaint would be Richard Beymer's casting as all the other Principal actors were perfect; but, you can't help but feel all the pathos for his character at the end of the movie no matter how many times you view it.This movie is in my own personal top ten list and I suspect I am not alone in that opinion.</fullReview>

Shame on you!Yes the songs are classics and still stand up today, but the bloody and downbeat ending (what does this add?) destroys the little afterglow they have.

		<fullReview>"West Side Story" is unanimously regarded as one of the all-time greatest cinematic romances yet when we think of Tony and Maria, there isn't much imagery to come to mind, except for the Cinderella-like thunderbolt and the Shakespearian conclusion. Apart from that, the two modern 'Romeo &amp; Juliet' never shine as well as they interact with their respective circle, instead of each other. As Tony, Richard Beymer, who's not given the meatiest role anyway, is more appealing as the ex-Jets leader desperately trying to talk the two rival gangs into peace, and Natalie Wood is irresistible as the enamored Puerto-Rican nubile, feeling so confidently pretty, witty and gay, and strong enough to defy her overly protective brother Bernardo.The love story is here and it is as pure and touching as the two idealistic lovers, but ironically, their interaction tends to slow down a narrative that is more excitingly driven by the hateful passion inhabiting the two gangs. Even the romantic songs are objectively forgettable when compared to the iconic "America" or the climactic "Tonight", even the dialogues are never as sharp and biting as when they're used in the very context of a confrontation. The romance is so overshadowed by the cinematic appeal of the rivalry that I'm wondering if "West Side Story", while not the best love story, might be the best hate story ever.For instance, take the two Oscar-winning roles: Rita Moreno who played Anita and George Shakiris as Bernardo, both Puerto-Rican. These are the characters that stuck to mind because they reflect the contradictions within immigrants, both strike as traditional people in their mindset but they live in lust and transgression, so much for their Catholic background and Family values. And there is a reason why Anita only half disapproves Maria's liaison, and why the most defining song is "America". Indeed, the catchiness of the refrain, the wit of the lyrics, Leonard Bernstein bombastic rhythm all elevates the scene to the same iconic status as "Singin' in the Rain" or "Somewhere Over the Rainbow". Ironically, the song doesn't even drive the story, it's just a parenthesis revealing a gender-related shift within the ethnic one.The conflict is also between boys and girls and this is a very relevant statement about emigration, as it's common knowledge that women are more enthusiastic to embrace freedom while men, coming from patriarchal cultures, are embittered over losing their authority, let alone for Whites. This is a social relevance that foresees more serious dramas about racial tensions, like Spike Lee's "Do The Right Thing" or "Jungle Fever". And when you think about it, which other movies comes to your mind when you think of Puerto Rico? Now, where does the heat come from? For Anita, it's just about guys having to let something out, according to the cops, they're just hoodlums, according to Doc, the candy store owner, these are the youth that will make the world lousy. According to the mainly concerned ones, they're just being misunderstood. What they all can agree about is that violence is inevitable.To those who blame emigration, the film indicates an often overlooked point, it is more a generational thing, immigrants mostly consist on young people, young men whose disoriented behavior is more likely to tend toward violence when mixed with poverty. These are the roots of violence and adds the generational gap to the gender and ethnic one. And I maintain that this is one of the greatest hate stories, even more because you can hardly make hatred or war appealing, but this is where the music has the edge over the story. The film was directed by two men: Robert Wise for the drama and Jerome Robbins for the dance choreographs but there's more to admire in Robbins' direction because he really had a way with the music.And "West Side Story" is certainly one of the best on that level, a vast project that took months of rehearsal and that, for the first time, used the urban landscape of New York as an area of artistic expression of a troubled youth and an energetic and energizing dancing never seen before, a sort of musical tagging on Hollywood walls. Violent moments were shot like graceful poetry while poetical lyrics conveyed hotness and coolness, in all the meaning of the words. Of course, here and there, you get some dated exchanged, the whole "chicken" jokes are a bit redundant, but the use of violence was still risqué, not to mention some sexual innuendo, and till know, I believe one of the most sensual moments of American Cinema is Anita putting her stocking and say that she's going to have her kicks? and have her private mix tonight, under the red lighting that leaves no doubt about the tragedy to comes.Love vs. Hate, men vs. women, young vs. old, Jets vs. Sharks, Robbins vs. Wise, "West Side Story" is constantly driven by binary forces, there are always two "sides" of the story, no pun intended and generally, there's one of them slightly superior to the other on a technical level, but never disposable as everything has its purpose. And the conclusion of the film, while predictable, because of the Shakespearian narrative, leaves you stunned by the incongruous power of silence. The prophecy has been fulfilled, the kids indeed made the world lousy. And Maria, like a Virgin Mary whose red dress is like spilled by all the bloodshed, blindly curses the haters and mourns her Anton, achieving the genesis of one of the all-time romances.I know I said it wasn't necessary the best, but given that it's one of the best musical ever that happen to be a romance, there was no way we could ever forget Tony and Maria, an iconic couple by proxy, but iconic nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether or not we've seen it, we all know about Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins' film adaptation of West Side Story (1961). A classic retelling of Romeo and Juliet in the cinematic version of Arthur Laurents' musical, this film's tunes, story, and romantic tragedy have echoed in our American culture for over fifty years through the infamous feud between the Caucasian Jets and Puerto Rican Sharks?aka the Montagues and the Capulets. West Side Story is a charming trinket whose relevance we like to think belongs to the past, but what if the film isn't just a portrayal of the past? What if traces of it still exist in the reality of today's America? Latinization in America, primarily the Big Apple, has been happening for more than a century. The results stand loud and proud through the bodegas on every corner, Spanish-speaking establishments, and the spread of vendors selling pastelillos. In 2016, there doesn't seem to be any indication of Puerto Ricans hiding away with their own kind. But this isn't the case in the New York of West Side Story, where mid-century immigrants have to fight a turf war just for the right to exist on the streets, and the star-crossed lovers, Maria (Natalie Wood) and Tony (Richard Beymer), stand no chance as their respective sides tug at them, forcing them to choose allegiances. Although today's New York is an exploding melting pot that allows people to embrace their skin, there is a gut reaction to retreat to the familiar in the face of panic or the unknown. Whether it's family or culture, we run back to the comfortable, edging away from anything that embodies the Other. You'll see where today's America and West Side Story collide if you mix a little politics with mambo.Take the witty scene where all the gangs attend a dance on neutral territory. To keep the peace, the host suggests a game of partner roulette, but plans change when Shark leader Bernardo and Anita (Rita Moreno) reach for each other while everyone else follows suit. Hence, the song "Mambo" plays as the opposing sides dance in spirited bursts that don't differ much from the choreographed fight scenes. In fact, throughout the film, Sharks and Jets mark their territory, whether women or streets, intent upon dominating the other side, ruining everyone's chances of equality or peace. Each gang draws a stark line between "Us" and 'Them." Yet while the men focus on dominance and divisions, some of the women try to build bridges with wishes of prosperity and for the development of American identities.Before any blood is shed in the film, a standoff between the Sharks and their girlfriends occurs in the unforgettable number, "America." The men and women have different ideas of what it means for them to be an American, but again, we get this insistence on loyalty in the lyrics: "Here you are free and you have pride, / Long as you stay on your own side." When you stop humming this captivating tune, you start to wonder why "America" is so catchy. The song offers so much hope about futures with "Cadillacs" and "terrace apartments," but it also illuminates certain truths about the limits minorities face. This scene in the film paints a picture of how Puerto Ricans come to the U.S. for success but end up in cramped apartments in condensed Spanish communities without fancy cars or appliances. This isn't so different from today's New York, where many minorities try to make do in the ghetto while having to get around on the always crowded 4 train. Still, this does not deter the hunt for identity on American soil?or as Anita would say, "I like to be in America!" The search for American identities and loyalties to our ethnic identities have always caused a struggle, regardless of whether or not we were born in this country or come from a mixture of ethnicities. Latinos and other minorities, even if they have the highest of hopes and the bravest of hearts, are hindered, if not crushed, by cruel realities daily. For instance, take the police officer Lt. Schrank. He constantly sniffs around at any sign of tension between the gangs, but he also doesn't hesitate to bark at the Puerto Rican Sharks to go home instead of the Caucasian Jets. He doesn't mind jumping at the chance to help the Jets for the possibility of fighting the Sharks. We can find Lt. Schranks in officers who abuse racial profiling to make an easy arrest, extremists of immigration reform policies, and even minorities who joke about other races to get a sense of superiority. There are also plenty of Anitas, who have big dreams but are disillusioned by the limits imposed by prejudice. We can find them in girls whose scholarships are based on their skin color, women who force their children to lose their accents, and children who don't distinguish race until they attend school.West Side Story has won eleven Oscars. It has been acclaimed for its music and excellent romance, and it still should be. Wood and Beymer enchant us with dreams before breaking our hearts with reality, and Rita dishes out some sass and disillusionment. Meanwhile, everyone dances on the side of the wall that they have built and maintain?not that different from the walls between countries and peoples that certain politicians wish to erect today. Whether you watch it for fun or illumination, this film deserves another award for still being an eye-opener of what it really means to live in America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>West Side Story is taking back the streets, one interpretive dance at a time. It's a classic to both American cinema and musical theater. A well-deserved masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of William Shakespeare's most popular plays has always been "Romeo and Juliet". The story of star-crossed lovers, has been adapted so many times for the big screen that many of them, don't really stand out, much. Directed by Robert Wise, West Side Story doesn't have that problem. This film is exceptional to point, has been deemed "culturally significant" by the United States Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1997. Not only that but its ten Academy Awards wins, make it, the musical film to beat. It's really hard to hate this film. Loosely inspired by Shakespeare's work, West Side Story takes the best dramatic parts of the story and moves the conflict to the Upper West Side neighborhood in New York City during the late-1950s. Instead of having the clichés and old, two royal families fight each other over family ties, honor, justice, and revenge. We have two young urban ethic gangs; the U.S.-born nativist gang known as the Jets, and the Puerto Rican immigrant gang known as the Sharks going at it, over class warfare and racism. Using this type of a conflict, and clever writing by screenwriter, Ernest Lehman, the movie is able to be shown as social commentary on the issues of race relations, immigrations and juvenile delinquents. It's these clash of cultures, where we get to see, much of the magic of West Side Story as well. Instead of using the old fashion Queen's English dialogue to push the story, along. We get then- hip American's Beat-Generation beatnik, mixed with the aficionado Spanish Harlem, dialogue. I just hate that the infamous Hays Code ruin the use of profanity. Also, the fact, that most of the slangs are now somewhat dated. However, at the time, these young men &amp; women were still considered as cool 'Katz'. It's also nice to see major minority characters in a film. Even, if most of them, are played by white actors. Also, I like how the original Broadway's soundtrack, return for the film adaptation. It's nice to listen to the jazz and Latin aesthetics sound. It made this film, very watchable. Mad props to composter, Leonard Bernstein for making this happen. His score for West Side Story, helped bridge the gap between classical and popular music. Even, the songs by songwriter, Stephen Sondheim was amazing. It's really surprising, how catchy, songs like 'Tonight', 'America', 'I feel pretty' and 'Gee Officer Krupke", are today, when compare to back then. Another shout out, goes to all the dance choreographers that work in this film like Jerome Robbins. The way, they were able to use ballet type moves to portray acts of violence and further the plot is pretty unique and edgy at the time. While, in today world's, the 1950s dance moves might seem a bit silly and out of touch. Its unique style still lives on. After all, we still love to snap our fingers as if we're getting ready to go to a rumble. It was revolutionary. It help create the style of dance that now feature in many, many music videos. Also, mad props to the set of abstract graphics of the city and the overhead aerial shots, created by Saul Bass. The opening and closing sequences with the NYC skyline was astonishing. Honestly, there was something that was a bit underwhelming. It had to be the two main characters, Tony Wyzek (Richard Beymer) &amp; Maria Nunez (Natalie Woods); two members of the rival New York City gangs who fall in love with each other, only to have the tensions between their respective friends build toward tragedy end. They were written, so bland, with little to no personality, besides looking innocent and in love. It doesn't help that Richard Beymer is not really a man, I call for being charismatic. At least, not in the same level, as their original choice for the role, Elvis Presley. I don't see, how he was able to woo, Maria, off her feet. While, yes, I know, a lot of people give credit to Natalie Woods for being the glue that holds the movie, together. For me, personally, there was barely anything in her performance that 'wow' me. Yes, she look alright as eye candy; however, her singing voice was below average to the point; that she was dubbed over, for somebody else. Her character's personality was paper thin, and her screen presence as a Puerto Rican was somewhat jarring. Even, her semi touching speech in the end; was a bit disappointing. I'm really hoping for at least more from her. I really don't know, why they pass over, original Broadway actress, Carol Lawrence for this role, for Natalie Woods. I know, that she was American sweetheart, at the time, but it felt to me, that Lawrence is more suite for this type of a role. Still, I give credit for Woods for trying. Honorably, do you know, who deserve, more credit for making this film, work. Supporting actress, Rita Moreno. She was amazing in this film as Anita, Maria's closest confidante. Every scene with her, shown, the actress can handle a large number of emotional range. I'm glad, she won, an Academy Award for this role. Even, in the male side, the supporting actors were better than the main actor. I have to give, mad props to both Russ Tamblyn as Riff, Tony's friend and George Chakiris as Bernardo as Tony's rival. The jokes and intense action moments, between them, really does work. Both deserve, their high praise. Overall: With that say, West Side Story is one of the best films, made in the 1960s. West Side Story gives us, something new out of William Shakespeare's timeless novel that people were wanting for. So let's get ready to rumba! Watch it and join in, with the fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting and easily to relate to.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching the film West Side Story I couldn't help but be reminded that it is somehow loosely based on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Which means it's what Shakespeare referred to as a romantic tragedy. Instead of having the two families fighting and opposing one another, it's two rival gangs. To me it seems like a more modern take on the famous tragedy. Which is a good idea as in today's world gang violence is rifer than feuds between wealthy families. If we think of and compare two notorious street gangs, it's easier to relate to the story. It's filled with heart-ache, choices, that I would call "The Eternal Balance'' or more understandably right from wrong, advantages or disadvantages. Taking modern issues and substituting it in to make the story interesting and more understandable for our modern situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely loved this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1957 Broadway show, the film of West Side Story graced our screens on October 18, 1961. The Broadway show was adapted from Shakespeare's play, Romeo and Juliet. The show and movie used the same theme of two lovers meeting, being from contrasting groups of people. In West Side Story, Tony is a member of the Jets (American), while Maria is a Shark (Puerto Rican). As is the case with Romeo and Juliet, these two characters fall in love and by doing so, cause the deaths of two people who are close to them. Although similar in themes, the movie definitely has its differences ? for instance, it is a musical. In terms of acting, an area which I have a bit of experience in, this musical adaption most definitely delivers as there are very strong performances given throughout. One which stood out for me in particular was that of Natalie Wood, who played the role of Maria. For the majority of the film, she played the role which such vulnerability and sweetness, traits which I believe to be extremely suited to a character like Maria. However, in the final scene, her anger and passion is let loose and we see a complete character change. This shows diversity for Natalie as an actor but, it also brings depth and dimension to the character of Maria. On a side note, Russ Tamblyn, who plays Riff, also shone quite brightly. His comic timing and screen-presence lit up every scene that he was in. The musicality in the film was absolutely stunning. The dances were choreographed beautifully. Specifically, I enjoyed the song performance of "America" by the Sharks. This is such a nice song that the Puerto Ricans sing about life since they have come to America. The dancing, however, is phenomenal in this scene. One word to describe a lot of the ensemble numbers in this musical would be 'upbeat'. They are all very rhythmic, which provides an interesting contrast to the much slower duets that are sung by Maria and Tony respectively. Having done some research on this film and the actors in the lead roles, I am aware that a lot of the actors did not do their own singing and that their voices were dubbed my professional singers. Although this point annoys me, it definitely does not take away from the performances of these songs in the film, as the actors' expressions definitely bring emotion to the songs. The overall plot was obviously loosely based on Romeo and Juliet but, one key difference was at the end of the film. In the story of Romeo and Juliet, both titular characters die at the end. In West Side Story, it is only Tony who dies. For whatever reason, this adaption chooses to have Tony murdered, rather than taking his own life, which is the case for Romeo. For me, this makes his death even more tragic, as he did want to live on with Maria and spend the rest of his life with her. Does this work though? The answer is simple: yes! This is a clear distinction between West Side Story and Romeo and Juliet ? in fact, it is one key element which sets the stories apart. If anything, it allows West Side Story to stand on its own and not rely on the fact that it is another adaption of the famous Shakespearean play. This is a very important point, which I certainly believe to be true. Although an adaption, this film certainly stands on its own two feet and has the credibility to be its own story without the reliance of its predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Musical at its high time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Open a time capsule and watch this 10-Oscar winner in 1961 (including BEST PICTURE), a Rome- and-Juliet inspired musical adaption (originally a Broadway play by Leonard Bernstein) under the milieu of the turf war between two youth gangs, The Sharks (Puerto Rican immigrants) vs. The Jets (local white trashes) in NYC, Maria (Wood) is the younger sister of The Sharks' leader Bernardo (Chakiris), she and Tony (Beymer) are drawn to each other from the very first sight in a dancing room, but Tony is the best of Riff (Tamblyn), the head of The Jets gang. In a single- combat by which two rivalries want to settle all the scores once and for all, Maria asks Tony to stop the rumble but the enmity cannot be quenched and Tony's interference only makes things worse, there will be blood shedding and the hostility widens. It's Romeo and Juliet, so don't expect there will be a happy ending.What is more striking is that WEST SIDE STORIES is a paragon of blending top-notch choreography and singing renditions with the heightened tension in its narrative, compared with HELLO, DOLLY! (1969, 7/10), it is a much more potent film, in a sense that its impact is not purely from the synchronised visual stunt or mellifluous voices, it is a film at the very first place, musical is the form to amplify the emotion of the story, that's why it excels HELLO, DOLLY! in my opinion, the latter is an extravagant party with well-crafted entertainment. In WEST SIDE STORIES, its soundtrack is one of the best successful album in USA for all-time, while going with the test of time, it is dulcet, catchy but also a tad behind the times for the ears of our generation. But the difference between the live play and the film version is they can dub the voice for the latter, Natalie Wood doesn't need to be trained as a soprano, and it hardly affect one's attention to empathy her rejoicing or grief with well-calculated lip-synching. Both Tony and Maria are presented in a conventional way that unfortunately cramps Beymer and Wood's performances, only in the final act, Wood finally gets the chance to unleash her glistening rage and grab the limelight, hones up the dramatic climax with her final roar and condemnation. Indeed it is Chakiris and Moreno (plays Anita, Bernardo's wife) who won two Oscars and it was a rare achievement for non-white actors to win acting statues at then, Chakiris is a slick dancer and competent singer himself, it is more like a trophy for his personal allure and showmanship than his acting skill, which would be repeated by Joel Grey in CABARET (1972, 9/10). Moreno is the one who really rides both the choreography and the hard-bitten drama here, her Latin-gene gifts her fiery passion and she is the first one willing to accept Maria and Tony's love story, and she is not driven by pure hatred even after the ensuing tragedy blindsides her life, her ideals are to bury the hatchet and discard all the animosity because American belongs to everyone, not one racial, but every and each citizen. In the most intense scenes when Anita encounters the Jets in Doc's store, during the violent gang-rape stimulating dance number, she embodies not as a screeching victim, but a stern warrior, she contends with piercing resolution to thaw the deep cleavage rooted in those hoodlums' mindset, at least she has tried. This is a worthy victory for her. WEST SIDE STORY is a one-of-a-kind gem of its genre, directors Jerome Robbins (who was fired owing to that his multiple shooting of every scene was be too pricey for its budget) and Robert Wise (substituted Robbins in the director chair and who would bring us another musical classic THE SOUND OF MUSIC 1965, 8/10) do make wonders and concoct this movie-and-Broadway hybrid with an almost peerless upshot, a marvellous achievement in spite of the thorny multitasking of acting and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>West Side Story--A Classic film that's in a class by itself:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>West Side Story is a wonderful, venerable old classic film that's definitely in a class by itself.The storyline, the music, the dancing, the characters, the costumes, scenery, the singing, and the cinematography, all of which I love, have all been combined into the beautifully dynamic little package that it is. West Side Story is a film that I never tire of seeing over and over again, especially on a great big, wide movie screen, in a real movie theatre, with the lights down low! It always feels fresh and new, like I'm seeing it for the very first time, and I always notice at least one or two things in each viewing that I didn't notice in the last. West Side Story is truly a classic that never grows old. While most classic films (even classic films that I've liked well enough to see more than once.) are somewhat dated and frayed around the edges, West Side Story has withstood the test of time fantastically! The MGM quote "Unlike other classics, West Side Story grows younger is so true!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>West side story is undoubtedly the greatest musical picture of its time. Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins adaptation of Bernstein-Robbins 1957 Broadway musical transferred exceptionally well to the big screen. A breakthrough in musical film, West side story explores all sorts of modern issues such as street violence, gang warfare and racism which resulted in the United States Library of Congress labelling it as culturally significant. Wise's development of an originally Broadway musical to a motion picture was surprisingly successful. The broader array of techniques available to filmmakers enhanced aspects such as colour, created the fast paced dramatic atmosphere that captivated the audience. A contemporary urban adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, located on the mean streets of Manhattan, a long cry from the picturesque streets of Verona. Starring Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer in the lead roles of Tony and Maria, star crossed lovers from rival gangs and featuring enigmatic supporting actors such as Russ Tamblyn, Rita Moreno and George Chakiris the film boasts many outstanding performances. In particular the roles of Puerto Rican gang leader Bernardo and his girlfriend Anita were excellently portrayed by George Chakaris and Rita Moreno, earning them a well-deserved Oscar each for best supporting actor and actress respectively. Their riveting and fierce portrayals of a fiery couple outshone their leading counterparts. Richard Beymer, an unusual choice gave a rather stiff and unconvincing performance as Tony. Wood effectively portrayed the innocent and sweet Maria, as an American actress playing a Puerto Rican character she managed admirably. However, there is an evident lack of on screen chemistry between Wood and Beymer which results in an unbelievable pairing, and an unflattering imitation of the two greatest lovers of all time. Leonard Bernstein's score perfectly accentuates the drama and tension which permeates the picture. Coupled with Jerome Robbins compelling choreography, extravagant and dazzling musical numbers which avoid the constrictions of stage boundaries, the two build momentum resulting in a captivating experience for the viewer. The superb marriage between dance and song brings the film to life and gives a new lease of life to an old well-worn story and is the most attractive feature of the film. The colourful streets and even more colourful characters contribute to this fresh take on Shakespeare's classic tale. The storyline of this adaptation for the most part stays true to the original; Tony and Maria are the forbidden lovers, from rival gangs of different ethnicities. Marias Puerto Rican background adds another dimension to the musical, introducing a new and slightly more contemporary issue to the plot, the racial diversity and prejudice that exists between the Sharks and the Jets. For the most part the two story lines remain quite similar, although the tragic conclusion of West side story deviates from the original, perhaps in an attempt to reduce the tragic element of an otherwise rather upbeat picture.West side story was well received upon its release by critics and public viewers alike, and it is easy to understand the appeal of the vibrant, dramatic and captivating plot and performance, which resulted in it becoming the second highest grossing film of 1961 in America. It was dubbed as "the best film musical ever made", by film critic Stanley Kauffmann. The picture won an astounding ten out of 11 Oscars it was nominated for, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (George Chakaris), Best Supporting Actress (Rita Moreno), and Best Direction (Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins). Overall, I found West Side Story to be wholly deserving of its widespread acclaim and praise. For its tragic genre, the film manages to remain rather buoyant due to its musical and chorographical excellence. Whilst evidently an adaptation, it does not conform to such limitations and the modern twist and deviations from the original plot allow a fresh take which is appealing to modern day audiences. A mostly epic performance by its cast, I believe West Side Story is worthy of the title 'the best film musical ever made'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*spoiler alert* Magnificent, "I'll never stop saying" West Side Story is magnificent! Flashback to the year 1961, where the streets of New York City were filled with two rivaling gangs, the recently immigrated Puerto Rican Sharks, and the defending white natives the Jets. Each respective gang with a leader, to whom the entire gang looks to for advice, and would protect until the very end proves the movie's overall theme of loyalty. However, complications arise when outsiders, somehow related to either gang (Maria is the Sharks leader's sister) fall in love with each other at first sight and decide to spend the rest of their lives together. Begging the question, will either gang put aside their differences so these two lovebirds can be together? Based on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, the movie of West Side Story contains elements that could satisfy anyone. The opening "Prologue," proves, through Jerome Robbins use of aerial shots of the surrounding city contrasting Leonard Bernstein's instrumental, that an intricate action scene is about to take place. The vivid incorporation of ballet, mixed with the sporty style dance fighting is so incredibly detailed, an obvious homage to Gene Kelly's masculine dancing style that became popular after his critically acclaimed Singin' in the Rain debuted. This scene introduces a new genre of gangster fight dancing, which can be argued as an early hip hop dance style, popularized modernly and seen throughout the movie. There is a reason the movie has earned 19 awards and 7 overall nominations. Each scene transitions flawlessly, introducing more action, drama and other popular genres along the way. Elements of the tragic play are emphasized, including the exaggerated love story for the hopeless romantic. John Astin relieves the heavy drama with comedic relief during the dance scene/"Mambo" number. Even the obsessive musical theater major will enjoy this movie. Overall, an audience interested in multiple stylistic qualities can follow the movie, which is what makes this film an overall classic.The music incorporated furthers the storyline without interrupting key aspects of character development, like in other musical movies, meaning songs don't just appear because this is a musical. The songs are so catchy, you'll be singing them days after you've witnessed the movie. Each song serves a purpose, sometimes surpassing the duologue in the film. In fact, the songs without singing tend to be the movies best, enhancing the dancing visuals, intensifying the storyline. The placement of every song may differ from the musical, for good reason, moving the light-hearted numbers to the beginning act, and saving the darker songs for the second. Some musical theater "buffs" would argue against the authenticity of this but by doing so Robbins somehow added more heart to an already emotional piece simultaneously ensuring the film's originality. Each actor possessed the emotionality behind every song in every scene, which is why some earned Academy Awards for their portrayals. However, a majority of the cast was dubbed over by trained singing professionals. Common for film on this era, the idea behind awarding someone for work that wasn't entirely their own seems cheated. The dubbing was fairly obvious in certain scenes as well, making it very distracting (Rita Moreno and Natalie Wood were both dubbed by the same singer at one point in "Tonight," which made the harmony sound like it was being sung in one key). Keeping in mind the generation to which this movie debuted, and how incredible the acting is, the sound discrepancy can be overlooked. The camera style and seamless combination of colors in the set contrasting the climatic scenes during the film should be admired almost as much as the acting. The use of multiple angles throughout the film made it more realistic, and added a perspective that couldn't normally be seen through the musical (because of it's stationary viewpoint on stage). The sets resembled an authentic version of New York in the 1960's. The tall skyscrapers, fire escape behind every apartment and graffiti written buildings helped audiences believe that the film actually took place in New York. Scene's containing both Tony and Maria sometimes showed a blurred background, making it seem like they were the only people and nothing else mattered. Every scene was more breathtaking than the last, making the film one of the greatest musical adaptations even today.Following certain "ridiculous" qualities of the original play however proved the film's faults in storyline. The two main characters that fall in love despite their feuding families, don't really know each other that well but are willing to put everything aside to pursue this relationship. This becomes incredibly absurd when Maria finds out that her lover killed her brother, and instead of being upset immediately sleeps with him. From a realist perspective it seems pretty bizarre to forgive someone that quickly for murdering your sibling just because you love him or her. This plot line parallels Shakespeare's equally ridiculous suicide scene that could have easily been avoided if either respected an outsider's opinion over their own, which is again seen in this film during its climatic scene. Tony upset of Maria's death, runs through the streets trying to be killed because he couldn't live without his true love, essentially causing his demise in the process. This was an incredibly frustrating aspect of the film, but needless to say falls under the romantic genre smoothly.Besides the minor flaws, the overall quality of the film garners respect not only to the filmmakers but also to the incredible cast. Even though the movie came out over fifty years ago, it still maintains relevancy, making it a classic must-see. The expression "they just don't make movies like this anymore," directly correlated with this film. No matter how many times viewed the ending scene with Natalie Wood threatening to take her own life will bring any audience member to tears. It's extremely well made, and easily and overall favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"West Side Story" is one of those movies that everyone has a very definite opinion about. If you look at it just as it is-- a movie about gangs that dance as they fight-- you will just laugh at it and might as well not watch it. But if you can manage to get into the artistic spirit of the thing, it's an extremely enjoyable movie.Basically a modernized version of Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet", "West Side Story" tells the story of two feuding New York gangs, the Puerto Rican Sharks and the white Jets. Tony (the best friend of Riff, the leader of the Jets) and Maria (the sister or Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks) fall desperately in love, causing many problems between the two gangs. The cast (including Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer, George Chakiris, Russ Tamblyn and Rita Moreno) is superb, both dramatically and musically. The music is good, featuring songs like "America" and "I Feel Pretty", and the plot of course is wonderful. "West Side Story" is a great musical picture that you will definitely enjoy if you look at it from an artistic sort of perspective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>West Side Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated directors Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Sound of Music) and Jerome Robbins, I had heard about this highly popular musical from Stephen Sondheim (Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street), and I knew a couple of the songs from hearing them on talent shows, so I was really excited to watch it. Basically, set in 1957 in the streets on the West Side of Manhattan, New York, two rival teenage gangs are fighting over neighbourhood territories, these being the White American gang the Jets, and the Puerto Rican immigrant gang the Sharks. Riff Lorton (Russ Tamblyn) is the leader of the Jets, but one of the founding members of the gang Tony Wycek (Golden Globe nominated Richard Beymer) is no longer active with the others, but he still keeps in touch with them. Bernardo Nunez (Oscar and Golden Globe winning George Chakiris) is the leader of the Sharks, and he has his sister Maria (Natalie Wood) and girlfriend Anita (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Ria Moreno) who try to avoid getting involved in the gang situations. It is at a dance that Tony and Maria meet each other, and it is love at first sight, this would of course cause even stronger hatred between the gangs. Anita supports Maria's decision to go against her brother and continue seeing Tony when they have the opportunities, Maria even tries suggesting that Tony should try and make peace between the Jets and the Sharks. Of course this attempt to end the feud between the two gangs only creates a massive argument between Riff and Bernardo, Riff is killed by Bernardo, and Tony is shocked to have killed Bernardo in the heat of the moment. One of the Sharks angrily tells Maria what has happened to her brother, and she does at first act angry towards Tony, but he explains what happened and he promises her that they will be able to live happily if they move away. While the Jets plan to get revenge for the death of Riff, Anita at first tries to convince Maria that a man that kills another is bad, but she is convinced that they truly love each other, and she tells her that Chino Martin (Jose DeVega) is looking for Tony with a gun. After Maria covers up for Tony about his involvement with Bernando's death to Lieutenant Schrank (Simon Oakland), Anita goes to tell Tony that his true love is detained, but she is harassed and mock raped by the Jets, until Doc (Ned Glass) comes in, and she instead angrily tells them that Maria is dead. After being told this lie that she was shot dead by Chino, Tony runs out and shouts for him, but he is happily shocked to see Maria coming towards him, and then the Jets and the Sharks show up after Tony is fatally wounded by gun shot by Chino. Tony tragically dies in Maria's arms, she angrily shouts and blames the rivalry between the Jets and the Sharks, even threatening to kill some of them and herself, but she can't do it, and in the end Tony's body is taken away, Maria walks behind him, and everyone else walks away as well. Also starring Tucker Smith as Ice, Tony Mordente as Action, William 'Bill' Bramley as Krupke, Eliot Feld as Baby John and Susan Oakes as Anybodys. Beymer gives a good performance as the young man yearning for the sister of the rival gang leader, Wood is beautiful and touching as the young woman stuck in between the battle, Chakiris with his time on screen is good being aggressive and good looking, and Moreno is terrific as the girlfriend of the gang leader who is obviously a dangerous choice. The Romeo and Juliet inspired story is compelling, the colourful settings and costumes are sensational, the choreography for the dancing and dance style fights are terrific, and the songs, many that I recognised, including "Maria" (which I heard sung on Britain's Got Talent), "Tonight" (number 61 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), "America" (number 35 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), "I Feel Pretty" and "Somewhere" (number 20 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, which I heard the music of on Britain's Got Talent) are fantastic, it is a wonderful musical romantic drama. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Saul Chaplin, Johnny Green, Sid Ramin and Irwin Kostal, Best Sound and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical. It was number 41 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"West Side Story" is the tale of two lovers who fall in love. I won't say anymore than that about the story, because if you know Romeo and Juliet, then you already know the story of "West Side Story." That being said, this is an amazing film that deserved every Academy Award that it had gotten: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Art Decoration (Set Decoration, Colour), Best Cinematography (Colour), Best Costume Design (Colour), Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound. It also won a special award for Brilliant Achievements in the Art of Choreography in Film. It was only beat out in one category: Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay), which went to "Judgement at Nuremberg." As normal, I'm not big on talking about the Cinematography, or the Sound, or the Costumes, because, as it always show, they are completely over-shadowed by the acting talents. Simon Oakland was great as Lt. Schrank, who is basically Prince Escalus in Romeo and Juliet. George Chakris deserved his Supporting Actor award for his portrayal of Bernardo, the Tybalt of the story, as did Rita Moreno with her Supporting Actress in the role of Anita, the Lady Capulet/Nurse from Romeo and Juliet. Russ Tamblyn was great as Riff, the Mercutio of the story.But, no one, in my opinion, can come even close to the stardom of Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood as the two "Star-crossed lovers," Maria and Tony. Both of them were robbed of the Best Actors/Best Actress awards, if you ask me. I completely believed them, and in a film, that's saying something. A high thumbs up for them.Now, I can't review a musical without talking about the music and the choreography. Come on; you knew it was coming sooner or later. The music is very catchy, from the widely fun "America," to the love song "Tonight," to the very cool song "Cool." I know; I'm full of cheesy puns. But, honestly, the music and the choreography was very well-done here, and the singing was great as well! Kudos to everyone on that! Overall, it's a great film/musical. If you're not big on "Romeo and Juliet" then you might want to skip this, but otherwise, I'd say go and see it. I loved it. I usually love musicals; in fact, the only one that I plan on not seeing anytime soon is "Mamma Mia!" Don't ask me why; I've just never been interested. But, honestly, this is a wonderful film that should be shown to kids today. A 10/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The true West Side story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although IMDb list 8th and 10 Street locations of scenes shot in West Side Story, they left out the most important locations where Tony and Maria sing on the fire escape, the alleyway, and most of the other street scenes. It was 67th and 68th Street between West End Avenue and Amsterdam Avenue. If you look closely you will see Saint Matthew's Church, the wall of PS 94, on the corner of 68th and Amsterdam, the Joe Salwyn Paper Company, and the buildings called "The Models" on 68th Street. This area was the future home of " Lincoln Center" and all the tenants living in the buildings were given notice to vacate and were forced to relocate to other areas. Ultimately the area was scheduled for "Urban Renewal" and all the tenements were torn down..It may be "Lincoln Center" now but it can never replace the true West Side Story..Progress...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>West Side Story: A Landmark Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>West Side Story is a musical directed by Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins. It stars Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer, Russ Tamblyn, Rita Moreno, George Chakiris and David Winters.The movie is an adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name that was adapted from William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet.West Side Story opens with an overhead shot of Manhattan that introduced to two rival street gangs: the Jets, second-generation American teens, and the Sharks, Puerto Rican immigrants. When the war between the Jets and Sharks reaches a fever pitch, Jets leader Riff decides to challenge the Sharks to one last "winner take all" rumble. He decides to meet Sharks leader Bernardo for a war council at a gymnasium dance; to bolster his argument, Riff wants his old pal Tony, the co-founder of the Jets, to come along. But Tony has set his sights on vistas beyond the neighborhood and has fallen in love with Bernardo's sister, Maria, a love that, as in Romeo and Juliet, will eventually end in tragedy. All the songs written by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim for the original Broadway production of West Side Story were retained for the film version which makes this musical truly a classic.It also retains the original choreography of Jerome Robbins, which is recreated in some of the most startling and balletic dance sequences ever recorded on cinema.Finally,the performances of the cast were just simply terrific that one cannot find a reason not to enjoy this movie.West Side Story is a beautifully-mounted, impressive, emotion-ridden and violent musical which, in its stark approach to a raging social problem and realism reflected during its time of release.The 10 Academy Awards it has won truly attests to how great this movie is.Truly,it was a landmark musical for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very energetic film. I saw this a few times on TV, but was able to enjoy its grandeur at a local theater that plays older films one time only. It was a terrific event, and the audience was good natured and snapped fingers at the beginning in line with the movie!! Of course it is the music and dancing that we mostly remember and Jerome Robbins richly deserved his part of the directorial Oscar. But the rest of the movie, with the story and acting, were equally captivating. I enjoyed Wood and Beymer as the leads, though sometimes I wonder if Beymer's Tony really was the type to lead the Jets.I enjoyed John Astin's small role as the dorky dance arranger. Moreno, Chakiris and Tamblyn were nothing short of spectacular in their performances.Alice Cooper does an homage to this film in his 1972 School's Out album with the song "Gutter Cat vs the Jets." Thought I'd toss that one in!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Juvenile delinquency is purely a social disease".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always try to make a distinction between a film's critical acclaim and my own reaction to it. "West Side Story" is a much heralded film, and one of the Top 100 Movies of all time on the American Film Institute's original list from 1997. I'm not a big fan of musicals, so that probably plays a bit into my reaction to this picture. I just didn't care for the movie all that much, and really began to fidget the last hour or so, hitting the pause button repeatedly to see how much time was left till the end. The concept of rival gangs dancing and singing doesn't conform to a reality I've come to expect, and although this was an originally creative take on the Romeo and Juliet theme, I could just as easily have passed on it. My motivation in watching had all to do with the AFI Top 100 I mentioned earlier, as one of my goals on this board is to review every film on that list. For the most part, I'm in general agreement with the pervasive feeling accompanying most pictures, but occasionally I fall away from the pack, and this is one of those times.The one observation I would make though has more to do with the approach taken in presenting The Sharks. I have to wonder if this film would have been made today given the politically sensitive nature of the industry and many movie going fans. Other films are liberally criticized for being racist and fear mongering, and this one seems more overt than most if that's what you're looking for. It's no secret that the Jets hate the Sharks because they're Puerto Rican, and the song 'In America' expresses that sentiment. The interesting thing about it though, it's the Latino women who defend America as a land of opportunity, while their macho boyfriends see only futility and hatred at every turn. So for me, that was a clever little departure from the main story that had me thinking about how important attitude is in making a difference.The other thing that got my attention was the way Doc broke up the Jets' man-handling of Anita near the end of the story. With purposeful insight, this old shop keeper rightly questions the futility of the rumbling gangs - "Why do you kids live like there's a war on"? With that, the picture offers some value for present generations in countries around the world who hold onto their own ideologies, instinctively choosing war over peace, and missing the chance to focus on the things that are really important, making the most of life for themselves and their communities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leonard Bernstein's incredible score is, along with the great Jerome Robbins choreography it inspired, the best and most important part of this movie, which was based on the great Broadway musical by the same title. I repeat, and emphasize the word MUSICAL!! Leonard Bernstein was and is an American treasure, the likes of whom we will probably never see again. He was a great composer, equally comfortable writing classical, semi-classical, and popular music. He was a gifted lyricist, erudite lecturer, and innovative cultural ambassador, particularly through his ground-breaking Young People's Concerts, which were televised at Philharnonic (now Avery Fisher) Hall. Oh, I forgot to mention that he was a great pianist, as well as one of the greatest conductors of all time. So please put his name where it belongs - at the top of the list of credits for West Side Story!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whatever happened to Riff/Russ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was drawn to the movie first by its music, but it's great on so many levels, not least the social commentary.But I want to know why Russ Tamblyn, who played Riff, didn't get more recognition for his role? He should have been nominated for an Oscar. And I was very sad to read his career stopped here. In pictures from his later years, he looks like an awesome guy. I wish I could have seen him in more movies. I feel robbed! The 'delinquent' song is excellent and so funny. I thought Avenue Q was modern and cutting edge. West Side Story did it years ago. This song goes into all the causes of juvenile delinquency in a humorous way that seems so far ahead of its time.And the dancing in the social dance scene is amazing. How 'out there'. Again, much more cutting edge than expected.The problem I have with the film is that it all occurs in two nights (perhaps I should blame Shakespeare?) and that Maria could go for a guy she had just met that killed her brother (perhaps it would have made more sense to make Bernardo her over-protective cousin). I found that so hard to swallow it kind of spoiled the whole thing. Although I thought Natalie Wood did well in the last scene. And, of course, Oscar-winner Rita Moreno was amazing.I have two thumbs, so I give it two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tragic Love Affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>West Side Story is a musical about two groups of murderous street gangs (one white, one Puerto Rican) in New York City. However, in the musical-murder tale, we have the typical Romeo and Juliet spin off. Maria (Natalie Wood) and Tony (Richard Beymer) are the star-crossed lovers in this tale -- she the sister of a Puerto Rican Shark, he a grudging member of the Jets. They don't come from wealthy, feuding families, but from racial groups deeply resentful of one another. The high point of the musical is the big love scene which plays out on a fire escape, outside Maria's room. For a first watch, this movie plays out exactly like Romeo and Juliet; two different parties having conflict with each other and then there are two individuals that fall in love with each other. However, these two love birds come from the conflicting parties. Highlights of the movie were the dances and songs. The acting between the main characters seemed to be realistic. It's a classic love story that will be remade in every which way. I didn't think that the costume choices were that great, the colors were too bold and bright for a movie that took place in New York City. Along with the actual clothing, the girls had dramatic frilly dresses and it seemed like all the girls did was sew dresses they would be wearing later that evening. The length of the movie was a bit lengthy as well. It turned out to be one of those movies you find yourself moving around in your chair to find some comfort. First time seeing this musical, I made perfect distinction as of who was on each side. They made the American gang dress in blue jeans and light colors with a jacket over it. The Puerto Rican side wore more on the darker colors, usually black or dark purple slacks and a dark solid color t-shirt to match with it. The accents from both sides fit well. The conflict between the two teams was perfect, the build up and dramatics weren't too much. I also liked the fact that they over exaggerated the characters, individually, making them seem like they were top dog in their environment.I'm not a musical fanatic, but West Side Story turned out to be a great watch and I think the fact it has parts from Romeo and Juliet will make it easier for audience members to watch and it'll keep them wondering, "Oh, what's next?" or " Let's see if things relate like they did in Romeo and Juliet." And besides the fact of its lengths, I think many will enjoy it, maybe not so much children. Overall, I would rate this movie an 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love Until Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. Love until Death 2. I really enjoyed this film even though it was a musical. I also enjoy films that are set back in older days where the color isn't very bright and almost feels like a black and white film. I think the director did a great job of making this musical into a film. I think some parts still looked as if it was on stage which is understandable. It's interesting how in the middle of a conversation people can just start singing a song. 3. This film starts out with the Jets and Sharks running around town while getting in small fights with each other. The film leads into the night when the dance is to take place. The Jets and Sharks decide to have a war counsel after the dance at Doc's Candy Shop. Tony comes to see Maria after the dance and sing goodnight to her. The two gangs set a day and time for the rumble that will take place. Within the next couple days, the rumble takes place under the highway. Things don't go as planned and the rumble ends in despair. Tony is running from Chino because he is out to kill him. What happens in the end is for you to find out. 4. I really liked all the music used in this film. There was a lot of hype and suspense at different types when the music would change. I think the characters voices were projected very well in the different scenes. I think the different settings were perfect for the parts that they were played in. The effects also kept you on edge because at times you didn't know what was going to happen next. The scenes in the film matched very well with what was happening at the time. 5. At times I thought there was a little too much singing. I know this was a film based on a musical, but when you make it into a movie the singing should not be so overbearing. I feel the settings did switch a little too fast at times. There was also a quite a bit of dancing for it to be a movie and not a musical. Some of the effects at times were a little confusing and didn't really stand out as much as they should have. 6. I really enjoyed the characters in this film. The actors really portrayed these characters to the fullest extent. Bernardo, Tony, and Maria were my favorite characters. I think they played their parts the best out of the whole film. They really used great expression in their singing and acting. All the actors for the Jets and Sharks did a great job of portraying gangs. Certain audience members would probably be able to relate to certain characters. The characters would most likely be Tony and Maria because of the love they share for one another. 7. In the end, I really enjoyed this film after seeing it for the fourth time. I would watch it once more and like it just as much. Even if you don't enjoy musicals, I would still recommend seeing this film. You might want to see it, especially to find out what happens in the end. I would give this film a rating of 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still pretty good as far as Broadway movie-musicals are concerned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, the direct connotation between this Broadway movie-musical and the most-beloved Shakespearean tragedy, Romeo and Juliet, is very, very clear.Romeo and Juliet had the two rival families...the Montagues and the Capulets. In West Side Story, there are two feuding families but in the form of modern street gangs....the Jets and the Sharks.The Jets, of course, was made up of Caucasian people, and the Sharks were akin to today's Latin Kings street gang...made mainly of Puerto Ricans.Of course, the famous scuffles and skirmishes between the rival gangs cumulated in the famous "Rumble" scene. Especially when character Ice of the Sharks gang and character Riff of the Jets gang engaged each other in a knife fight; in Romeo and Juliet, the weapons used in the fight scenes were mainly rapiers.I especially liked the two leading ladies in the film...Rita Moreno (who played Anita) and Natalie Wood (who played Maria). But Rita probably takes the cake more than Natalie. Rita sounded stronger and confident even in the taunting scene where Anita was gang-raped by a number of Jets members at the bar.The musical numbers are definitely classic Broadway, and a pretty great smorgasbord of music by the great Leonard Bernstein. It is classic Broadway even when Berstein's music sounds nearly atonal and harsh, like in the opening number featuring the gangs dancing across the sidewalks and the playground. There is the jazzy, swing-packed energy of "Cool", and the gentle, prayerful waltz of "One Hand, One Heart". "Something's Coming" has a mix of rapid jazz waltz and the rapid two-four meter that can pay homage to almost any up-tempo song in the Broadway musical repertoire.The credit roll sequence is rather boring. But not completely. The use of the walls laden with graffiti along with the postlude music covering some of the famous numbers of the musical during the credits was helpful.The opening sequence was perhaps a very creative one. There is the famous silhouette of the Manhattan skyline, which changes colors during parts of the musical overture. After about 5 minutes, the silhouette changes to the real Manhattan skyline, and then through panning and panorama, the viewer is taken from Manhattan to the West Side of New York where the story begins. The opening feels a little too simple because on the focus of stillness at the beginning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really am at a loss of how I could put this beautiful cinematic masterpiece into a few paragraphs. I was brought up on this movie, and have treasured it as my favourite musical to ever be conceived.Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim's lyrics and music are beautiful and MARIA and SOMEWHERE are my stand out numbers in this movie. The dancing by Jerome Robbins is unparalleled, and so modern for its time and this is epitomized in DANCE AT THE GYM and COOL.I am still to see this on the stage yet I doubt it could retain the same colour and vibrance which this film does. All the casting was terrific. Natalie Wood, I believe, gives one of her best performances (second to Splendour in the Grass) and really shows Maria's transformation throughout the story. Another casting choice which I think no one else could play was Richard Beymer. He has the looks, the charisma and the acting chops. It has been criticized that he was lacked the edge of an ex-gang leader yet you have to think of who the character of Tony is. He is like Romeo, he realised that his life in the gang wasn't what he wanted, he wanted to grow up. He is a boy falling in love for the first time and I think this really comes through.Rita Moreno, George Chakiris and Russ Tamblyn also give knock out performances, so do all the Jets and Sharks. However, it is the love which is at the heart of the story which makes people come back for more and more. Every time you watch this movie you still hope that someday Maria and Anton will run away to place of "peace, quiet and open air" and every time your heartache's as he dies in her arms.This movie was all deserving of its Academy Awards</fullReview>

People don't like too much the musicals. It is a common opinion that they are not realistic. But when the eyes of Maria asked for the guilty between both gangs I think it was not possible to maintain this opinion. Despite the fact it was a Broadway musical the translation to a filmic language was wonderful. The wonderful choreography of Robert Wise was the starting point of a new style and brings to the film this magic movements that were reproduced in a fantastic way by the panavision lens. Also the incredible music of Leonard Bernstein was increased by the stereo soundtrack and is today after more than 40 years one of the best CD soundtrack albums.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just re-watched for perhaps the 4th time this incredibly satisfying work. I felt a little embarrassed not having drawn the parallel with Romeo And Julliette until I read it here! West Side Story has always been for me the reminder of this great mystery of our wild humanity and it's often with sadness that I think of it. It seems as if we will never be able to get out of this rut of misery and violence . In similar work,I'm always divided between what I often see as the glorification of our weakness and an attempt to remedy to it. They, the artists, are they concerned with this side of things or simply about their art and their fame? The answer, I guess, is also a mystery and probably different to one and each. I often kept in mind WST when someone mentions how increasingly violent our society has become - and I wonder. I think any large city in the world had, and perhaps still have their own WST - and it started long before this production was thought of. Pehaps this is why I did not relate to Romeo and Juliette, I was too much taken by the dilemma people create when they try to merge various group with very contrasting background together. Yes to me, although entertaining, the love story was not the this work strong point. The portrayal of hatred through the amazing dance, songs choreography. Yes so much talent and energy. I also approved of the ending, it does not lies or butter up the story for a good feeling. It leaves you hopelessly in front of a too obvious reality. As it has often be commented on, and I'll put it in an other way, some aspects of it will alas be forever contemporary.</fullReview>

I laugh every time at John Astin and Officer Krupke! The film itself is an older genre that remains popular. It tries to use blends, stills and cut-outs that enhance the audiences understanding of the themes. it remains a classic in cinema musicals. an outstanding use of music, scoring and dialog.

		<fullReview>"West Side Story" is the movie adaptation of Leonard Bernstein's classic musical, a twist on Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet." It is loaded with memorable tunes and pleasant dance numbers. (These have to be the most graceful street gangs in New York!) Granted, it may be a bit hard to believe teenage hoodlums would break into song at any time. But the movie gives a lot of eye candy, at least before things turn serious towards the end of the story. Some camera tricks are employed to convey emotion, and interpret some stage-to-screen passages. Also, some excellent performances are turned in by Natalie Wood, as Maria, and Rita Moreno as Anita. "West Side Story" is enjoyable, and will survive as its stage version has before.</fullReview>

This is perhaps one of the best movies that I have ever seen, and most certainly deserves the title `best musical ever'. The music and the songs are excellent, as is the choreography and the acting. Every move the actors/actresses make are made to the best possible effect.There is also one more comment that I wish to make and that is that as I was watching the film I kept getting the overwhelming feeling that the film is very, very anti-American and anti-American way of life, which seems strange for the medium that it is brought across in. this comes across mostly in two scenes, one when the police lieutenant is racially harassing the Puerto Ricans (`PRs') but especially in the song, aptly named `America'. I found it to be very subtle and very funny.I would recommend this film to anyone, for its entertainment and educational uses if for nothing else!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt,it is a very good film. But I would like to point out a weakness that has caught my eye. The film is usually called the landmark musical of the last century and so on. It had around 10 to 12 songs. I have seen the movie only once some 4 years back. As far as I can remember,there were 2 songs that were used in very weak moments of the script.Especially, /*** warning spoilers ahead***/after the murder of Bernardo when Anita were trying hard to make Maria understand that Tony actually did not love her and would eventually leave her(Maria); the director here chose to put this conversation through a duet song sung by Maria and Anita.If anybody has some cinematic sense and has watched the movie, he will realize that in this situation, a dialogue would have done much better than a song. I,personally,like musicals very much. I heard (before viewing 'West side story') that this movie earned ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.It clearly indicates that this is a film of extraordinary merit. But then, I was very much pained to see the use of some songs in some situations, which demanded them the least.Well,I liked the particular song where the girls and boys of the 'shark' team (i.e., the Puerto-Rican immigrants) are debating about the lifestyle of America pitted against that of their homeland. It was a thoroughly enjoyable song.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another 60s sensation !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films which you really have to see up on the big screen in order to fully appreciate it. Musicals tend to die a thousand deaths in the Living room. The visual excitement of all that sweeping and majestic camera work which was a hallmark of the genre is regularly defused by the constraints of the small screen.I've just enjoyed a screening of "West Side Story" at a revival theater here in Australia. Unfortunately, the first 30 minutes of the presentation was somewhat marred by focus problems and a slightly wonky soundtrack. The print itself was far from pristine but, still, what the hell ...... old movies have scratches ... in fact a few clicks 'n bumps probably add to the nostalgia. Anyway, that's all by the way.It was the first time I've ever seen this picture on "The Silver" and there's no denying it's status as being a true classic of the American cinema.There APPEARS to be something a bit peculiar going on however. From where I was sitting there seemed to be two very different acting techniques being employed in this film. Some members of the cast are playing their roles like film actors( e.g. Simon Oakland) while others are acting like they're on the Broadway stage ... all very 'theatrical' with broad gestures and overly enunciated delivery of their lines. Maybe I'm wrong. I'd like to watch it again. The above comments are not a criticism, merely an observation. Clearly, this is an exceptional movie by any standards. The energy, the direction, the camera work and, of course, all of that superb music which has an almost operatic quality to it. The vitality that pulsates throughout this film is extraordinary. Fine performances across the board but, yes indeed, George Chakiris really DID steal the show. No much wonder he found a little something extra waiting for him in 'the envelope' on that special night of nights in L.A . He really was quite stunning.All in all a grand piece of movie making. Another 60s sensation !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the matter with you people? Can't you see this absolutley MAGNIFICENT story blooming right in front of you? MAD! POSITIVELY MAD!!!!!!!!(there is one tiny spoiler)!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reading the IMDb reviews on one of my personal favorites, West Side Story, for quite a while. Every once and awhile I come across a comment filled to the brim with spoilers. About Richard Beymer's possible miscast, or the unreality of love at first sight. GIVE THEM A BREAK!!!!!!!!!!!WWS is an incredible film, one of the best I've ever seen. I am a big fan of movies from the black and white era, with Fred Astaire and Debbie Reynolds and Gene Kelly, who were creating marvelous musicals around this time, (Singin in the Rain, The sound of Music, etc.) But this story sweeps them all behind, by far!!!!! West Side story is the basic tale of Romeo and Juliet in 1950's form. It's got everything, gangs dancing, tough people singing, it's totally fun.My favorite songs are the gems of the movie, even though I really love all of them! If there was a gun pointed at my head, I would have to say "Tonight". It's one of those songs that leave you breathless and you wind up singing it in the shower afterwards, I know I do. I also really like the energetic "America", which really shows the discrimmination between Anglos and Puerto Ricans.For the actors, that Natalie Wood is great! Why they had to dub over her, I have no clue. I don't understand why they had to get some operatic singer, although she had a beautiful voice, but why they couldn't just use Wood's voice. Oh well. Can't do anything about it now, what with Wood's tragic drowning in 1981. I also think that people come down a little too hard on poor, seriously-needs-a-dentist Richard Beymer. After all, he did his best, but when you look at the movie, there was no real passion between himself and Natalie.The supporting cast, of Rita Moreno and George Chakiris (did i spell his name right). It's no wonder they both recieved Oscars as Best Supporting Actor/Actress. They both seem comfortable with showing that They can act!!!!!!All in all, this is probably the best film (not musical, but FILM) I have ever seen, and I love musicals. I really do think that it's the best of all. My favorite part of this movie, I think, is at the very end, when Tony is killed. Some people think it was a bit exaggerated, but when Maria is crying and Lieutenant Shcrank picks up Chino's gun and walks over to Tony, Maria screams, "Don't you touch him!" and throws her arms around him, looks up, and you can see real tears in her eyes. The music that accompanys this ending, with Maria staring, teary-eyed, at both groups and at Shcrank. This ending leaves me bawling every time I watch it.Another great part is near the end when Anita and Maria conclude the A boy like that/I have a love song, with the part,When love comes so strong There is no right or wrong, Your love is your life!!!!Shoot, that's a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have made a comment on this film before. I think that this is probably one of the top musicals ever made. West Side Story has a terrific engergy that makes you wanna sing with them.The only bad things are on the reviews. Some people are getting on Richard Beymer (Tony) too much, saying he drew the film back a notch just because he was "wooden" to the audience! He was a fine actor, even if he was a little toothy! :) I think Beymer showed his love and did things his way, even if his way didn't win him an Oscar, I really think he and Natalie Wood deserved one.So give him a break! Oh, and my favorite songs: America, Tonight, (duet + quintet) and all the scenes are electrifying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny, I must be getting old and sentimental. Semi-mental, maybe... I've just caught West Side Story on TV and watched it for the first time since I was a kid and I L-O-V-E-D IT!In a time where even kids' TV shows rely on CGI and anything even remotely resembling a theatrical performance is anathema to the major studios, seeing this film is like looking through a forgotten window into a more genuinely creative universe. Of course some of the lines and the dancing seem a little dated today but it's a fabulous period piece - that's half the pleasure. What a shame more films today can't take what might now be a bold step and simply take a stage performance and let the cameras roll.It's fantastic for a change to encounter something that feels like it will stick in my imagination for a while. Hmmm... hope this doesn't mean I'm going to have to start admitting to enjoying musicals!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>West Side Story on DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the interest of full disclosure I have to admit that I am not a fan of musicals. In fact, the term `all singing, all dancing' is usually enough to send me running and screaming. Despite winning ten Academy Awards on its release in 1961, MGM's West Side Story has never been a favorite of mine, and I haven't seen it for years. So it was with mild disinterest that I viewed the new slickly packaged 40th anniversary DVD reissue of this retelling of the Romeo and Juliet story. As it turns out I was in for a pleasant surprise. While I still find the larger-than-life Puerto Rican accents grating and have to suppress giggles at the vision of tough gang members dancing in tandem, this new version boasts a wonderfully remixed and re-mastered audio track, a digitally polished Panavision picture and interesting extras, adding up to a beautifully done reissue. The two disc set offers a wide screen presentation of the film, with English, French and Spanish subtitles and spoken language options; a new, comprehensive 56-minute documentary that includes every major West Side Story figure, and a host of shorter features, including alternate trailers, original film intermission music and three photo galleries. As an added bonus MGM has included a thick print scrapbook featuring the entire script, an original lobby brochure and behind the scenes photos. Nice package all in all, and while West Side Story will never make my Top Ten Favorite Movies Of All Time list, this reissue has made me reconsider the work, especially the lyrical beauty of Ernest Lehman's script and the nice supporting performances of George Chakiris and Rita Moreno. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The other "gangs of New York" movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>West Side Story came out when I was a mere sophomore in high school, I had never seen it until last night on TCM, uninterrupted by commercials, in widescreen and stereo. Almost as nice as watching the DVD. As just about everyone knows, it is the Romeo and Juliet story set in 1960s New York, but in general it is the same story told many times in many different ways. Here it was Puerto Ricans fighting for their right to have a life in this new country. But the basic story, about a boy and girl from different "sides of the track", is always good for a drama. West Side story deserves all the praise it gets. Although it is a musical, which seems incongruent for two gangs in New York, the singing and dancing is normally complementary to the story. One thing I found disconcerting was the singer who dubbed songs over Natalie Wood's singing. She was too operatic, and didn't fit with the stage singing of the other characters. Rita Moreno, on the other hand, had a perfect singing style for this kind of musical. Natalie Wood was such a good and attractive actress, it is a shame that we didn't get to see her as an adult actress, because of her drowning in 1981.some SPOILERS are below in my personal summary, don't read any further, please.Tony, pretty boy, a Jet, met and fell in love with Maria, sister of Sharks leader, Sharks and Jets rumble under highway, Tony tries to stop it, a Jet gets stabbed, Tony stabs and kills Maria's brother, runs away and hides, cop questioning Maria, Maria's friend tries to get Tony a message, she is hassled, almost raped, by Jets, angry and tearful she announces, "there's no more Marie, she is dead", Tony distraught goes out into the streets, yelling "Maria", Sharks shoot him and he dies as Maria shows up. Mesage - "why can't we just all get along." Where was Rodney King when we needed him??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dynamic, groundbreaking film musical that far surpasses the stage version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the concept and certainly the dialogue and plot of the story are hopelessly dated and contrived, there's no denying that the groundbreaking dynamic of this film stands the test of time and is a tribute to the craftsmen involved in creating it. As a musical, WEST SIDE STORY is a milestone for it's tonal originality and body mechanics, and these are the features that hold up well over forty years after it's creation. The new special edition DVD provides a sterling presentation of the film, along with some enlightening background information on the production, and will certainly prove valuable to the film's many fans. The new Dolby Digital soundtrack does a fine job of preserving the original Panavision-70, 6-track sound, and notably amplifies the brilliant score and libretto by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has long been, not just one of my favorite musicals, but one of my favorite movies. From beginning (with the establishing shots of NY) to end (with the wonderfully done end credits) this is a breathtaking film.The Bernstein score is beautiful and the Sondheim lyrics are wonderful. The "America" number is especially good - the choreography is great and the lyrics are as powerful today, as ever (Rita Moreno is a gem!). Sure, it's a bit dated, but the sentiments are still very true. All in all, I think that it's a great update of "Romeo and Juliet".My only real problem with the movie had always been the casting of Tony. He never seemed like a real ex-gang member to me. Heck, I always felt that Anybodys could have taken him in a fight. About a year ago, I had the great pleasure of seeing WWS on the big screen, at the gorgeous Paramount Theatre in Oakland, CA. WOW! What a difference it makes seeing a wide-screen movie like this on a big screen - I couldn't believe how much more powerful the movie was. A TV screen just can't do it credit. What really blew me away though, was Tony. For the first time, I completely believed in his character - and it made me enjoy the movie even that much more.I can't recommend this film enough, but if you have the opportunity to see it on a big screen - DO NOT LET IT PASS YOU BY! You will be amazed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>something timeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this film is one that can only be described as timeless, when you watch it you realise that a film of this calibre only occurs once in awhile and when it does it is perfectly timed. West Side Story is the beginning of many musical that are based in the period they are performed for example Grease which i am sure would not have been as big without the help of West Side Story making a musical light up the cinema screen. Tony and Maria are cast perfectly as the modern day Romeo and Juliet which has you sat watching the character and saying which character is based on which character from Romeo and Juliet, the songs fit the period and mood perfectly and it leads towards helping a person from outside the period and place it was set to understand what was happening between the anglo and p.ricans, if Robbins had have stuck with the original basis between the Catholic and the Jewish [orignally titled East Side Story] it would not have been such a big hit. All i can say is that if you haven't already seen this film sit down and watch just once and even if you aren't into musical or don't enjoy films you will find it hard to hate this film, prehaps a few criticisms but there is no way anyone can push the boat out and hate this film like some of the release now-a-days. It is a film that will stay a classic forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Romeo and Juliet" on the Mean Streets of Gang-Infested New York City.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Romeo and Juliet" gets a wild spin in "West Side Story", the dominant Best Picture Oscar winner from 1961. Two gangs, one white (The Jets) and the other Puerto Rican (The Sharks) are on a bloody collision course on the streets of New York City. But throughout the chaos and ominous tones a love-story blossoms between the white Richard Beymer and Puerto Rican Natalie Wood. Their love transcends race and the gangs, but in the end will it be enough to save them both so they can have a life together? Great Oscar-winning turns by George Chakiris (as the leader of the Sharks and Wood's older brother) and Rita Moreno solidify the film's almost then-unknown cast. Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins each took credit for the film's direction and became the only pair to win Oscars for achievement in that category. Wise, a true Hollywood director, handled everything except the choreography. This turned out to be the only film that Robbins worked on. A truly moving and emotional experience. One of the best musicals ever produced. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The big question in this one, and a couple of smaller ones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything that can be written about this movie has probably been written, but, where did they get Richard Beymer? He's a triple threat: he can't sing, he can't dance, he can't act. I've seen dinner theater productions with a better Tony.The musical is, of course, compromised by its atrocious book. Nevertheless, in terms of its musical and dance numbers, it is the most difficult and exciting musical ever written. Oh to have seen it on Broadway in the original production. Bernstein's late recording of the score (he never conducted it on Broadway) is wonderful for the late Tatiana Troyanos as Anita and because for the first time you get to hear the details in the reprise of "Tonight," but strange in that Jose Carreras singing Tony is the only one who can't lose his Spanish accent!I heard an interview with Rita Moreno recently, and she had to have "A Boy Like That" dubbed (she is still passionately unhappy about how it came out) because her voice wouldn't go low enough in those days. Marnie Nixon deserves a life accomplishment Oscar for her wonderful dubbing (not Anita--Maria) in this and many other movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>West Side Story is a brilliant classic romantic musical. One of the best of the 60's. Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer play the lead roles here and they both do a brilliant job especially the great Beymer. The music in the movie is lovely too. I was shocked to hear that Natalie Wood isn't really singing here though, just lip-synching to someone else's voice, still the woman who really is singing here has a great voice. Anyway, if you haven't seen West Side Story then I definitely recommend that you do. It's one of my all time favourite movies and I give it a 10/10. See this movie now!</fullReview>

His character is best friends with Riff, played by Russ Tamblyn, The leader of Tough gang called the Jets, who's enemy is Maria's older brother Bernardo, who is played by George Charkiris. He won a supporting role for this film, as well as his lover in this film, Rita Moreno. All together, this film won Ten Academy Awards including Best Picture.The screenplay was written by Ernest Lehman. In my opinion, i love all performances by the Cast, and i love the way the movie was directed. Choreography was mind-blowing, and this is definitely a MUST see!

		<fullReview>I couldn't, in all conscience, give this film a perfect 10, although it certainly is one of my all-time favorites, and I have seen it, in whole or in part, at least a dozen times.The one flaw I see here is the casting of Richard Beymer; he just does not fit my idea of the hero. Yes, he's supposed to be an ordinary guy, but for me his acting does not come up to expectations. This may be an unfair prejudice on my part, but he just doesn't fit into the film.And what a film it is. I think I know all the songs by heart, at least to sing them along. The story is powerful from many aspects: the slums, the gangs, the pop psychology in the famous "Officer Krupky" song. The music is dynamic and the dances, especially "America" totally memorable. For some tastes today, everything might be a little too pat and the music definitely old-fashioned, but for its time, it was truly a great achievement and worthy of every Oscar it received.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In West Side Story, they show you things like, fights and sex, without SHOWING you. It's done through dance or suggestion. This is a WONDERFUL movie. The dancing is wonderful, the songs are great and it's easy to like almost ALL of the characters. W.S.S. shows you that it's not as easy as "black" and "white" there is more to the story. However, sometimes the directing leaves a bit to be desired. Don't get me wrong, it's really a fabulous movie, but there are some "cheesy" movements and eye communications that make you roll your eyes if you've ever studied directing.The dialogue is very time appropriate. The dancing is sometimes symbolic. But the whole movie is a joy to watch, even when it's jerking your tears out.I'd recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest musicals ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This modern day adaptation of Romeo and Juliet is both a great musical and a great movie. It's one of those films that I can't remember when I saw it for the first time, although I know I was pretty young at the time, and I have loved it ever since. The music and songs are both popular and excellent, and with good reason, as they are the work of the extremely talented and renowned Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing- Truly Amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to take this opportunity to address any of you who may have been led astray by Dr. Mike's opinionated comment. In the first place, the music and dancing were, not only great, not only excellent, but perfectly miraculous. Can anyone out there, after having seen this movie, name at least one movie that matches it in music, storyline, dancing, leads, and virtually everything else? While Natalie Wood may not be Puerto Rican (and whose fault is that, hers?) she is a fantastic actress, and does this role remarkably!! Richard Beymer is also WONDERFUL, and very believable!! He is truly amazing, and I have no idea why on earth he didn't get the recognition he deserves! The love story is beautiful!! It's amazing and wonderful!! Makes you sit up straight without even blinking! It makes you hope desperately, and eventually cry. The leads are not wooden, I for one definitely believed that they were real people. And also, these are people who didn't even HAVE a high school education probably!! The violence is not overwrought, it's very real! I mean, the characters wouldn't be refined gentlemen, now would they? Would we really like Riff if he was a refined gentleman? The Jets, cretins? I don't know what that means, but they definitely are not!!! And, finally, Robert Wise's direction is definitely NOT sloppy? Look at 'The Sound of Music'? Can anyone call that a sloppy movie? So, you must believe someone who doesn't think she knows everything about everything! Trust me on this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"West Side Story" is one film that will touch you and stay with you. When I was in 7th grade, I saw WSS in my choir class. I cried at the end. I loved the forbidden love and romance of Tony and Maria, and the music is timeless and absolutely wonderful! The supporting cast is great, and the music, dancing, and story are all terrific. Great for the romantic, musical fan and drama fan. Even some fights for the guys! A movie with everything to offer. How can you not love that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the BEST musical ever made, but good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a lot of expectations for West Side Story since many called it the best musical of all time. Although I enjoyed it, I have to disagree. I don't think it was the best musical ever, I still think that JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA are far superior. But West Side Story did have some entertaining dancing and choreography, and some great music and singing as well.WEST SIDE STORY is a modern (although now it's a little older) version of Romeo &amp; Juliet, taking place in New York City. Two rival gangs, the Jets (the Americans) and the Sharks (the Hispanics) constantly battle for turf. Tony (Richard Beymer), former leader of the Jets, falls in love with Maria (Natalie Wood), the sister of Sharks' leader Bernardo (George Chakiris). They try to keep their love alive while the two gangs try to tear it apart, all the time singing songs and dancing.The acting is not too great, but the singing and dancing is very good, and that's more important in a movie like this one. Aside from Tony, Maria, Bernardo and a select few more, most of the characters are very two-dimensional and boring. But all of them are only there to support the love story between Tony and Maria.At times, I found this movie downright boring, and especially in the beginning-middle, I was not always paying attention. The ending is fairly good, and the beginning is a great start, but at times I was very unsatisfied with this movie. Still, it's great for the musical lover, and fair for the moviegoer. (But I still say go rent the movie version of JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still one of the greatest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just recently saw "West Side Story" again after several years. It only confirmed what I thought about it all along: It's one of the all-time great screen musicals, as well as one of the most innovative. Shot partly on location in New York City, you get that gritty "where-it-happened" feel from those opening tracking shots over the city, through that chilling close-up of Russ Tamblyn, successfully breaking away from nice boy roles as Riff, and on till that heartbreaking end when the gangs find understanding only in tragedy.Co-director Robert Wise, who up to then had been associated with good small-scale films, such as "Curse of the Cat People," "Odds Against Tomorrow," and "I Want to Live," proved his worth as a director of "big" pictures with this film. He would go on to do "The Sound of Music" and "Star!" later in the decade, but this is where he established himself as a director of musicals. Co-director Jerome Robbins, while he'd done some brilliant work on Broadway and staged the musical sequences for the film of "The King and I," had never handled an entire film before, and his too-painstaking-for-the-studio's-liking approach caused him to be fired fairly early on. His presence and influence, however, are felt throughout the film. Rarely had screen audiences seen dance sequences so energetic as in the "Dance at the Gym" and "America." However, it was all a bittersweet experience for Robbins, who returned to Broadway and, apart from staging the dances for the film of "Fiddler on the Roof" in 1971, essentially washed his hands of Hollywood.That the music is some of Leonard Bernstein's best goes without saying. A true genius, this distinguished composer/conductor/educator never composed better music than he did for "West Side Story." In truth, he spent the rest of his life trying to outdo his greatest achievement as a composer, and the results were mediocre at best, disasterous at worst. His young lyricist, Stephen Sondheim, proved to be more than up to the task, as well. One can already see those qualities which would make him one of Broadway's most illustrious names in the years ahead.Finally, we have the performances. I tend to agree with those people who feel that Richard Beymer's Tony comes off as being a little too whitebread for the part, but the other performances make up for it. Natalie Wood, even with Marni Nixon's singing voice coming out of her mouth, makes a convincing Maria, the childlike innocent becoming a woman steeled in grief in the space of twenty-four hours. The two Oscar-winners in the cast, George Chakiris and Rita Moreno, bring an intensity and strength to Bernardo and Anita. Simon Oakland's Lieutenant Schrank solidified his tough guy image. And, among the gang members, Elliot Feld, later a celebrated director-choreographer himself, and the late Jose de Vega, turn in especially good work as Baby John and Chino, respectively.In short, this is a film which just gets better over the years. Whether you're seeing it for the first of hundredth time, it's still terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has special meaning to me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in Sydney in 1965 and I purchased the sound track to play at my family home. My mother hated it because she was into Janette MacDonald &amp; Nelson Eddie type. As luck would have it the movie was playing at our local theatre when I was home on pre embarkation leave prior leaving for a tour of Vietnam. My mother felt compelled to go with me and no need to tell you she loved the movie and the sound track. I have been to see the movie 16 times, the stage production twice, on video several times and also twice on TV. Obviously this is my favourite musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen many musicals and many excellent movies in my few 14 years - But I must say that WSS surpasses them all. There is no way to describe the way that you feel when you see Maria's "only love sprung from (her) only hate" (Romeo and Juliet) and the pure hatred that surrounds her. The music, the dancing, the motions, the moods - all are portrayed in such a spectacular way in the movie... It makes me cry every time I see it, even though it has been my supreme obsession for over 3 years now... This spectacular movie has a special place in my heart, and will forever. The heartbreaking richness swallows me whole, and I am sure that after seeing even as many times as i have already, that it will never let me go, and keep me warm and happy.... This movie is not to be missed! I highly recommend it to everyone who appeciates beautiful things, and truly - "When you're a Jet, you stay a Jet!!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, but why the overdubs?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw "West Side Story", I was amazed at how good the dance numbers, the choreography, and the singing was in this film. I also thought it was a brilliant transformation of William Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" onto a musical set in New York, where the Montagues were the Jets, and the Capulets were the sharks. I also thought Natalie Wood was very good, as a very convincing Puerto Rican. Little did I know that there was something behind it all. Something secretive that fooled me at first, and nearly ruined the rest of the movie for me. I was stunned at Natalie Wood's "singing" voice. I asked my mom about her, saying "I didn't know she was a singer". My mom replied, "She wasn't.". I am still wondering to this day why in the hell they decided to dub in other singer's voices over the actors, and worse yet, not give them any credit! I was very involved in the movie, but when I heard that, my concentration on the film suddenly went all over the place. It's strange, and I don't like it one bit! How and why did they think that they could get away with it. Now that I've looked up the trivia at IMDB, I've also learned that Natalie Wood is not the only actor who's singing voice was dubbed. Why couldn't they have picked some real singers as the players in the film. My overall opinion: I was impressed with the film, but was upset with the overdubs. It could have been so much better. But, I still managed to pay attention to the story and the characters. There's only one number I can't stand, and it's the one where the grief stricken Jets try to play it cool. I thought that the lead singer of that number was overacting, and it didn't serve the storytelling. The relationship between Maria and Tony(or say, the overdubbed relationship) was very good, and very tragic. I couldn't speak after Tony was shot, and all the characters suddenly went silent. The best parts of the movie, I think, lie in the conflict between the Jets and the Sharks. The way they fight each other, with a kind of musical manner. Today's generation wouldn't get it though. The opening scene where the Jets and the Sharks taunt each other with a kind of ballet, which eventually leads to violence, is really my favorite scene in the film. They're fighting, but the choreography and the music make it flow through and work with perfection. Still, I wish they didn't do the overdubs, or at least didn't let the information about them get out. It nearly soiled my overall enjoyment and understanding of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Raw and Fun Shakespeare Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as Shakespeare adaptations go, West Side Story is considered by many to be among the strongest, singularly unique, eye-poppingly flamboyant; in short, best adaptations committed to film. That is a list that includes Laurence Olivier's Hamlet (1948) and the "Taming of the Shrew's" variation, 10 Things I Hate About You (1999). Retooling arguably one of the most overrated plays in the English language, West Side Story opens and breathes new life into the themes of "Romeo and Juliet" relocating the tragic love story from seventeenth century Verona to nineteen sixties Manhattan. I had the pleasure of watching West Side Story first as a young man then only a few days ago as an adult. While most kids grew up with "On Top of Old Smokey" being sung in their home, I was enveloped by the lyrics of Steven Sondheim and couldn't get enough of such classics as "I Feel Pretty", "Tonight" and "Gee, Officer Krupke!"For those not yet versed in the neo-expressionist masterpiece, West Side Story is the tale of two lovers; Maria (Wood) and Tony (Beymer) who simply cannot be together. Maria is the sister of Bernardo (Chakiris) the leader of a scrappy Puerto Rican gang in the heart of New York City. Meanwhile Tony is an enforcer and founding member of The Jets, a crew of native whites, descendant from Polish immigrants. Needless to say The Jets and The Sharks don't get along and plan a rumble over the turf they call home. Trying and failing to keep the piece are Detective Schrank (Oakland) and Officer Krupke (Bramley) who turn their noses at the youthful gangs and their aggressive street ballet.The film begins with aerial shots of New York City as ambient noise melts into the menacing finger snaps of gang members. The story struts slowly and confidently, draping the audience in the brightly colored world of Maria and Tony with an opening ballet so terse and tight it can't help but startle. The depth of field within the frame, along with the flashes of harsh lights, shadowed trestles and euphonious melody adds to the films attitude and fury. It's an aggressive musical with violent themes all centered around a love story that's sincere to a fault.Natalie Wood does an outstanding job channeling the frustrations and ecstasy of a young ingenue finding love for the first time. Richard Beymer is slightly miscast as the gallant beau who steals her heart yet his cornball bravado can be forgiven when matched by Russ Tamblyn's Jet caretaker manager Riff. The real heart of the show however is Rita Moreno as Anita, the sassy female guardian whose equal parts Frenchie from Grease (1978) and Mae West only 100% Puerto Rican (unlike Wood). Moreno can not only act but she can sing like a songbird and dance like she's treading on water. She ended up winning Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards for her portrayal and in the years since she gained distinction as an EGOT (someone whose won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony).The dance numbers are a compendium of elastic, punchy fun with men and women flying through the air in graceful synergy. What penetrates through all the showy glitz however is an excess of feeling in all the numbers. Whether it be the sweaty paranoia of "Cool" or the sly, bittersweet social awareness of "America", the characters large and small all find little moments to exhibit pure personality. Granted some of the song and dance numbers may overstay their welcome, yet beyond the restless movement and admittedly dated lingo, there's a state of mind so raw, so real that it overpowers any of the film's minor missteps.An of course there is the social subtext which best represents itself in songs like "America" and "Gee, Officer Krupke!". Certainly there is a racial component to West Side Story, yet if we dig even deeper we find that all characters are trying to come to terms with an internal struggle for validation and acceptance. The Sharks distract themselves from the inner conflict with racial resentment, a conflict that is made real not only by The Jets but by Schrank who has no problems seeing them as "the other." Meanwhile The Jets overwhelm their resentments with mockery, not only openly dressing down Schrank and Krupke but even ridiculing their assumed hangups in song. One of the few moments of Jets honesty comes when Doc angrily chastises them for "(making) this world lousy!" One of the hoods responds "We didn't make it, Doc." It is at that moment we see that they have much more in common with The Sharks than they realize; they too feel invalidated by social systems.Taken as a whole, West Side Story is a layered, beautiful and bellicose film which dares to tell a familiar story with new story elements, exciting visuals and an infinity of blunt antagonism. Those who have yet to see this film should watch it on the largest screen possible to take full advantage of its epic scale and dense mis en scene. Those who find the inspiration for West Side Story to be too adroit, be aware the romance is laid on just as thick. Yet just because it can occasionally flirt with corniness doesn't mean it's no less a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>West Side Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>West Side Story accomplished two goals for me. As a modern day adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, it fit quite nicely among the month featuring Shakespeare films. The musical directed by Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise was also selected by the Academy as 1961's Best Picture Winner. I have been on a years-long quest to see every film that has taken Oscar's top prize, and West Side Story starring Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer put me one step closer to accomplishing my goal. I'm sure I'm not alone in my assessment that this story of forbidden love ranks as the best retelling of Shakespeare's most well-known classic. Setting the Bard's prose to music was an excellent choice, as West Side Story remains cherished in the hearts of audiences everywhere. In this retelling of Romeo and Juliet, feuding families have been replaced with rival gangs, as the American "Jets" set out to stake their claim of the neighborhood from the Puerto Rican-born Sharks. Riff (Russ Tamblyn) acts as the leader of the Jets determined to keep the neighborhood free from the Puerto Rican immigrants he believes are taking over the neighborhood. Bernardo, leader of the Sharks, is equally determined to assimilate into the neighborhood and carve out a place for his friends and family seeking better lives in America. As the animosity intensifies, the hatred between the two groups escalates to the point that they can no longer exist safely. At a neighborhood dance, the groups attend to plan a fight for later in the evening. Bernardo's sister, Maria (Natalie Wood) is thrilled to be going to her first dance in America. As she dresses for the evening, she is anxiously awaiting the opportunity to meet people and dance the night away, always under the watchful eye of her brother. Riff talks former Jet Tony (Richard Beymer) to go to the dance, and suit up for the Jets one last time and help them fight the Sharks. Eager to leave the gang behind, Tony denies Riff's request to fight but succumbs to the pressure to go to the dance. At the dance, Maria and Tony lock eyes, instantly fall in love and ignite a passionate secret romance. Eager to move away from the gang life and begin their lives anew with each other Maria and Tony devise a plan to leave New York which will only work if they can keep their love hidden long enough to run off together. With each gang honing in on the secret, Tony and Maria are in a race against time and proximity ending in tragedy for the forbidden lovers.West Side Story wastes no time letting the audience know it is a musical. Nearly fifteen minutes into the film, no dialogue is heard, but a beautiful bird's-eye view shot is seen with a catchy musical number being heard in the background. The tone is intense with scenes characterized with flash cuts and stark lighting changes. This film plays with coloring in a very interesting way. One scene, in particular; the initial meeting of Tony and Maria, the background goes dark and the audience is only left to see the two would be lovers. After the dance we see another scene with the forefront blurred and an ominous image of Riff in the background, an excellent use of foreshadowing. West Side Story is a fantastically done musical, with memorable fun songs, endured in hearts for over the last 50 years.</fullReview>

Giving it a more modern edge and updating the lingo from Shakespearean time makes it a lot easier to relate to the characters and story line. Even watching the movie now in 2014 it still reflects upon issues that still matter today, such as immigration. The musical numbers are dramatic and get the point across. There's so much that goes into them it keeps you involved and are exciting to view. The choreograph seems very original and unique.

		<shortDescription>All the world's a stage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A loose adaptation of "Romeo and Juliet", "West Side Story" is a campy but iconic musical by Robert Wise. Choreographed by Jerome Robbins, the film sees rival New York gangs lock horns and battle over women and walkways. The film's song-and-dance numbers point to an America which betrays locals and immigrants alike, and which seems to delight in pitting races, classes and sexes against one another. Unlike the Shakespeare play upon which it is based, "Story" discards the heroine's death and the hero's suicide. It stars the photogenic, pixie-faced Natalie Wood.Though overlong, "Story" is immaculately directed, Wise treating us to machine-precise camera work, eye-popping colours, smooth editing and some fine sets. Stand out songs include "America", "The Rumble" and "Gee, Officer Krupke". See Nicholas Ray's "Rebel Without a Cause".7/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recommend "Still Startling and Still Finger-Snapping Cool Especially with Jerome Robbins' Dazzling Choreography" (Ed Uyeshima from San Francisco, CA; 24 January 2007). Also, there are some interesting comments about the demise of the filming locations ("The true West Side story", joandambra from US; 15 November 2011).Some good points have been made about the two acting Oscar winners (Chakiris and Moreno) not singing ("Great Music and Choreography, But It's the Same Old Story", edwagreen from United States; 27 March 2006). And, the authenticity of the natives vs. Puerto Rican conflict is questioned ("Problems with Authur", harry-76 from Cleveland, Ohio; 4 September 2002)Frank Fob ("OK, let's get it out of the way", frankfob from California; 15 June 2008) downgrades Natalie Wood and defends Richard Breymer, exactly the opposite of how I rate their performances. Finally, there are excellent points about the song ordering changes ("song order", losmwl from United States; 1 April 2007) which change their contextual implications."West Side Story" doesn't top "The Red Shoes" as the greatest dancing movie ever, largely because of casting. The producers of "Red Shoes" needed Moira Shearer and waited a year for the reluctant ballerina to participate. Here the producers needed Elvis Presley as Tony. (Apparently Presley turned it down and regretted it afterwards.) Richard Beymer is as uncharismatic as he is inauthentic. (His one redeeming moment is when he apparently performs his own stunt climb over of a fence.)Natalie Wood is not authentic as the Puerto Rican Juliet, but she is superb overall, especially in the tear-jerking melodramatic closing scenes. Chakiris and Moreno are both very strong--Moreno's role has the most depth in the cast. However, the Academy Awards made a clear mistake in recognizing Chakiris before Russ Tamblyn's Riff. Tamblyn is the only member of the principal cast (i.e., Wood, Breymer, Chakiris, Moreno) who actually sings all of his character's material. Tamblyn sings, dances and performs flips superbly. He even seems fairly tough (as singer/dancers go) and is a focal point in almost every scene he's in. He should have won with Moreno.I saw this last evening (6/14/13) with the Baltimore Symphony performing. I have issues with the beginning. Leonard Bernstein's overture, with a single image of almost no visual interest, is a technique you'd expect with a live opera, but not a movie. (Still, Bernstein's music and Sondheim's lyrics are praise-worthy.) I also think the helicopter footage at the beginning is overly nauseating.Somehow viewers get drawn in by the Shakespearean finish despite having seen gang members constantly singing and dancing, belying their menace. That suggests the power of dance to inspire hope that it continues; when great dancing suddenly stops we feel sad. Imagine if Presley had appeared as Tony in 'West Side Story'. WSS was a single acting upgrade away from becoming the limit for dance cinema. It is still a real fun viewing experience.</fullReview>

Although I appeared in several on-stage, I don't much care for musicals. Most musicals I see as fanciful family entertainment that is harmless, depth less and child-friendly, loaded with the type of music that brings a tear to the eye of the nostalgic and encourages one and all to sing heartily along with those actor/singers on the stage or screen. In my opinion, West Side Story is a miracle. It's referred to as a "musical," but oh, it's so much more. Everyone who's a die-hard fan of West Side Story can agree with that. According to many critics, West Side Story has a significant flaw, and that is the casting of Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer in the two starring roles of Maria and Tony. Critics complain that both those actors were cast as the tragic lovers solely for their celebrity. Well, that's no surprise, it happens more often that not. I don't know what other actors were considered for the role of Maria in the film version besides Natalie Wood, and frankly, folks, I cannot envision any other actor who could bring Maria to life with more honesty and loveliness than Natalie Wood. Granted, Natalie did not sing as Maria, a major "flaw" critics loved to point out and scoff at. But then, Audrey Hepburn did not do her own singing in My Fair Lady, either. Audrey, like Natalie, is an outstanding actor with a genius for dialects. Another example is Dorothy Dandridge, the incomparable goddess of stage and screen who ALSO did not do her own singing in her Oscar-nominated performance as Carmen Jones; although she was a jazz/blues singer of the highest repute, her voice was not tailored to sing opera. With actors like these who had it all and then some, no one's gonna notice, or care, that someone else is singing for them! I only know of two actors considered for the role of Tony: Warren Beatty and Elvis Presley. I really can't see Warren Beatty who was King of On screen Gigolos at that time in the role of Tony, an ex-gang-banger from the streets of NYC and decidedly NOT a gigolo. Elvis Presley, on the other hand, would have been a PERFECT Tony, at least in my opinion. His performances in King Creole and Jailhouse Rock proved Elvis to be a fine actor, and he would have had no trouble playing street-wise ex-gang-member Tony. And, needless to say, Elvis would have had no trouble singing Tony's sweeping ballads. Unfortunately, Elvis could never have been cast as Tony because his overwhelming celebrity and drawing power would have diverted all attention from everyone and everything that made West Side Story what it was. On the other hand, I will never understand what possessed central casting or whomever was responsible to cast Richard Beymer as Tony. This sounds mean, I know, but I will not sugar-coat my outrage. Not only did Beymer not do his own singing, but he was as appropriate in the role of Tony as TV-ghoul-of-the-night Elvira would be playing Cinderella. Nonetheless, West Side Story as a whole is brilliant to the point where it's possible to excuse Beymer's miscasting. If you've never seen West Side Story, treat yourself to a priceless film experience! For die-hard fans like myself, West Side Story will continue to rein supreme above all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No matter how much you've seen it, Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet story is one love story that will be told for years to come.West Side Story is an adaptation of the Romeo and Juliet story. The movie itself is based on the book of the same name.Elvis was actually approached to come and play the role of Tony but he turned it down and opted for other musicals. If Elvis had known that this movie will be set in the range of classics to be seen maybe he would have picked the offer.The movie tells the story of two rival gangs, the Jets (Americans) and the Sharks (Puerto Ricans). The jets decide to challenge the Sharks for who takes control of the streets at a dance that night. Riff the leader decides to call Tony Wycek (Richard Beymer), a co-founder of the Jets who has left the gang to work at a local candy/drug store, would be the best member to present the challenge to the Sharks.At the dance that night Tony gets there and meets Maria (Natalie Wood) and it was love at first sight. Tony gets carried away by her presence and everything else from here I need you the reader to go watch it yourself.The movie still has its marks in Hollywood, as some of the songs are still being used, and also in the Michael Jackson Bad video the standoff between the rival gang leaders is similar to that in the movie.The film holds the distinction of being the musical film with the most Academy Award wins (10 wins), including Best Picture.One thing you will also find yourself liking is the choreography during the singing, it was warm and enjoyable. The movie script is also well written as it takes you through a Romeo and Juliet story with its own ideology and fun that you may actually forget that you are watching a Shakespeare adaptation.The director Robert Wise has won the Academy award for Best Director and Best Picture, for West Side Story (1961) and The Sound of Music (1965). He was also nominated for Best Film Editing for Citizen Kane (1941).This is a movie to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A colorful, musical account of the perpetual hostility between natives and immigrants in congruence with Shakespeare's epic tale of love and tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest musicals of all-time. The movie is a musical adaptation of Shakespeare's classic tale of love and struggle, beautifully brought out with foot-tapping dance sequences. The wonderful lyrics and music also contribute to this most-vaunted film. The Sharks and Jets fight for place and hegemony over the other the gang and even fight scenes are wonderfully turned to dance sequences. Such is the effort taken by Choreographer and Co-Writer Jerome Robbins.When the two gangs meet in a dance club, a former founder-member of the Jets, Tony falls in love with Maria, sister of Sharks' leader Bernardo, at first sight. They are lost in oblivion when their eyes meet and are interrupted by their respective gangs. The gangs' rivalry gets fueled with Tony and Maria falling in love.They decide to battle it out with fists and be done with it once and for all. Both the gangs renege on not using weapons and come armed to fight. Tony is persuaded by Maria to bring peace between the gangs. When Riff, the head of the Jets, is stabbed by Bernardo, Tony enters the fight and kills Bernardo. They gangs are chased off the crime scene by cops. Maria doesn't lose her love for the man who murdered her brother despite her sister-in-law's advice to forget him. She even enters the Sharks' den to make truce but they ridicule and try to take advantage of her. Tony is shot by a member of the Sharks and thus concludes the epic story of love and tragedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>West Side Story is a film I appreciate rather than like.Yes, it is loosely based on Shakespeare. OK, but big deal. Yes, it is an artistic leap forward in transplanting modern dance into an urban setting with a romantic context. I'll grant you that, but I don't much care for the dancing (I don't much care for dancing anyway). This is the stuff I'm lukewarm about.Here is stuff I actively am not too keen on. I don't like juxtaposing urban realism and stylisation in terms of sets. There are some performances which varied from "mannered" (not a compliment) to what one might class as appropriate to the time the film was made: the urban realism doesn't always stretch to the performances. And the two principals were, in my view, a bit on the weak side.Now we come to what I liked.The score. Oh, that fabulous, fabulous score! If this film existed as nothing other than a vehicle for Bernstein's score and Sondheim's libretto, then that would be good enough. These are, quite simply the best songs (words and music), as an collection of pieces, ever written for musical theatre or film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gang Bang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jets were a real gang in 1950s New York City, and its members were, no doubt, more exciting than these actors let on. In fact, one Jet is alive today and a grown-up mob kingpin. He was never like the bland kids shown here. For one thing, he probably never sprang into a Jerome Robbins ballet to express his lethal Weltanschauung. As an update of Edward de Vere's Renaissance play, Romeo and Juliet, the movie plot line is effective enough. But the courtly aristocrats of de Vere's play are a world apart from these kids and are fueled by brilliant, overwrought poetry. It's a story that can't ring true in the gritty milieu of Hell's Kitchen. Leonard Bernstein's spectacular score is the finest thing in the movie. The Arthur Laurents book is wrongheaded. Puerto Rican Maria can't be Juliet, nor can Polish Tony be Romeo. To try to make them so kills their charisma. Maria should have been written sexier. And it would have been easy to fix Tony, too. First of all, he should be alpha male, not Riff. Minor changes to the screenplay would have made this work. The fabulous introductory music should be a pantomime, in which Tony slays a gang member of the Sharks, establishing his virility, intensity, indomitability and unpredictability. Then one would be thrilled and surprised by his falling in love with Maria. Nor would one doubt his capacity for killing Bernardo. As it is, one doesn't believe the contrivance of the tragedy. Laurents was perhaps afraid audiences would not accept an earthy Maria or a feral Tony. The dancing doesn't help either. The right style did not exist in the fifties to capture the raw, dangerous masculinity of the disenfranchised gang members. It exists today in the work of many contemporary choreographers and a host of modern street styles. Ballet is way off the mark. As a result, the characters of Tony and Maria are limp, gooey sweet and forgettable. You don't really care about them as they are a boringly ideal construct. If anything, Schadenfreude is one's only emotional reaction. Anita is the only one who feels real. But Tony and Maria are supposed to be the core of this film, though they seem to be missing in action. Future remakes ought to make more of the explosive energy of the music and employ leads more believable in their passion to live and die hard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Maria?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>West Side Story is a very modern twist to the Shakespearean love tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. Only set in the 1960s with gangs in New York City. Basically an American boy, Tony falls in love with a Puerto Rican girl, Maria. Maria has just arrived to America and lives with her traditional Puerto Rican family. Her brother, Bernardo, is the leader of the Puerto Rican gang who named themselves The Sharks. Meanwhile Tony works with Doc in his store but is still friends with rival gang leader Riff. Riff's gang is known as The Jets. Riff knows that Tony will always have his back no matter what. One night Riff invites Tony to a local dance. At the dance they plan to meet The Sharks and decide where they can have the ultimate rumble for the local territory. Meanwhile Maria is also preparing for her first dance, which her brother is taking her to. Both Maria and Tony feel that something great is about to happen at this dance. At the dance Tony and Maria meet. Thus begins the star-crossed lovers' story. They have to see each other in secret because Tony's friends hate Maria's brother, Bernardo and he hates them. Also Maria's parents want her to marry a Puerto Rican man. They don't want her to lose her roots by Americanizing. Tony and Maria pretend to get married and fantasize about both of their families and friends coming together. One night ruins all of their hopes and dreams as the rumble begins and death hits both gangsI really enjoyed the new version of the Romeo and Juliet story. The songs were catchy and I couldn't stop singing them for days. The choreography is amazing! I couldn't remember all of those steps at once. I also couldn't dance in line with the rest of the actors/dancers. That is just incredible. I didn't like how some of the singing and emotions were exaggerated. At times the emotions seemed fake and staged not natural at all. Also when Maria and Tony first meet is a bit unreal. I didn't like the darkened background effect at their meeting. Why didn't Maria die as well? I was thinking that both lovers were to die, so I wanted Maria to die with Tony. Why did she just walk away into the street? I didn't like how all of the people just walked away, including Maria.Maria and Tony were portrayed pretty well. They were very convincing about being in love. They had chemistry on screen. They make a very memorable couple. Plus they could sing so that really made the story more pleasing to watch. Nobody wants to see a musical where the actors can't sing. I didn't like the character of Chino, Maria's suitor. He ruined the whole story for me but of course he had to or else it wouldn't be a tragic love story. Still Chino was very a very flat character you can't even see him as an antagonist. To me he is just a dumb, na?ve guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>West Side Story is directed by Robert Wise, has a screenplay by Ernest Lehman and stars Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer, George Chakiris, Rita Moreno, Russ Tamblyn and Simon Oakland.Basically a 60's updated version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, West Side Story is filled with gorgeous costumes,energetic and unforgettable dance sequences and a great cast. Bernado(George Chakiris)the leader of gang The Sharks is horrified to discover his younger sister Maria (Natalie Wood)dancing with Tony (Richard Beymer) who is the best friend of the leader of the gang The Jets Riff(Russ Tamblyn). A battle soon begins between the gangs and Tony and Maria soon fall in love and must keep their romance a secret.Moving and spectacular West Side Story is well worth watching. My favourite characters in this are Anita(Rita Moreno)who's Bernardo's girlfriend. Anita is feisty,strong and an amazing dancer. My other favourite is Maria(Natalie Wood)who's falling in love for the first time and is heading towards tragedy. Featuring unforgettable songs like "America", "Tonight" , "Jets" , "I Feel Pretty" and "Somewhere". The entire cast is superb with standout performances by Natalie Wood, Rita Moreno, George Chakiris and Simon Oakland as a detective who starts to investigate the gangs crimes.This is a superb musical and a interesting version of Romeo and Juliet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art at its highest form.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter what anyone says, West Side Story is art at its highest form and undoubtedly one of the ten greatest musicals ever made. With a running time like an epic, an opening overture with incredible music and sets that will blow your mind, this is an over-the top rendition of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet that works on nearly every level. It all starts with the actors, and while most of them can't sing, they look very good on camera and pull some pretty nifty physical moves as well. Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer and Russ Tamblyn all provide strong performances even if they seem a little off balance. However, the finest performances come from the Latino lovers; George Charkris and Rita Moreno. Together they have hotter chemistry than most American actors and separate they give strong work as two people that love each other yet let other factors get in their way.To be frank, this is a film that cinema-wise is near perfection. Robert Wise directs flawlessly, Jerome Robbin's choreography is absolutely stunning and the score by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim will stay with you long after the film ends. Some people think it's overrated and others think it's just okay. In this viewer's opinion, it is near-perfect and a wonderful look at racial relationships mixed with beautiful music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De-fanged classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>West Side Story remains an all-time great movie musical, fully on par with The Sound of Music and Fiddler on the Roof. Robert Wise's impeccable craftsmanship again shines through, and the rest of the crew reads like a Hollywood Deam Team: Sondheim/Bernstein/Lehman/Robbins. Its a shame that even in 1961, the lyrics had to be watered-down for political correctness. God knows what a re-make would be like today. Maybe Quentin Tarantino could make a good stab at a high-gloss update, where inner-city gangs DON'T spontaneously break into ballet dance numbers, and incessant finger-snapping. Regardless, the film should be in everyone's library: more proof that "they don't make movies like this any more."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>West Side Story is Romeo and Juliet set to the streets of New York.The Jets and the Sharks are the two gangs constantly fighting with each other.Tony and Maria are the two youngsters falling in love with each other.The Puerto Rican Maria is the sister of the Sharks' leader Bernardo and Tony is the former leader of the Jets.But love is always stronger than some minor details.West Side Story (1961) is one of the most critically acclaimed musicals.It's a winner of 10 Academy Awards! It's directed by Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins and it's based on Arthur Laurents' play.Leonard Bernstein is behind the masterly music.Stephen Sondheim wrote the lyrics."America" and "Tonight" are among those great songs that are heard in the movie.The acting work is superb.The beautiful and talented Natalie Wood is perfect as Maria.Richard Beymer, who's done great work in The Diary of Anne Frank as Peter Van Daan and later in Twin Peaks as Benjamin Horne shines in this movie.Other great performances include Russ Tamblyn (Riff), Rita Moreno (Anita), George Chakiris (Bernardo), Ned Class (Doc) and so on.The movie's filled with classic scenes.One of them is the first encounter of Tony and Maria.Their eyes meet on the dance floor, they keep staring at each other while the others dance around them.They start approaching and end up kissing.That's one beautiful scene.West Side Story is a timeless classic, just sensational.It has reached closer to the reality level than most musicals.The fantasy world that Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly lived in has been forgotten here.Sure fantasy beats realism anytime but in movies they both can work.The lesson of this movie: gangs ain't cool-dancing is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stunning. Even forty-plus years after it was made, this movie will still leave you gasping at the dance numbers, the editing, the production and costume designs, the lighting, the colour - and that's even before you get to the music, lyrics, script and performances. Moreno, Chakiris and Tamblyn are dazzling. Beymer is fine in a role that is pretty dull until the last reel, at which point he acquits himself well. Wood is terrific, particularly in the final scene, where really, if she hadn't been the fine actress she was, the whole event would, in spite of everything, have seemed anti-climactic.There is such wealth of invention, imagination, and passion here, it's difficult to see how this isn't the greatest movie musical, an accolade usually handed to admittedly wonderful Singing In The Rain. I guess that the latter can justify its pre-eminence by being entirely a Hollwood product (albeit much of it the work of practised Broadway hands Comden and Green), whereas West Side, notwithstanding the dynamism of its photography, to an extent is a record of a pre-existing stage show. The fact is, however, that West Side is not really, at least in any ordinary sense, a musical. Although it owes a debt to works like Oklahoma!, and shares an enjoyment in theatrical energy with what is otherwise not even enjoyable rubbish like Hello Dolly, West Side belongs to a special group of American creations, of which Porgy and Bess is probably the best-known other example, which bring a number of different forms together at the highest possible level, and by doing so create something entirely new, not quite classifiable under any of the general headings. Although there are set-piece numbers that find links to other genres and styles - and indeed, a whole other play, since Romeo and Juliet is at the heart of this piece - there are other things that are uniquely West Side's, and the movie version's West Side in particular - such as the moment in the Dance at the Gym when Tony and Maria first see each other, or when the Jets sing, dance and act "Cool" in a garage with a low ceiling, in and out of headlamps.A very great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adaptation at its best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone knows the story of Romeo and Juliet. Everyone has also seen at least one play or movie of the most popular Shakespearean story. However, what happens when you modernize a Shakespeare play and make it into a musical? You get "West Side Story".The story follows two gangs in New York City: the Jets and the Sharks. One Puerto Rican, and one American. Bernardo (George Chakiris, Oscar-winner for Best Supporting Actor), the leader of the Puerto Rican group, Sharks, hates life in America and can't stand their racist image upon the foreigners. Riff (Russ Tamblyn) leads the Jets, New York-born gangsters who want nothing but to clean the Puerto Ricans out of their city. Bernardo's younger sister, Maria (Natalie Wood) falls for a young American (Richard Beymer) who's friends with the Jets. Soon, the two sides find themselves in a struggle while Maria and Tony (Beymer) create confusion with their love for each other."West Side Story" broke many records. Becoming the most successful adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, being the only movie ever to have two directors who both won an Oscar, and influencing a generation of filmmakers, the movie stands as one of the greatest musicals ever created. Directors Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise create a film completely visually stunning and unique. From the excellent choreography to the flawless editing and directing of each musical segment, "West Side Story" remains as one of Hollywood's main entrepreneurs in film-making.The unforgettable beginning sequence, in which the camera overlooks Manhattan and then zooms into a playground where a bunch of hoodlums stand and start snapping their fingers remains one of the best and most memorable scenes in cinema history. Utterly entertaining, and beautifully filmed, "West Side Story" is a remarkable and entertaining movie for everybody. Robbins and Wise construct an inspiring musical that touched the hearts of people all over the world. Staying away from typical feel-good dramas, the movie is a bright and colorful plethora of society in the 1950s. Almost all the actors enjoyed excessive physical training to endure all the intricate dance sequences as well as keeping a figure that resembled a "cool" personality.Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer have enormous chemistry as the modern Romeo and Juliet stuck between two wars. The over-the-top sympathy we feel for the two characters is so abundantly emphasized through their musical sequences: Beymer's "Maria" and Wood's "I feel pretty" numbers really convey their love, avoiding any cliché with superior directing."West Side Story" is a movie that one can watch over and over again. From the superb directing to the flawless choreography, it grabs hold of the audience and reaches deep. A movie experience for everyone and anyone. A piece of cinema that one shouldn't dare to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it imperfect? yes. Is it excellent? Absolutely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not for those who don't like musicals; do not expect a gritty true-to-life drama set in the inner city, with dirt, grime, blood and guts. This is a musical.But this is a musical unlike any musical before or since. There is no uplifting moment at the end of the tragedy (e.g. Shirley Jones's "You'll Never Walk Alone" at the end of "Carousel"); this stays dark at the end, true to the "Romeo and Juliet" story that inspired it.What's wrong with the movie? 1. Fair to middling acting. The central romance at the core of the story is only lukewarm. I believe in love at first sight(which is different from true love, but that's not what this movie is about, btw), when eyes meet, heart stops, a sudden gasp, knees go weak, and fingers tingle. The central characters in this romance do not do a great job of convincing me that this is happening - Richard Beymer looks lost, Natalie Wood is not Puerto Rican, Russ Tamblyn isn't a gangster. 2. Dubbing - but then again, everyone did it back then- just watch South Pacific, one of the greatest musicals of all time - Lt. Cable, Bloody Mary, Emile deBeque - all were dubbed by real singers; in The King and I, Debora Kerr was dubbed by none other than Marni Nixon, who sang for Natalie Wood in WSS.What's right? 1. The music. From the opening overture, Bernstein's jazzy/Latin americana score is a thrilling, awe-inspiring masterpiece with imaginative tempos, lyrical melodies, and unforgettable songs. 2. The dancing - This is the part of the movie that cinches the deal for me, that make WSS an all-time classic. Jerome Robbins was fired 60% through filming because he ran way over budget pushing his dancing cast to perfection. That hard work shines brilliantly. The Sharks' "America" and the Jet's "Cool" are among the best ensemble numbers to be found in American movie musicals, imho. George Chakiris is a dancing god, a suave/macho figure (in stark contrast to the wimpy Tony). These dances aren't just "numbers", they stand alone as cinematic gems. These two items, the music and the dance, are what make this movie a joy to watch. period. exclamation point. These two items overwhelm the mediocre acting. They give this movie its fire.And for you movie musical fans out there, comparing the latest musicals from Hollywood (e.g. Chicago, Rent, and even Phantom), tell me which of those movies can match WSS in score, number of unforgettable songs, and dance? I don't mean to knock those movies, they do have their gems as well, but a hundred years from now, I guarantee, most of their songs will be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Music and Choreography, But It's the Same Old Story ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"West Side Story" lost various Broadway Tony awards but came up with 10 Academy Awards including best picture of 1961. The film beat out the great "Judgment at Nuremberg."Jerome Robbins' choreography can't be beat. Lenny Bernstein's music is just phenomenal. You know from it that the Jets and Sharks think they own the neighborhood. They can certainly make life difficult in the neighborhood. Just keep them singing and dancing and everything could be fine.Unfortunately, this is really a musical version of Romeo and Juliet with gang warfare. In the Shakespearian classic, we had to contend with family feuds.It's the same old story of oppressed people calling out for help in America. Everyone wants a good piece of the action, to secure the American dream. Unfortunately, the Jets and Sharks, two neighborhood street gangs are in need of desperate psychiatric help. Their answer to everything is singing, dancing and using the knife.Poor Simon Oakland. As officer Krupke, he comes off as the tough uncaring police chief who is ready to bust heads.Natalie Wood is wonderful as Maria but too bad that the usual reliable Marnie Nixon had to sing for her. Why wasn't Carol Lawrence from Broadway allowed to do the movie?George Chakiris (Bernardo) won the best supporting actor award as did Rita Moreno for best supporting actress. Why this occurred is beyond me. Many people are not aware that Chakiris and Moreno did not do their own singing in the film. Besides, Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland were magnificent in "Judgment at Nuremberg." They were literally robbed of the coveted award.Why does Rita have to sing to Maria that a boy like that, he killed your brother? You don't keep going with a guy you just did that. If someone has to explain that to you, you've got trouble.If we can go beyond the oppression and need for understanding and just enjoy the singing and dancing, you're in for a treat.Russ Tamblyn dances like he owns the streets of N.Y. He certainly appeared in great films such as "Peyton Place," "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers," and this musical as one.</fullReview>

Natalie was never a great actress but somehow endeared herself. Her real name was Natasha Gurdin. Her parents came from Russia. West Side Story is an American Romeo and Juliet. Shakespeare's influence as a playwright remains enormous. "Tonight" is the best song from the musical score. You feel the anticipation. Cousin Larry and I saw this in November, 1962. President John Kennedy was due in Louisville early that evening, and I suggested we stay to get a glimpse. Kennedy came riding down 4th street perched atop the back of a Convertible. His accessibility cost him a year later when he was assassinated in Dallas, November 22, 1963. I will always link Kennedy and West Side Story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I've seen "West Side Story" at least a hundred times, and I could watch it a thousand times more but it will never cease to take my breath away. I remember being captivated by it as a child, and the older I got the more I understood about what was happening in the movie, how it was more than just love and songs and great dancing. It's about passion and fire taking over all reason. About how hard it is to be young and to accept the world we live in. Some people I know will never get past the dancing or the "breaking into song" - thinking that just makes it look stupid, that it's not realistic, etc. But that never stopped the opera or the ballet, so why should musical theater be laughed at for interpreting movement through dance? I think that if you can get past the "unrealities" and try not to compare it too much to "Romeo and Juliet" and just let yourself understand the content of the film as a whole, "West Side Story" will be a beautiful experience. I don't think I will ever get through the movie without shedding a tear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>West Side Story is really a timeless homogeneous masterpiece for many reasons. Everything fits very well together. I have seen it dozens of times and I can watch it again and again, every time I realize something new and although it is quite long, it is never boring and can't be shorter. Neither the story (love, hate + aggression) is outdated nor the music which will still be listened to in decades. The actors which seemed to be carefully chosen, also because of their acting, singing and especially dancing abilities (esp. George Chakiris, Tucker Smith and Tony Mordente). The scene and the place with a certain atmosphere, strengthened by the kind of illumination. It fascinates right away. The opening with the view of New York, Manhattan, the West Side until we see the gangs' turf and finally the Jets who snap their fingers, all this leads you into that certain direction. Every time I watch it, I have the same goose skin as I had the first time, more than 30 years ago!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is over forty years since Westside Story was made it remains a brilliant example of film making.From the moment the overture starts you just know something is coming ...something pretty amazing is coming.I know there are those that quibble about Natalie Wood and Richard Beymar in the leads but this is film is as perfect a version of any musical as has been made.BUT please try and see it in 70mm on the biggest screen with the best sound system you can.This film is beautifully crafted. It uses color, sound and images in a way that is only really seen properly in a cinema.That said on DVD (a brilliant restoration job in its own right) I have to admit it becomes a more intimate experience with its own joys.No one has topped the opening of the film with the stunning Saul Bass "titles", a simple abstract view of New York's skyline that changes color before announcing WEST SIDE STORY as the final moments of overture sound and then the breathtaking almost silent overhead shot of New York that zooms into the opening dance sequence..It remains as powerful a film today as in 1961.Special mention must go to the cast, crew and the dancers whose extraordinary work make Westside Story a unforgettable movie experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just the best musical ever. It certainly deserves to be rated as one of the best movies ever made. Winner of ten Academy Awards. Best Picture. People should be made aware of the great movies like this one. A picture that everyone can enjoy. A movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen the way it was intended, with full sound and the intermission. A joy of life to be watched over and over again. A movie to be passed on to your children and their children. This motion picture is art in every sense. A true celebration of the senses, from the opening helicopter shot to the graffiti walled end. Art everywhere. Musical Art, Dance Art, acting art, directing art. A student of film could earn a degree by just watching this motion picture and learning that film is about giving a good performance. And what better example than West Side Story. This movie gives great examples in the ensemble performances from the actors to the loving hand of Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the classic Romeo &amp; Juliet story, and I love seeing well-done modern adaptations of it. So, when I first saw West Side Story, I was blown away by Bernstein's amazing music, and Sontheim's lovely lyrics. A great story of star- crossed lovers, their was only one part I was unsatisfied with: The ending. WARNING: SPOILERS: I was so angry with the way, they changed the original text! How could they kill Tony but not Maria! It destroyed it for me. Besides that however, it's a lovely movie. The direction was awesome, the writing cute, and the acting smart. I have always been a fan of Berstein as well as Sontheim, so seeing their work together is just marvelous. All in all, a great adaptation of Shakespeare's amazing story.</fullReview>

It appealed to every artistic sense--art, music, dance, acting, scenery, cinematography, color, words, story, symbolism--I took it all in. It seemed to speak to my generation, who was soon to find its voice in the mid-sixties. I had not even read Romeo and Juliet. I was only beginning to be aware of racism. It forever changed the way I viewed, film, art, and the world. My goodness, how could a film do all that? Well, I was 13! I see it now through different eyes, but it takes me back to a time before I had seen or experienced anything. It is an enduring work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest musical ever made....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Im surprised that this movie isn't riding high in the top 250 movies...its an absolute corker of a film with some truely outstanding songs. This takes the old Romeo and Juliet premise and places it in 1950's New York where two angry rival gangs are at each others throats. In the middle of all this hate love blossoms between the sister of The Sharks leader Maria and reluctant Jet member Tony. The musical numbers in this film are breathtaking from the tender 'Tonight' to the incredible 'America' which is a visual treat. Natalie Wood gives a sweet performance as Maria although Richard Beymer's Tony is a little wet (its hard to imagine him in any sort of gang let alone such a fiesty one as The Jets). For me the standout performances are Russ Tamblyn as the energetic, cheeky 'Riff', Rita Moreno as the sultry 'Anita' and especially George Chakiris as the brooding Shark leader 'Bernardo'. This is a classic film that everyone should see, the dance routines are amazing, the romance very moving and you can almost feel the simmering hatred between the two angry gangs. An utter masterpiece. 10/10.</fullReview>

One complaint--and this has nothing to do with the film--is the sound quality of the DVD. Though mastered in dobly digital 5:1, there is virtually no surround sound. The DVD is best appreciated by setting your home theater receiver to the two channel stereo mode. Otherwise, most of the sound is processed through the center channel, which is a shame.

IMHO, when filming one of the all-time greatest musicals, one would hope to assemble a cast of actual musicians. Neither of the 2 leads, Tony and Maria, actually sing, and that makes it hard for me to fully enjoy numbers like "Somewhere" and "One Hand One Heart". (I know, I'm too fussy.... :-)</fullReview>

This is one of the best - great songs, brilliant dance sequences, and a cast to die for (Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer are perfect - they may not do their own singing but my goodness, they ARE Maria and Tony). The opening sequence where colours and drawings slowly turn into the city sky-scape is excellent. 'America', 'Jet Song' and 'Cool', my favourite sequences, stand up to repeated viewings. 'West Side Story' is a tragic film; Romeo and Juliet in the rough American streets, out there and real. This film has a message to give and it does it well. Special mention has to go to Rita Moreno as Anita -you'd never believe the same girl had been the screen Tuptim in King and I a few years before. What an actress. Also watch out for some fabulous dancers amongst the Jets (led by Russ Tamblyn and Tucker Smith) and the Sharks (led by George Chakiris).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>West side story shows that you don't have to end a story happily</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes when you have seen a movie you stop and wonder, what was good about this movie? Was it a good story? Was it great performances? Was it a fantastic environment? Or was it reat credits? And all you can come to is that it was a good damn entertaining and absorbing movie. That just what West side story is - a jolly good experience (as the British would have put it).The story is simple: Two youth gangs on Manhattan, New York are always fighting and arguing about something. A "member" of Jets called Tony (played by Richard Beymer) and a sister to a "member" in the other gang, Maria (excellent played by Natalie Wood) fall in love. Prohibited fruit as you may call it - a classic theme.The movie contains many wonderful songs by Stephen Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein, like "Something's coming", "Maria", "Tonight", "America" and "I feel pretty".The movie won 10 Academy Awards!!! (was it really that good back in '61?) including Best Picture.One thing that's very strange about West Side Story is the opening shot (by Saul Bass - he has done the same thing for Psycho). All you hear is some music and a lot of lines all over the screen. The only thing that changes is the color of the background. After 5 minutes!!! it stops and fades into a picture of Manhattan! Ok, it was Manhattan they wanted to resemble?! I see, I got the picture... But I just think it was so incredibly irritating!Now, here's a warning: Stop reading here if you do not want to hear the end ... ... oh you're curious, all right. West side story shows that you don't have to end a story happily. I think the happy moments in the film, all the wonderful and happy songs is enough. It's all right to end a movie in a sad way then. Or maybe is there no such thing as a depressing musical. I don't think so anyway - all musicals are absolutely fantastic.The end of West Side Story also makes you think back and remember that these people had a jolly good time, they loved each other and that love is not eternal and do not survive anything. No matter how much you want.But the end promises a little thing: the gangs will hopefully be friends after all they've gone through. And friendship is very important.Or maybe it's the reverse. Love is eternal and Tony will always live in Maria's heart.I have formerly seen the play here in Malmo in the theatre and maybe that's why I like it, I knew the songs and remembered the story.West side story is one of the most popular film musicals in history, along with My fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Mary Poppins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, maybe even great, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "West Side Story" in the winter of 1969 at the Lyceum theater on Fulton Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio. It had been re-released several months earlier with ads that attempted to lure the audience that had been too young to see it when it first appeared in 1961. "Unlike other classics, 'West Side Story' grows younger," the poster claimed, while also boasting of its having won 10 Academy Awards, including the top prize for Best Picture. Although not fond of musicals, I was taken with this modern day retelling of Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet." Sure, Richard Beymer's Tony was a hopeless wimp, and Natalie Wood, like Beymer, merely lip-synched to the voices of genuine singers. And sure, the street gangs appeared just a little silly and effeminate, rather than tough and menacing, while doing ballet leaps with switchblades in hand. But the music of Leonard Bernstein was striking, and Stephen Sondheim's lyrics were witty and, at times, beautiful. The song "Maria" is a gorgeous piece of work with some of the loveliest images ever conveyed in words, and a melody as haunting as a lost love. And don't forget such often recorded ditties like "Tonight," "America," and, especially, "Somewhere." There were also excellent performers, most notably Rita Moreno and Russ Tamblyn who not only contributed fine work as actors, but did their own singing as well.In 1969, "West Side Story" was a little more than seven years old and it was still playing in theaters, not on television. The screen was wide, the lights were low, and it was easy to be swept away by the filmmaker's vision. Now, "West Side Story" is almost 40 years old. The screen, and these days it's a TV screen, is small, the lights are bright, and "West Side Story" is a little harder to take. Richard Beymer's Tony remains a hopeless wimp, and the street gangs look like a gay version of the Bowery Boys. It's not a bad film by any means, it may even be a great one, but it is a film that absolutely demands to be seen on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>West Side BORING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>West Side Story, is considered to be one of the most infamous musicals of all time. The Broadway musical, turned movie is set in Manhattan, featuring the rivalry of two major gangs, the Sharks and the Jets. The story, however, is centered on the blossoming romance between Tony, who belongs to the Jets and Maria who is the sister of the Shark's leader.The two main characters claim to be "in love" after only a few days of knowing each other. The height of all the drama occurs when both gangs discover the secret romance and when the Jets challenge the Sharks to a fight.West Side Story is a dull modern version of Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet". However, the accompanying music in this film is absolutely phenomenal. America and Tonight are complete music genius. The first composition and funny light hearted arrangement makes the audience take note of the struggles most immigrants went through moving to America. The second arrangement is a more serious romantic song that truly conveys the feelings of a woman and a man in love. These songs alone make this monotonous movie a somewhat interesting movie.While this Musical was a smash on Broadway, Jerome Robbins (Director and Screen Play Writer of the film) did a horrible job translating this musical from stage to film. Many of the shots in the film, especially the scene where Tony and Maria first meet at the dance, are shot as if the audience was watching it on stage. This scene and many others like it throughout the movie show how Robbins clearly did not know how to translate the musical to the big screen. The film also dragged at certain points and was excessively too long. Towards the end of the film, audience members are left begging for the ending, good bad or indifferent. Also, the film begins with an exerting 10 minute long dance scene. A shortened dance scene or any dialog during this scene would have made for a more stand out entrance to movie.Richard Beymer, did a ho-hum job of portraying his character Tony. Many times he was overly animated and excited; the character's emotions were very forced and didn't seem realistic. Natalie Wood, who played Maria, also did a poor job conveying her characters personality and charm. Her accents seemed overly stressed and unauthentic. In addition to the main characters failing performances, the romance between Maria and Tony was also dreadfully unconvincing. No real person falls in love with in a matter of days. West Side Story is not worth the two and half hours of time it takes to watch this film in its entirety. The film's reworking of "Romeo and Juliet" is poor and Arthur Laurents essentially added music to an already written play. All in all I would suggest not watching this film and would only give it 5 stars out 10 for its unoriginality and long drawn out scenes.</fullReview>

Cinematography was fantastic (makes me want to go back there for an Egg Cream).Now for the not necessarily bad but somewhat inconceivable: The "Romeo and Juliet in Hell's Kitchen" angle just doesn't work for me here. In real life, Tony would be dead meat, Maria would be pregnant with Chino's kid, and the whole bunch would be fighting in Queens, because I don't see any of them having the means to afford a broom-closet in Manhattan, lest they mugged a rent-controlled apartment occupant for the space.The only way I see these two gangs ever existing in real life New York is maybe if they were in Greenwich Village! I don't know of any "gang" that went around snapping their fingers, dancing ballet, and occasionally singing (maybe we should compel MS-13 to do that!). The only dance numbers that any real gang members would perform would be on your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Striking and stirring musical triumph with very few mis-steps.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hugely popular Broadway musical (loosely structured on Shakespeare's Romeo &amp; Juliet) was given a vivid, polished treatment in its big screen adaptation. Wood is a newly-arrived Puerto Rican girl whose brother (Chakiris) heads a gang called The Sharks against the Caucasian gang (in the same New York City neighborhood) called The Jets. Tamblyn heads up The Jets since former leader Beymer has dropped out to work for a living. The rivalry between the gangs is in place from the beginning, but it reaches a fever pitch when Wood, at a local dance, falls for Beymer. This kicks off a series of (sometimes deadly) confrontations until the gangs begin to realize the destructive behaviors that they embrace are actually futile and have no value. The opening of the film (in which nearly 15 minutes pass before a real line of dialogue is spoken) contains some priceless and impressive overhead shots of NYC. Then an elaborate set of dances/skirmishes takes place as The Jets and The Sharks bicker over their territory. Of course, in this day and age - in fact even then, it's ridiculous for "tough" street kids to dance around this way, but if one can overlook the corniness of it and take it as an expression of art and music, the rest of the film is easier to relate to. The majority of the rest of the dancing takes place in situations in which it would be more apt to occur (except in the garage near the end, but by then disbelief has hopefully been fully suspended anyway.) Everything about the film is beautifully thought out and appointed. The costumes are gloriously colorful (Chakiris' purple shirt is unforgettable, as is Wood's final red dress), the choreography is stellar and impossibly difficult and the music is downright epic with masters Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim at the helm. Wood has been unfairly maligned over the years for her performance. In fact, she is thoughtful, lovely and believable, even when singing to someone else's voice. Beymer also attempts to inject some heart into his role, but he's just a bit too bland and boy-next-door to really make an impact. His teeth are distractingly white and pronounced throughout as well. Oscars went to the showier roles of Chakiris (who does a great job, but in retrospect doesn't have all that much screen time!) and Moreno as his sassy, sexy girlfriend. Tamblyn gets to show off his acrobatic skills a time or two. Very few adult characters appear in the film, so that when they do, the distinction is noticeable. One highlight is the sparky, one-upmanship in "America", a huge improvement over the version in the play which featured only female performers. Though much of the singing is dubbed, the vocalists are so good and the film is so well-crafted, it scarcely matters. A favorite of many musical film fans, the timeless story of love amongst marked differences in culture and/or race resonates just as solidly now as when it was made. Several of the craftsmen would go on to work on the even more successful "The Sound of Music".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's better than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All right. I love this musical. As a long time pit rat, I have played it many times, and it is one of about ten or so that I will play any time I am asked. So why do I dislike (hate is a little too strong albeit close) this movie so much?Well maybe it's because West Side Story isn't really a musical, but a musical is what the filmmakers produced.The various elements involved in producing a theatrical work (music, dance, drama, etc.) are all so closely entwined in the West Side Story that I love, they really can't be separated. It's a ballet. It's a drama. It's an opera. Musical numbers appear so seamlessly that it can be hard to define exactly where they began. Musical numbers may morph into fantasy dance sequences with similar ambiguity, and it can all come back to spoken reality just as unexpectedly.The people that made this film wanted everything clearly defined, and it has the effect of a loud belch during a dramatic soliloquy. The flow of things is constantly interrupted. The dance starts here. The next song starts here. Here's where the dramatic scene begins. It's too bad really, because a successful stage production is tricky owing to the kinds of transitions that must be made. One would think that film would be a great medium to realize the kind subtlety the material demands. Sadly, a musical (i.e. a bunch of songs in between spoken drama) is what got made.A case in point: the song 'Somewhere'. On stage, this starts in Maria's room and goes through much before landing in a dream world where the song is sung by an offstage voice. The dream is finally consumed by the nightmare of the earlier rumble in which some important loved ones are killed. This interruption jolts them back into Maria's room where they must decide how to deal with the reality. In the movie, it is reduced to a sappy love song duet that is embarrassingly trite compared to the original ('cinematic' it always seemed to me) concept they dropped.That's not the only example of such ham-handedness in the film, but, to me, it is the most unforgivably stupid.This isn't to say there is nothing redeeming in the whole film. The source material is too good to lose all of its power just because a bunch of trolls laid their inept claws on it. I particularly liked Ned Glass as Doc. This movie could have been immeasurably better, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Audiences flocked to see this handsome screen-adaptation of the popular Broadway musical show about juvenile delinquents in New York City, battling each other for prominence on Manhattan's West Side. So many different, top-rank talents were involved in this production that it's really no surprise the end result seems awfully heavy, weighed down by unnecessary self-importance and a creaky "Romeo and Juliet"-styled plot that was a wheeze even in 1961. Two teenagers from disparate sides fall in love, but Natalie Wood is entirely inappropriate as a barrios Cinderella (she's encumbered by the heavy pancake make-up, the plastic conviction laid upon her character and the drowsy overdubbing/lip-syncing process on the musical numbers). The thin premise is belittled further by the presentation, so big and "new" and "bold" that it forgets to have a personal connection (between the characters on-screen and the audience). Still, it won 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (the overrated Robert Wise), Best Supporting Actor (the inert George Chakiris), Best Supporting Actress (Rita Moreno, who shows real spirit), and Best Cinematography (courtesy Daniel Fapp, and deservedly so, for his opening shots are still being copied). ** from ****</fullReview>

So let's begin.... A tale of the old immigrants taking offense to the new immigrants. This is the pulse of the story hampered by the Romeo and Juliet body and it's love sick symptoms. As iconic as it is, West Side Story has its shortcomings with 5 foot tall prancers trying to act tough with their "war counsels" and rumbles? Still can't get past The Broadway aspect of the storytelling through hammy performance is not my taste, but it has its entertaining moments, It's when the Puerto Ricans and Rita Moreno tell us their perspective that I feel connected to the experience. Misery loves company and so does a good sense of smart and sassy humor! The dance hall "Mambo" and roof top "I Love To Live In America" are some of the best movie dance scenes ever and the later's lyrics remain brilliant if not eternal!

When Riff's best friend Tony (Richard Beymer) and Bernardo's younger sister Maria (Natalie Wood) meet at a dance, they fall madly in love.These are the gayest gangs on the face of the earth. Let's face it. This is Broadway hoodlums. However they have Natalie Wood, Rita Moreno, and a couple of great songs. That's enough to make this a good musical. It is however a big disappointment that Natalie Wood didn't sing her own songs. I have to subtract a point for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before Baz Lurhman...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vibrant, colourful, dark and violent. West Side Story is as an important adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo And Juliet as Baz Luhrmann's 1996 version, which is as far as I'm concerned, one of the most accessible and coolest versions to date. But upon seeing this, the competition is now well and truly open.Though West Side Story is not strictly a Romeo And Juliet adaptation, it's a thinly veiled one, but with one significant difference. I won't say what it is, as even though this is now celebrating its 50th Anniversary, some may still not have seen this, as I hadn't until yesterday. As an adaptation, this is first rate, close in tone and structure but with a sharp, witty direction; new, colourful and very 60&#x2032;s.But it's as a musical that this film demonstrates it true weight, with some of cinema's greatest numbers, executed with the same innovative direction, large wide-screen staging and cinematography on a scale that made what I believe, to be true golden era of screen musicals, what it was. It looks staged, but what a stage!The story is as important as the songs and the songs represent the characters more than some of the 1940&#x2032;s so-called Golden Era ever did. At the heart of this was Rodgers and Hammerstein but this off to one side, being co-directed by the man who ten years earlier, pushed a completely different genre, Science Fiction, into the more intellectual direction with The Day The Earth Stood Still, and would later bring us the Sound Of Music, and the love it or hate it, Star Trek: The Motion Picture.But its innovations begin with the film's opening. The Overture builds to the opening of the film, seamlessly, with the multicoloured animation sequence culminating with the building the streets of New York, and landing in the middle of the slums where the gang action begins.Greese owes a huge debt to this film, with its adult casting of teenagers and balletic dance numbers as a way of interpreting gangs. But this is not Greese. This is darker, harder and more violent, as were Greese is more sexual in nature. But both are enjoyable to watch with large-scale choreography and a real sense of the nature of dance and the physical skills and stamina required to perform it.Winner of 10 Academy Awards, this was the most well received musical in film history by the A.M.P.A.S., and certainly not without good reason. But is this the greatest musical of all time as many would argue? Not in my opinion but it is certainly one of the best but it's all very subjective. This had some of the best songs and dance performances that I have ever seen, with memorable tune after tune.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My First Musical Review!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say at outset that musicals aren't really my thing. Too artificial for me. That accusation could be levelled at just about any Sci Fi film of course, but we're all different! A year or so ago I told myself to watch some musicals to see if I could love them (at the age of 47!), and have since seen Cabaret (loved it), the Sound of Music (very good) and Singin' In The Rain (fantastic), so hopes were high for WSS. It gets off to a belting start with the mysterious graphic ("what is it?!!) and has some great moments. The photography and sets are first class, some of the music &amp; dance scenes have terrific energy and vibrance. For a film "of its time" it is a great period piece and tells us of the emergence of rebellious youth who don't anymore quake in their boots when the police arrive on the scene. So, why the 5 stars? For me there are just too many songs. The 3 musicals mentioned above felt like a film with a few songs; WSS felt like song &amp; dance with a film tacked on the side. As the titles rolled, my Mrs said "What a sad ending" but I hadn't felt it at all. I'd seen "Everybody's Fine" the night before and that is sad towards the end, but not this. The reason is that apart from Natalie Wood's character I just couldn't relate to any of the characters as they felt so artificial to me. Anybody that breaks into song in even the most traumatic of situations feels remote to me, so much so that I couldn't really care what became of them. Anyway, WSS gets a score of 7.7 on IMDb (at time of writing in Sept '11) so I'm clearly in the minority! I'm glad I've seen it &amp; I can imagine for the musical lover it is a must-see. For me I've seen it, glad I've ticked it off but won't watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Love to Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a musical film by director Jerome Robbins, who saw the opportunity to re-write a modern version of Romeo and Juliet play. But, to my opinion he fell short. If William Shakespeare ever saw this version he will be greatly disappointed with it. The lyrics, vocals, and the acting are incredibly poor. Mr. Robbins used the streets of the West side New York and their gangs, plus the fresh love between Maria, a Spanish Puerto Rican girl, who just moved into America played by the actress Natalie Wood and Tony an Italian boy play by the actor Richard Beymer to create the plot of this film. West Side Story does not remain true to THE END of its Shakespearean version, when Romeo and Juliet died. I cannot say that the film is bad, but I would just like to state that this film is not as equivalent as the amazing story of Romeo and Juliet, Just because it involves the ill-fated love affair between a young man and woman who in this case are racially prejudiced by the members of the gang and their family. Additionally, West Side Story asks their audience to believe that these groups of adults are teenagers, despite the fact that they're all somewhere around 30 years old. But, not all is a down fall in West Side Story. This film had some funny scenes, songs, and a lot of well done dance performances to enjoy. Also, this motion picture is shown exceptionally well the sad reality of the gangs and the deadly consequences of their actions. In addition, the ethnic tensions between the Puerto Rican (the Sharks) and the Anglo-Irish-Italian (the Jets) trying to out-macho one another sadly reflects our society's racial bias. If, this is the kind of subject that captures your attention, I will absolutely recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bernstein is perfect!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I'm a sports nut. Having said that imagine a minor league pitcher with good stuff throwing a one-hitter in his first plate appearance in the bigs. His career gets a little spotty for a few years, his ERA goes up a bit, and then his team makes the World Series.He's sent to the mound three games in a seven game series and proceeds to throw three perfect games. I can't even imagine what that must feel like. The entire rest of your career becomes irrelevant because you know that you'll never be able to duplicate what you just did, ever again!Perhaps that what Leonard Bernstein felt. "On the Town" was a good start but after he penned "West Side Story" Bernstein could have quit had he wanted to. Einstein had his Theory of Relativity, Hawking had his "Brief History of Time", and Bernstein had:"Jet Song", "Something's Coming", "Maria", "America", "Tonight", "Gee, Officer Krupke!", "I Feel Pretty", "One Hand, One Heart", "Quintet", "Somewhere", "Cool", "A Boy Like That/I Have a Love", Even the score behind the closing credits made you annoyed at anyone leaving the theater while it was still playing.I'm in no way denigrating the rest of Mr. Bernstein's body of work or, for that matter, good performances by Wood, Moreno, Neymer, Tamblyn, and Chakiris. I particularly enjoyed Simon Oakland as Lieutenant Schrank.But they're all Stockton and Malone, Barkley and Ewing, standing in Michael's shadow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undoubtedly the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason this movie gets 9/10 instead of 10/10 is because of Beymer's casting as Tony. He is the only weak link in this superlative musical.He just does not cut it as a tough ex-gang member. Everyone else is so perfectly cast its not true! Tamblyn is just great - athletic and balletic at the same time. Chakiris is spot on as Bernardo and Rita Moreno gives the best performance of her life in WSS. The direction, the music(oh the music!!) and the genius lyrics just could not have been better. I saw this as a kid in the 60's and have seen it dozens of times since. it still blows me away. Particular highlights are the "America" number, "Gee Officer Krupke" and "the Rumble" sequence. What never ceases to amaze me is how relevant it still is. Fashions aside and the editing of "bad" language aside it still makes its point 50 years on against a continuing background of gang and racial violence. What else does it so well? it ought to be compulsory viewing for all schoolchildren.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like A Bottle of Wine: West Side Story Ages With Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that when I first saw West Side Story, I didn't like it, but there are other movies that I didn't like when they first came out such as Gigi, but as the years roll by, these movies now are very entertaining. I believe that movies like West Side Story and Gigi were not really good for the time that they appeared. They are more for today than yesterday and will be much more appreciated for what there are in the future years to come. As far as casting goes, they could not have done a better job. The original cast on Broadway just could not have done it. There has been a lot of criticism about not casting Broadway Stars in the movie versions, but the Broadway Stars could not bring the American movie going public into the theaters to make the movie pay for itself. At first, Jack Warner was criticized for not casting Julie Andrews in the movie version of My Fairf Lady, but as Warner stated in his autobiography, nobody in Des Moines knew who Julie Andrews was, but they certainly knew who Audrey Hepburn was because the financial boom that was made off of her portrayal in The Nun Story proved that, and he was right in his casting her as Eliza even though most of her singing was dubbed by Marni Nixon. We will never know what My Fair Lady would have been like with the original soundtrack with Audrey Hepburn doing her own singing, but some of the songs were partially sung by Hepburn, but we do know that Marni Nixons voice was not suited for Audrey, but it was suited for Deborah Kerr in The King and I and definitely suited for Natalie Wood in West Side Story. Most of the singing for Anita was done by Rita Moreno for West Side Story, but only one song was dubbed and that was her duet with Maria for A Boy Like That. But as we know, dubbing is not a new thing in Hollywood. Rosalind Russell who can sing said in her autobiography that no matter what anyone says, that's Roz singing up there, but that's not entirely true. All of the songs were sung by Russell except for one. She just could not get Everythings Comin' Up Roses off the ground, so Warner hired Lisa Kirk to do the honors and for a hefty sum of moolah! But, back to West Side Story. First time around I hated this movie. Just couldn't stand it, but as the years roll by, now I see it as a great movie and a true work of art. The only flaw that I see is at the beginning of the movie when the boys start dancing while bouncing the basket ball. Still does't set well with me. Being an ex-dancer myself, it could have been done with less of a ballet-ish beginning. The guys look too much like sissy's that rough tough gang guys! But, thank God I can remember when it first came out and I saw it on the great big wide screen with stereophonic sound. This is the way movies like this should be seen. If you haven't seen it that way, you have never seen the glory of West Side Story. When I was in the Army, I went to Paris, France, and the Parisians wouldn't let it go. It was still playing at one of their theaters for three years running. Now, that proves that that West Side Story is one of the greatest movie musicals ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Musical Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WEST SIDE STORY is the 1961 film version of the landmark 1955 Broadway musical that updated Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET to the turbulent urban gang scene of Manhattan's west side that follows the romance between Puerto Rican Maria (Natalie Wood) and Polish Tony (Richard), which is framed against the battles between two rival gangs in the neighborhood, the Puerto Rican sharks and the Caucasian Jets, who are in constant, dangerous conflict over absolute rule over a small area of a west side neighborhood. Co-directors Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins have constructed a nearly perfect musical here, which offers everything Broadway fans want from a musical and also offers a meaty story that could appeal to non-musical fans as well. The score, by Leonard Bernstein (music) and Stephen Sondheim (lyrics) has almost become part of musical folklore: "Tonight","America","I Feel Pretty","Somewhere", "One Hand, One Heart", almost all of which have become individual classics in their own right and each is an integral part of the story that helps to flesh out characters and advance plot. The cast is first rate, despite the fact that none of the leads do their own singing. Natalie Wood still makes a lovely Maria (singing dubbed by Marni Nixon)and Rita Moreno and George Chakiris light up the screen in their Oscar winning supporting turns as Anita and Bernardo, Maria's best friend and brother, who is leader of the Sharks. Russ Tamblyn is athletic and charismatic as Riff, the Jets' leader and Tony's best friend. Richard Beymer is a little too limp-wristed as Tony, but his singing is superbly dubbed by Jimmy Bryant. But the real star of this film is the dance. Never before was the art of dance used to such brilliant effect to advance the plot of a story. The entire opening of the film, introducing the conflict between the Jets and Sharks is done completely in dance and perfectly conveys the tension between the two gangs. Co-director and choreographer Jerome Robbins has mounted some of the most amazing dancing ever seen on the silver screen. The opening, as well as the dance at the gym, "America" and "Cool" are absolutely dazzling dance numbers. This film swept the '61 Oscars, winning 10 awards, including Best Picture. No musical had ever won that many Oscars and it is doubtful that it will ever happen again. A once in a lifetime motion picture experience that all film buffs, especially musical buffs, should study and cherish and revel in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an education in everything: music, dance, cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>just watched it again today thanks to retroplex, and that makes my 60th (?) viewing since i first saw it as a 10-y-o in NYC in 1962. i agree with the featured reviewer, it needs to be heard at loud volume. almost everything in this film is extraordinary and was ground-breaking in its day: the Bernstein score and (whose???) lyrics, the Jerome Robbins choreography, the cinematography... not to mention the exploration of cultural differences which, at 10, i barely grasped but was seriously intrigued by.i had the record and know every note, lyric, and piece of dialogue by now. while it usually cheers me up (TCM shows it often enough), today i found myself weeping in the early part, 30 minutes in, where Bernstein so brilliantly uses the increasingly insistent xylophones to emphasize the growing frantic tension. i wept because i realized how much repeated listening and watching has taught me about music and dance, not to mention different cultures--the Jets were as foreign to me as the Sharks.it's intriguing to watch Eliot Feld, aka Baby John, who was not the best dancer in the group, but who went on to form his own ballet company, and the only minor cast member who achieved any success; all i can guess is that he became a protégé of Robbins... moreover, it is so clear that Michael Jackson stole, (or took inspiration from,) a number of scenes, for his videos. and not much became of many of the major stars; not Russ Tamblyn and Natalie Wood, but where did Richard Beymer vanish to? and Geo Chakiris didn't live up to his potential in the film.this is only the second time i've rated a film at 9. as with the Australian reviewer, i am a huge fan of musicals, but this is heads and tails above all others, incl. 42nd St. and Singin' in the Rain, because the music is so thoroughly integrated and the dancing is so remarkable.must admit: i no longer have patience for the sappy stuff like "Maria" and the first "Tonight." but John Astin's goofy role at the dance, Chita Rivera's stunning performances, and "Officer Krupke" allow me to forgive any and all few flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review - School work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The West Side Story" is an American musical, screen-version produced in 1961 by 'Metro Goldwyn Meier', remains an outstanding example of movie musical even now. The movie's success can be explained by the spectacular cooperation of the masters, the creators of the 20th century musical ? Leonard Bernstein (music), Arthur Laurents (book), Stephen Sondheim (lyrics), Jerome Robbins (production, choreography, direction) and self-sacrificing, inspiriting and ideal work of the actors, which managed to create unforgettable characters: Natalie Woods (who played Maria) and Richard Beymer (who played Tony). "The West Side Story's" plot, in many ways, resembles the immortal comedy by William Shakespeare ? "Romeo and Juliet", with the exception that all the action is moved to the middle of the 20th century. The Montagues and Capulets become two street-gangs of New York: the pure-'American' Jets and the Puerto Rican Sharks, who fight for a small section in the west side of the 'Big Apple'. The modern Romeo and Juliet become Tony and Maria, and now not only the disputes between the families and blood-vengeance stand on the way of their happiness, but racial and ethnic barriers as well. Tony not only belongs to the Jets, he is a founder of them as well, while Maria's father and brother are the founders and leaders of the Sharks. The two lovers stand in front of a very hard choice ? either to betray their friends and family, or sacrifice their love. I will not reveal the rest of the plot, but if you a familiar with Shakespeare's 'Rome and Juliet' you can probably guess how the story will end.Simple, well-known story line is extensively compensated by brilliant, easily-remembered songs. There are several of these which should defiantly be not mentioned: 'Maria' (preformed by Tony; a beautiful solo, which narrates about the love from first sight), 'Tonight' (preformed by Tony and Maria, which became the theme of the whole musical) and 'America' (which is performed by the Shark Girls; has very catchy lyrics and Latin American tunes). Another contribution are the musical numbers ? they all have very interesting stage direction and 'inter-cooperation' of the songs, choreography and setting. To illustrate this, the following example can be used: 'Mambo and Cha-Cha' (this musical number is a fusion of 'American' and Puerto Rican melodies. The music is performed by the Orchestra, which manages to quickly 'get the mood' of the melodies which are apart from each other by beat and tempo. The dances are performed by the Jets and the Sharks ? this 'dance and musical contest' is a form of a 'duel' between the two rivaling gangs) and Gee, Officer Krupke (this song is performed by the Jets and it is a parody on the way Officer Krupke walks, talks, acts, types of orders and tasks he gives. The Jets, which got annoyed by his behavior, decide to make fun of the Officer and perform this light, comic song.) One other thing, which contributed to the uniqueness of this musical is the fact that most of the songs were performed by the actors themselves (one exception was some of Natalie Wood's vocals, which were dubbed by famous Marni Nixon ? her other works include duplication of Audrey Hepbern's vocals in "My Fair Lady" and Deborak Kerr in "The King and I"; the other exception were Richard Beymer's and Rita Moreno's vocals in the 'A Boy Like That'/'I Have A Love' duet ? they were dubbed by Jimmy Bryant and Betty Wand).This musical is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone ? if you have not yet watched it, then it is a great omission. I think that the best thing in "The West Side Story" is the music: an absolute balance, the bewitching 'courage' of it. All the slightly 'husky' atonality are matched up with a sweet melody; which change every second and grip you, not letting you 'move away from the screen'. The last time I watched "The West side Story", I played it very loud, and could say that I almost felt as if I was in Manhattan. After seeing the film, I went back to some of the songs, and for the rest of the day was either singing the tunes, either tapping them on the tables. "The West Side Story" won 10 Academy Awards ? including the Best Picture and the Best Director/s. A true classic musical of all time and a definite 'must-see'.</fullReview>

I noticed in the trivia section that Richard Chamberlain was one of the 'non-singing' actors that was considered for a part in the movie (I presume as 'Tony'). Well, Richard had/has a fantastic singing voice; which he proved in a couple of Dr. Kildare episodes and in his 2nd movie "Joy In The Morning". He even had a couple of great-selling LPs. I don't think they would of had to dubbed his vocals by anyone else. Also, this is the first I heard that Elvis was once considered for the part of Tony. Wow, that would of been something. I think Elvis would of pulled it off fantastically.(And of course, no dubbing would of been necessary!) Elvis was also Barbra Streisand's first choice to star with her in the remake of 'A Star Is Born'; but greedy Col. Parker wanted too much money (in which he would of received 50%)for Elvis.</fullReview>

In 2001 I attended the 40th. anniversary of West Side Story at Radio City Music Hall. It was an nostalgic evening meeting with the cast and Mr. Wise again after so long a period. A little trivia concerning the film. Portraying the 3rd. policeman in the movie I was driving my own car. I was told it would be painted with water color to resemble a N.Y.P.D auto and afterward it would wash off. Unfortunately, it did not wash off and they had to repaint the car black again.

A more perfect movie doesn't exist. The combination of drama amazing music and heart pounding choreography makes this a movie going experience not to be missed. Natalie Wood was incredible and the voice matching of all the singers was impeccable. This is a movie that should be re-released on the big screen so new generations of movie goers can experience the movie the way that it was meant to be. It is one of the greatest American movies ever made and the best music ever written for a musical. There was one minor flaw that I never noticed before. The Jet member that had green paint poured on him from the sharks during the opening fight sequence cleaned up really quickly for the next scene where he and his clothes were clean as can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romeo And Juliet Take To The Streets In This Musical Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With 21 pages of comments on IMDb, there isn't really much that hasn't been said about 'West Side Story'. It's an exhilarating film experience, flawed, yes, but otherwise fabulous.The film is daring in it's approach. From the time the credits roll and we see the slowly changing colour sequence backed up only by the musical score, we know we are in for a different kind of musical. It is one in where tough street hoods can inexplicably move like ballet dancers. It is one in which fighting and violence is more like poetry than anything else. It is one musical where we don't get our requisite happy ending.Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer star as the modern-day Romeo and Juliet characters of the piece, Maria and Tony. One has to suspend belief when viewing Wood as a Puerto Rican. She's been coloured up by make-up, and tries on an accent for size, yet her All-American girl next door quality cannot be hidden. Still, she turns in a very good performance as the emotionally torn Maria. Her singing is dubbed, as is Beymer's, but it's her heart we care about most. Her and Tony meet and, as in Shakespeare's tale, it is love at first sight. The problem is, she's Puerto Rican and her brother is a member of the Shark street gang, and Tony is white and associates with the Jets. We know it will all end in tragedy, but that doesn't infringe on the enjoyable experience 'West Side Story' is.Technically, it's brilliant. The song and dance numbers are perfectly choreographed, and it's never anything but confident in it's approach. Perhaps a little too confident. Some of the sequences are frustratingly long and slow the action, and the film does drag considerably in places. The emotional impact of 'West Side Story' is never in doubt though. We feel for these lovers who cannot be together because of unnecessary racial boundaries. The film is even more poignant as the same racial boundaries, sadly, still exist today.Fine support is given by Russ Tamblyn, George Chakiris and Rita Moreno (the last two won Oscars for their performances). This is not the best musical ever made (IMO, 'Singin In The Rain' takes that lofty honour), but it is up there with the finest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't give 10's very often, but this movie deserves it! It's the classic Romeo and Juliet story in modern times (or at least modern for the time it was made!) It has the kind of music that you find yourself humming days after hearing them, but more than that, the background music evokes feelings that stay with you too.All of the acting, down to the last chorus dancer, was excellent, but Natalie Wood and Richard Breymer will just break your heart as Maria and Tony. Oh, and look for a young Rita Moreno as Anita! The sets are ingenious and gritty, without being dark. The costumes are designed to work with the legendary choreography of Jerome Robbins, but not feel out of place for the time period.The magic of this musical is that, although it is a period piece, the story, itself is timeless. Even though it is a tragedy and, technically it has a sad ending, somehow the viewer can't help but feel uplifted by it.There is NOTHING about this movie I would change, and I don't say that often!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the greatest musical I have ever seen in my life. It's about the racism between the whites and the Hispanics. It's amazing in so many ways. From the dancing and especially the singing. Cudos to Rita Moreno for the deserving Oscar she won. Rita Moreno is such a great dancer and a beautiful crier. Tony and Maria deserved it each other so much. The prejudice between the whites and Hispanics grew so highly that people get killed. It has a great meaning and beautiful music. I would watch this movie everyday just to hear "America". Oh and Tony was so gorgeous. I love this movie and I always will!10 stars for West Side Story</fullReview>

		<fullReview>west side story is an amazing movie. everyone - regardless of age - should see it. i loved it. i saw it when it first came out (way back when) and have watched it many times since. this movie has everything. it has beautiful music,dancing and humor. it's not really a violent or typical gang type movie. i especially liked all the dancing. i think everyone should own a copy and show it to their kids and/or grandkids. if you put aside all the gang conflict,the movie is fun. well i don't want to keep writing more or i'll end up giving something away. i had not intended to write 10 whole lines about it. hey, what more am i suppose to say - it's a great musical - it's well done - the singing ,dancing are beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>West Side Story vs Romeo and Juliet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie West Side Story, starring Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer about 'star-crossed lovers' from two different worlds, is a truthful and yet musical portrayal of life in New York. The story itself, is a dedicated and truthfully updated version of Shakespeare's play, Romeo and Juliet. The plot refrains from diverting the viewers mind from the original plot of Romeo and Juliet, staying within the bounds of the play's events and main ideas. The movie, grasping the audience with a combination of genres such as music, drama and romance, has managed to create an ideal understanding of Shakespeare's most famous work for the younger generation. The rival gangs, the Sharks and the Jets, show the troublesome relationship between the two families, the Montagues and the Capulets. The events and differences between the opposing two, guide (Romeo and Juliet)Maria and Tony towards their fated end. As Shakespeare wrote, 'my only love sprung from my only hate', showing that the stronger the conscious hate, the stronger the unconscious love. The final end of the movie, perfectly portrayed what might have happened to the Montagues and the Capulets, if either one of Romeo and Juliet had lived. Their hate would have been distinguished and there would be a realisation of what their actions and judgemental thoughts have done to those surrounding them. Though, this was achieved in the play, by both character's deaths. The very fact that Maria did not die and lived to show the world how its hatred and deception tore her from her lover, just goes to show how magnificent this film really is. Although not dedicating it's entire plot to the truth that was Romeo and Juliet, it has managed to captivate audiences worldwide with it's clever and colourful look at humanity. All in all, no matter the similarities or differences between the film, West Side Story, and the play, Romeo and Juliet, the fact remains that both are exquisite and as intriguing as the other. There really is no competition between the two. As a matter of fact, there is no need to compete the two against each other as they both stand out on their own merits. Truly captivating and original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sondheim masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>anyone who is as obsessed with Broadway as i am has heard, and maybe even seen a few shows, of Steven Sondheim. He is the greatest composer/lyricist in the past thirty years with works such as Company, Merrily we roll along, West side Story, gypsy, and many others. Natalie wood has stared in both gypsy and west side story, as maria and gypsy rose lee. Even though she is fantastic, her Oscar nom was removed because she was dubbed, by the same person who dubbed my fair lady. This movie is one of the few plays that wasn't drastically changed to fit its movie, which coincides with its length of nearly three hours. not to mention that it won ten Oscars, which has only been surpassed by ben hur and titanic. West side story picked up an Oscar for the sensational Rita Moreno, Anita, who was also the first actress to win an Oscar, tony, grammy, and an emmy. As if this wasn't enough this movie has taken the classic tale of Romeo and Juliet and adapted it to model our own time. Alone this universal theme could have been placed any place at any time, but mixed with a genius score and dazzling choreography this is one movie that is worthy of new york.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movies ever made! great singing, dancing, plot and hot guys! what more could a girl ask for? Rita Moranis and Natalie Wood are phenomenal but it's really George Chakiris, Russ Tamblyn, and Richard Bellmer (or however you spell his name) that make this movie. their passion and talent just light up the screen, a must see for all movie lovers! songs like "tonight" and "maria" are romantic and "the tonight quintet" reminds you how serious this is. it's Romeo and Juliet in the 1950s and "cool" is an excellent example of this while "Officer Krupke" just makes you die laughing. if you like musicals and love stories and war stories, this is your movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best adapted Broadway musical ever made!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that the above statement covers a lot of glorious musicals (Oliver, Sound of Music, Oklahoma, The King and I, etc.), but the story, the score, lyrics, and that wonderful Jerome Robbins choreography put this film at the top. It also doesn't hurt that the many messages in the movie (race relations, love, generational issues), all still apply today.The performances(although many of them have dubbed singing voices), are all first rate. In particular, Russ Tamblyn, Rita Moreno and George Chakiris. They bring a driving, intense energy to their roles, and all of their dancing is breathtaking.Special kudos also go to co-director Robert Wise, who came to the project after Jerome Robbins was fired for running over budget.In my personal list of the 50 best movies ever made, there are only four musicals. "An American in Paris", "Singin' in the Rain", "The Band Wagon", and "West Side Story". This one is my favorite. It's perfect.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tour de force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Giving this film the title 'musical' is almost demeaning. The score, choreography and emotion displayed are second to none - they have created a genre busting experience. At once exuberant and graceful, dramatic and poignant it is a film I can watch over and over again, despite the valiantly remastered but ultimately disappointing sound on DVD. Even if you don't normally get on with musicals, I urge anyone to try it, this has great dancing and the best music you will find anywhere. Outdated? It was made in the early 1960's so what would you expect? And yet, if you look beneath the surface, you will see the same issues today, poverty breeding conflict, gang warfare, and of course, love. The real star of this film though, is the music. Compared to other musical films, it's in another class!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just seen "West Side Story" again. For the seventh time to be accurate !Of course, when I sat down in front of the screen I told myself I should not be surprised if I was a little letdown as the film would certainly have lost some of its edge. Only natural when -like me- you know the slightest details of its plot like the back of your hand.Well, I was wrong. And all the happier for that. As a matter of fact, Robbins and Wise's masterpiece once again interested me - made me laugh - caused me to sob - moved me - thrilled me - upset me -resonated and vibrated in me. Quite an amazing phenomenon for sure. That's why I started wondering what had made this prodigy possible. And here is the result of these interrogations ( although I am not at all certain that RATIONALES can faithfully translate EMOTIONS ) : - The social comment is at the same time relevant, witty and still valid today. As an English teacher I regularly use "America" and "Gee, officer Krupke" as documents for the class and no student has ever complained about them being outdated. - The musical numbers are brilliant, original, wonderfully filmed and danced. - the score constitutes a powerful mix of rock and classical music and although the tunes are very familiar to your ears, you still note the modernity of the arrangements, the subtlety of the orchestration and the catchy rhythm of most songs. - the settings are slightly stylized, which makes them more timeless and meaningful. Drab greys and Aggressive reds vie to win the rumble ! - the editing is absolutely sensational : I had never forgotten Bernardo's fist hitting a blood red brick wall underscored by a sudden accent of music and I experienced the same physical shock this time around. - Riff and Bernardo are superbly portrayed by Tamblyn and Chakiris : why on earth didn't they become stars ?My only disappointment ( but is perfection of this world? ) is the choice of Richard Beymer. Not that he is a bad actor. It is only a matter of physical appearance. He looks too clean, too much of "the-right-guy-next-door-you-would-love-your-daughter-to-marry" to be credible as a former bad boy.Whatever the case may be, I am ready for the eighth screening and I am not afraid at the prospect any more !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is still one of the classic love stories of all time. This film probably would still be a classic even without the music and done as a straight romantic drama. The story itself is what drives the film. It basically is a story about racism and how hatred drives various races apart. Natalie Wood gives a wonderful performance, but the fact that her voice had been dubbed was what kept her from getting recognized at Oscar time. However, the only negative thing I have to say about this film is the length. Today, most audiences have attention spans that only last for maybe an hour and a half to two hours at the time. The fact that this film clocks in at nearly three hours might be a turn off to younger audiences.Another thing worth mentioning is the fact that many people have complained over the years that this film seems to romanticize street gangs. If you look past the gang aspect of this film, you will see it for the wonderful story it is.</fullReview>

And it's the best version there is.The Jets and the Sharks are rival street gangs in New York City. They battle for territory and respect. But one day the former Jets leader, Tony, falls in love with the sister of the Sharks' leader, Maria.What will happen when these two gangs find out about this little romance? You'll have to see the move to find out. And you should see the movie. It's one of the greatest musicals ever made. And one of the greatest movies ever made.You've all seen or heard about Romeo &amp; Juliet, but you haven't seen it like this. And once you see it, you'll wonder why they don't make movies like this anymore. Musicals are a great genre, and this film proves how great it is.It won ten Academy Awards, including Picture, Director, Supporting Actor (George Chakiris), Supporting Actress (Rita Moreno), Art-Direction, Cinematography, Costume Design, Editing, Score, and Sound. It only lost the award for Best Adapted Screenplay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best and most influential musical of all time! (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SPOILERS) Where can I possibly begin? West Side Story is an absolute classic! It is also one of the most influential movies/musicals of all time. How many musicals have won 10 Academy Awards? It has a wonderful mix of dancing and music, and the acting was perfect. It is a Romeo and Juliet type story, set in New York City in the 50s (Even though the movie was made in the 60s). There are two gangs (At least that we know of): The Jets and The Sharks. The Jets are white American boys, and the Sharks are all Puerto Rican. You can't really say that the Jets are the heroes, though; they hate the Sharks because of their race, and that's why the Sharks hate them, so there really are no bad guys in this movie. Riff (Russ Tamblyn) is the leader of the Jets, and Bernardo (George Chakiris, in an Oscar winning performance) is the leader of the Sharks. One day the Jets decide that they have had enough of the Sharks, and want to challenge them to a rumble. Riff knows that they need former Jet Tony (Richard Beymer) to help them out, but Tony has a job at the candy store, and doesn't really want to be in the gang anymore. However, he agrees to go to a dance that night at the gym. Bernardo is there with his girlfriend Anita (Rita Moreno, who also got an Oscar for her performance), as well as his gang. Of course the Jets are all there with their girlfriends, and the two gangs have a dance off. During the dance off, Tony spots Bernardo's sister Maria (Natalie Wood), and he is smitten. She too feels something for Tony. However, Tony does not know that Maria is is Bernardo's sister, and of course trouble erupts. Tony and Maria try to see each other as often as they can, but are forbidden to by their families. A few hours before the rumble, Maria learns of it, and asks Tony to help the Jets and Sharks stop it. Tony tries to do so, but Bernardo and Riff keep fighting. They each pull out switchblades, and Riff is killed by Bernardo. Bernardo just stands there, shocked at what he has done. Outraged, Tony grabs Riff's blade, and kills Bernardo, causing both gangs to fight with each other. The cops come, and everyone escapes. Maria waits at her home for Tony, only to have Bernardo's best friend and sidekick Chino (Jose De Vega) tell her that Tony murdered her brother. When Tony shows up, Maria yells at beats at him, only to fall into his arms and embrace him. When they hear Anita coming in, Tony escapes out of the window, but Anita sees him running, and tells Maria that a boy who kills can have no feelings. Realizing that Maria and Tony are in love, Anita goes to Doc's candy store to tell Tony that Chino is now after him with a gun, but is abused by the Jets. Furious, she tells them to tell Tony that a jealous Chino shot Maria and killed her. When Tony hears about this, he runs through the streets yelling "Come and get me too, Chino!" He is about to give up, when he sees Maria running towards him. Overjoyed, he runs too her, but they are both too late. Chino has seen them, and he fires his gun, shooting Tony in the stomach. Both gangs here the shots, and run to the playground, only too see Tony dying in Maria's arms. She tells them all that they kill each other not with weapons, but with hate. They all realize that she is right, and members of the Jets and Sharks carry Tony's body away with the police. Maria finally stands, and walks away, knowing that she will be strong and live through the pain. Not only is this entertaining movie a masterpiece, it is also very moving. If you haven't seen this movie, you have to go out as soon as possible and rent it! You will not be disappointed! 10/10.</fullReview>

This question will dog me for a long time. The tagline reads "The Screen Achieves One of the Great Entertainments in the History of Motion Pictures" but I can't find anything in the film itself to back this up.

		<fullReview>Move over, "Singing in the Rain." "Moulin Rouge!" is but a cheap and gaudy shadow."West Side Story" is truly the most amazing movie ever made. Plot, characters, cinematography...perfect. Critiquing these would be like critiquing the chord structure of a Beethoven symphony.Speaking of symphonies, have you heard the music to this picture? It's gorgeous! I am a fan of John Williams, but he is no Leonard Bernstein.I just saw this movie on the big screen in 35mm for the very first time (I was not born yet when it was originally released). I have seen a lot of films on the big screen, but no modern film compares.For one thing, all the actors had *talent* back then. It's really them singing, dancing, acting, and even climbing over walls and making it look like ballet. Such facility...they must have rehearsed forever!In a modern film, they wouldn't bother...they'd have dancing doubles do the feet, singing doubles (and electronics) do the voices, and have cheap cuts and angle shots so you wouldn't notice as much. Here they focus on the actors and their abilities; cuts are sparing, and everything is genuine and rings true.Such amazing choreography can't be seen on the stage. The film media is used to the utmost to create a spectacular effect.If you ever have the opportunity to see this movie on film, in a theater, jump! You will be reminded that movie masterpieces can and have been made.</fullReview>

My feeling is that someone out there in internet world can articulate their views about these films better than moi. However, with "West Side Story," I figure that having detested musicals for so long this one is worht commenting on- the same way "Billy the Kid vs. Dracula" would be, if I were lucky to see it. Robert Wise was, contrary to what film historian David Thomson said, a very apt director. "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is one of the best sci-fi films ever made, and this is one of the best musicals. With "West Side," he created a lively production with an interesting story line and none of the sappy "My Fair" saccrine which has made a lot of us refrain from sitting through many films of this genre. Along with "Cabaret," "Singin in the Rain" and perhaps "Oliver" or even "A Fiddler on the Roof," this is one of the best musicals ever.</fullReview>

It was made over 40 years ago and it still hasn't gotten old. The people involved in production were experts and it definitely shows.Now, vote an excellent 10 for West Side Story and get it in the Top 250. If you don't, you're just like Officer Krupke.

It is a timeless classic and other's today should be made like this. I am a huge musical fan and the ones from the 50's and 60's were better than any of the others I've seen. I think the entertainment industry ought to look back and get a clue. This had great songs and dances, and sure seeing some tough "buddy-boy" gangs doing ballet in the streets may sound funny but it was done with such pizzazz flair that they were able to pull it off. This is a classic, and that's only one of the reasons that it won THE BEST PICTURE OSCAR in 1961. This movie will forever live on in the lives of everyone young and old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A milestone achievement in entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's still one of the most watchable flicks nowdays, and easily transcends generations and really is a vibrant experience but in the tradition of Romeo And Juliet it is in one respect a let down.In R&amp;J the gangs were not the central piece of the story, it was the relationship, and it brought resentment about the rivalry. In this the hirachys and whole ego complex around the gangs is so fun that it is more a glorification of it than an instrument to demote it. Riff and his lieutenant, his best friend who brought victory for them against past gangs, this is a fable surrounding Tony, the Romeo of the situation, he is a god in the gang and they talk about the emeralds and the Jets' history in the town and traditions around organised warfare, none of that was in R&amp;J it was just two families but it serves two purposes for this movie. One, it shows how far Maria brings Tony from the way he used to be, and it humanises the jets as a whole.If it did not have those fun elements it would not be half the movie it is however, that be, an entertainment fest. The dance choreography is superb and the music unforgetable, the acrobatic fight scenes are also a pleasure to watch, and the finger clickin walk is recognised by many a person.Few would have thought it possible to create a base formula for remakes from a remake but there has been many a movie since using the R&amp;J formula with the West Side Story variations.This is a milestone achievement, be sure to see it in the best form possible.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every one knows about the problems that this film had, the miscasting of Natalie Wood (for many reasons), Richard Beymer, and Russ Tamblyn, the split that the two directors (Wise and Robbins) had during filming, and the lip-synching. Despite, all these flaws, this is still a brilliant film. The music, the dancing, the engaging performances, it all comes together in this modern rendition of "Romeo And Juliet". The scene where Maria and Tony first meet at the dance, where the "I saw her through the crowd" cliche was created, is my favorite scene, you can see the two falling in love at first sight. Oscar winners Rita Moreno and George Chakiris are brilliant. I sure hope this ends up being the only version of this play turned into a film, with the success of Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin, they might decide to do their own version someday, and nobody wants to see 31-year old Jennifer try and convince audiences that she's 16, despite her alleged ability to sing, dance, and act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The electrifying part is the Jerome Robbins choreography, especially in the famous opening scene, the school dance, and the "Play It Cool" number. Always with a snap of the fingers, a whistle, and a strut. The exciting part is the various rumbles and the action before and after. The stunning part, of course, is the finale, which still has the power to rip the breath from your body, even if you know it's coming. Oh, there are flaws, (Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer are beautiful but a trifle wooden and unconvincingly dubbed, and you wonder how so much can happen in a day), but they're pretty much made up for by the beautiful Bernstein/Sondheim melodies and the generally excellent screenplay, adapted from Artur Laurents' stage book. My favorite songs: the aforementioned "Play It Cool," "Tonight," "I Feel Pretty," in which Wood glows, and "When You're a Jet, You're a Jet All the Way." My favorite scenes: Those containing these songs, and the scene in which Maria and Tony meet each other's "dummy" parents and pretend to get married. In this scene, all is forgiven and you really feel for these people. Then, there's the final scene.One last note: The songs "America" (which surprisingly lacked the energy I thought it would have), and "Gee, Officer Krumpke" make interesting commentary on the conditions the respective gangs live in. Who knew a 1950s musical could do that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too few good songs to compensate for tonal tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The flamboyant choreography and unapologetic corniness of a classic movie musical is usually a delight, if you like that sort of thing. I very much do, but I can't help but find the approach ill-suited to a supposedly very serious story about street gangs and teenage angst. There is no winking in the self-important posturing of "West Side Story"'s Jets and the Sharks, or in its weepy, overwrought Romeo and Juliet plot. The drama seems to ask to be taken seriously, but it is hard to oblige when the street toughs click their heels, snap their fingers in unison, and spout forth bowdlerized epithets like "Krup you!" A collection of great songs would easily make up for tonal clashes, but sadly only a couple of the tunes are worth hearing. "America" is the highlight, a creative and catchy commentary on the different meanings of life in the U.S. for female and male Latin American immigrants.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the best musical ever made. It is fantastic!!! It is loosely based on Romeo and Juliet, but it means that west Side Story had an inspiration, and it is told movingly and powerfully. Right from minute one I knew we were going to be in for a treat. The prologue was brilliantly staged, as was the rumble, which I found a bit disturbing to be honest! Quintet was thrilling also. Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood are wonderful as the two lovers, Wood is very heartfelt and Marni Nixon's singing for her is the very definition of angelic, as is Russ Tamblyn as a very energetic Riff. George Chakiris is also good as Bernado, though I would have given the Best Supporting Actor Oscar to Tamblyn, but it is Rita Moreno as fiery Anita who impressed most, easily one of the best supporting turns of any musical. The songs are fantastic, one of those musicals where every song works, some are funny; "America"(amazing choreography) and "Officer Krupkee" and some heart rending ones; "Tonight" "One Hand One Heart" and "Somewhere". The choreography was enough to have you on the edge of your seat. Everything is right about this movie, and I am shocked it isn't in the top 250, because it should be for it is one of the greatest film musicals! 10/10 without question! Bethany Cox</fullReview>

The message contained in the Song, SOMEWHERE is something everyone could learn from. One of the most Oscar honored films of all time. Beautiful and passionate updating of the Romeo and Juliet classic. Should be required viewing for all people. The only negative in my opinion is the dubbed singing (someone else's voice). Highly acclaimed film for many reasons. Filmed on location in New York City, the film captures big city life with all of its benefits and problems. Clearly deserved the 10 Academy Awards it won. Only a few movies have won more Oscars than West Side Story. Natalie Wood is radiant as Maria.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Unusual Musical: a Dance Adventure cum Love Story; Exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very strange film from a very unstrange theatrical work. Everyone knows how "Romeo and Juliet", a well-written but Medievally gloomy Shakespearean tragedy, was adapted for "West Side Story". The locale was moved from Northern Italy to New York City; the Montagues' and Capulets' servants and relatives were transformed into Euro-Ethnic Versus Puerto Rican youth gangs; and Romeo and Juliet became Tony and Maria. The basic premise probably seems interesting; the original play stressed the baselessness of the quarrel, the hot-blooded youth of the participants and the swiftness with which attachments were formed. In the play, also, a strong injunction was put onto the two sides in the "war" by authorities--and this is missing here. This I suggest is the dramatic key to why "Romeo and Juliet" is more violent than "West Side Story"--because to do what they do, the youth in Verona have to defy a strong edict. Lacking this, the rival gangs here only slowly escalate their quarrel to an artificial climax. The other odd element here is "dance"; the idea of stylizing human action as dance in a musical is one that has very seldom been tried. The fluid choreography by Jerome Robbins works well here for the most part; the use of real New York streets etc. permits a reality to play against--much as shadows may be thrown onto a prepared wall perfect for seeing them as outward shapes hinting at something more inward. The credit for the film's pace and power go to Ernest Lehman, Jerome Robbins and Arthur Laurents for the adaptation of the original play; to Robert Wise and Robbins for the direction; to Irene Sharaff for her costumes and Daniel L. Fapp for luminous cinematography. Among the huge, largely spear-carriers or dancers participating cast, acting honors go to Rita Moreno, Simon Oakland, William Bramley, Ned Glass Natalie Wood, and Susan Oaks as "Anybodys"; Russ Tamblyn and George Chakiris do well; no one else is particularly good except Tony Mordente. But they do not have to be; they are playing young people, meaning they need intelligence, energy and purpose, and these are supplied by all concerned in abundant measure. Songs such as "Tonight", "Somewhere", "The Jets' Ballet", "Maria", "America", "I Feel Pretty", "Your Love is Your Love"and others have become famous; and the film won many nominations. It is innovative in many ways, engrossing, captivating, and occasionally not-too-well-acted. But the essence of the film is motion, I assert, and seldom has movement been used so effectively in any film in my judgment. A+ for effort is the least one can give any aspect of this unusual movie. The music by Leonard Bernstein carries the day, always interesting and never dull; and the lyrics by Stephen Sondheim are terrifically on target. This is a musical whose emotional appeal is perhaps very hard to resist.</fullReview>

The Maria in my school play was perfect for the part and her voice was so amazing that I can no longer be amazed at Marias' voice and acting the film. However, the portrayal was amazingly good for when it was made. The songs are catchy and it gives people a small bit of an understanding to Romeo and Juliet, as that is what it is based on. the costumes and settings are good and vibrant. I think it is better as a musical being performed live than watching it on video or DVD, but as musicals go, it is still fairly good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, let's get it out of the way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Natalie Wood is awful. Not just awful, but so relentlessly and completely awful she almost single-handedly ruins the picture. It had other problems, but her outrageous miscasting, her laughable attempts at a Puerto Rican "accent", her complete lack of chemistry with her supposed love interest, Richard Beymer, the fact that she was neither a singer nor a dancer but was given a part that required a lot of singing and dancing--neither of which she pulled off--were among the film's downsides. Richard Beymer's performance, however, is not nearly as bad as it's been made out to be. He plays Tony a bit more naive and somewhat goofier, maybe, than he should have, but compared to the acting jobs turned in by most of the other Jet "gang members", it wasn't bad at all. Much of the non-musical dialogue is insipid and painfully outdated even by 1961 standards, and other than Tony Mordente, the members of the Jets gang looked like exactly what they were--Broadway chorus boys. I realize this film isn't a documentary, and it was more important for the actors to be able to sing and dance than it was for them to actually *look* the parts they were playing--the Puerto Rican Sharks were a bit more authentic-looking, which was odd because the two main actors in that gang, George Chakiris (Bernardo) and Gus Trikonis (Indio), weren't Puerto Rican but Greek--but to tell the truth, the Jets were the sissiest looking and acting "gangbangers" I've ever seen. On the other hand, the supporting cast is actually pretty good--Simon Oakland as the gruff and racist Lt. Schrank, Ned Glass as Doc the candy store owner, John Astin as the doofus rec center director--but the "gangsters" themselves are just not very good actors. There are also several numbers where the songs aren't even remotely up to the level of the dancing that accompanies them ("Cool" comes to mind).That being said, there are several upsides to the film. The dancing is spectacular--especially in the terrific "America" number, which just explodes off the screen at you--and the "Dear Kindly Sergeant Krupke" routine is still hilarious, even if a bit forced. The film's main advantage, however, is Rita Moreno. She is absolutely volcanic and blows everyone off the screen whenever she's on it, whether she's dancing, singing or acting (her scene in the candy store where the Jets rough her up is especially chilling, and it's all entirely due to her). I think Rita was the first real glimpse Middle America got of how smart, funny, sultry and sexy a Latina actress could be--up until then Latinas were mostly caricatures such as Lupe Velez and Carmen Miranda--and in the numbers she was in, especially the "America" routine, you just couldn't keep your eyes off her. You could really feel the pain and anger in her voice when she sang the "Stick To Your Own Kind" number. She won the Oscar for this role, and few actresses deserved it more.All things considered, it's still a pretty good movie, although frankly much of it is quite dated and doesn't hold up particularly well. But the spectacular dancing, the infectious and beautiful music (especially "Maria") and the Romeo-and-Juliet story still work. Natalie Wood, who didn't belong in this movie at all, doesn't quite manage to sink it entirely, even though she comes close on occasion ("There's a Place for Us" comes across as a bad parody of the old Jeanette McDonald/Nelson Eddy movies where they sing into each other's faces and is hysterical in its awfulness). If you haven't seen it, it's definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

The actors voices also feels very modern, especially Russ Tamblyns. The love story is cute but never embarrassing. Though the most fascinating thing about "The West Side Story" is the smashing choreography. Everything, from dying to putting a fake gun back becomes a dance move, in a natural way. I'm not that much for dance really, but this is really good! The Movie gets kinda slow in the end, a bit TOO much dancing maybe?

		<shortDescription>Intense passion in the dance but none in the drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>West Side Story oscillates unevenly between two moods. One is riveting, bustling with an energy fueled by highly stylised movement and dance, but bottled by the great, imprisoning nature of the set design. The effect makes the successful dance numbers explosive, particularly 'Cool' and 'America'. The players thrust and throw their hands with abandon and defiance, their movements violent and impassioned. Where the film fails is in transporting this passion to the love story that forms the entire basis of the Romeo-and-Juliet plot. It's a forced and inauthentic affection, the flatness of which is only reinforced by a collection of feeble or just plain atrocious ballads (Maria, Tonight, and more). These shockingly poor tunes contribute to the blandness that besets the whole affair, further perpetuated by the blandest of leading men. Natalie Wood (who seems to old for the role) occasionally injects Maria with some wit and inner steel - most notably in the 'I Feel Pretty' sequence. For the most part, however, she cannot dispel the fundamental wetness of the role; she emits a sense of feminine helplessness that is most suggested in the insufferably 'angelic' nature of her singing. The lackluster scenes with the lovers drain the film from its full-bloodiness; it takes the spark of Rita Moreno and the other supporting characters (however amateurish the acting) to jolt the film back into life.There are some rousing, superlative dance sequences, but the fever they stir ultimately dissipates for the filmmakers to mechanically pump out the humdrum denouement to the contrived tragic trajectory of this, the soggiest of romances.5 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>song order</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think West Side Story is an excellent movie, but I cannot agree with those who like the change of the song order. Specifically, I cannot stomach the swap of "Cool" and "Officer Krupke." These numbers were placed where they were in the Broadway show for specific reasons. Swapping them takes them out of the context they were originally presented in, and thus changes their impact and meaning in relation to the show. I'm not a fan of the lyric changes, but I understand the reason (motion picture censors). And I'm not a huge fan of making "America" into a number with both the girls and boys of the Sharks, but I can live with these issues. Keeping the Robbins choreography was the correct move, and I don't think there's EVER been a better score than Bernstein's. I challenge anyone to find a Broadway score that comes anywhere near the caliber of Bernstein's music. It's not only the best Broadway score ever written, but it has some of the best American music ever written. Also, Sondheim's lyrics (when they weren't changed for the censors) are excellent, with the possible exception of "I Feel Pretty." Sondheim himself doesn't believe that it was his best effort, and I have to agree. The story is a great story, but this is a show to watch specifically for the choreography and the music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film version of the classic Broadway musical is hopelessly dated, but that's more a testament to how timely the material was than it is a criticism. Of course the image of gang violence portrayed here comes across as unbelievably quaint now, but compare this film musical to any other film musical of the time to see how gritty and different it probably seemed to audiences.Natalie Wood (pretty, but not a great actress) and Richard Beymer (terribly miscast) make no impression as young lovers Tony and Maria, but Rita Moreno, George Chakiris and Russ Tamblyn more than make up for any spark the leads fail to generate. Jerome Robbins' choreography remains intact and looks terrific on screen, and the score by Leonard Bernstein may be the best ever composed for the musical theatre.I really like the look of this picture. The off-kilter camera angles and stylized production design generate the feeling that everything is transpiring in a feverish dream world and retain the artificial feel of an imaginary world, while Wise's fluid direction and use of actual New York exteriors at the same time open up the movie and give it a distinctly cinematic feel. Wise had a knack for adapting stage musicals that other film directors sorely lacked.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A musical that people who don't normally like musicals like myself will like. I saw this in the theater as a kid a couple of years after it first came out since it kept playing around the country for a long time due to it's popularity. I've seen it several times on TV since but would like to see it on the big screen again now. Nominated for 11 Academy awards it won 10 including Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins and Best Supporting Actor for George Chakiris and Best Supporting Actress for Rita Moreno. It also took home Oscars for Best Cinematography for veteran cinematographer Daniel Frapp in the biggest film of his career, Best Art Direction, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, and Best Music Scoring for a Musical for Saul Chaplin, Johnny Green, Sid Ramin and Irwin Kostel. Only Ernest Lehman for his screenplay failed to win his nomination. Incredibly of all the great timeless standards that have emerged from West Side Story by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, none of them were nominated for best song for the 1961 Academy Award which saw Moon river win over Love Theme from El Cid, Bachelor in Paradise, Pocketfull of Miracles and Town without Pity. West Side Story was adapted from the Broadway musical by Arthur Laurents and Jerome Robbins which won two of it's six Tony Award nominations for 1958 for choreographer Jerome Robbins and Scenic Designer Oliver Smith. Robbins brought Smith with him to the film version as a consultant to the set design and he also brought to the film from the stage play co-choreographer Peter Gennaro and Howard Jeffrie and Wallace Siebert from the play's choreography team. Robbins detail on transposing the musical to film along with the skill of film maker Wise made this a classic but it's the excellent songs of Leonard Berstein and Stephen Sondheim and the masterful film scoring of their songs by the team of Chaplin, Green, Ramin and Kostel that gives this film the lifeblood that endures across the decades. Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer star in the lead roles with Chakiris, Moreno, Tamblyn among the support cast. Lot's of dance numbers from the sharks and the Jets. This, like it's number of Academy Awards deserves a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Musical for modern days based on Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer were insipid. George Chakiris, Rita Moreno and Russ Tamblyn were wonderful. Realistic, depressing sets. And oh, the dancing! Oh, the songs! Oh, the colors! You want to participate - you believe in the kids! You want to applaud! You want to dance with them! Sometimes you just want to turn it off and go to bed. Altogether a tearjerker (an age-old story) and an exciting, stimulating movie. The message will surely appeal to the young and the old. Some of the secondary characters were marvelously portrayed. This movie will make you feel better for having watched it, something that cannot often be said of movies today, especially musicals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more than a musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To call "West Side Story" a musical doesn't do justice to it. It represents a formidable achievement in cinema history.Based on "Romeo and Juliet", "WSS" tells the story of rival gangs in New York City's slums: the American Jets (I assume that they were ancestrally Italian, but they could have been Irish) and the Puerto Rican Sharks. Amid their constant fights, American handsome-boy Tony (Richard Beymer) and Puerto Rican beauty Maria (Natalie Wood) fall in love. Since their love is tacitly forbidden due to the hostility between their ethnic groups, Tony and Maria have to keep their relationship secret. But the continuous enmity between the gangs causes things to take a turn for the worst.The movie does have its flaws, mainly Natalie Wood's not-quite believable Puerto Rican accent. But overall, "WSS" is a great look not only at star-crossed love, but at the ethnic tension that exists even to this day.And there was that one woman in the movie who...I can't tell. Was she supposed to be a lesbian?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting vision of Shakespeare's well known play; set to music and built around dance routines. It is enjoyable to watch, but there is too much emphasis on the spirited choreography, leaving the film rather thin in terms of plot. There are indeed some memorable songs and some well choreographed sequences, but the film offers little else, or anything on a deeper level. One should note too that the first five minutes of the film are useless, but the whole overall product is certainly not ? it simply just is not a masterpiece. It became the first film with a dual direction to win the Best Director Oscar ? and to this day it is the only such winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A (slightly) dissenting opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching West Side Story for the first time and was left with mixed feelings. The dancing is excellent, some of the best ever filmed. The music is very good, although not the best ever. Since I am young and not familiar with the songs, I approached them fresh and found many of them flat. Certainly, Tonight and America are great songs, but many of the other ones, especially the love songs, grew tiresome. The acting by everyone but the leads was good; however, Natalie Wood is TERRIBLE. Rule #1: When casting a Puerta Rican, find a Puerta Rican. Tony is also a weak lead who, despite his physical presence, never is convincing as a former gang leader.That covers the good and some of the minor bad. After all, great films can overcome bad performances. However, this one does not. The love story couldn't possibly be any flatter. Since the leads are so wooden, the audience is left wondering why anyone would fall in love with them. Their dialogue is straight from a high school love letter, which one may argue is fine except we all wrote better letters than that, didn't we? Even worse is the film's overwrought violence. The ever-lingering threat of deadly violence mixed with the dream-like reality of the dance numbers creates a disturbing atmosphere. All of he whimsy and fantasy are wonderful. A whole new world is created and nurtured by the dancing. However, the violence is real, and the film never even tries to balance the blood with the light-as-air feel of the rest of the piece. I find it to be a distinctly American film, one that even in its creation of an alternate world must include hideous violence because a world without it is too foreign to be imagined. I also found many of the images to be dull. Yes, we know they are caught in cages, and no, I don't need to see another chain link fence. Yes, we know their Catholicism binds them, and no, we don't need to see another cross. The heavy-handed message that the older, prejudiced generation has wrought the violence falls flat too. Let's face it: the Jets are a bunch of cretins. Nothing is stopping them from doing what Tony does: fall in love and listen to his heart (I understand why they don't want the job). The Sharks strike me as quite a conservative bunch. In the end they just want to fit in, especially the women. One can see them sacrificing their culture in order to fit in. By trying to elicit sympathy for both, West Side Story leaves you feeling nothing for either. I believe it has much to do with Robert Wise's direction. He always was a sloppy director, and this film reeks of his touch at its worst moments. At least Robbins provides some wonderful dancing that ranks with the Red Shoes and Singin' In The Rain as some of the best ever put on film. In the end, West Side Story falls short of classic status by any criteria other than that of the fond memory.</fullReview>

I don't see whats so special about it', some say that the filming and the editing was great,who can notice that stuff when the acting and the whole idea of the movie is horrible.

		<fullReview>The first ten minutes are great - the opening sequence on the playground plays like some bizarre urban ballet....and then they move indoors. Most of this film was shot on soundstages, and the directors made no effort to make it look like anything other than what it was - a filmed play. Any effort at all to shoot outdoor scenes outdoors would have improved the film considerably. Instead, we're left with a film that hasn't a shred of realism. There's no chemistry between the leads (Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood) and one can't help but wonder how two people, acquainted for a mere 24 hours (and who have spent perhaps 15 minutes together in that time), could be so "in love." When she finds out that Beymer has just killed her brother, she dismisses it with hardly a comment. It reeks of phoniness. Most of the songs are OK, although I feel compelled to point out that "Officer Krupke" just may be the worst song ever written. The dialogue, in trying to sound hip, instead sounds forced, and probably sounded phony even in 1961. Finally, most of the Jets just don't seem like gang types. Imagine Wally and Beaver Cleaver as murderers and you have some concept of the Jets. All in all, a colossal misfire, and one of the Academy's Best Picture blunders of all time. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean, there's a fine line between over-the-top melodrama from back in those days and the level this film hits. Who knows, maybe musicals in that age really were this excessive, but these histrionics just don't do it for me. I think Grease is a better musical on pretty much every level. What this one lacks is that emotional connection between the two leads. Probably one of the most insufferable duos I've ever seen in any film, and that's not an exaggeration. Just so mind-numbingly dull. And that's another thing, the music just isn't good at all. I'm sure it has its fans and I'm sure people will jump on me for this (especially because it's an actual stage musical) but just not interesting or entertaining. Only very few songs were, and the worst were, of course, the ones revolving around the two leads. Did I mention they were insufferable? If you want an example, take a look at when Maria is informed about the rumble and instead of asking about her brother she asks about the guy she met just a day before. Am I just nitpicking now? Perhaps, but I have the right. Truly, the only shining spot among this atrocious mess is Rita Moreno. You just wish the film revolved around only her somewhere else, away from this predictable excuse for a film. She delivers her lines with the right amount of energy and spunk, and by the end of it she's the only one you really like. To call her a scene-stealer would be an understatement. She's the one reason not to give the film a complete failing grade, and she nails her final scene.I have only seen around one third of all Best Picture winners, but this is right there as the worst after Crash. To call it outdated is just not enough. Some of the choreography and Moreno and to a much lesser extent Chakiris are good, but everything else? The music, the characters, the singing (which, to top it off, many of them don't even do and you can tell) are all mind-numbingly dull and awful.</fullReview>

To attribute William Shakespeare's Romeo &amp; Juliet to this film is a disgrace to Mr. Shakespeare. I believe in 1961 this film would have made more sense as a concept, today however it's very dated. I really feel this movie would/should be considered a Kids movie. The movie and songs are very innocent and this a beautiful thing. Lets just say West Side Story "Jumped the Shark' a bit! Its sad that this piece of film is considered one of the great musicals... I prefer Mary Poppins or The Wizard of Oz any day. I just wish William Shakespeare's Masterpiece wasn't mentioned with this film.... as Hamlet says: O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all the visage wann'd, Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect, A broken voice, an' his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing, For Hecuba! What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her? What would he do Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have? He would drown the stage with tears, And cleave the general ear with horrid speech, Make mad the guilty, and appall the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and earI think that says it best, remember its just my opinion...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the number of us who actually remember the types of gangs portrayed in this movie dwindle, it's easy to dismiss it as outdated--even humorous. What one needs to do, however, is consider it on its own merits--some of the most sophisticated music ever written for a musical (Leonard Bernstein). The choreography, gang posturing in your face rhythms, the dancing is breathtaking. Again, nothing is as dated as slang, but, as with Shakespeare, it was the language of the time. Those of you who find it amusing, take a look at current slang 20 years from now. Performances are pretty good although I'll never understand how Richard Beymer was selected for such a major role (his filmography is pretty limited) especially since they dubbed in his singing. Natalie Wood works OK but it's hard to imagine her a Puerto Rican. The Latins generally outperform the Anglos, but they probably have more to be angry about as characters. There is great tension in the music. When I first got a record of this I listened to it so often I could recite every word of every song. It's a fine musical. And, of course, there's "Officer Krupke!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately the rest of it just doesn't hold up all that well. This is one of those "classics" that I eventually got around to watching after many years of ignoring it, and since it finally came up free on streaming I decided to give it a shot. I can easily imagine how seeing this live on stage performed by a talented cast would be a pretty incredible experience, but from my point of view the dance-fighting (or fight-dancing) didn't make much of an impact on the story? from a technical standpoint the moves were amazing, but it's hard to become emotionally invested in a brawl when the opponents are basically dancing with one another. I'm sure the audiences 50+ years ago saw it with completely different eyes, but today it just looks odd, not artistic.Aside from a couple of memorable numbers, the songs were average? surprisingly few of them were particularly hummable or would stick with you for long after exiting the theater. It was disappointing to learn that the two lead performers were both dubbed for singing.I agree with previous reviewers who thought that Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood had very little on-screen chemistry. The fact that the two characters fell in love at first sight didn't bother me; I accept that kind of thing in films, but the actors have to sell it, and these two failed to. I also agree that the lack of exterior sequences (after the very beginning) was a problem; it made the production look a bit bargain-basement and constantly called attention to the fact that it was a filmed version of a play.It was nice to see good old John Astin turn up, albeit briefly? I see that someone in the message boards has incorrectly identified him as Christopher Lloyd, and I can't quite see how one could confuse those two performers.Basically, anyone who likes musicals would do well to give this a try, with the understanding that it's showing its age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously I couldn't tell if the story being played out was supposed to be taken seriously or not. Although violence is not a big part in musicals, they could've done a bit better to make the fight scenes look real instead of the guys just dancing with each other. As cheesy as the script was, the actors do deserve an A for effort, they were definitely in shape and tried to sing well. It's very easy to pick out everything I don't like about the movie. But to be fair the camera angles, and acting made the movie interesting. I can't remember the camera stopping at any one scene, it was in motion at least 95% of the time. The picture is very good quality for being made in '61. In the beginning the acting wasn't too great, it kind of seemed unorganized, but by the end the actors became a cohesive team. Now for the bashing. I can see where High School Musical got its inspiration from, and it horrifies me. Didn't like the book, never saw the musical on stage, and I never want to see the movie again. Even though the camera was very steady, moving it around so much made me feel as if I was watching a roller-coaster ride. One main thing this movie could have used was more singing lessons. The main reason why I didn't like this movie was because I couldn't identify with any of the characters. None of them were smart or clever enough to be memorable or likable. Most of the movie was about sporadic singing and fight scenes that looked like they belonged in the Russian Ballet. This is not a film I would recommend anyone watching if they want real action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Embarrassingly bad (but prizewinning) adaptation of so-so musical version of Romeo &amp; Juliet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many critics and viewers have sung this film's praises, as relevant and groundbreaking-a musical for someone who doesn't like musicals. It won many Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, but it's hard to see why. The film is awkward, unimaginative, and flat; it preserves many of the defects of the musical it adapts, with many new shortcomings of its own devising.The 1957 musical was an updating of Romeo and Juliet to the 50s of gangs and zip-guns. Unfortunately, this kind of "updating" soon seems hopelessly dated; the film attempts a further updating to the early 60s, with the same result. That's the amazing thing about Shakespeare's original; as Baz Luhrmann showed, it doesn't need updating, but transcends its time. West Side Story, however, is a period piece.[SPOILERS follow, at least for anyone who doesn't know the story of R &amp; J.]The musical changes the original story, in an attempt to make it socially relevant-but instead leeches out the power and poignancy. The Montague/ Capulet feud, over some trivial personal slight, long forgotten, is transformed into a racial conflict, a battle between established and recent immigrants; One of Shakespeare's points is that such a personal feud might possibly be healed by guilt over some needless deaths. But a racial conflict isn't going to go away just because Maria accuses both gangs of recklessness. Unfortunately, the play pretends that this kind of simplistic reconciliation can happen.and this passes for realism or relevance? Would anyone find the ending realistic if it were set in Northern Ireland, or in Palestine? Come off it!Another revealing change: both Romeo and Juliet die, suicides in despair at the thought of life without transcendent love. Maria does not kill herself, but survives to call both Jets and Sharks to reconciliation at the end. In Shakespeare, this call comes from the civil and religious authorities, and the reconciliation comes about only when the feuding leaders finally submit to these authorities. In West Side Story, there are no authorities that anybody could submit to; the parents are nonexistent, the police are figures to be mocked, and Friar Laurence has been transformed into Doc, a cranky old shopkeeper who has no counsel to offer other than "When are you kids going to grow up!" Most of the "updated" dialogue is of this sort-replacing timeless poetry with slangy inanities.There are many such flaws in the musical (including Bernstein's stylistic indecision; he vacillated between writing sharp-edged jazz and slurpy romantic ballads, but at least most of the music is fairly interesting), but the film outdoes them all in its quest to be cinematic and realistic. So we are treated to a dozen or so well-groomed dancers leaping and prancing through Hollywood-realistic city-street sets. Realism? how long would these guys last if they tried dancing like this through the real West Side? They don't look realistic at all, just silly.The most effective scenes are those that are most like a filmed stage-play, with a fairly static camera and the dancers confined to a well-defined set. "America" is done on a rooftop, "Officer Krupke" is set on a single front stoop, and the Dance at the Gym [aka the Capulet's Ball] is genuinely exciting. Presumably both of these were directly inspired by the original choreography; at any rate they are the least cinematic, and the most successful.The much-touted cinematic effects look cheap and desperately unimaginative. No one could think of anything more interesting to do during the Overture than cycle the stylized graphic of Manhattan through various primary colours, changing every minute or so, for no apparent reason? The opening music accompanies overhead shots of many different locations in New York (including Yankee Stadium, and the UN building); why? Tony sings "Something's Coming" in front of a shoddy back-projection of streets, unmotivated by anything in the song, and looks like he's riding through a Tunnel of Love. The haloing of Tony and Maria when they first meet at the dance might have been a novel effect in the 1930s, but in 1961 it looks like something out of a student effort.Of course, any time Tony or Maria are on the screen a discerning viewer wants to run and hide anyway. Neither Richard Beymer nor Natalie Wood has the slightest degree of charisma, neither can sing (their songs had to be dubbed, with no attempt made to match the vocal timbres, or even to make it look like they were really singing), neither can dance (ensembles dance around them, while they hardly move), Wood's attempt to affect a Puerto Rican accent is embarrassing to say the least. So this timeless love story has a great big zero at its heart: two central characters about whom no one really gives a hoot, and who lack any ability to grab your attention. (The second leads are much better, esp. George Chakiris, not a Latino by the way, as Bernardo, aka Tybalt, the leader of the Puerto Ricans.)What were the producers and casting people thinking? Probably they started believing their own hype, that this was inevitably going to be a great timeless film, and they opted for names rather than talent. Even if they thought the world really needed a film version of this so-so musical, they would have been better off just filming a stage production, with real singers and actors, and dancers dancing where they belonged, on a stage.This isn't a great film, and it certainly isn't a great film musical. If you want to see one of those, try Singing in the Rain, or Top Hat, or The Band Wagon, or A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, or Moulin Rouge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is well made, but I just don't like musicals.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend wanted me to watch this movie, even though he knows I hate musicals. I will have to say this is one of the better ones I have seen, but I still didn't care for it for the most part. It is basically a remake of "Romeo and Juliet, and that doesn't help as I don't care for Shakespeare that much either. The movie is at its best when no one is singing or dancing, but this is coming from someone who doesn't like those things in his movie. So if you like musicals check this one out, because if I could take it, then you should really enjoy it. I also didn't care much for the ending and how they got to that point. That guy should have just stayed away from the whole rumble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't like this movie this time around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "West Side Story" when it first came out, and like everyone else I thought it was good. A couple of months ago I decided to buy a copy, since I had just seen "Chicago" and was in a musical movie mode. Maybe it's just me, but after the first great scene- the overhead view of New York, it all went downhill for me. I guess I'm looking at things I didn't see before. From the first fight, I started to realize that the whole thing was unbelievably corny. Well dressed teens hanging around a playground. If they were so bored--- get a job. The Sharks complaining about how badly they were treated in "America." OK-- what were they doing to improve their situation? Gang fighting? Every scene was painful to watch. I watched about an hour, then started fast forwarding. I watched the last scene, then hit the eject button. This movie was good in it's time, but anyone watching it today for the first time would laugh their heads off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>boring and stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read a book by someone who lived in that area during that time. He said people in his neighborhood hated the show. It was nothing like their life really was.The story is loosely based on Romeo and Juliet which I never liked. Romeo and Juliet fall madly in love the first time they meet. How stupid and unrealistic. I never thought the whole suicide angle was at all romantic. What a waste of young life. Back to WSS. I just could not get into this movie. The dialogue seemed as if it was written by junior high school students. The plot seemed phony.I thought the last few scenes were stupid and unrealistic. I did not feel any sympathy for the characters.I just can't buy tough street gang thugs dancing ballet and singing.I do like some of the songs. I would never watch this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't buy into dancing street toughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the classic musical about street gangs, modeled after Romeo and Juliet. The first ten minutes we see the gangs converging, snapping fingers and breaking out into some bizarre, prancy type of dance. As far as street toughs go, these guys couldn't even frighten my old aunt Ethel. I just couldn't buy into everything. Maybe this movie was ahead of it's time (see Micheal Jackson's Beat It video), but I don't like my street toughs dancing around like Barishnakov. Based on this, I give it the boot. (Keep in mind that I'm not a big fan of musicals, but am I not close-minded [I thought Cabaret was great])</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Short Opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I enjoyed the plot. This movie contributes to the false stereotypes of Latinas. The leading lady, not even a Latina, with he heavy accent. As if all Latinos had that sort of accent. Well, its just insane, the appearance of Latinos, as roudy, violent, and well so on, just makes me nuts. And, of course Latinos dreading the return to Puerto Rico, appearing as if the United States was a whole lot better. But, of course this movie was to encourage a type of assimilation for the immigrant. Take the name Sharks v. Jets, Jets high in the sky above all and sharks below in the water, they "bite" they're fierce, violent. etc. Oh, and the calling of Spics, a term used by the government imposed by the government.Oh, the comment made by the cop that if Puerto Ricans took over, the city would turn into a mess, well its not like they in other places but the ghettos. ALthough, this musical is suppose to beamusing, entertaining, cheerful, honestly there is underlying Latinosocial issues, that many may not care, but should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>West Side Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard West Side Story listed as one of those "classics" that everyone should see, but I have to say I was very disappointed in this movie. First of all, the premise of gangs dancing and singing just came off as so cheesy, fruity, and unrealistic. The music wasn't powerful...although there were 2 or 3 choruses that I liked, overall I didn't like the music. Even though it only spanned a few days time over the course of the movie, it seemed like they should've had some great "epiphany" lesson -- it was like the whole purpose was to say Puerto Ricans couldn't get along with the white people and I was just disappointed after expecting it to be this wonderful classic that I had heard referenced in so many other movies. Tony, although he tried to do the right thing for the wrong reason, he gets to the rumble and acts too quickly and then he does the wrong thing. Just suffice it to say I was sorely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keep This Story to Yourself!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching the movie "West Side Story" for me was cruel and unusual punishment. I kid you not, watching these people dance all over the screen made me want to die. I'm sorry but musicals just are not my thing. Especially one that dates back to the 50's.West Side Story is a story about two rival gangs that want to take over the block. One is a white gang, and one is a Puerto Rican gang. Clearly tempers fly and the go after each other on a daily basis. Finally one day the two leaders of the gangs decide to meet up and organize one major brawl to settle the scores once and for all. Just before the great fight, something unheard of occurs. The right had man from the white gang and the little sister of the leader of the Rican gang fall in love. Something like Romeo and Juliet but instead of rival families, its rival gangs. Could their love be strong enough to withstand the pressure they get from their piers? Me personally I could do without this movie. I really can't enjoy people singing and dancing all over the television for two hours. There were some high points to the movie though. I must admit, the character Maria was very attractive. Watching her made the movie almost worth watching. There was much more bad than good when it came to this movie. The choreography was awful. The moves were not tight and the background dancers were not in sync with each other. I thought the singing was bad also. Vocal coaches were needed to improve the singing big time.Just knowing that this movie was shot back in the 1950's put it in my head to not get my hopes up. The stages were very fake to me. The fact that I grew up watching these modern day films makes it hard for me to take steps backward and enjoy old style films. On top of that I really don't like musicals. I would rather sit through romantic, chick flicks and day. Maybe the next viewer will have more appreciation for this movie but as for me, I rather go without hearing this West Side Story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It bored me stiff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of musicals through the 50's I eagerly awaited the release to our local cinema of West Side Story. I had an argument with my husband about going and left him holding the baby (literally) I was expecting great things from this movie after all that had been written about it but I was disappointed. There were a couple of nice songs but nothing to make me go out and buy the record. The acting I thought seemed forced. I put this in the same category as Dances with Wolves which I also found boring. It seemed like a series of postcard views. I refused to go and see Sound of Music as even the clips did nothing for me. I did see other Julie Andrews films which I enjoyed. I would give WSS a 1 out of 10 but I realize that it must have something that I missed so I gave it a 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>outstanding! truly realizes the insanity of hate and prejudice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw West Side Story, I was nine. It didn't make a huge impression on me, mostly because, knowing the ultimate outcome of Romeo and Juliet, I waited for that ending to happen, which it didn't exactly. I am now 15, and when I watched it this time, I loved it so much that it became one of my favorite films. While I haven't seen Singin in the Rain recently enough to compare it, this is without a doubt one of the very greatest musicals ever made. The entire film is stunning, a model of great cinematography, editing, production. The music is unforgettable, the choreography is brilliant, and the acting is topnotch. And does it make you cry! A must-see, but wait until you are somewhat older than nine!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the dumbness of some story elements ruin the movie for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The music is nice, so I'll give it a 4 for the songs. As for the rest of the film, I just don't see why it has received so much attention (particularly from the Oscars). Perhaps the problem lies within me because I just can't get past the fact that this is a musical about two effeminate street gangs. I saw the movie all the way through as a kid, but in my 30s I tried watching it again and just couldn't keep watching. When the Jets and Sharks (or whatever their names were) started fighting, I found myself laughing uncontrollably as they danced and pranced and skipped across the stage! I am originally from Washington, DC, and ANY gang behaving like THAT sure wouldn't last long!</fullReview>
