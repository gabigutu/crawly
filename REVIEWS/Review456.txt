		<shortDescription>A sequel that actually rocks!! (even from a non-fan)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie blew me away - I have only seen two episodes of the show, never saw the first movie, but went to a pre-screening where Johnny Knoxville himself introduced the movie, telling us to 'turn off our sense of moral judgment for an hour and a half.' He was right. As a movie, this would probably rate a 2, given it has zero plot, no structure besides randomness, and very little production value. However, that isn't the point. Everyone in our theatre was laughing and gasping the whole way through - not only were some of the stunts creative (see trailer if you need to know but they hid some of the best (or worst depending on how you want to look at it)), but some of the stuff they did took us completely by surprise. These guys do some stuff that won't make it into your newspaper reviews (and probably can't even be published here), involving lots of things below the belt. However, almost 3/4 of the stunts are fantastically hysterical (even if morally condemnable, but remember Knoxville's statement), and if you are in the right mindset this movie is hysterical to watch. Only about 20 minutes of this movie could have actually been shown on TV, so consider yourself warned of what you're getting into - some stuff is disgusting, but instead of being repulsed by it you end up laughing at the sheer stupidity of it all. As a person who thought Jackass the TV show was an over-hyped fad with only a few funny sketches and lots of unnecessary pain, the amount of fun I had at this movie has made me realize that having no boundaries is the best environment for these guys to work in. It's a lot of fun and should be a great comedic fix until the Borat movie comes out. With this movie, you may think you know what you're getting, but these guys are a few steps ahead of you - I guarantee you'll be surprised by the 3rd sketch. So enjoy, and don't worry: you won't want to perform almost any of their stuff at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackass number Two delivers exactly what we all hoped for and were afraid of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sequel is exactly what you will expect it to be. And it is good enough that everyone who would have wanted to watch this should leave it happy.This is not a movie that will win an Academy award. But it does take what made the Jackass TV show and original movie a success, and it turns it up a notch. It is funnier, more brutal, and more disgusting than the original. And I loved every minute of it.The original had a few notorious stunts, and there is at least one stunt that this movie will be remembered for. You will wince, cringe, look away, and laugh very, very hard.In any event, you probably do not need to read this review, or any others, to know if you will like this movie, unless you have never heard of Jackass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do I begin? I sat down ready to laugh a bit and I was blown away! This movie is just perfect, it's indescribable. Jackass Number Two in all honesty was grosser, more obscene, funnier and more entertaining than the first. This was just what I needed tonight.There are so many scenes in this movie that will make you say "Oh My! No Way!" or "Ouch!". Perfectly mastered and set up, each event and scene were coordinated way before and therefore made it even more perfect. I loved every minute of it! I'm just going to say that there was even a scene where it was necessary to censor particular footage in order to prevent an NC-17 rating! It was so hilarious that they had to put it in anyway! Amazingly good.9/10. Incredibly funny, Do Not Miss Out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes. Bam cried a couple times and so did Englund. And most probably you will too. The whole cast is back in action and Knoxville has stepped up to become the true leader of this gang of messed-up retards (I mean this in the best possible way). I first thought, maybe Bam or Steve-O were the main go-to guys....nope, the main man is now Johnny. Don't get me wrong, everybody, and I mean everybody is great in this flick! Right from the get-go you're laughing, and believe you me, don't plan on resting that smile of yours. I personally think the movie definitely has better moments than the first. You know when you go into a theater, and you kind of don't want to have high expectations for it.....well, this movie blows all expectations away. If you love Jackass, you can go into this with gigantic expectations. No matter what you'll laugh your ass off. If you're not laughing, the reason is most likely someone has a gun in your face telling you if you laugh you die or maybe you are embarrassed about the sound of your laugh or the highest probability is that you were eating Jack Sh!t for breakfast and Jack left town. All I have to say is, prepare yourself to have a sore face after the movie. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Circus Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tops the previous incarnation by a mile, taking everything to the next level. As always the JackAss guys are purely unbelievable, and I personally laughed harder in that theatre than I have in a long time. Like the first JackAss, this isn't so much a movie as an eighty minute long string of stunts and pranks. It is pure circus entertainment taken to the highest level. Essentially these guys are clowns, debasing themselves for the amusement of others. And its great. The shenanigans are so low, outrageous, and often disgusting that they transcend into a higher form of entertainment.You can't rate this along other movies, its in a class of its own. And it shines. Go and enjoy it for the pure spectacle that it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's what you expect. It induces laughter, cringing, and dry-heaving, not necessarily in that order. It's over-the-top. You will see things that you may never be able to erase from your mind's eye. " Jackass Number Two" is better than the first; the actors definitely took more risks while filming this movie. There are many stunts which could have killed the actors, especially Johnny Knoxville. The treatment of animals was suspect, but other than that, the movie achieved what is was made to achieve. If you like the preview, see the movie. If you don't, steer clear! 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Knoxville has lost his mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Knoxville has gone insane.In the first Jackass he delighted in practical jokes more so than the physical stuff ? his opening car rental gag and the later bit involving an air horn on a golf course were more akin to some type of extreme Candid Camera ? but in Jackass: Number Two he's really off his rocker.Beginning with a sequence where he is chased through a living room by a bull, or later when he rides a rocket (a stunt which almost cost him his life due to an unexpected explosion from the side of the rocket), and especially when he stands willfully in front of a defense mechanism and takes a spray of pellets to the stomach, Knoxville is a madman. In the first film Bam Margera and Steve-O ? notorious party animals ? were the daring ones, but you know it's pretty bad when you see Knoxville enticing them to do a stunt.This is essentially a series of stunts pulled off by guys consumed by testosterone, constantly trying to one-up each other. It will eventually end in death for one of the cast members ? in Jackass 2 Steve-O nearly loses a leg to a shark, Knoxville (as aforementioned) is nearly impaled with an explosion from a rocket, and so on and so forth. Jackass 3 has already been confirmed owing to the success of 2, and frankly I can't imagine any stunt out-performing the bull run in the opening scene of this film ? that's incredible footage. It's almost unbelievable, and I wondered whether it had been faked, but apparently it was 100% genuine. (Which is actually kind of frightening.) And in terms of extremes Jackass 2 far outdoes its predecessor ? it also feels more cinematic than the first film, with less of the cheesy titles preceding stunts that were made famous on the original MTV television show.Unfortunately, the boys were given too much freedom here, and a good number of the gags are simply lame exercises in crudity ? I can enjoy the occasional poop gag, but watching a man relieve himself on a miniature toilet, or see Steve-O take beer up the butt (yes, honestly), gets grating after a while. Even the frat boys in the screening I attended ? who were enthusiastic when Wee Man took a playing card up the rear and got zapped by a rigged chair ? were disgusted by some of the scenes in this film. It's not a matter of getting away with as much as possible ? it's a matter of saying, "Is this even entertaining or funny?" Many times, sadly, it really isn't.But for every lame stunt involving fecal matter and farting on people's faces, there are some brilliant hidden-camera bits. Wacky director Spike Jonze ("Adaptation") dresses up as an old woman and hits the streets naked, with sagging breasts and no shame. And my personal favorite skit involved Knoxville as an irresponsible old man, out for lunch with his grandson, letting him drink alcohol and smoke and swear and insult people. That's classic comedy taken to new extremes with the liberties of an R-rating. It's a shame they had to ruin all the great stuff ? including a final segment involving an elaborate terrorist prank ? with poop jokes along the way.Still, there's enough sheer spirit and craziness in this film to merit a viewing, and it's really taken the concept of extremity in cinema to new heights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got out of an advance screening, and wow was this movie hilarious. Possibly better than the first one, but at least its equal. If you don't like jackass, or really unnecessary amounts of male nudity(way more than in the first) then stay far, far away. But if you dig the whole Jackass thing, then this movie will not disappoint. Toro Totter is the greatest invention ever. OK. so my review wasn't long enough... All else i have to say is poor, poor Dunn, they really kick the crap out of him in this. So if you enjoy masochistic humor, and prolific male nudity, and by far the most disgusting female nudity ever (John Waters is involved, need i say more?) then this movie will keep you in stitches for it entirety. I never stopped laughing, and actually came out drenched in sweat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackass No. II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Knoxville and the boys of Jackass go over the top for "Jackass Number Two." At a press screening, the laughter was so loud and raucous it was hard to hear all the dialog. The stunts are over the top and the pranks are funnier and more outrageous than ever before.All of the guys put their limbs on the line to make a great film, and they succeeded. If you like this genre, you'll love this film. If not, don't bother.Some of the funniest bits are the pranks the guys play on themselves, and they have no regard for what happens to them. They'll do anything to make a stunt work. Many critics panned Johnny Knoxville for a less active role in the first film, but not to worry, he is front and center in Number Two, and they have enough footage in the can to be half way through a Number Threee.This is a must see for fans of this type of humor.Chris Sansone, Entertainment Editor, Fort Bend Herald</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. After seeing this film, you will know why America's youth continues to lack intelligence and any traits to contribute to the wellbeing of society, except for making themselves more inept to function.Jackass Number Two stars some of the most repremandable people imaginable, who at there core lack any sort of talent or brains to make anything of themselves (especially Bam Margera and Steve-O), and there only option for fame was to make a living entertaining those as stupid as them by harming there being. A guy drinking horse semen? Just flat disgusting. A man putting a fish hook through his cheek and acting as "bait" for sharks? This isn't humor, it's evidence for institutionalizing him.Overall, I walked out of the theater with no hope for mankind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>20-somethings getting hurt is funny...30-somethings...not so much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Instead of bowling over with laughter where I probably should have, I felt a deep concern for these Jackass folks which I've spent the last eight years or so watching in very forms. To me, Jackass Numer Two was the passing of an era. The main thing I noticed is how incredibly old everyone in the cast is looking (and sounding) these days. The howls of pain no longer tickled my funny-bone. Instead, I felt sorry for these people. The creaking bones and pain pill addictions which invariably will come from performing these stunts, left me at times shaking my head. At one point in the film, Bam Margera turns to the camera and says something about not wanting to do a Jackass Three...as if that wasn't enough....there's a very tired and very drunk Margera at the close of the credits painfully trying to take off his pants, while falling into a booby trap set up by the crew. His body, wrecked with burn scars and bad tattoos, straightens up and he turns to the camera and says "This isn't funny anymore." And you know...he's probably right. Yes, there are certain moments of comedic genius to be found dressing up as a Bad Grandpa, but falling off an old-fashioned bike when you're pushing 35-years old is in a way sad. The most horrifying image of the film is a bloated Preston Lacy lying in a pile of garbage cans after doing an unwise slide for the musical number. You see the crew run to his aid, but they're not laughing...and shortly thereafter the film, which is filled with some of the greatest punk rock ever produced goes out in stone cold silence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>is it another sign of the decline of American intelligence, or another grab-bag of the most obscene gags and jokes to hit theaters, you decide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jackass Number Two may not be as "good" as part 1, though it may depend on how you define 'good'. I guess it has to mean more to how much you're fulfilled entertainment-wise by the material. To say that the Jackass boys outdo themselves this time is putting it lightly. Maybe it was around the time that one of them drank horse semen, or when one put a leech on his eyeball, or when one of them blew farts directly into a another with a space helmet on, or when...Nevermind. The point of Jackass Number Two is, well, there is no point if you're going at it logistically. If anything by logic these guys are out of their (bleeping) minds. Being fodder for seeing-red-charging-bulls, here and there surrounded by a snake or two, I wonder here and there if these guys inadvertently have a death wish in them, or at least the instinct. But on the other hand, Jackass 2 is at it's best for me in showing how people can actually be live-action cartoons- sometimes very X-rated and crude, but cartoons all the same.This was evident for me too already in the first Jackass movie, but this time it's almost all-too-blatant. What are we to think of Wile E. Coyote's reputation when Johnny Knoxville straps himself to a rocket (though this time just for the sake of doing it across a lake, not for a roadrunner), or in what I thought of as a Beavis &amp; Butt-head homage rolling down a long hill inside of a tire? But there are other things that had me laughing very hard at what they were doing. The old-man/lady get-ups were the best for me, as Spike Jonze (yes, Spike Jonze) and Knoxville provided caricatures that are like walking, breathing punk'd creations, with genitals and breasts all askew. Yet through all the stupidity, the insanities, and what sometimes just has me going 'huh' (the final musical number comes to mind), there is at least a good spirit of the old-time pranksters in them, even as they cheat death and get away from it laughing their heads off at each other. Little bits like riding the bicycle with the one big wheel and small little wheel ("why did people do this"), or the switcheroo of Bam's father in bed, are genuinely clever, if still very stupid things to see.Now, if you're going into this movie without having seen part 1, it may be a bit naive on your part. It helps to see the first one just to know whether or not this stuff is really for you. Because if you know it is for you, Jackass Number Two is probably the picture of the season. If not, you may end up either a) puking in your seat, seriously, or b) walking out within the first twenty minutes. This is the kind of picture that I, who rarely calls for censoring anything, could have been warranted a second look for an NC-17 rating. On the other hand, it'd be wrong of me to say I didn't have a good time for most of the time either, even when a gag or joke was weak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What you would expect and still not worth it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Depending on the way you read this it may contain spoilers, although not specific ones.This movie is pretty much exactly like I thought it'd be. It's tasteless, pointless and just full out a waste of time. Having seen the first one, I knew exactly what I was in for when I started watching the second one. I thought there might be a few cool things or funny things, but no not at all. There was one stunt that I actually found was cool and I laughed a total of one time during the whole movie, the laugh was half-forced.The first one contained disgusting material, but it had the occasional prank that was played in good humor which would actually make me laugh. The second one had the same thing, the only problem is the pranks they would play in good humor usually turned out to have it contain some sort of stupid and disgusting material in the end anyway.The extent that these people can go to is very ugly and very far. For some it's funny and others it isn't, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but it's hard for me to accept that any of this can be humorous to anyone. The group of people that were the performers in this movie should stick to doing it for themselves and no longer for the camera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What you would expect from a Jackass movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just about as good as the first Jackass, but with slightly more disgusting skits. I wouldn't say this was as good as the first, but it came very close. Jackass fans will not be disappointed, but if you didn't like the first movie, you will hate this one. There are scenes that will be seen as Jackass classics (the elderly suits with "additions", the "cab ride", and many others), and those that you will wish you never watched (eating crap, drinking semen, etc...) Overall this movie was a good watch, and I am glad I got to see it. I'm sure this movie will not have the best rating due to critics that rate it (I sat in the press section and most of the older viewers seemed disgusted), but don't let that stop you from enjoying it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you would like to waste time do one of two things. First stand outside and stare at the sky or two watch the movie Jackass Number Two. There are more stunts and more men with certain 'body parts' flapping in the wind, but the movie does not break any laughter barriers. The entire crew appears in the movie along with a host of celebrities who make cameos. But the movie fails to make a dent in the funny department. From a senior citizen exposing her chest to people to the ingesting of a bowel movement; Jackass is plain silly. The television version is much better than the bizarre,flimsy silver screen production. If you are looking for laughter look elsewhere rather than Jackass Number Two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this video the viewer gets to watch serial hair-brained stunts, which usually result in some pain to the participant on camera, some of which are amusing but many of which are mere exercises in juvenile vulgarity. Clearly the producers of this effort sought to out-do previous works of bad-taste and, I suspect, they have been largely successful. If watching a midget nearly get suffocated by a nude 300 pound plus woman, or a man using his sock-covered penis to provoke a snake attack, is the type of thing that floats your boat, then this is the flick you've been waiting for. Judging by the response on this web-site, one might think this was some sort of cinematic masterwork but, believe me, these ratings reflect a highly selective viewing audience.</fullReview>

If I laughed once, than I would have had to declare it a good movie. Needless to say, I didn't laugh.

They are free to do whatever things they like to do with their bodies (despite the fact that our bodies are Temple of The Holy Spirit). I'm worried because of the great quantity of viewers who ranked this movie between 9 and 10 stars. If this movie for them was a great movie, the future (our future) looks very dark. How anybody with common sense would like this kind of movie? The same we can say about "Superbad" and "Knocked Up". What's the message for the young ones, the future of the country and the world? For our tomorrow leaders? College equals alcohol, drugs and sex? Nothing else matters? These two movies also were highly rated for most of the audience. What about responsibility? What about the consequences of our actions? I'm worried, definitively.</fullReview>

The Jackass idiots do a lot of anal stuff but would never involve any male erections on screen - there are hardly any penises (limp or otherwise) on view in the film, compared to the acreage of male arse. John Waters's cameo making the "wee man" disappear was an inspired moment (if you haven't seen the film, it's not what you may think).I watched the film when on holiday at a backpackers accommodation, which had an earful of eye candy, if you allow me to mix metaphors, consisting of American and English surfies.

		<shortDescription>This movie is sick...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not mind jackass 1, and was thinking, hey this could be funny. But as another commentator has said Jackass moved practical jokes to just doing stupid things.Quite frankly it reminds of things that people come up with they are completely drunk, and stoned out of their minds. Its not funny, and some scenes like the skat is just SICK! I mean REALLY sick! I was hoping Johnny Knox would do more Rémi GAILLARD type jokes, but I guess when you run out of creative ideas you do stupid things. If you want to crack up laughing and you liked Jack Ass 1 do a youtube search of Remi Gaillard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>turning the gay up to 11</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yea I know this film (and films of it's ilk) are pretty much review-proof and as such it's a tad futile to try to critique the film in any conventional sense. Of course that won't stop me from trying. Johnny, Bam, Steve-O, wee man, and the rest of the Jackass gang are out for another series of unrelated idiotic and insanely retarder stunts. Given that the first movie was done on the cheap, it was destined to turn a profit and as such warrant a sequel (you have to know part 3 is just around the rancid corner).This amps up the stunts. More disgusting, more disturbing, and decidedly more gay. However, cranking it up to 11 doesn't automatically make it better and I found myself enjoying part 1 more on a whole. While watching this one I chuckled a few times, cringed a lot, and was severely bored by some (prosthetic nude 'granny' is one of the recurring bits that was beyond lame). Still if you were a fan of the TV show, you'll watch this regardless of whatever any one else says, if on the other hand the gay naked wrestling scene in Borat made you wanna vomit, steer clear of this 'film' at all coasts. Guys acting mentally retarded gets old fast.My Grade: C- DVD Extras:Commentary with Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Ryan Dunn, Wee Man, Preston Lacy, Dave England, Ehren McGhehey, Jeff Tremaine and Dimitry Elyashkevick; 30 minute 'The Making of Jackass Number Two' featurette; 36 additional segments (7 of them unrated); 16 minutes of deleted scenes; 8 minute outtake reel; Karazy music video; VMA spots; photo gallery; Theatrical trailer and trailers for "Norbit","Babel", "The Last Kiss", &amp; "Nacho Libre" 1 Easter Egg: Highlight 'Previews' in the second page of the Special Features menu and press down for an unrated teaser tailer for the film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a lover of gross humor, shockers and NC-17 movies, I was mostly bored by this one. I had no background of the first film or the MTV show. Sometimes I was shocked or horrified, but there were no laughs. A grown man farts into a tube connected to a face mask over someone's nose and the man with the mask pukes into it? They milk a stallion's penis and someone drinks the semen? If there were some social or comic context into which the pranks fell, I could see a cause for humor but there was none. The only exception was the fake terrorist in the taxi (who has had the other men's public hair glued to make a beard)where he freaks out the taxi driver by pretending to be ready to blow up a plane (except that the driver is in on the joke too). It's kind of America's Grossest Videos: short takes in which the sadomasochism reaches new lows. It's all so random and arbitrary. John Waters had some raunchy stuff but it fit into a story and was intended to gross out a specific group in society. These guys seemed like brain-damaged skateboarders and ex-surfers with frontal lobe disinhibition. Regarding the high ratings seen here, I wonder if there isn't an age at which seeing a grown man poop is no longer hilarious. I wasn't shocked, but more curious at what their motivations were and overall bored.</fullReview>

The only reason I can think of for watching this crap, is to hope that Johnny Knoxville might kill himself... in that respect, it's kind of like NASCAR.And with the Internet, at least you don't have to sit in a theatre full of pre-pubescent mental-defects and pathetic college kids on coke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass Number Two (2006): Dir: Jeff Tremaine / Cast: Johnny Knoxville, Steve O, Bam Margara, Jason "Wee Man" Acuna, Chris Pontius: One can understand the daredevil madness associated with Jackass: The Movie despite the fact that the stunts are not for the squeamish. However, the comic troop goes too far with this sickening sequel based on the M-TV program. Some stunts are entertaining such as the one where they hunt for an anaconda within a pool of colored balls, or the seesaw stunt regarding a bull. Other stunts are just plain gross such as drinking horse semen or gluing pubic hairs to one's face as a beard. Some of the location work is innovative and the director shoots it somewhat like a documentary, which works. Johnny Knoxville, Steve O, Bam Margara, and Jason "Wee Man" Acuna all return for what can only be described as a suicide test. Chris Pontius has an encounter with a bull and its horns that are a little too close for comfort. These films are almost always marketed towards the wrong audience and display just how far morals in society have plummeted. The boys are less funny here, and it is strange that no women are involve at all. Either no female would be seen in such garbage or they would feel intimidated by a female capable of such shock. For their next stunt they should draw straws to see who should have this film shoved up their anal track. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

I must caution the masses however, I considered taking my (under-18) son with me but am relieved I did not. This compilation of obnoxious skits contains a few that albeit as hilarious as they may seem to the adult community, a few are not for the immature. These guys must get paid a great ransom to tolerate some of the devious stunts, sometimes played at their expense. In particular, Bam Margera and Ehren McGhehey are slighted by the group in a few particular stunts. Enjoy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the first jackass movie more than this offering.This time around there are more outrageous, often shitty stunts, i found it to be inferior to the first one. There are a few decent, really funny stunts, but overall the standard is low. It feels like they're running out of stunts that are actually funny, although most of the stunts can provoke a cheap laugh, it really depends on your sense of humor.It's not really a movie, the many back to back stunts just add up to the time that a movie would run for.If you like the TV series and the first movie it may be worth watching this. Teenage boys and possibly young adults will love this movie. If you're looking for a fun, light hearted movie with crazy stunts, violence, swearing and stupidity, then this is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass Number Two is the sequel to popular stunt television show starring Johnny Knoxville and his daredevil crew. In this film we see as their everyday lives as they go out of their ways to continue with out daring stunts. The film does have a lengthy run but it is non stop and most of the stunts and pranks are quite funny. Several could have been done without, such as many of the gross out and disgusting stunts. These may include: miniature dollhouse toilet scene (this should have been cut out), horse scene, fart gas mask scene (small scene but was unnecessary), leech scene. The film is best when the crew are doing physical stunts where they are more as daredevils such as the bicycle scenes, bull scenes, or rocket launcher scenes were well delivered. There is quite a great scene towards the end involving a prank within a prank in he form a terrorist attack and a taxi- his was well done although went quite long. Johnny Knoxville disguised as his 'Bad Grandpa' character was a brief look and was well done, although a very brief glimpse which was quite good as well. The other female grandma was funny at first but they did a few too many. Overall, Jackass Number Two is a film for those that are familiar with these stunts and enjoy these type of pranks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the sequel to an unfortunate film, based on an American television series even more miserable, where people do crazy nonsense just because. Directed by Jeff Tremaine, is performed by the same guys from the first film, people whom I refuse to call actors, and to whom I recommend to arrange a real job quickly. It's serious guys, grow up!Anyone who has seen the original movie or the TV series and liked it, you'll probably love this movie. I give these people my condolences for that, because this type of film material is no more than an intelligence death certificate for those who can see it or like it (it's possible?). Unfortunately this type of film is not suitable for smart people, or people with a minimum of good taste. It's a machine to make money at the expense of stupidity of some people. As I said to the first one, this movie is not really a movie because it's so bad that's not worthy of that name. It's a proof that something went very wrong in the evolution of human race, or the Darwin's theory of natural selection isn't working as it should. It's shameful, disgusting, miserable, horrible, terrible and unfortunate from start to finish. Throw him in the trash, along with the people who did it!P.S.: I gave this movie a star because IMBb's system doesn't allow us to rate below zero to a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Johnny Knoxville and his team of daredevil stuntmen, including Steve-O and Bam Margera, return for a second helping of madcap mayhem, including a hosepipe rodeo, a crafty extendable boxing glove, objects being inserted through the gums, and many others.The UK have caught on with the American's and their love of shows like Jackass lately and have made a show entitled Balls of Steel, which has courted some controversy for some of the more outrageous stunts (namely, squirting Tom Cruise in the face at a premiere he was attending.) But the yanks still remain the zaniest daredevils when it comes to near the knuckle shows like this, and the second movie outing for Jackass pushes the boundaries even further than they've gone before. In one scene, in fact, where horse semen is forcibly ejected from it's behind, one of the performers even freely admits he is 'ashamed of himself', really giving you the impression they know they've gone beyond the boundaries of tastefulness and decency themselves.You know what you're getting through-out, so it's hard to review on a critical level, to be honest. At 90 minutes, it's all probably a bit too long and drawn out, and it's become somewhat boring and tiresome by the end. But if you're a fan of the show or liked the last film, or just want to see how low human inhibition can fall, you'll find something to enjoy here. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's tough to really consider this as an actual 'movie'. Sequel to 2002's "Jackass: The Movie", this movie is just another extension of the MTV television series with skits you could never, ever....EVER show on television. The entire Jackass crew returns for this sequel, in which they take their stunts to extremes that blow away their previous efforts.This flick had me laughing insanely through the entire 95 minutes, though I admit to having low standards for humor sometimes. This movie is not classy, thought-provoking, inspiring, heart-warming, or anything else people look for in a motion picture. Of course, if you go to any movie with the word JACKASS in the title in search of the next Oscar-winner, you're barking up the wrong tree. Though, if you're looking for some great low-brow, oftentimes sickening, entertainment, you've found it. I'm going to assume the only people reading this comment are those who are familiar with the style of comedy associated with the show.If you've got a weak stomach, BEWARE. My ex-wife almost lost her dinner on multiple occasions while watching this with me. The things these guys do for money (especially Chris Pontius and Steve-O) will boggle the mind and churn your stomach. If you're anything like me, you'll be horrified by what you're seeing but you can't turn away. I won't bother talking about any of the sketches specifically, since I wouldn't want to ruin anything for potential viewers.I guess I like these movies because they remind me of anytime I'm hanging with my friends and someone starts a conversation with "Dude, I dare you to..." or "Wouldn't it be funny if...". Of course, our dares never pan out. Then again, my friends aren't being offered the kind of money the Jackass crew rakes in. Would I recommend this movie to a friend? Hell yeah. But, like a visit to the dentist's office, remember not to eat anything for a couple hours before viewing.You've been warned.</fullReview>

But in Jackass Number Two i really was. I am convinced that they save all of their best stunts for these films rather than the television show. The commentary from all the characters throughout the scenes is also fantastic, they're all so funny. I will definitely buy this film when it comes out, and i'll rent the first one, which i didn't go to see because i thought it would be rubbish. Thankyou for reading.

And I can be short about this: if you like the series and/or the first film you can't miss this: it's more of the same and at the same time it's more disgusting (I didn't know that was even possible, but it is), it's more painful, and it's still very hilarious.If you don't like the series and/or don't like the first film, skip this at all costs - it is not going to appeal to you.There's not much of a story in this one: the gang goes out do silly stuff again. The same people, some of the same sketches, and some new things. They're still crazy and the stunts performed are still not to be taken lightly. Good stuff.

While watching this movie there were some stupid parts but the majority of this movie keeps you laughing no matter what. There was an elderly couple in front of us that was laughing the whole time, a middle aged couple behind us, and some teens around us too who were also laughing so it is true that no matter what your age or maturity level you will most likely find this movie amusing.

I can honestly say that i didn't stop laughing the ENTIRE movie. The stunt with Jay Chandrasekhar was one of the funniest pieces of film i have seen in my entire life.Again i honestly believe that the only way this movie could be topped by another Jackass movie is if one of the characters gets so hurt that they die, and i would never want to witness that.

		<fullReview>My sister, a friend and I went to see this film for my birthday on the 24th of September. We had all seen the first "Jackass" movie a while back, and we all enjoyed it. We were really looking forward to Number Two.We were not disappointed.From start to finish I was laughing hysterically. It is equal parts shocking and amusing, however, and is definitely not for those with weak stomaches. It is obscene, but it is also groundbreaking American cinema... well, perhaps that's a bit too much praise for a movie where men intentionally get their scrotum's stuck to ice sculptures, but it IS groundbreaking in that it shows us obscenities whether we like it or not, things that no other "decent" American movie released nation-wide would dare show us.There was only one scene in particular that I felt was unnecessarily obscene, and it involved a horse - I'll not elaborate.I laughed, I nearly gagged, and I came damn-close to crying (out of a physical reaction to viewing a scene involving a leech and an eyeball, not sadness). In my humble opinion, "Jackass: Number Two" is THE film of '06.Does that make me a jackass? Perhaps. But if it does, I could really care less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a huge fan of the Cky videos, Jackass, and Viva La Bam for a long time. They've had a great run and I expected my laughter to end, eventually. But, it hasn't yet. This movie kept my mouth open the entire time. I'm still laughing, randomly. I went to the theater with low expectations, thinking it wasn't going to be better than the first. Oh, how incredibly wrong I was.There were many great moments in the movie. If you're squeamish, don't like randomly placed raw humor, or if you disliked the first movie, you probably won't like this. But, with that said, I almost wet my pants from laughing so hard. It had all kinds of different pranks, masochistic humor, toilet humor, puking, laughing, some great falls and massive damage done to all of the cast. Ryan Dunn even branded Bam's rear end with an image that will be stuck there for a long time. I'm sure you can only imagine how raw this movie is.No pain, no gain? Right? This movie has already done well, causing theaters all over America to laugh so hard, they'll be wishing it could last longer. I know I did. This movie did not feel short, at all, especially with the credits continuing the footage. But, I still wish it could've gone on forever. Now, let's just wait and see when they release Jackass Number 3! Overall, an excellent film, if you can get past the male nudity and a few sickening images. Keep your kids out of this film. They don't need to see this, at least until they are older. Support the crew and BUY THIS when it comes out on DVD! I know I will.</fullReview>

So for 90 minutes I was a twelve year old again and was totally content to watch people hurt themselves.If your inner child is still twelve and very low brow see this film.(And just a word of warning-if you want to take your kids to this, don't.This film is rather graphic in many ways that should have gotten this film an NC17 rating.

		<fullReview>The kindest thing that I can say about "Jackass 2 Unrated" is that it is the most vile, disgusting, and repellent movie that I have ever seen in my entire life. On the other hand, I spent most of my time laughing my ass off at this hideously hilarious movie. Mind you, "Jackass 2" makes the first "Jackass" movie look extremely tame. In fact, if there is a "Jackass 3," it is going to have to top "Jackass 2" and Johnny Knoxville and his bunch are really going to have to dig deep to come up with better gags. The thing that sets "Jackass 2" apart from the previous "Jackass" is that this time when the guys aren't performing stunts to alienate other people, they punk as Ashton Kutcher might do themselves. Some of the normal nitwit gags include riding a mini-motorcycle at high speed down a short track to a do a loop-the-loop but crashing; rolling downhill in giant caterpillar tires; and launching themselves aloft on rockets that crash only a few seconds later. The best and most nauseating stunts include milking a stallion of its semen and drinking it. Steve-O dons a bubble helmet called a fart mask and promptly chucks up when the stench of a fat man's gas hits him. Steve-O does the butt chug where his companions pour beer down a tube stuck in his rectum. One of the biggest gags involves them shaving their pubic hair to supply one of their unsuspecting own with material for a beard. Johnny Knoxville masquerades as an old man and walks through town with his testicles dangling from his shorts. Later, they pull the same stunt but this time he masquerades as an shriveled up old lady who gets her dress caught in a car door and when she walks away, it rips to show her sausage-shaped breasts. When they aren't trying to gross everybody else out, these freewheeling stunt guys see if they can keep from puking after performing some of their more objectionable gags. The opening gag is probably as stylist as any "Jackass" movie will ever get. The film opens with stirring music from "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" as dust rises and we see our protagonists emerge from this dust cloud with steers charging in hard pursuit after them. Think of the old TV show "Candid Camera" gone wild and you'll be prepared for what follows, unless you are of the squeamish variety. Of course, as they point out at the beginning and the ending, nobody but professional stunt men should perform these stunts. Some people would never set their eyes on this kind of nonsense and people who are easily offended should avoid it at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Embarrassed to say this but... this is awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect from Jackass 2. Jackass 2 is 90 minutes of 9 stunt men who worked on the show performing extremely dangerous stunts and pranks. I thought I've either really like it or loathe it to the core. The result? I loved it. It's one of the most insane films ever made and to be perfectly honest isn't so much a film as a rocket powered shopping trolley smashing through a supermarket, but it's deliriously entertaining and incredibly funny. Some of the stunts cross the line into disgusting instead of disgustingly fun gross out humour and anyone who doesn't like this sort of thing should stay as far away as they can. J2 is a fairly surreal experience overall, and is totally nuts but it is genuinely funny and showcases comedy at its most unrestrained and daring. All of the performers are entertaining and have plenty of presence, while Jeff Tremaine directs the film very well. The opening set piece where a group of bulls chase the performers through an abandoned neighbourhood is pretty extraordinary.J2 is an acquired taste, but for what it is it's very well done. It's consistently hilarious, the jokes are well done, the stunts and daring and often clever and for once gross out comedy works. Some of the stunts are weaker, but most of them hit the mark. At times it's a terrifying movie but it doesn't feel terribly intense and throughout it's good natured. On a cinematic level it's actually a rather good piece of documentary filmmaking. The gross out novelty never quite wears off and the shocks, screams of laughter and sublime comedy never stop flowing. I haven't watched the TV show or Jackass 1, but even though I was uninitiated, it was still an absolute blast. Not all of it is fun, but at least 85% of it is. Crazy, smashing comedy with no subtlety, no restraint, no taste and no boundaries. Believe it or not, it's genuinely awesome.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Knoxville and his gang of misfits do a whole new series of stunts. It's as stupid and as perverse as ever before. Like before, it is just one stunt after another. Some are funnier than others. Some are unleashed on the unsuspecting public. It's all very random and great for the fans.This starts with the running of the bulls. The branding is insanely stupid. The rocket bicycle is magical and that jump is beautiful. I want one. There is the Bad Grandpa character in this but it's still in its infancy. If only that guy actually throws a punch at Knoxville. The flashing grandma is a little funnier for this one. John Waters does something that is fitting for him. The pranks don't get creepier than a leech in the eye. They shoot Knoxville off on a big red rocket. I don't think the grand song and dance work. Overall, it's not necessarily better but it's at least more of the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As you would expect this sequel is more gross out, hence more funny, steered by Johnny Knoxville, a sort of Vince Vaughn lookalike, and his crazed mob. Again we have more di..heads who just want attention and they get it, like in one of the ball tubs, like you see in Le-cornu's, an added bonus, hidden underneath lurks an anaconda, that Knoxville tackles, who gets his fangs into di...ead Johnny a few times. D..khead, or more correctly Jackass. Another stunt: Big hole in the wall, behind it one of the largest punching gloves you'll see. I think you get the picture, when a chain of oblivious jackasses walk up to. Oh, a highlight act to end the finale, Terror Taxi: this segment putting a spin, a twist on the scenario prank you must see. Definitely for fans of the original. You will not be disappointed, where as in very few cases, the sequel here, surpasses the original. Ones who hate to be grossed out, or like to wince at some some scenes, forget it. This one includes much additional footage in the after of the movie. Again, if a fan of the original, if still sitting down, don't be a jackass, rent number two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strongly good if not painful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-7/10Jackass Number Two is a gross out comedy that dares you to just have a little laugh at this, and it really does. With it's crazy stunts and documentary style clip show, it transfers it's laughs from the small screen to the big and brings a whole lot of entertainment with it all. Maybe not recommend for the more sickened of cinema goers or those who dislike painful stunts and disgusting challenges, I did however find this to be strongly a good movie, and here is why.The story, well the story isn't so much a story as it is a documentary, that has absolutely no plot, it is scene after scene of wicked antics and crazed stunts(sounds dumb right), maybe so but it is wickedly also funny and really can leave you crying with laughter at there reactions. Some scenes are down right disgusting and can make you feel just sick constantly, so again another warning to those who dislike that kind of thing.Johnny Knoxville I would say leads the whole project but looking back I am not so sure as people appear all the time to jump into bull horns and drink Bull? well you get the picture. I especially enjoyed the cast being this big though because you get a whole new reaction as because this is clip after clip, it doesn't go stale because if the variety of people taking part, and with hilarious consequences.Not sure if this film actually is written or directed but in any case they do a good job if it indeed does contain a script. The stunts are well done and I guess I have to give it to them, they know how to take extreme pain, and I mean extreme. Maybe a few more really daring stunts could have made this more thrilling but the laughs compensate for the thrill of this film, just all round fun I guess.The films main criticism is it's vulgarity and pure stupidity, it is also crude and really if it didn't have the funny reactions, wouldn't be funny at all. I also disliked the quality of the film at times, now I understand it wants that documentary style filming to look like it is just them on a normal day, but it shakes a round so much and puts filters on so much, it just becomes confusing, at times.Now people who will like this, well I guess anyone who saw the show should love this, 92 minutes of just pure Jackass. Those who don't know the series well, if you watch this and don't feel sick then you will laugh your head off as it is just fun and fun mixed together with some stupid stunts. Again for those weak at the stomach, don't watch and anyone who dislikes extreme pain well, just stay away, you have been warned.Overall I give this a 7/10, a Strongly Good movie and I personally felt it was quite close to being Very Good. With this you have to have fun and not take it's humour too seriously, sit back and just laugh along with the cast who forever laugh at the misfortunes of there fellow members. There are genuinely stunts for everyone I believe and that maybe some will disgust or anger some, some will have you laughing a lot, give it a peek I say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mortifying Humor That Is Jackass Two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the first and then this one I have decided that maybe sometimes the sequels are better than the original. Basically take everything that dignified/sophisticated people can't stand and cram it into one movie and you will get any of the numerous Jackass movies. This one just like the first one is made up of skits, but the thing that made this one stand out more than the original one is the fact it's much more cruder and raunchier. I have never really looked away or gagged from a movie until I saw this group do stunts/acts of disturbing behavior that almost made me vomit. Now for the real review I would like to say that this is actually a very funny and surprisingly good movie, but even though this is my opinion I am guessing that many people were mortified and offended. If you are a fan of stupid humor and want a good laugh I would definitely check this out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eh? I dug the first Jackass when I was a bit younger, but revisiting these movies as I have gotten older makes me realize I have outgrown this childishness. I still very much enjoy raunchy humor, but I'm really not into watching people go to extreme measures to inflict pain on themselves by risking their lives. As you may expect; the gang goes out of their way to outdo themselves from the first one. I don't remember a whole lot about the gags in this one, but the most memorable is probably the terrorist segment. It's really outlandish stuff that I couldn't believe I was witnessing. Final Thoughts: Johnny Knoxville is a crazy SOB, and there is no other way to put it. It has some hits, but also many misses. If you're a huge fan of extreme comedy, these movies are for you. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass Number Two takes the small screen antic of the Jackass boys &amp; turns them into a full length full on feature film. Dangerous or disgusting skit after dangerous or disgusting skit, it's none stop insanity for an hour &amp; a half.If your a fan of the Jackass TV show on MTV or anything similar like Dirty Sanchez then the odds are you will like this which is exactly the same but expanded to feature film status. As you would expect there's some dangerous stunts like letting Bull's charge &amp; trampled you to disgusting ones like a guy drinking fresh Horse cum to very crude ones like the old woman who keeps exposing her horrible saggy breast's to one you can't quite believe like a moment when a guy puts a Leech on his eyeball &amp; lets it suck to ones that will make you queasy like the fart mask gag which I won't even begin to describe. So there's plenty of blood, bruises, pranks, bodily fluids &amp; pubic hair to satisfy the kid in us all, sure it's gross at times but it is funny as well which is the only thing Jackass Number Two aims for, it wants to make you laugh &amp; to be fair to it I did laugh so job done I guess. You do need a certain twisted sense of humour to enjoy much of what takes place here in Jackass Number Two but as long as your not a total prude there's laugh to be had here.Available in both theatrical &amp; uncut version the uncut one goes on for about a minute &amp; a half longer &amp; the easy way to tell which one your watching is during the Horse cum drinking moment, if there's a big 'Censorsed' banner during this bit then you have the shorter cut. All scenes featuring Vincent Margera were cut just one month from the films release after he was arrested on sexual assault charges.Jackass Number Two is no more than an extended version of the TV show really, if you like the TV show then you will love this. It takes a certain type of sense of humour to find this funny but it worked for me, I wonder what that says about me? Don't be surprised if a Number Three isn't too far off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, though I had gone into the first movie with no knowledge of the gang or their exploits (see the review of Jackass: The Movie for details) I was well and truly converted by the time the second big-screen outing came along. I had the first movie and all of the "best of . . ." releases on DVD and would often watch them when after a quick fix of stupid, crude comedy. So I can happily call myself a fan by this point.An easy movie to review in all respects; if you didn't like the first movie then you're not going to like this one. If you've always been a fan then here you get more of the zany, often disgusting, exploits the gang are famous for. I don't think it's quite as much fun as the first film but some people think it's even better so each to their own. However, some scenes are still up there with the funniest, grossest moments I have ever watched.You should already be familiar with the faces by now so there is less of a "getting to know you" feel about many of the skits despite the fact that the hard-living craziness of their lifestyles has taken a serious toll on the looks of many of those involved (it's Knoxville and, ironically, Steve-O who seem to have changed the least) but that's fine because, by this stage, you're either totally onside with the group or still stuck on the sidelines wondering how the hell any human being can find any of this amusing in the slightest.Watch, enjoy and remember: don't try this at home!! See this if you like: "Jackass", Jackass: The Movie, Dirty Sanchez: The Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and very stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jackass Number Two is basically a bunch of guys doing very stupid (and quite often very painful) things. This includes electrocuting themselves, going sledding indoors, putting leaches on very sensitive body areas, messing around with dangerous snakes, throwing full sized medicine balls at each other, branding themselves with hot iron and a lot more hilarious but idiotic stuff.This movie gives you a headache by just watching it. Some parts are quite disgusting - but the movie is still quite funny. I enjoyed watching it - but after a while it did get a bit repetitive. A lot of the stuff they did without any extra protection (like a helmet) and yet they usually come out of the stunt with no serious injuries.Its a good laugh and I enjoyed it - but be warned - some parts are quite sickening. On the DVD - there are loads of extra stunts which they didn't show in the actual movie - so for all the action its worth it to purchase the DVD (or Blu-ray).Its simply: gross, hilarious, stupid and fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So stupid, it's funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie for the first time a few weeks ago. I had recently fell in love with Bam Margera, one of the cast members so i felt i had to watch this.After seeing the introduction I was left with my jaw dropped to the ground. In all honesty i think Jackass 1 and 2 have the best openers I've ever seen to a movie. With the whole cast emerging from dust or smoke you see about 10-15 bulls chasing after them. You could not believe that this could actually be real. With the men jumping in to bins, cars and pools to try and get away from being hurt it shows Bam and Johnny Knoxville run in to a house where they think they're safe. "Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville &amp; welcome to Jackass." He gets trampled by 3 bulls and there it is, the movie begins.With absolutely hilarious skits you can tell the boys have stepped it up a thousand notches since the first Jackass had so much popularity. A lot of people can look at these men and just think this is pure stupidity and no doubt it is. But it is also pure entertainment that no other men have given people in a long, long time. These men pretty much risk their lives for a bit of fun. Shocking yet brilliant, Jackass 2 will have you in fits of laughter from the very start to the very end.Some scenes may make you puke. Watching a man poo, watching a man eat poo or watching a man drink horse semen may not do it for you. If not then there are always the hilarious skits where Johnny Knoxville dresses up as an old man with his balls hanging out, Bam Margera getting penis brands on his ass and the very hilarious Terror Taxi scene. Then there are the scenes that are down right stupid but you can't help but laugh. From Steve-o shoving a hook in his mouth and almost getting bit my a shark to Johnny Knoxville fishing out anacondas from a ball pit and getting bit several times. No doubt the men in this movie could've lost their lives and in some way this is why we love them.After you think it's all ended they finish the movie with a hilarious Broadway dance number. As i said, this movie will have you in stitches and in tears. I have to congratulate these men for daring to do what many others never would just for pure entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first but just as fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been a regular watcher of the show "Jackass" on MTV but when I did watch it I often did enjoy its craziness and fun of it all. I also liked the first movie, "Jackass: The Movie" a surprising lot. "Jackass Number Two" is not as good, fresh and original as the first movie but its done in the same trend as the first movie and the TV show, so how could it have ended up bad?Ever since 2002, after the release of "Jackass: The Movie" it had been more quiet around Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Bam Magera, Wee Man, Chris Pontius and all of the others. No wonder that they were more than keen than to make yet another Jackass movie, 4 years after they all last worked together. Ever since a lot of TV shows tried to jump into on the success of "Jackass" and shows such as "Dirty Sanchez", "Viva la Bam", "Wildboyz" and "The Dudesons" but no matter how absurd some of the things they did in it were it nowhere ever reached the level of "Jackass". Secret of "Jackass" are its persons that are involved. No matter how strange they are and behave, they are all likable in a way and the fun they are obviously having together translates really well on to the screen. It also really feels as if they haven't been gone for 4 years and they just continue on were they had stopped. This is also why I'm still looking forward to the third Jackass movie and even Jackass number 11 and 12.No, the movie is not as good as the first movie was. The crazy stunts and stuff they came up with for this movie were just not as good and original as was the case in the first movie. This of course doesn't mean that this movie isn't good or hilarious to watch. Difference also with the previous movie is that they perform more skits and play more pranks on each other this time. The skits are probably most hilarious since they are so crazy and well done. It's great to see the director Spike Jonze dressed up as an old lady harassing people with her breast hanging out of her clothes. Yes, that is the Spike Jonze who also directed the movies "Being John Malkovich" and "Adaptation.". Or watch Johnny Knoxville as an old man picking fights with random people and embarrass them with his fake attached set of balls that bungle below out of his shorts.The movie still makes you wonder though how much of it and i'ts reactions are real and what got staged. This already was sort of an issue with the first movie but this movie raises this question as well. Sometimes it seemed to absurd to be real.But real or not, the movie will make you laugh for real. It's almost constantly funny, even when they aren't doing any crazy stunts it's still fun because they always do or say something funny instinctively. Like I said before it are its performers and interaction and chemistry between them that makes Jackass irresistibly funny to watch. Even though Johnny Knoxville and Steve-O are obviously the big stars of the show they still know that they are nowhere and nothing without all of the other guys and they also behave like it. They are just a part of the group and their part in this movie is no bigger than any of the others and that's how it should be like.The movie is perhaps also more gross than the previous movie. It features quite an amount of vomiting, drinking horse semen and of course Dave England shows his skills of doing number two's on command.Absurdly and irresistibly fun. Bring on the other Jackass movies!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start with I really couldn't get into this movie at all. But, after a while the sheer momentum of the vile gags grips you and you just have to stay and see "one more stunt". Whilst I think a lot of the gross-out moments are mere fillers there are some classic slapstick scenes that warrant a look and provide great entertainment. I'm amazed this passed for a BBFC certificate with scenes involving excretion, bestiality and some extremely cruel and barf-inducing routines. Neverthleless I felt all of the above shocked (this viewer) into a state of free disassociation and once those moral boundaries were shattered, well, you just have to laugh! Is this Brunel then? Probably not. But I particularly loved the rousing Hollywood finale which firmly pushes tongue through cheek. A lot of pain, a lot of filth, an awful lot of guilty pleasure. Watch, and be amazed and appalled in equal measure.</fullReview>

It&#x2019;s been like 8 years and I don&#x2019;t really find it that funny anymore. But it still brilliantly good at what it is.Times change thing I guess. Jackass is still Jackass all they do is practical joke and do some stupid stunts on each other and on themselves. But this time they really push it really far, some of the stunt could really left someone dead and or hurt beyond bad. I still love the practical joke part though, it still crack me up.It is still funny, like a much longer episode of Jackass on TV with better camera work that is all. I cannot say anything else. It is Jackass. You get what you expected, people getting hurt for your entertainment.I&#x2019;ve seen the unrated version and there is more stuff there, I meant a whole lot more, so I guess I would recommend that.Recommendation: fan will truly enjoy it.Reason to Watch: Everyone in this movie is involved in everything.Reason not to: you&#x2019;re getting too old for this.Rating: 6.5/10 (Grade: C) Please rate Y/N only After Read.</fullReview>

The guys get knocked off skateboards, use an appendage as snake bait , and even put a fish hook through the cheek and jump in the water with a hammerhead shark. I didn't even want to watch the leach and eyeball bit, it looked very nasty. I don't see how they don't get seriously hurt if they are really doing all these crazy stunts. And I think they really are. Like the part where they are trying to pick up an anaconda in balls. And the snake bites Johnny Knoxville several times and draws blood each time, yet he still picks it up. Is that not dangerous? It sure looks like it.FINAL VERDCIT: So if you are into the MTV show, then you'll like this. Just don't eat before you see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How are these guys not dead yet?Seriously? The first Jackass was insane. But "number two" is worse, and significantly so. It's incredible to witness these guys willingly endure such traumatic events, some with brutal consequences, and to see how they face and deal with these extreme decisions. To know that they are all banking a nice paycheck is probably the one and only comfort in this film. I mean, Steve-O shoves a giant hook &amp; line straight through his cheek and jumps into a school of swarming sharks as human bait. It's certainly creative, but it's also so arresting sometimes that it's just not right to laugh. And then what is beyond this?

		<fullReview>Since first appearing in Jackass on MTV in 2000, Johnny Knoxville and his gang of risk-taking reprobate chums have become very rich and very famous. Personally, I would rather wallow in obscurity than eat animal crap, chug down fresh horse semen, stick leeches to my balls or risk death in a variety of unpleasant ways, but each to his own. And while these guys are willing to risk life and limb for the sake of entertainment, I'm going to watch, because, quite simply, the results are hilarious.Taking things several steps further than the first movie, Jackass Number Two (Unrated) is a non-stop thrill ride in which all members of the team experience pain and humiliation in huge doses. Occasionally the skits become a little too scatological and crude for my taste, but the sheer insanity of most of the stunts and pranks mean that it is easy to overlook the less palatable stuff.And, like the first movie, Number Two is funniest when it's not trying so hard to disgust. Jackass The Movie's finest moment was Air Horn Golf, a simple juvenile prank that had me in stitches; in the sequel, my award for funniest moment goes to the old man (Knoxville in heavy prosthetic makeup) with his balls hanging out of his shorts. Spike Jonze's as an old lady who repeatedly flashes her saggy breasts is a close runner-up.Of course, with a movie of this nature, those who are easily offended should stay well away, but the rest of us who enjoy such childish stuff will have a great time. No doubt there is a third film in the offing; I look forward to seeing them try and top the sheer lunacy of Number Two.</fullReview>

My theory is that, if someone is stupid enough to do something like the events portrayed in this movie and is getting paid to do said events, then I might as well watch it all happen. Don't get me wrong. This movie is not what I would consider a quality movie and certainly isn't worthy of any awards, but, for what it is, you will probably find yourself laughing the entire time. And, if you are anything like me, you will probably find yourself feeling guilty for taking such pleasure out of this movie. If you don't laugh at least one time while watching "Jackass Number Two", then, congratulations, you are a boring stick-in-the-mud.You know the plot?or lack thereof. A bunch of people who have no considerable talent or intelligence all get together and pull off a series of painful, mind-numbingly brainless stunts that always end in injury. This is a sequel to a movie based on an immensely-popular MTV series that featured a bunch of people who have no considerable talent or intelligent all getting together and pulling off a series of painful, mind-numbingly brainless stunts that always end in injury. Wait?what's the difference between the television show and the movie? Well, this movie features all of the stunts that cannot be shown on TV?and I mean that very literally. Many of the stunts shown in this movie could never be shown on any television channel?ever. I mean, would MTV ever show a man drinking horse semen? Um, the answer is obviously "no" and for good reason. First and foremost, MTV would probably find itself out of business and, on top of that, parent groups would probably have a field day and soon every channel in the industry would be getting scraped with a fine-tooth comb. Remember post-Janet-Jackson-breast-exposing-during-Super-Bowl-Half-Time-Show? Think three times the size of that and you would have what would occur if "Jackass Number Two" was shown on television without a considerable amount of editing.In comparison to the original, "Jackass Number Two" is not quite as entertaining. There are a few moments when things get quite dull and the laughs almost completely stop. Instead of stunts and pranks, they do scripted little skits. "The Miniature Bathroom Incident" comes to mind. What was that? On top of that, the male nudity explodes in this movie and the homoerotic tendencies are at an all-time high. I don't remember the language used in the first movie, but this movie features 117 F-words (thanks to kidsinmind.com for that little tidbit of useless information). That's overkill if you ask me and only shows that the cast members have nothing useful to say?just in case you forgot the fact that are a bunch of people who have no considerable talent or intelligence (that phrase is getting used a little too much lately). While I typically do not complain about language in movies, "Jackass Number Two" abused my good graces a little too much and for no reason whatsoever. It just didn't make sense to me.When "Jackass Number Two" ended, I realized that this was a sure-fire success--an effective movie if there ever was one. Sure, the effect is to make you laugh so hard that you throw up?or possibly to throw up first and then laugh at that too, but it hits the nail on the head regardless. This movie is funny and, even though you will feel terribly guilty after it all, you will still realize that this is hilariously over-the-top and perfectly effective. Despite a few slow points and excessive bad language, "Jackass Number Two" is a movie that will have everyone rolling on the floor, clutching their stomachs, regardless of age, sex, ethnicity, financial background, etc. Just don't be surprised if you find yourself keeping the fact that you watched in from your coworkers.Final Thought: Funny! Funny! Funny! Shamefully funny! That is all that needs to be said.Overall Rating: 7/10 (B+)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As expected the movie contained things that would make your stomach turn inside out. However, it would also make your stomach and sides hurt with laughter.Outrageous stunts, some are outright stupid but none the less the humor of someone getting hurt just does not seem to fail. The amount of self inflicted pain is enough to make you wonder whether or not the participants are brain dead, or will be soon. But the damage seems to be paying off, after all this is the second one. However, the participants seem to regret the fact that the second one was made, leave it up to friends to come up with the best way to freak you out.The abundance of male nudity almost overwhelms male stupidity; however, the male nudity at times is enough to make you want to throw up. Overall a good movie but, be prepared to turn away once the grossness reaches the limit of your tolerance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What the hell can I say about this movie, Jackass 2? Well, you either are going to love it or hate it. If you don't like sitting in a theater for an hour and a half watching a bunch of dumb sh*ts doing extremely stupid stunts that hurt each other, then you will hate this movie. However, if you enjoy that sort of thing, like me, Jackass 2 is definitely the movie for you! Those who liked the first one, will LOVE the sequel. It's about ten-times more disgusting, twisted and of course, hilarious.There is really nothing more I can say about this movie without spoiling it. All I will say is some of the stunts include a golden dildo, horse semen, a motorized boxing glove, an old ladies knockers, an old guy's sagging balls, fat women, king cobras, penis snake bites and a notorious "fart mask". It's one of the funniest movies of the year in my book. I highly recommend this to only those who can handle and/or appreciate it's depravity.

I actually didn't start watching "Jackass" until a few weeks ago, and then I rented this movie and laughed my butt off! It is so hilarious what these guys do to themselves and to each other. Bam's snake scene -I felt really bad for him! I was surprised he actually *cried*! I was like: "Whoa! Bam? Crying? What's going on?!" And then he's hiding on the top of a van or whatever...But hey - this is Jackass! So it's all good.

		<shortDescription>Even Better Than The First Film, If You're Into This Stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do you describe the plot of a "Jackass" film? A group of guys (including Bam Margera and Johnny Knoxville) do a variety of stupid stunts that could seriously injure or kill them. Nobody dies, but there is plenty of bodily injury to go around.If you're the type of person who didn't like "Jackass" (the show or the movie), I have no idea why you'd watch "Jackass 2". You know what it is: violence, nudity, bodily fluids. But if you liked the show and the movie, I am willing to bet you'll like the sequel even more. I liked it more, as have pretty much everyone I spoke with. Why? Because there is a better flow to this one with less repetition.The only thing this film really lacked for me was Party Boy, because I love seeing Party Boy dancing to his theme song. But I can overlook this (especially because Bunny the Lifeguard shows up).Some of the stunts here were very clever. I liked the teeter-totter with the bull. Some of the rocket-powered wheelchairs and shopping carts were a nice touch. (Allegedly, much of this film was inspired by "Looney Tunes" -- and I will say this was far more entertaining than any of those cartoons.)The best stunt by far was "Terror Taxi". I don't want to give the thing away, but here's the premise: a man dressed up as a stereotypical terrorist (turban, beard and even explosives strapped to his chest) gets in a taxi and asks to go to the airport. This stunt is not only really ballsy, and possibly too soon after 9/11 to be considered funny by most people, but wait until you see where it goes from there. No stunt has ever gone this far and probably never will again.I am not going to say "see this movie" or "don't see this movie". With most films I review, I feel it's a good idea to recommend movies to people and tell them if it's their type of film. Well, in this case, I think you know if you're going to be a fan of "Jackass" or not, because if you're thinking about renting it, you probably already know what to expect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is such a dumb, disgusting, stupid, hilarious movie. I laughed nonstop in spite of myself. Some of the stunts will leave you shaking your head at how anyone would dare blindfold themselves in front of a charging bull, or wrestle a ten foot anaconda. But if you liked the first one, you might as well go pick this one up. This movie has a one demographic, anyone over the age of 40 most likely is not going to like it, so don't bother. Even I had to admit it was a bit too much during some scenes,such as the fish hook, the leeches, or, good God, the horse semen. Because of the increased raunchiness, I will say too that I liked the first one a bit better, but if your looking for stupid to laugh at, your not going to go wrong here. But again, if you find no humor or curiosity in what I mentioned above, please, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Jackass Number Two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the Jackass television series from MTV, or the original movie when it was released in 2002. This sequel was originally planned for release here sometime last year in October, but has been shelved until now. Nonetheless I shall unabashedly say that I had a good time watching this, but I guess it will only appeal to those who have a thing for low browed humour.Jackass Number Two consists of various episodes of skits, ranging from the vulgar to the dangerous, featuring a whole host of comedians cum stunt persons who are willing to risk life and limb to capture on film some ridiculous, nonsensical stunts, or craft deliberate candid camera-ish funny moments to either humiliate, or just have plain fun amongst the cast and crew. The gags range from the simple sucker punch types, to elaborate rouses like Ashton Kutcher's Punk'd. Even their own cast and crew are not spared moments where the joke's actually on them, without them knowing.With Johnny Knoxville (Dukes of Hazzard) being one of the chief pranksters, be prepared for plenty of scenes with naked butts, balls, and hair from the pubic region. Be prepared for loads of camera focus on the body parts, and bodily fluids from animals are not spared either. If it's not your kind of thing and you dismiss toilet humour jokes easily, then steer clear of this comedy, as crassness just got its ante upped in this movie. There's no joke that cannot be made here, and there's a running one throughout the movie involving an old man, and another on an old lady. No holds barred, I tell you.If you want to unwind after a hard day's work, in need of some mindless fun and comedy, and not bother about plot or characters, then Jackass Number Two is an automatic choice. Just do repeat what they do, in the real world.And if you've watched this already, which is your favourite skit?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so I think the guys from Jackass are funny. I can't help it. Maybe I never grew up or maybe there is just something inherent in being male that makes me enjoy watching people get comically hurt. Is this the same gene sequence that causes me to enjoy the Three Stooges? I saw the original Jackass with my long-time girlfriend at the theater. It was outrageous and probably not appropriate but I didn't feel uncomfortable watching it with her. Jackass 2 is a different ballgame altogether. Feces, male nudity, and horrible physical abuse are rampant through this entire movie.In Jackass, the boys looked like some skaters who decided to film their outrageous stunts for laughs. It was, for the most part, all in good fun. In Jackass 2, they are covered with bruises and wounds and -- despite my immature nature -- I had to wonder if maybe they'd taken it a little to far. I think Johnny Knoxville is a comic genius but I worry that we may lose him too young if there's a Jackass 3.Is it funny? Yes! Will it make you worry about yourself if you like it too much? Maybe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a sad, depraved culture we live in. Man fishing. Fart masks. A puppet show, using the male's fifth appendage as the puppet. But it's just so funny.This is normally the point in a movie review where a plot outline is given. But "Jackass Number 2" is without plot. Anyone familiar with the show and two subsequent films would know that there is no plot. It's a series of hilariously painful, disgusting and grotesque stunts strung together. It's not fiction. I don't even know what to classify it as, because it's not a documentary either. It just is. And what it is is funny.I have this theory that the "Jackass" saga is in actuality the most brilliant concept known to the entertainment business. Since the invention of film, people have locked to the cinema, truly all forms of art, as a form of escapism. They watch the films on the screen as a departure from the daily drudgery of life, fantasizing that they're Humphrey Bogart saying good-bye to a one time love in "Casablanca" or they're Superman, zipping around Metropolis, saving lives. And the crux of my theory is that everyone wants to do stupid stuff. Every person has a secret desire to pull one stupid, insane stunt. I guarantee it. I'm not saying they should, in fact I warn against. But everyone has that desire to. And "Jackass" plays on that desire.Relentlessly it plays on it. The viewer will run a full range of emotions. From laughing uproariously to nearly vomiting (and for the exceptionally squeamish, they probably will vomit). The most cringe worthy, for myself anyway, was Steve-O's beer enema. The most hilarious was Bam, who is absolutely terrified of snakes, locked in a trailer with a king cobra. And the most sobering event in the film comes from Chris Pontius after a horse milking stunt when he earnestly proclaims how ashamed he is of himself.Judging this film on the standard criteria is just impossible to do. They aren't acting. There's no script. Mise en sc?ne is the last thing on director Jeff Tremaine's mind when he's trying to capture the running of the bulls. It's shot documentary style. It really comes down to whether or not one can stomach and get joy out of watching a group of masochists cause intentional harm to themselves."Jackass" documenter Tremaine was able to consistently make us laugh. And he new exactly what direction to take the film in order to keep us guessing, and keep us right on the edge of our seats. The film started off tame (by "Jackass" standards, for whatever that's worth), and as the film progressed, so did the extreme nature of the stunts. They would get progressively physical, progressively cringe worthy, progressively hilarious.I there isn't anything inherently wrong. It's just good, wholesome fun. Minus the wholesome. Don't take the family. Finish the popcorn early in case you need a basin in which to? do what some people have done after watching a stunt. Only see this if you can handle it. They put warnings at the start and end for a reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throughout this entire movie i kept saying to myself, what a jackass. but the odd thing was, i was laughing really hard. This movie is really funny. its not high-brow humor, its pretty much in the same line as the first which is really just an extended scene from David Lettermans stupid human tricks, but, as i said, it is funny. There is a lot of male nudity in the movie and in the DVD extras there's even more. Th midget bungee jumping had me rolling over in laughter and i liked it so much i re winded it to see it again. that was funny. the snow in the house was funny too. Then there are the scenes that really made me gag, like the horse semen scene, the fart mask and the leeches all had the fast forward button activated. All in all though, this is one funny movie and the title certainly lives up to its name, these guys are a bunch of jackasses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never got into the series of Jackass, and what few episodes I saw, I thought it was simply OK, nothing special.A long time after the release of the first movie, I eventually got around to seeing it as my girlfriend had already seen it and thought it was hilarious.I watched it, and from the first Ford Mondeo destroying sketch, it was clearly better than the series, pretty funny stuff.This time I went to the cinema to see Jackass Number Two, and I laughed so hard, I got a headache, I got a sore throat and had to take painkillers when I got home.... It was utterly hilarious.If you don't like puerile humour and stupid stunts, then you'll never find it funny, but go and switch off your brain and just watch the film as its intended, to show you the stuff you'd never do yourself, and laugh hard at the end results. Jackass isn't Oscar material and it doesn't pretend to be, it also doesn't pretend that its got a script (?!) along the lines of David Mamet, but when you can hear some of the Jackass guys saying on screen "this really isn't a good idea", you know just how bad things are.... which equals funny! :) Ordinarily, this would be a guys movie, but in the cinema, were plenty of girls who laughed along.Not a date movie, but hell, so funny, I really cannot recommend this film enough.Leave your brain at the door, turn your morality dial down, and for gods sake, don't eat popcorn.... you'll choke on it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Switch your brain off, don't eat anything for six hours and brace yourself for the cinematic equivalent of passing out kidney stones whilst having a fat man rub his 40lbs arse in your face. If that doesn't get you in the mood for Johnny Knoxville and friends, then the thought of seeing grown men drinking the misty fluids of a randy stallion HAS to.Jackass Number Two pretty much takes off from where the original left off. We were left perplexed by Ryan Dunn's decision to insert a toy car to where only a doctor's wristwatch should venture, and subsequent trip to the GP's office ? a stunt even fearless maniac Steve-O dared not attempt. This time, we are thrown into the deep end right from the word go: From the "running of the bull" sequence that opens the film straight to Chris Pontius (the one who dressed in a thong and danced to annoying dance music) dressing his manhood up as a mouse and offering it to a snake. And it only gets worse from there.Amid the nihilistic masochism there are some genuine comedy delights here. Watching Johnny Knoxville dress up as a grandfather, and feed his little'n booze and cigarettes is all the more hilarious for the reactions of the oblivious onlookers around him. The only problem is, is it worth sitting through the decrepit "fart mask" and "arse chug" gags to appreciate the sporadic hilarity in between? There is nothing fascinating about watching people degrade themselves in this way, as the Internet is filled with similar stupidity that lives in a sub-world that knows no restraint. At least Borat and South Park had intelligence, wit and purpose beneath the stupidity. There are only so many times you can see the infinitely rippled exterior of Preston Lacy before barfing into your popcorn bags. In fact ? every time we are blessed with the sight of our nine combatants exposing themselves, revealed are a slew of horrid looking scars. At one point, one psychotic dude lying in a heap on the floor, dressed as a terrorist, with a beard made of pubic hair, mumbles to himself "Why the hell did I agree to do this?" Got me, Charlie.Despite some critics proclaiming the grotesque self-abuse undertaken by our barmy protagonists as achieving some kind of cinematic purity, the truth is it is nothing more than a shocking inclination of what some people will do to gain infamy these days. And whilst around a third of it is absolutely hilarious, your overall enjoyment of Jackass Number Two solely relies on your tolerance of the relentless vomiting, poo eating, horse pleasuring and sperm drinking that enwraps all the funny bits in between.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Does exactly what you expect, and then some. The first movie, was a step up from the TV show with sicker stunts airing uncensored and a gnarly factor that had increased. Surprisingly, Jackass Number Two is even more twisted.The stunts have become more dangerous and spectacular, with some mind blowing painful antics sprinkled with good fun skits to keep that smile turning into a curl of disgust.Knoxville, like always, dominates the proceedings, but this time he has reason to take centre stage as he volunteers for the most dangerous and idiotic of all the stunts, with Bam Magera also proving himself as wild as ever, despite having had his image toned down in 'Viva La Bam'. Surprisingly, the infamous Wild Boys (Steve O and Chris Pontius) seem to take part in fewer of the skits, despite being focal in the previous outings.If you like Jackass or Dirty Sanchez then you will definitely enjoy this film, and will laugh your guts out for the 100 minutes of its duration, if you see it as childish, disgusting or a sad snapshot of the youth culture of today, you will find it as offencive as ever.

		<shortDescription>Puerile and disgustingly hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Male bonding tends to be pretty basic - shared physical activity with maybe a dash of toilet humour. The Jackass team take this to an extreme level. Firstly, horrifically dangerous stunts, often as practical jokes on each other. Add to that jolliness that makes American Pie look like polite chit-chat with the vicar. In a variety of locations (with no connecting story), Jackass succeeds in raising the lowest common denominator to a palpably frightening, disgusting and hilarious level. Try these tricks at home and you might not only risk killing yourself but get arrested if you survive.As the film opens, a group of men are running down a street with wild abandon. Are they celebrating? Drunk? No, as the camera pans back we see they are being chased by a herd of wild bulls. They eventually get tossed about by them and seem to positively enjoy the pain. And that's quite mild. The film soon progresses to such things as rocket-powered shopping trolleys and drinking horse semen.We see a man's penis dressed up as a glove puppet introduced into the cage of a snake with big teeth, moving it on a string to tease the snake until it chomps on it. Later, in a reality-TV type gag, very large snakes bloody a couple of the cast. In 'man-bait', the team go 'fishing' for sharks, using one of their own on the end of line, a fish-hook having been inserted excruciatingly through his cheek. They will stop at nothing, it seems, in search of dangerous gags that are comic, beating each other up by playing dodge-ball with medicine balls blindfolded, or trapping each other with nasty wild animals. John Waters does a brilliant cameo as a magician, making a dwarf disappear in an agonising way. Spike Jonze freaks out passers-by dressed as an octogenarian woman who 'accidentally' exposes herself. Jackass Number Two stages all these quite well, but is on shakier ground over a number of gags involving errr . . . 'number twos' - which are admittedly more gross but less well-staged than in similar but fictional toilet-humour films like American Pie. Some of the gags, such as the terrorist-in-a-cab sketch, seem a little self-indulgent. Jackass Number Two still provoked frequent howls of laughter from the (male) members of the audience at the press screening however, even though I hang my head in shame to admit I was one of them.This is a sick film but, on its own level well-executed. The editing is sharp and many of the laughs are unpredictable. Johnny Knoxville is endlessly amusing in his testosterone-filled persona and if anything is faked (other than things like Spike Jones' breasts) it isn't very apparent. The budget - and their own ingenuity - seem to have allowed them to construct a film that is an improvement on their earlier similar efforts and the directing is tight enough to ensure it doesn't over-run its welcome. What they claim as 'the film's greatest gag' - where one of them pretends to be a suicide bomber to scare a taxi-driver but in which, unbeknown to him, other members of the team have substituted an aggressive actor for the driver - falls a bit flat due to lack of dramatic cinematography. The more outright jet-propelled wheelchair crash, or 'eat horsesh*t' dare, are actually more within this film's comfort zone. Not a movie to take your grandmother to - or maybe even your girlfriend - in fact admitting you've been to see it might label you A Sad Case; but for a lads' night out after a few beers it's probably hard to beat.More puzzling is why films like this should work at all. What is it about watching people willingly inflict pain and embarrassment on each other that brings out the voyeur in us? Many theorists account for various types of horror and revulsion in psychosexual terms. Certainly any Freudian could have a field day developing motives in a film exhibiting anal fixation and masochistic amusements. But on an audience level there is response which is simple catharsis: there's the shock of the imminent threat to life and limb (or unbearable embarrassment) followed by relief as the veil is quickly pulled across and we see the willing victim has survived. This 'negative aesthetic' also serves a useful social function. At a simple level, the bruises of the school rugby field are quickly forgotten amid camaraderie of the locker room. We suffer work we don't like in order to get a pleasurable reward, or listen to our iPods while working out in the gym. The competitive nature of male bonding perhaps encourages such an attitude from an early age - the 'emotional sharing' of typical female bonding perhaps being a less useful attribute for the fierce hunter-gatherer. Normally we don't push things to such levels as Jackass Number Two of course, even in SAS training. In a famous English court case, consenting homosexual men who nailed each others' foreskins to pieces of wood were deemed in breach of the law (the 'Spanner' case). Yet, perversely, there is also an element perhaps of the machismo hero in the Jackass stunts - things that even James Bond wouldn't dare to do - and an element of subversion that appeals to anti-authoritarian types.This puerile film is remarkably funny, and could even remind us how horrific Tom and Jerry is as some of the adventures are based on that cartoon. Most people will give it a wide berth. "Why would you burn him in the first place?" Ryan Dunn is asked after branding his friend with a red hot iron. "Cause it was funny," he replies. The skull and crutches (instead of skull and crossbones) on the 'don't try this at home' disclaimer make us wonder how long they can keep doing these movies before being killed or seriously maimed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not the kind of movie that really merits critical attention. It's not going to win any Oscars - it's really not a very good movie at all. Heck, it's not even really a movie - just a string of short disgusting, gross-out skits strung together in an effort to make entertainment. And as much as every critical bone in my body cries out to give this movie a failing score, gosh darn it, I'm going to give it a much better score. The kind of people who are going to enjoy this movie are not the kind of people who really care what critics have to say, so I'm not going to give some snobby critique of Jackass's quality of surreal existentialism that permeates and commentates on how our society....oh forget it.What's to say? There's no plot development, no character development - no real beginning - there's a semi-enjoyable end that's not nearly as funny as the skit that precedes it, and everything in between reeks of improper, bathroom humor that junior high kids laugh at. It's actually pretty funny.Leave at the door all your preconceptions of a good movie. Jackass: Number Two is just gross-out crap. That's really all it is. I do give the filmmakers this, though: they come up with some pretty imaginative stuff. You'll probably cringe several times throughout, want to throw up a couple times, wiggle and shift uncomfortably as the people on screen do death and vomit-defying stunts. Vomit, crap, urine, semen....virtually every bodily fluid can be seen in Jackass: Number Two. There's nudity, sexual humor abounds, and so on and so forth.It's entertaining. If you're the kind of person who finds this stuff enjoyable, then you will probably really like Jackass: Number Two. I laughed several times. Like I said, it's pretty imaginative stuff. I never once wanted to vomit - though I do have a pretty strong stomach. Just accept the movie's premise: a bunch of idiotic guys do weird crap for fun. Once you get past that, accepting it and going with it, you'll enjoy it. The only flaw in the movie is the sheer excess of all the weird and disgusting stuff. There are several very imaginative, very disturbing skits, but it drags in many places as they do ones that are less interesting. Towards the end things pick up, but in the middle of the movie the drag hurts the overall film's quality. In a half hour TV show this isn't a problem, but with film length celluloid, it's inevitable that boredom will ensue at some point. After awhile the gross crap just becomes desensitizing.On the whole, though, Number Two is an entertaining, imaginative, and above all, disgusting comedy that will leave you with a feeling of pain, nausea, and hilarity. Go see it if you must, but hey, if you know you don't like this kind of stuff, don't bother. You'll just be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious, far better then the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I want to say most of the people who give this a poor review don't like this kind of comedy, the movie is great if you have an open mind and aren't afraid to laugh at some stupid things.This movie is shot just like the TV show with a lot of short clips compiled into one long movie. Some of the scenes don't even have dialog someone will just come out and do something unexpected and it is funny!! The only negative I had is I felt like I wasted money on my Popcorn and Icee, there was no way I could eat or drink anything during this movie I was constantly laughing. I was honestly nervous of drinking some Icee and seeing something that caused me to laugh and shoot it everywhere.If you don't mind some male nudity, and you enjoy Jackass the movie, jackass the TV show, and viva la bam, then for YOUR SAKE go see this movie.And if you DON'T like the first movie, or the TV show. Don't see it, and if you do see it don't post a bad review about it. Hardcore christians who see this and bash it just doesn't seem right to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Hard to say much else other than "Wow."I went to the local AMC, expecting more crazy stunts performed by the usual crew of mischievous deviants that are now so well know for they're offhand performances. However, no possible trailer or teaser, TV spot or internet pop-up advert, could have prepared me for what lay ahead beyond the doors of the theater. After the first half hour, things her funny, while still maintaining that Jackass edge. Soon afterward, things take a turn for the worst. It's all you can do not to look away from the scenes that take place, which will both horrify and disgust you. But you are too attached to the characters that we have come to know and love, and we just can't stand missing them mutilate themselves even more than before.If you really love the Jackass guys, you will love this departure from their TV-tamed Jackass, back to the original brand of sketches, minus all the shopping carts, that were so prevalent in the "CKY" series, that were mainly directed by Bam Margera and Brandon Dicamillo. These sketches are above and beyond what you could ever predict to happen, and are constantly keeping your heart pounding.It's worth a lot of laughs, but you will want to shower when you leave, stunned from what you just witnessed. Don't go with your kids, or parents for that matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holy smoke is this a funny movie! First, I'm a fan of Jackass and I suppose if you're not, you wont like this but it boggles me how anyone could watch this film and not laugh their head off. This movie works on a level that comedies hardly or rarely work on anymore. i.e. Making the audience really laugh. And more than just once or twice. And more than a chuckle now and again. Most comedies only have that and Jackass #2 is so much more. If you actually are open-minded to the humor of it then we're talking about 90 minutes of belly laughs. Its like a roller-coaster. You can get on the teeny kiddie ride (i.e. scary movie 4) or get on the big bad mean ride that everyone is standing around in awe of (Jackass:The Movie 2). If you are a fan and you're not sure this could possibly be as good as the first one or the series, run, don't walk, to the nearest theatre with your highest expectations and get ready to be blown away. Other people do stuff like this (Dudesons, dirty sanchez) but the real difference here is the personalities of the Jackass guys. At least Knoxville, Bam, Steve-O, Dunn, Pontius and Wee Man. I cant say that Ehren or Dave or Preston really add much to their stunts through their personalities but perhaps the formula works with them adding a "normal-doofus" balance to the whole thing. The main guys are just hilarious though ans as has been pointed out by others, surprisingly, Knoxville pulls into the front on this in a big way. Bam and Dunn get hammered away as usual and are hilarious, again as usual. All in all, 10 out of 10, cant recommend it enough to anyone who is a fan and I cant wait for the DVD and #3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There isn't much to say about this film. I mean its Jackass, it is what it is. You already know what your paying for before you ever go into the theater. Just to see some of the stuff that these guys actually think up is insane, and to see them actually execute the stunts is mind boggling. I've never been so disgusted in all my life and actually enjoy it. Jackass 2 by far kicks more ass then the original, although this one seems more Hollywood then the first I still see the determination and pure insanity in Johnny Knoxville's eyes. Just to give you a quick preview of how ridiculous this movie is, just think of the most insane, idiotic, dumbest thing anyone could ever do. Well have you got it yet. OK now go see Jackass 2 and I'm sure they'll be able to outdo you by ten fold. I'm not going to go into anything because I would have to reveal spoilers but I can sum up the movie in one sentence: You'll laugh till you can't laugh anymore. Worth the ticket.

		<shortDescription>Grosser and more gay, wetter, stickier and smellier, too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grosser and more gay than the first one, "Jackass 2" delivers more of the same, only this time it's wetter, stickier and smells much worse. Steve-O puts on a helmet to which is attached a tube that carries gas from a fat guy's ass. When the fat guy farts and defecates, Steve-O vomits into his own face. Chris Pontius drinks horse semen in the film's only censored moment while the other guys puke their guts out at the concept. In the first installment, Knoxville dressed up as an old man and did things most old men would be embarrassed to do -- to put it mildly. In J2, "Being John Malkovich" director Spike Jonze gets made up as an old woman whose breasts look like socks filled with billiard balls. He roams the streets with his breasts exposed and we get to enjoy the horrified reaction of everybody he/she meets. This is one of the funniest segments of the film. Not one to be upstaged, Knoxville revisits his Old Man shtick and adds interest by having disgusting old testicles hanging low and heavy from his shorts and exposing the hairy pills to anybody unlucky enough to see them. While on the subject of Knoxville, it's heartening to see the man still risking life and limb for fun and profit, despite his status as rising Hollywood star. His confrontation with an angry bull and nasty encounter with a snake are both stand-out chapters. As noted above, this is much more gay than the prior feature and is a celebration of all things male and vile (depending on your perspective, of course). The boys still appear to be having fun, although Bam Magera does go on record as saying that he hopes there is no Jackass 3. There's no story, no real point but pure idiocy, and, technically, it's just above good home video (blown up to 35mm, of course), but it's a fascinating document that is as funny as hell most of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was by far and away the funniest movie ever. I gauge funny movies by how much they make me laugh and my stomach is still sore from seeing it two days ago. I would recommend a seat buffer on either side of you to avoid injuring your friends, because you will be jumping around laughing so much. The format is basically the same as the first movie and the TV show, a series of 2-5 minute bits. The main difference between this one and the first movie is that in at least 60-70% of the stunts someone should have (not could have) been either killed or maimed for life. These guys have a serious death wish. The other 30-40% are so gross you want to throw up, because they are most of the time they are. I went back and watched the first movie on DVD for comparison and there are only a handful of bits that were that extreme, this was way different. Here are the spoilers: Portions where someone should have been killed: * Knoxville ride that oil can rocket at least 80-100 feet in the air and lands in the water, if it lands on him he's dead. * Wee man bungees off of a bridge attached to Preston, predictably Preston falls too and if he land on wee-man he's dead. * Knoxville, wee-man, Dunn, and several other are gored by bulls at least 3-4 times. * Dunn bungees in a shopping cart into a garage door * Several people, including a guy in a wheel chair, use compressed air to rocket into the water going at least 50-60 MPH, getting at 100 feet of distance. * Steve-O should have gotten his foot bitten off by a shark Gross portions: * Jerking off a horse and drinking it (I almost lost it) * Some fat farts into a tube leading into a "Fart Mask" Steve-O is wearing, he pukes. * All the guys shave their pubes and England unknowingly wears them as a beard.I've seen a few others say people were talking to the screen like "What are they doing?" "Oh no!!" "Don't do it!!" Exactly the same as my experience. Go see this movie because the guys won't survive another one!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a long time since I laughed so hard during a movie.It's also the first time I almost puked as well. With more dangerous and outrageous stunts than the first release, Jackass 2 raises the threshold of pain and suffering even higher. My personal favourite is the terrorist skit towards the end of the film, a practical joke within a joke, pulled off with such exacting precision that the word genius should be used to describe it. I even dare say that I see some of myself in those guys, who hasn't done something outrageous or dangerous in their life and got a laugh out of it? My only regret is that I didn't think of it first! So my hat off to Johnny, Bam, Wee man, Steve-o,Chris and the rest of the Jackass gang, thank you for taking it to a higher level and making us laugh and sick at the same time. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cons (contains minor spoilers): This is a very disgusting movie. There is much male nudity, vomit, fecal matter, "midget" nudity, fake old breast nudity, horse "nudity", eye ball eating, cheek hooking, underage drinking, and more. You will be grossed out and you should not bring young children! There is no plot and some people will even go as far out to say this should not even be considered a movie. You have been warned.Pros: If you go into this movie knowing "I'm going to be grossed out, I'm going to be shocked, and I will laugh at the pain these men go through..." you will love this movie! This, much like Snakes on a plane, is the kind of movie that is made by the audience. If you walk into the theater and when the title comes up, everyone cheers, than you know the movie will be great. Why? Because the amount of people screaming, laughing, clapping hands, etc will make the action better than, say being alone at home watching the movie. I can't remember more 5 minutes of this movie, which my friends and I had not laughed.The stunts are imaginative, hilarious, and completely idiotic. Just remember, this movie is not for the weak stomached or that of the serious nature. Go into this movie with an open mind and a big sense of humor. If you don't laugh once through the movie, go to the hospital because your funny bone is broken</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass Number Two is just about the funniest movie I've ever seen. Without script or plot, you know not what to expect during the whole film. Sure, it has some funny stuff in it, but there is also some absolutely disgusting stunts. Three people in my theater threw up because of some of these. Like when one of the people started eating horse feces, that made one person throw up. There are some also very mean things done to the people in Jackass 2. Wee Man and someone else, I forgot, was in a locked limo, they couldn't get out. Then the others came and put hundreds and hundreds of bees in the limo, which they were trapped in. They also put some black beads outside of the car, so when they actually did get the door open, they would trip and fall. Or when Bam was trapped inside a cage with a large and dangerous Cobra. And he's terrified of snakes. He was actually crying. So all in all, it was a good movie. I would watch it again, but next time I'd know when to close my eyes! ;-)</fullReview>

I loved this one much more than the first one, they definitely upped the ante.Also, one thing that made me kinda "uncomfortable" in the first movie was the way they really messed with other people, but this time they keep the really messed up pranks among themselves.

This has to be one of the sickest movies I've seen in years and if I was going to compare it to anything Pink Flamingos comes to mind. It has tons of slap stick humor and insane stuns, but there is far more in the way of gross out humor. You'll see human and animal waste, lots of naked men (more scrotum's than you've than you ever wanted to see), and enough vulgarity to make Marquis De Sade smile in his grave. I really don't want to spoil any of the stunts considering that it would really ruin the fun of it. But I can say that Snakes On A Plane has nothing on Jackass 2, and there are some great snake scenes in Jackass 2. It's like this is the kind of movie where you already should know if you'll like it or not just from seeing the trailer.There just isn't much to say, if you have a strong stomach and love to be shocked then you will be laughing your ass off from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's face it: Jackass isn't for everyone. Honestly, that's part of its charm. While studios usually bend over backwards to produce films that will appeal to the maximum number of people, the producers of Jackass: Number Two fearlessly pushes things over the edge.Although it may be redundant to say so, if you didn't like the first Jackass movie or the television program...this movie is not going to change your mind. Please, go see something else...in a theater where you won't be able to hear people in Jackass laughing and groaning.The same cast of characters are here (with only the insidiously funny Chris Raab missing), and this time around the stunts are way, way more intense. Where Jackass One had a few segments that made you wince, Number Two will have you wondering if these guys were really out to kill each other or not. It really isn't any worse than some of the stuff on the CKY videos or Steve-O's DVD's, but there will be a few surprises for those of you who haven't seen these. The boys REALLY, REALLY push the 'R' rating. REALLY.As an aside, I honestly can't imagine why Number Three wouldn't be forthcoming if the release is even moderately successful. There were numerous cuts from this movie shown in previews and TV specials. Who knows? Let's keep our fingers crossed!</fullReview>

Even though i think it should have been longer, i almost threw up in the theater, and that made the entire movie! That is what we go to movies like "Jackass" for! I would not have minded if one particular part wasn't censored, just because it's a movie, and they should be able to show what they want, and they check your ID when you buy the ticket anyway (at least where I'm from), so they should have been able to leave it without.

		<fullReview>I laughed more times in this movie than any other movie in recent years that I can remember. I also cringed more. To say that Jackass is an acquired taste is an understatement. I have no problem watching guys beat themselves up, and their friends, for a laugh. But some things are just a bit hard to look at straight on. Most notably, a beer enema, and manual masturbation of a horse (and the drinking of the results). But overall there are so many hard laughs in this movie, that at some points I found myself gasping for breath. They stress that you don't try any of these stunts at home, but some of them would be fun to attempt. My favorites being Firehose Rodeo and several attempt to jump a lake through use of several, shall we say jet-propelled vehicles ranging from a shopping cart, to a full sized rocket. Johnny Knoxville, who surprised the Hell out of me by turning out to be a talented actor, is the ringleader of this circus of freaks. Bam Margera continues to torture his parents, Steve-O proves to be someone I would never want to meet in real life, and Wee Man turns out to be one of the most daring, and foul mouthed of the bunch. Watch for Wee Man's adventure with a parachute and a high powered fan. I was in tears. So yes, there is no such thing as good taste when it comes to Jackass...and thank GOD for that! These guys will do anything for a laugh, and as long as they do, I'll be watching.</fullReview>

If you are a fan of jackass this movie will blow you away. 2 completely pushes the limits to anything Knoxville and the crew have brought to jackass. If you are like me who before seeing the movie says: "What else can they possibly thing of." Well you will see,they bring out everything in this movie pulling off the most dangerous,disgusting,and hilarious stunts I have ever seen. Some people may not like the ending much because of the whole musical thing, but I still found it hilarious. Johnny Knoxville proves to be the craziest man I know in this film, showing he is still down for anything. He was probably the best out of everyone in this movie. He wasn't scared to do anything and you will see that mostly all the other guys on the team will pussy out at one point in the film showing weakness, but Knoxville remains the craziest guy. I have respect for all of them because they all do ridiculous stunts. This movie is a MUST SEE for Jackass junkies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass #2 was hilarious. I was laughing for a majority of the show. The stunts that they come up with are so original and it makes me wonder how they come up with half the stunts they do. This one is so much crazier than the first. These guys are the dumbest geniuses i have ever seen.The only people crazier than these guys are probably the Dudesons. It was so entertaining it felt like it was only 30 minutes long, time flies when your having fun. If you have a tough stomach its definitely worth seeing, just don't close your eyes, its got a lot of small funny parts that go by fast.</fullReview>

My top 3 favorite parts were the Arabian guy in the taxi, the fire hose rodeo and o ya the whole movie was so funny go and see it as soon as possible my friends really liked i don't care what other people say it is so funny.The opening is one of the worst things i have seen in my life it is too sick and painful to even watch or talk about you will see when you watch the movie. I give this a movie a 10 because it is way better than the first jackass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's one thing seeing a movie like this at home, but another when you see it in theaters. I just went and saw it and can honestly say that it wasn't a movie, it was an event. Never before has a Jackass film gone this far, and never before did I find myself holding my stomach in laughter after 80% of the scenes. This movie isn't for the faint of heart however, and I wouldn't be surprised if a good many of people who've seen it have "tossed their lunch." Another thing that people should recognize is that comedy isn't easy, especially physical comedy like this. Many of these scenes stood-laughing in the face of and wavering-over the edge of death. There was an amazing amount of risk and effort put into this movie. It seems like it ought to have been the most physically exhausting movie ever made. Furthermore, if you think that all of the comedy in here is just them showing off how stupid they can be, you would only be half-right. There is also a great deal of wit involved in this movie, so screw the critics that will tell you otherwise. They wouldn't know a good time if it launched them off a dock into a lake. Ladies and gentlemen, you're in for a surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best five dollars i've spent in a while. I can honestly say that you cannot over hype this movie because you are guaranteed to be shocked. If you liked Jackass the movie then you will love Number Two. It Exceeds the stunts from the first movie. There are less pranks on the public because of their fame, but they do disguise themselves for some pranks on random public. This is the kind of movie that could be watched over and over. It does contain a large amount of vomiting and bleeding so it is not for anyone that is easily disgusted. Thes guys are the perfect example of guys doing whatever they want and getting paid for it. The world would be a less stressful place if more people acted like that.</fullReview>

Johhny Knoxville really puts himself on the line with this one. I swear these guys almost killed themselves several times during the filming. The movie goes by so fast, it really leaves you wanting more. During the movie, you see everyone has bruises all over their bodies from the previous stunts. These guys are super crazy.

		<fullReview>I saw it last night and the place was packed. I had high expectations for it and I was not disappointed. The gags are hilarious. The crowd laughed and was shocked by each stunt. It was incredible. You won't believe anything from the first stunt (It involves a snake and Chris Pontius's privates) to the last stunt (It involves Ehren Mcgehehey and pubic hair and a taxi driver). I laughed through everything. It is an incredible movie. Don't listen to any critics reviews because they will call it stupid and idiotic or a bad message to children. But I say Who gives a sh*t. It is great fun and you'll love it. Just close your eyes when they do the "Magic Trick" scene. You'll gag or cover your mouth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many others, when I first went to see this film i thought to myself "Theres no way this will be better than part 1. I was mistaken. Jackass: Number Two manages to blow not just the original movie, but the entire series out of the water. Many of the skits were downright genius, such as the one where Chris Pontius, dressed as Satan, is shot out of a manhole onto a sidewalk and starts to protest "Keep God out of California". Or the toro totter, which is a four sided seesaw, with the object of the game to be the last individual on the tower after the bull (toro is Spanish for bull BTW) is released. Although most of the skits are completely new ideas, a couple of classics make the rounds in this film, such as the old people bit. Be prepared though, as this movie is at least three times as gross as the original. You will see either a set of balls, an ass, human feces, or a combination of the three at least once every five minutes. Then again, that will only add to the fun. Be prepared going into this one, its a 95 minute ride filled with chaos and laughter the entire time.</fullReview>

Although Raab wasn't there, you hardly notice with all the crazy stuff going on. I really cant describe the how funny it was, the only thing i can say is that everything was original and well thought (if there is such a thing in this genre).The reason i didn't give this movie 9 out of 10 was because i almost threw-up my very expensive snack....4 times!!! But i did drink a slushie when a funny part happened and shot slushie out of my nose. Folks, don't drink while watching this movie, you will shoot it out your nose and/or spit it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, an obvious disclaimer to get out of the way: if you dislike the TV show, or disliked the first installment, you will despise this film. The only thing that's changed is the quality of what's done - the nature of the stunts are all the same.That said, this is the only sequel I know of that 100% blows the original out of the water. Johnny Knoxville has said in interviews that a lot of his inspiration for this film came from watching cartoons like Tom &amp; Jerry and Looney Tunes, and it shows. Those cartoons were masterful absurdist comedies in one genre, and this is a masterful absurdist comedy in another one.Perhaps because they had a source for inspiration, the stunts are all better. More inventive, on the one hand, and much better executed - with more cameras, and better props so that things (for the most part) seem to go more or less as intended the first time around. Mercifully, harassing innocent bystanders (or Bam Margera's parents) is kept to a minimum; the vast majority of the time, the victims are the Jackass boys themselves. They even layer pranks on pranks, telling people they're going to do a stunt and then secretly changing it to do something else instead.While it would be probably frowned upon if I suggested seeing this movie while under the influence, the 6-pack of beer I drank before seeing it decidedly enhanced my viewing experience.</fullReview>

Good movie, no way Oscar worthy but its a good reality comedy thats for sure, it really topped the first in every form, that really went the distance, occasionally overboard, i did some some blood shed and tears falling, which is also funny because of that fact that they had the choice but did it anyways, often times i thought maybe they just have a death wish, but if they do decide to make a Jackass 3, i hope these guys have really good life insurance plans because it will be hard to top this one, funny movie all around..some may not agree, but who cares what they think, if you don't like it you shouldn't have watched it in the first place.</fullReview>

All the clips in the movie trailer are just the tip of the iceberg. What makes this movie so good is the fact that most of the stunts have not been done by them before. They came up with new material for this movie. But they still have some of there usual, so, if you can't deal with male nudity, and vomit, don't go see this movie...let your ticket go to someone who will enjoy if. You are guaranteed to laugh your ass off. The whole Jackass crew really outdid themselves on this one, I can't think of another way to put it...You really have to go see for yourself.

		<fullReview>I've must say that I've had a really hard time waiting for this movie to come out since Jackass Number 2 was announced, and to put it bluntly, this movie exceeded the original. The Jackass crew went from the funny pranks of Jackass The Movie to complete shock and awe for the creation of this gem, and while I obviously can't recommend everyone to see it by sheer nature of the beast, it should be seen by everyone who enjoys seeing someone making a jackass of themselves. With plenty of shocking moments that almost make you question if what you're seeing is real, this movie goes above and beyond anything in the first Jackass movie. Definitely not for your young-lings, so save that cash and go twice and see it's sheer wonder on the big screen - It's the best way to view this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the first Jackass I thought it would be impossible for them to top themselves; but they did! Same great cast, well executed stunts and pranks, plus hilarious antics. It was the most hilarious movie i have ever seen in theaters. Brilliant. I have never laughed that hard at a movie in my entire life. There was never a period of more then 3 minutes of silence throughout the theater. Everybody was enjoying themselves, and laughing out loud. The show does not do the movie justice. Everything is so intense and extreme, there is not one dull moment. I give it 2 thumbs up, 5 stars, and I cannot wait for it to come out on DVD so I can see all the deleted stunts and bloopers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"That which does not destroy me, makes me stronger." - Nietzsche "We must embrace pain, and burn it as fuel for our journey." - Kenji Miyazawa "Jackass 2" finds a troupe of daredevils, clowns and idiots subjecting their bodies to huge amounts of pain, risk and abuse. The payoff of this abuse is supposed to be our laughter, but it's clear that the Jackass troupe, who come across as a merry band of bohemians, skaters, magicians and plain ole anarchists, themselves derive moments of almost sadomasochistic pleasure from the pain they endure. This is not just comedy. This is pain as an affirmation of life, pain as an almost sexual thing, pain as a means of bringing one closer to being, to one's own corporeality; I bleed therefore I am.Nietzsche himself touted pain as the essence of joy, and believed that pleasure and pain were not opposed to one another, but go together. The strength of one is the strength of the other, he said, and to pursue pleasure is to go headfirst towards pain and vice versa. Which, in a wider context, is why affluent societies increasingly find themselves either drifting from hedonism to sadomasochism, or suffering hugely despite material contentment.The Jackass crew captures this paradox. The troupe spends most of their time in fearful, giddy anticipation of pain, then in a kind of quasi-ecstatic pain, and then in jubilation at having survived the pain. As this drug rush lasts only moments, the troupe then finds itself quickly hopping to the next painful set piece. In real life, many of the crew would develop dangerous drug addictions.Unsurprisingly, the film is relentlessly corporeal, stressing toned, muscular bodies, feces, vomit, semen, blubbering flabs of fat, grotesque characters, dwarfs, midgets, freaks, cuts, bruises, defecation, injuries and torn flesh. Few films convey the sheer fleshiness of the human body, and how willingly we embrace pain in the pursuit of morsels of pleasure.Like ascetic monks, who masochistically revoke all pleasure, there's also something almost spiritual or monastic about the way the Jackass troupe flagellate themselves in the name of eliciting laughs. Of course they could also be raging idiots. It takes either a God or a moron to put a leach on one's own eyeball.8/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so ready to hate this. Honestly, the mere appearance of "Jackass Number Two" directly contradicted everything Johnny Knoxville and director Jeff Tremaine said after the first movie wrapped and I personally felt that this was simply the same bunch of guys milking it for all they were worth. Watching "Jackass 2.5" didn't do much to defy my expectations either, being little more than half-arsed efforts that could have been DVD extras. Yes, I was all ready to hate this. But by the time the first skit had finished, all that had been forgotten. As a fan of the TV show and first movie, it was like the boys had never been away and thank God, they've pulled out all the stops with this one.Like before, this movie follows the same haggard bunch of skaters, stunt men and drunks (Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Chris Pontius, Steve-O, Wee Man, Preston Lacy, David England and Ehren McGhehey and guests) as they put themselves through a variety of absurd and extremely painful stunts and humiliations for your amusement. There are less hidden camera stunts than before (which is good because they were usually weaker than the other skits) and more emphasis on nudity, swearing, head shots and serious altercations with rather nasty examples of wild life. But please remember that this is strictly for adults only, though hugely immature adults obviously.Whether you'll enjoy "Jackass Number Two" or not depends largely on whether you enjoy this sort of nonsense. Personally, I do and the reduction of rubbish like Party Boy is good. There is too much Old Man stuff involving Knoxville and Spike Jonze in masses of latex make-up but again, this is personal preference. Like a circus, there is something for everyone so if naked skateboarding midgets aren't your thing than maybe the rocket-powered shopping trolley will be. It's supreme silliness and assuming you have an immature, childish streak in you, this is a movie you really shouldn't miss. However, if you're sensible and don't enjoy seeing someone hunting for snakes in a ball pit then you'll probably turn away from this so fast that your face will spin around to the back of your head. Gratuitous shots of poo, puke and blood (all real, remember - this is one film that is strictly anti-Hollywood so don't expect things like a budget or effects) also won't be to everybody's taste but I never felt close to puking myself. And guess what - that's also a personal thing.It may be a cop-out but whether you like "Jackass Number Two" depends largely on whether you liked the first one. If you did then chances are, you would have already seen this movie and if you can't stand the sight of any member of the Margera family then nothing I say here will change your mind. For me, I remember snorting with laughter at moments during the first movie and I will admit to laughing out loud at times during this one. It's not consistent enough to score higher but when it is on form (my favourite bit was the switcheroo with Phil and April - genius!), this is a really funny film. It's slightly better than the first one but by its very nature, "Jackass Number Two" will be hilarious at one point and then tedious the next. Stick with it and try to not choke on your popcorn when Steve-O inhales something nobody should really be inhaling...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never followed the TV programme Jackass,but I enjoyed pretty much the first movie of that group,specially on the surrealistic moments which did not include rude humor but some touches of humanity or subtle humor.Jackass Number Two shows more extreme things than the ones we saw in the first part but it lost big part of the humor and subversion from the first part.I mean,I did not laugh so much as in the first part,but still I laughed with this second part.But a lot of things in this part two feel forced.It seems that the Jackass group was so obsessed for doing something more extreme that the humor does not flow naturally.Another negative point from this movie is the animal abuse.I do not see the motive for scaring animals.In the positive sight,I appreciate how brave this group is with what they do.I honestly do not understand the reason for risking their lives(Money? Fame?)but I appreciate that this people have enough talent for laughing for themselves.The bravest member of the group is,no doubt,Johnny Knoxville.Jackass Number Two is more extreme than the first part but it lost a lot of the humor and grace.In spite of that,I laughed and I had a good time watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nobody Will Ever Top These "Jackass" Stunts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The kindest thing that I can say about "Jackass 2 Unrated" is that it is the most vile, disgusting, and repellent movie that I have ever seen in my entire life. On the other hand, I spent most of my time laughing my ass off at this hideously hilarious movie. Mind you, "Jackass 2" makes the first "Jackass" movie look extremely tame. In fact, if there is a "Jackass 3," it is going to have to top "Jackass 2" and Johnny Knoxville and his bunch are really going to have to dig deep to come up with those gags. The thing that sets "Jackass 2" apart from the previous "Jackass" is that this time when the guys aren't performing stunts to alienate other people, they punk?as Ashton Kutcher might do?themselves. Some of the normal nitwit gags include riding a mini-motorcycle at high speed down a short track to a do a loop-the-loop but crashing; rolling downhill in giant caterpillar tires; and launching themselves aloft on rockets that crash only a few seconds later. The best and most nauseating stunts include milking a stallion of its semen and drinking it. Steve-O dons a bubble helmet called a fart mask and promptly chucks up when the stench of a fat man's gas hits him. Steve-O does the butt chug where his companions pour beer down a tube stuck in his rectum. One of the biggest gags involves them shaving their pubic hair to supply one of their unsuspecting own with material for a beard. Johnny Knoxville masquerades as an old man and walks through town with his testicles dangling from his shorts. Later, they pull the same stunt but this time he masquerades as an shriveled up old lady who gets her dress caught in a car door and when she walks away, it rips to show her sausage-shaped breasts. When they aren't trying to gross everybody else out, these freewheeling stunt guys see if they can keep from puking after performing some of their more objectionable gags. The opening gag is probably as stylist as any "Jackass" movie will ever get. The film opens with stirring music from "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" as dust rises and we see our protagonists emerge from this dust cloud with steers charging in hard pursuit after them. Think of the old TV show "Candid Camera" gone wild and you'll be prepared for what follows, unless you are of the squeamish variety. Of course, as they point out at the beginning and the ending, nobody but professional stunt men should perform these stunts. Some people would never set their eyes on this kind of nonsense and people who are easily offended should avoid it at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rated R for extremely crude and dangerous stunts throughout, sexual content, nudity and language.I have never seen the TV series or the first Jackass film.This was on the movie network so I decided to check it out.There is no real plot in this movie, its just basically a bunch of funny gags and stunts put together.Now, I find these to be fairly funny however there are plenty of people who will hate and be disgusted by this film.There are also little children who may copy the things shown in this film, if you have impressionable children, keep them away from this film.I think that is the main reason why the film is rated 18+ in Quebec,Canada when movies that are way worse such as The Evil Dead,Clockwork Orange,Scarface etc, have either 13+ or 16+ ratings.Anyway, if you like Jackass, watch Jackass Two, you will not be disappointed.I have never even seen the TV series and I laughed.</fullReview>

But that's the thing about Jackass The Movie: It was fresh, original, and FUNNY. Jackass Nnumber Two was funny, yes, and things start out funny... but then you see Bam Margera trapped in a horse cage with a snake and he's almost crying (!) and that's where the humor starts to fall off. The Terror Taxi prank was one of the lamest things I've seen, and don't get me started with Steve-O and the fishing hook (oe Steve-O drinking the horse urine). The ending with the bear claw and musical was DUMB. It's as though everyone involved with this movie was like, "Let's just get this over with."Yes, I liked Jackass Number Two, I laughed, but I liked the original better. And please no Jackass Number Three. The originality of this series has gotten stale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There isn't much to say about this film. I mean its Jackass, it is what it is. You already know what your paying for before you ever go into the theater. Just to see some of the stuff that these guys actually think up is insane, and to see them actually execute the stunts is mind boggling. I've never been so disgusted in all my life and actually enjoy it. Jackass 2 by far kicks more ass then the original, although this one seems more Hollywood then the first I still see the determination and pure insanity in Johnny Knoxville's eyes. Just to give you a quick preview of how ridiculous this movie is, just think of the most insane, idiotic, dumbest thing anyone could ever do. Well have you got it yet. OK now go see Jackass 2 and I'm sure they'll be able to outdo you by ten fold. I'm not going to go into anything because I would have to reveal spoilers but I can sum up the movie in one sentence: You'll laugh till you can't laugh anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanks Jackass for spawning a culture dumbasses while making art without meaning to!! See, these skater type dudes with tatts and scabs go around hitting themselves with stuff in totally more elaborate ways. Then they wrestle animals of differing danger levels, then they wrestle each other. Then they make elaborate poop and/or pee stunts involving something harmful and/or illegal in some states. They drink shots of horse semen. They hit each in the nads. They blow things up a practical joke type ways. They hit each other in the face. And so on. The main dude, Johnny Knoxville, is totally hot in a heroin scabby type way and there is a little person.Funniest movie in years!! I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But kids are trying this at home and they are maiming themselves in the process for all to witness on youtube.Anyway, not much to report. Jackass Number Two is funny. Hilarious. It made me laugh, granted I was three-sheets to the wind, but understand this: these men are not Jackasses.Quite the contrary, these men are geniuses of a third kind. This is what post-post modern art looks like people. It is art. Yes, it is.For those not anywhere on this planet or anywhere near a TV during the last several years here is an explanation of Jackass: See, these skater type dudes with tatts and scabs go around hitting themselves with stuff in totally more elaborate ways. Then they wrestle animals of differing danger levels, then they wrestle each other. Then they make elaborate poop and/or pee stunts involving something harmful and/or illegal in some states. They drink shots of horse semen. They hit each in the nads. They blow things up in practical joke type ways. They hit each other in the face. And so on. The main dude, Johnny Knoxville, is totally hot in a heroin scabby type way and there is a little person (dwarf).Sounds like art to me. You see these guys do this without trying to make art. Their intention is simply to make each other laugh, vomit, cry, and/or bleed. The simple fact of their unwillingness to call these stunts anything more than jackassery makes them my vote for most influential performance artists of their time.True their fame was born from the festering recesses of MTV's demographic marketing hubs but darn it even evil can spawn beauty. Just look at the Bush daughters.Thanks Jackass for spawning a culture of dumbasses while making art without meaning to!!</fullReview>

Yes, the crazy guys from MTV got together and made a sequel to their first movie. and i must say, it has to be one of the grossest, perverted, disgusting, stupid...and hilarious DVDs i've rented.Well, Johnny Knoxville leads a group of pain-freaks on an adventure filled with pain, stupidity, and dangerous, funny, and even fun stunts (like the big tires going downhill). We, the audience, witness Bam margera get his butt cheeks branded with a hot iron held by Ryan Dunn. We witness Weeman jump off a bridge with a bungee cord attached to Preston lacy, the fat-ass of the jackass crew. we see Chris pontius drinking horse semen and Steve-o sticking a hose up his ass.It's a great show. definitely worth a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I watched this movie, I completely believed that there could never be a movie out there that really pushed the limit on what is considered okay. This movie is so wonderfully messed up that people who have won on Fear Factor would cringe and look away. I admit, I did't have the guts to watch one part, but that is the marking of a movie that is actually worth the watch. 95 minutes of this movie wasn't nearly enough, and that is my only complaint. This movie is brilliant and is so much better than the first one. There are even some seriously good quotes in this movie, which actually surprised me. I appreciate the fact that someone took the time to make such a demented, wonderful movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The gang is back! This is an instant classic in the comedy genre in my opinion. I don't believe I've ever laughed so hard in my life. Every event and every dumb thing they did in this film was absolutely hilarious and if you didn't laugh once, you don't have a sense of humor. I never saw Jackass Number 1 but since I'm a big fan of the shows, "Jackass", "Wildboyz", and "Viva La Bam", I couldn't resist watching it. Chris Pontius is my favorite person in the movie and I think he might be one of the funniest people in the world. Classic line from the film, after Ryan Dunn burnt the shape of a penis on Bam Margera's ass: "Why did you do that?"-Bam's Mom "Because it was funny."-Ryan Dunn.Overall, this is probably one of my favorite comedies that I've ever seen and I hope they make a Jackass Number 3 in the near future. I highly recommend it! Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10 **** A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you hate burp, fart, penis, and poop humor, than you will hate Jack Ass 2. I on the other hand felt it was the funniest movie I have ever seen. I had to close my eyes several times due to some really gross parts, but I still laughed. Most of the movie they would do something brutally painful and I would scream "OH!" And that would be followed by laughter. It was non-stop to be perfectly honest. I thought it was 10 times funnier than the original. They went beyond pusing the envelope on this one! You could tell that they had a much larger budget to work with. The make up gags were classic. It was also nice to see Preston in some of the funnier gags. Conspicuously missing is "Uncle Vito" aka Vince Margera. He got popped for groping a minor at an autograph session in Colorado, so he got cut from the movie to avoid scandal and decreased box office draw. This is a must see for any fan of the original show and first movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass number 2 was way better than the first one. Some of the stunts were pretty nasty but still funny definitely one of my favorite movies. They did some of the greatest stunts in history and should definitely keep doing either the show or make more movies. but i thought that they should have put more stunts with Bam in it because he is by far the hottest person of the cast. Johnny was a maniac in this film. He did some of the stupidest things i have ever sen anyone do. like the beginning when he gets chased by the bulls or when he blindfolds himself and lets a bull run into him. But the best stunt preformed by any of the cast members was the four way see-saw with the bull running around them. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone mature enough and without a weak stomach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good thing I passed on the popcorn and soda, otherwise the couple in front of me would have been wearing a reality show version of their Jackass experience during the "animal act" segment. Truly a filthy lame excuse for entertainment. Classic comedy, its not. Like a dog to its own vomit, this movie just keeps coming back. Still, some pretty funny stuff, but bogs down in the middle with a litany of unimaginative stunts and gags. It's rare that I laugh out loud at a movie, but I did at this one a few times. Not as creative or imaginative as the first one, but still causes enough of a physical reaction to pass muster. I agree with the cast of this waste of digital projection technology that there should never be a Jackass Number Three. I wonder if the CIA will try to use some of these techniques to interrogate detainees, instead of doing it just for kicks, like these idiots.</fullReview>

If you have never seen the TV show, well, you may be mystified at why anyone would make a movie of this.I thought about 30% of this movie was some of the funniest stuff I have seen in a long time. At the opposite end, about 10% was just unwatchable--I could have done without the excrement, and worse. The movie has been called gross and disgusting, and it certainly earns those adjectives.However, Spike Jonze and the various "senior citizens" having clothing fallout--absolutely inspired. There was a lot of this film that I couldn't stand, but a few of the parts made the whole thing very worthwhile.</fullReview>

If you don't like Jackass, don't expect this film to convert you.It is nice to see that Knoxville still has balls... he does some painful stuff in this movie.The opening stunt was a waste, and wasn't nearly as funny as the guys seemed to think it was. But a few of the longer bits (i.e. the taxi prank-on-a-prank) redeem it.If there is a third Jackass movie... I think they will have run out of material. That said, this is the only thing Knoxville is good at... his attempts at "acting" in "real movies" are pitiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the first movie......even though I never had cable or saw the TV series before. I've seen parodies and have heard people talking about the TV serial. I only saw the first one because of my curiosity and the 99 cent rental price. I just watched the second one today (in the theater), And even though I laughed my ass off....some scenes seemed to be faked.....like the "fart funnel" scene, where steve-o was on the receiving end of the fat dudes fart...most of the puking in the movie seemed faked and I felt cheated in a small way for it. They may think that you can fake what jackass does for a filler scene, but that just doesn't fly with me. Even the funny but questionable terrorist sketch seemed faked that it was painful to watch....the dude riding in the cab with the toothless fool was carrying a camera the whole time!! I hardly ever see movies in the theaters, but I'm glad I saw this one and got to laugh with all of the other peeps at the movie. I just wish Hollywood would stop messing with a great thing....and let it be itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be completely honest with you this film was great. It's got no real structure ( which is to be expected from a jackass film ). Just random stunts that make you laugh your head off.As merry pranksters they have no match, and as they age (Knoxville is 35 now), they only grow in appeal. The laughs here are so big - I'm talking doubled-over, fall-out-of-your-seat big - that they are meant to be shared in a theatre full of similarly helpless viewersIt involves Johnny Knoxville, and his chums doing what the do best. If you've ever seen the television programme on mtv, and you enjoyed it I strongly suggest you go watch this film. It's just like the first only a lot more meaning-full, slightly longer and many more stunts. It's great to see the guys back on the screen enjoying themselves and entertaining us. As awesome as it is stupid (and that's pretty awesome) Jackass Number Two is an idiot's delight. Simple, unadulterated sub-mental joy.If there were an Academy Award for Picture Most Likely to Make an Audience Puke, then Jackass: Number Two would win it hands down.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is the Reader's Digest Condensed version of the below- this movie is hilarious, get some friends together and see it. And for all of you art house film people, try to sit through one movie that is not morbidly depressing. You will feel all warm and tingly inside once you walk out of the theater. Okay, so you are not going to get a deep social commentary on the current status of Kazakistan through the eyes of a struggling young man, nor will you get cinematography of Stanley Kubrick or Darren Aronofsky. You are going to get a group of guys hurting themselves in new and creative ways. Pure entertainment. I am a film buff, but sometimes when we see a motion picture we don't want to think or feel some state of pure emotion. We just want to laugh, hang out with friends, and watch our idols like Chris Pontius, Steve-O, Preston Lacy, Weeman, Spike Jonze, Bam Margera, and Johnny Knoxville preform stunts and pranks the likes of which mankind has never seen. The only depressing part about this film is the fact that no one else in this generation is going to get an opportunity to hit pay dirt for being completely stupid. Go see this movie. Get some friends, and walk in expecting the most laugh out loud hilarious film you have ever seen and walk out feeling satisfied. Unless you actually enjoyed that Lost in Translation crap. In that case, avoid this film, or any other remotely decent movie for that matter.</fullReview>

Johnny Knoxville was on top of his game and sort of shucked his Hollywood suit to step down in the trenches again. I went to the first one with a guy friend, this time my wife decided to attend and to my amusement she laughed as hard if not harder than I did. I would not recommend taking small children because the content of this movie might take an adverse affect in their later years lol.

We have objects placed into the rectum of men. We have men showing their buttocks off. We have men holding their penises, leaving little to the imagination.Who is the targeted audience? Impressionable teenagers who connect with these skateboard-riding, fun loving "guys". They dress like teenagers, act like teenagers, and do the things teenagers like to do. Now that their interest is captured, the young audience laughs along at the blatant homosexual behavior. They don't believe they're watching suggestive gay material designed to sexually confuse the impressionable youth. It's subliminal, planting the seeds of homosexuality into the minds of today's youth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friend who recently celebrated his birthday (see my Invincible review) asked if I'd like to see Jackass Number Two. Since it would be with his sisters, their boyfriends, and the son of one of them and we'd eat at a nearby Mexican restaurant beforehand, I said sure. Now I'd seen the first Jackass which I found funny and disgusting so I knew what to expect here. I wasn't disappointed what with the snakes, penises, fecal matter, old man scrotum, and old lady breasts, I once again laughed and cringed. There was one skit about terrorists and taxi drivers that almost killed the laughter until the end when all was revealed. There was also an amusing Busby Berkely parody that some young viewers may not get but I enjoyed immensely. So based on my enjoyment of many of the skits whether gross or not, I'm giving this one a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Knoxville and his merry group of pranksters--who must have testicles made of steel--return for more gut-busting, potentially bone-breaking stunts. These stupid human tricks range from skateboarding intentionally into a wall to drinking horse semen... Funny to some, moronic to others, and disgusting to everyone, this popular theatrical expansion of the MTV series is certainly lively, but whatever appeal it has is ultimately due to Knoxville and his fearless friends (including Bam Margera, who gets branded like a cow; Chris Pontius; Wee Man, a little man who walks through a convention room naked; special guest John Waters; co-producer Spike Jonze; and even Margera's what-the-hell folks). If there's anything worthwhile about the movie, it's the charisma of the guys themselves, although when they pull mean-spirited surprise pranks on each other it doesn't seem to sit too well with the victims--or with the audience. The worst moments are the gags with Jonze disguised as a half-naked old lady ("Candid Camera" stuff), and a trip to India which could've been left out completely. Knoxville, a born star, is amusing riding a rocket into a lake or facing down two separate bulls (you would think one such encounter would be enough), but if frat-boy pranks aren't your thing, wait for Knoxville's next legitimate movie. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Johnny Knoxville and his team said otherwise, it was obvious from the box office numbers of the first Jackass movie that sooner or later that there would be a sequel. It turned out to be a bit later rather than sooner, but the Jackass boys are back in this disgusting, revolting, and only occasionally funny follow-up. Like its predecessor, Number Two is about being outrageous and as vulgar as possible with no other goal in sight. In terms of grossness, Number Two outdoes the original. There are scenes of mass vomiting, acts of defecation, and many stunts involving genitalia (human and otherwise) that make anything from number one look tame by comparison. It's as low-brow as humor can possibly get. Some of it is laugh worthy, though the segments miss more than they hit. After a while, all the attempts of being shocking get old. There are far too many segments involving poop and exposed body parts along with segments that feel like they are in the mix just to replicate the show and/or previous movie. Knoxville should have listened to himself when he said one was enough. Recommendation: Wait for DVD. There might be deleted sketches that are better than the ones contained in the final cut. 4/10</fullReview>

I don't think that this genre will ever die out, but this basically was a bunch of frat boys running around and trying to out gross each other.I know, like I said, I expected very little and I got that.It was almost like a hour and a half long TV episode. If you want to take your kids to it, under age kids. You will see more genitals then you would normally want to see.There are some very talented guys in this group who will pigeon hole themselves in if they continue to do this one trick pony stuff. There is at least 4 gross out scenes, which make no sense other then to just gross you out. This movie left me wanting more young guys in old people suits. I think that stuff is hilarious. By far the best scene in this movie. I am glad that Knoxville has broadened his horizons as an actor. I feel he is talented and will be around for awhile.

First, I'm a fan of Jackass and I suppose if you're not, you wont like this but it boggles me how anyone could watch this film and not laugh their head off. This movie works on a level that comedies hardly or rarely work on anymore. i.e. Making the audience really laugh. And more than just once or twice. And more than a chuckle now and again. Most comedies only have that and Jackass #2 is so much more. If you actually are open-minded to the humor of it then we're talking about 90 minutes of belly laughs. Its like a roller-coaster. You can get on the teeny kiddie ride (i.e. scary movie 4) or get on the big bad mean ride that everyone is standing around in awe of (Jackass:The Movie 2). If you are a fan and you're not sure this could possibly be as good as the first one or the series, run, don't walk, to the nearest theatre with your highest expectations and get ready to be blown away. Other people do stuff like this (Dudesons, dirty sanchez) but the real difference here is the personalities of the Jackass guys. At least Knoxville, Bam, Steve-O, Dunn, Pontius and Wee Man. I cant say that Ehren or Dave or Preston really add much to their stunts through their personalities but perhaps the formula works with them adding a "normal-doofus" balance to the whole thing. The main guys are just hilarious though ans as has been pointed out by others, surprisingly, Knoxville pulls into the front on this in a big way. Bam and Dunn get hammered away as usual and are hilarious, again as usual. All in all, 10 out of 10, cant recommend it enough to anyone who is a fan and I cant wait for the DVD and #3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I really cannot see how this movie can be considered any good. This reminds me of the Simpsons ? the episode in which there is a movie competition in Springfield and Homer thinks the "man getting hit by football" is pure genius. This is really like 80 minutes or so of men getting hit by football. And it seems there are a lot of Homer Simpsons here! Really, these are the dumbest guys doing the dumbest things. Nothing really compares to hit. Being run over by horses is more fun than that. Eve if it gives you cancer.Sincerely, this movie is a pure waste of time. In fact, it is not even a movie, as there is no acting, there is no script. I cannot believe how this movie can reach such a high note, really, as even Plan 9 from Outerspace is actually good compared to this. But I guess that it is really the fact that our society favors sheer stupidity over intelligence. It is not even funny, unless you suffer from serious brain damage. Sorry, I really don't want to insult anyone, but simply the fact that there IS such a movie and that it got away with a high rating is in itself an insult to intelligence, to the human race and to dignity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Knoxville and his crew of masochists do more stupid stuff which hurts them badly and could get them killed - and film it. Number Two in name, number two in nature. But of course, they meant it that way. And that's what scares me...JACKASS NUMBER TWO is so funny and so unnecessary that I'm laughing on the outside and crying on the inside.Bam Margera, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Ryan Dunn and Jason "Wee Man" Acuna are the nucleus of this team of men who show affection by kicking each other in the nuts and laughing, setting new lows for redneck entertainment with every spaz stunt they never pull off. Either they're a bunch of guys who refuse to grow up - or they're trying to get themselves killed, which is the same thing from another direction.There are the usual rocket sleds off piers, the willful crashing into objects, the beatings and molestations by each other; there is Knoxville dressing as an old lady whose flaccid breasts "unwittingly" dangle out to discomfort passersby; there is man-nakedness at every turn, branded butt-cheeks, blurred balls and stinking taints; there are the practical jokes that the gang play on each other, like throwing a King Cobra into a pen with the snake-phobic Margera, or doing the switcheroo on Margera's mom so that she wakes to a fat impostor in her bed who isn't her fat husband.Then there are the clinically insane bits, like Steve-O pushing a giant fish hook through his cheek, attaching it to the end of Pontius's fishing line and jumping into a sea full of sharks; swimming with sharks isn't dangerous enough, he has to risk his cheek being ripped off from Pontius trying to reel him in if a shark grabs his leg, not to mention the infection and scar and simple visceral pain the hook is going to cause on his face.And why does Margera agree to have his butt branded with a red-hot cattle-brand? And how many times must they get chased and butted by bulls before they realize they might actually get a horn through the liver and die? And Steve-O puts a leech on his eye. And Pontius eats cow dung. And one of them drinks horse semen. Am I being unreasonable or am I getting too old to appreciate the idiocy? Why does the "movie" open with Ennio Morricone music from FISTFUL OF DOLLARS? And then a snake bites on Pontius's penis dressed as a mouse.SIDE NOTE: "All My Friends Are Dead." This Turbonegro song features on the soundtrack. I guess it's inevitable. Ryan Dunn was reported dead in June 2011. The most amazing part: it wasn't from something he did on JACKASS. "Police say the 34-year-old was travelling at around 130mph in a 55mph zone when his Porsche 911 flew off the road at around 2.30am on Monday morning in Pennsylvania, instantly killing him and his passenger." The best "bit" is a gag within a gag and the most complex setup; I doubt this movie's demographic can even follow it: they dress McGhehey as an Arab, strap him with fake dynamite and beard, and put him in a cab to Burbank Airport. The joke will be the cabbie's reaction to this obvious "terrorist" passenger... The REAL joke is on McGhehey who is being set up by the crew: the cabbie is Jay Chandrasekhar (of Broken Lizard) in disguise, who has been told to slap Arab McGhehey around and pull a gun on him. Plus, unbeknownst to McGhehey, his fake beard is pubic hair shavings from all the gang, one of them with crabs.There is a minefield of richer commentary here, but even the time taken to view this sordid public display of egomaniacal deviancy wastes time that could be spent doing something more productive with my life - like electrocuting my balls. Hey, maybe these JACKASS clowns are onto something...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching 'Jackass: The Movie', I thought these gutsy &amp; crazy fellas were done with their absurdity. But, they return with 'Jackass Number Two', and they, this time, also made me amuse and question myself.'Jackass Number Two' follows the human spirit gone wild, with Johnny Knoxville leading the bandwagon once again. But this amusing-film actually belongs to, Bam Margera, who is an absolute brat, and I guess the most scared as well. His gags are most hilarious and those situations can truly make it to a comedy film's screenplay.Jeff Tremanie who directs this film, knows what he has made. And the actors who participate in here, also know what they have done. And Spike Jonze knows what the hell he has done in here! I don't why, but I want to ask the entire cast &amp; crew of this comedy a, very important, question? Who's The Jackass? Us, in the sense, each of it's viewer. Or is it, you guys who manage to pull such off crude yet funny stuff?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently, I'm not as smart as I'd like to think I am because I gave in and decided that if I'm going to sign up to see a movie like Jackass, I might as well see the sequel. Oh, do I feel sick saying this, I actually kind of liked the sequel. But it's like saying I prefer diabetes to cancer, it's not that dramatic of a difference. But how could I not laugh at some of these pranks? As stupid and insulting as they are, I did get a kick out of some of them. Who the heck would go for a water hose rodeo? Of course the members of Jackass. Who would come up with dressing up as an elderly lady with her blouse coming off and seeing the reactions of regular citizens? The members of Jackass. I just gave in and let go and I think I just had a good time with this Jackass sequel. If you can't beat them, join them, oh, boy I can't believe I just said that.I have to give these guys a little credit, their pranks can be a little clever. But I'd expect them to be with this sequel. You have to up the pranks, though I'd hate to see these guys on their kid's career days. I wonder how proud I would be to say that my daddy gets paid to come up with stunts like hit the bell and shove a vibrator up his behind. How do you join this family business? Do I even want to know? But granted, we're all young once, we all do stupid things and look back at how silly we were, just makes me wonder how old Johnny Knoxville will have to be to realize this.The only prank I found to go way too far was the terrorist prank. What's so funny about it? That we're making fun of a culture, race, tragedy, the fear of a nation or that someone could seriously get hurt in a situation like that? I just couldn't find it funny and I don't want to know the person who thinks that it's funny.But I did think other than the elderly woman with the open blouse was funny, Steve-O pretends he's bait and puts a hook through his cheek. It looks like they actually had a lot of fun with that one and I have to admit that I was laughing. Also when Wee Man sits on the electric chair and thinks that someone is throwing cards at him and that the cards are electrocuting him. While I still think that this is an insult to our intelligence and Jackass is an incredibly vile show, I give up, I let go and just decided to have fun with these gags. So believe me, this is as kind of a rating as I could give.4/10</fullReview>

This movie takes it to a new level and is even far, far better than the original. Bam Margera commits the most to this movie and consequently deserves an admirable mention.

		<fullReview>Jackass Number Two (2006) *** (out of 4) The Jackass gang is back doing more stupid stunts, pranks and other things I'm sure God is rolling his eyes at. When I watched the first film as my first film of this year, I had never seen the show before and it would be an understatement to say I was somewhat shocked at what these idiots were willing to do. Well, they go a lot further here and while it makes for an even better movie I'm still not sure these guys shouldn't be in prison. Like the first film, most of the pranks get actual laughs including a hilarious segment where one of the men dresses up as an old man with very short shorts on with his balls hanging out the back. The scene where the dog comes up to him is tasteless but oh so funny. Another great prank is the final scene where they play a terrorist prank but with a twist. The most outrageous stuff isn't really funny but mostly shocking and this includes several scenes where their down below parts get injured. I'm sorry but anyone who is willing to injure themselves down there just isn't right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass 2 gets a 10 out of 10, for being perfectly psychotic and sociopathic. Knoxville at the preview suggested turning off moral judgment when you see this. That's actually impossible. Turn off your moral sense. Huh? Turn off your brain. That's what we do when we die--our brains turn off. That's what we do when we commit genocide and other really bad stuff. Everyone knows that this flick is utterly sick and genuinely insane, so then why are we afraid then to condemn it? Will we condemn it, when during Jackass 3, one of the "actors" actual dies. Accidentally suicide right on stage? Will we praise the dead then for his courage? I saw part of Jackass 1, and I laughed at some parts, but in the end, I just felt that I was laughing at genuinely psychotic and sociopathic acts, and that's just never funny. Sorry, guys, this is a good flick to dull your brains and your sensibilities. Your moral sense should just naturally puke on this movie, just like the cameramen puked while filming it.</fullReview>

Well when you put things in perspective, there are very few movies that make you laugh often, gag and say WTF, turn away from the sheer horror that grown adults would do such an act, plus make you want to see what else is going to happen. I am not a fan of this stuff, but I am open minded and can see that they are the best at what they do. I watched this with my two teen boys and laughed so hard throughout the movie that I developed a headache. Odd, but it was great family time. BEWARE! There are several skits that can make you throw up and/or turn away. This movie has several shock factors and is not suitable for most children. Do not try this stuff at home.</fullReview>

One day my friend and i were on the phone talking about if they would ever run out of ideas, and i said "Of course not! They're had TV shows, two movies"...and honestly, do you actually think that the guys will ever run out?Overall this movie is one you can sit down and watch and not want it to end.

Yes, it was extremely funny, and yes at the same time, quite painful, in the theaters besides the laughing i heard ouch, and the most common, thats gotta hurt. They need to blow stuff up too.

		<fullReview>In the UK there is a group of guys that call themselves 'Dirty Sanchez'. They do the same sort of thing as the 'Jackass' boys.Eventually, as a finale, I'd like to see these two groups come together for a competition that the viewing public would vote on, after they see the movie.I'm sure they'll advertise it as "Post viewing inter-active votes of pain and life-long emotional, physical and mental scarring", no doubt(as if there hasn't been enough scarring with those Jackass lads). My hat goes off to the boys of Jackass and Dirty Sanchez.It may be a simple skit but my favorite part of Jackass 1, was the air horn in the bushes, at the golf course. For some reason I laughed so hard I couldn't catch my breath! People thought I was having a fit.My favourite Jackass 2 bits were the sh!t in the f@rt funnel and the Bam cobra scare. Bam always f**ks up others on his Viva Bam show so it was good payback to see him sh!t his pants over that real AND fake snake.You have stones the size of Jupiter!To the Jackass and Sanchez boys, "Please join forces so you can make more money and waste it on doing stupid cr@p like nailing your foreskin to a spinning rotary blade for the ultimate Jewish Bries" (spelling?-What the f**k do I know about circumcision, I'm a f**king Kiwi!).If I have helped in any way, you could always send me some cash.Cheers, you crazy c*nts.Graeme</fullReview>

Even the outtakes were awesome, and that really says something because what you do must not be easy to cut considering it is all pretty much the same. Love Weeman and his wee p.

		<fullReview>I shouldn't like Jackass Number Two. No one should. There is and never has been anything particularly redeeming about Jackass. And yet...it's one of the funniest things I have ever seen - and I simply cannot explain why.This new movie leaves the first one in the dust. It's so funny, so horrible and so wrong. The whole team give their all - with Jackss in chief Knoxville leading the charge. He's nuts. I adore him, but he's insane. And more power to him. With his burgeoning film career he could have sat back and just let everyone else do the dirty work, but the fact that he threw himself, almost literally, back into the world of the 'Ass so wholeheartedly makes me oddly respect him. More kudos must go to Bam Margera who previously seemed content to sit back and just make sure everyone around him did pretty much what he wanted. Here Bam isn't the tormentor but the tormented and is all the better for it.I simply can't say what my favourite part is because I laughed the whole way through. Admittedly I viewed much of the movie from between my fingers, but there hasn't been a 'real' movie I've seen in a very long time that made me feel as invigorated as this did. Love them or most probably hate them, the Jackass team have delivered above and beyond my expectations. But I do agree with Bam. There can never be a Jackass number three because someone will die and I want these guys to stick around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass Number Two is easily the most hilarious film of 2006, beating the also hilarious Clerks II. It is one of the best sequels in recent memory, beating Jackass The Movie in every way. Now, this film may be the funniest, but it is also the most offensive, appalling, and utterly disgusting. You will find yourself feeling sick several times throughout the film. I'm completely serious when I say don't eat anything before watching or during this film, because chances are that it will literally come back to haunt you. Keep the drinking to a minimum as well. You've been warned, because, just like the tagline says, it will make you beg for mercy.Jackass Number Two follows the crazy men from the hit show Jackass, Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, Chris 'Party Boy' Pontius, Preston Lacy, Ehren McGhehey, Dave England, Brandon DiCamillo, and Jason 'Wee Man' Acuna (Chris 'Raab Himself' Raab is absent) as they perform the most outrageous, life-threatening, and revolting stunts imaginable. I'm not going to tell what the stunts are, but I will warn you that any scene with an animal will be sickening or psychologically frightening, and that one cast member (once again, not telling) will flirt with death several times in the film.What makes Jackass Number Two so entertaining is not the stunts themselves, but how the cast reacts to them and to doing them. To put it simple, if they loved doing it and had a blast, you will too (this goes for 99% of the stunts). All the stunts are very original, and 90% of them are never-before-seen. You will witness a few recycled ones, but they're amped up. You wouldn't think directing really factors into a movie like this, but it does; Jeff Tremaine's direction makes the movie so much funnier, because he provides guidance for the gang in their comedic timing, which is simply brilliant on his part. He could have just sat back and slept throughout filming (actually, you'll see in the film that he did sleep through some filming), but he went out there and helped these crazy guys make the stunts as funny as he could. I give Mr. Tremaine two thumbs up for that. Another great thing about Jackass is its bonanza of celebrity cameos, and this time they include BMX legend Mat Hoffman, skateboard god Tony Hawk, director/actor Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers &amp; Beerfest), actor Luke Wilson, Miami Dolphins star Jason Taylor, and director/actor Mike Judge (Office Space). The scenes with Hoffman, Taylor, and Chandrasekhar are among the funniest in the film, as it's even funnier to see these men as a part of the film.Jackass Number Two is one of the most politically incorrect, morally degrading, and just plain wrong movies of all time, if not the most. Despite this, it is so original and so hilarious that you won't care about that. You'll be gasping for air, laughing so hard you'll be crying, and jumping out of your seat laughing throughout the entire film. Due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this film, no one under 18 should watch this film. You've been warned. I hope you enjoy Jackass Number Two as much as I did.10/10 --spy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a fan of Jackass, Viva La Bam or the CKY videos, then you already know what you're in for. But this is one of those rare happenings when a sequel is better than the original! And man does this movie pack a mean low blow. But i mean that in a good way. It's the same type of death-defying, gut-wrenching insanity that we have all come to know and love and expect from Bam, Knoxville and Co. But this time with even more laughs than ever before! With Johnny Knoxville's insane tolerance for pain, Bam Margera's love for harassing his friends/family and Steve-O's gross-out factor, you have one hell of a funny film. The bar for the stunts, skits and general mayhem of the Jackass crew has been raised. Jackass 3? Doubtful, because it's nearly impossible to improve on perfection.</fullReview>

Jackass Number Two has twice the laughs and twice the action. Some stunts will leave you breathless. Besides Little Miss Sunshine, I think it was the best movie I saw this summer. Maybe even this year. The entire cast returns, besides a few such as Chris Raab and Rake Yohn. I don't think any of the cast members had a dull moment. Each and every stunt was either funny or dangerous or a combination of both; stupid. The beginning was just as funny as the first one, and the ending was interestingly hilarious; the cast performing a musical number. Jackass Number Two is the perfect movie to see with your friends. Stay during the credits, there are some pretty funny moments. One involves Luke Wilson.</fullReview>

NOT THIS TIME!!! they completely made a 180 degree flip...the whole cast is so outstanding in what they do and not were the stunts crazy...but the music basically fit every situation...GOOD WORK!!!! When you go see this be sure to use the bathroom before going to the theater, maintain a strong stomach and rememba to not let your beverage spray out your nose....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent movie and the best of jackass. Jackass always seemed like it would hit a peak, a point where the only way to shock people more would be for some to actually die on the show. Luckily, we haven't reached that point yet and this movie is amazing! There's a new shock value where people are getting truly injured by bulls, rockets and snakes! Also, there are new skits on crew members that get really advanced - no more johnny using a razor on weeman for the entire movie. There are also new members to the cast as the show grows in budget and complexity; there's also must less of the low budget "hick on a Sunday afternoon" sketches and much much more of the well thought out, expert on site, full camera crew - sketches. Pretty much the entire movie was funny, no zoning out half way through, making this the best jackass movie/episode so far. A MUST see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just a good as the first. I recommend this for responsible teens and adults. It will have you laughing so hard, tears will stream down your cheeks. Johnny knoxville and team take a lot of chances. I'm surprised that they have not broke there neck or been accidentally killed with all the crazy stunts they pull. You will not regret seeing this movie at least one time. I hope Johnny and friends come out with more of these crazy movies they are a blast to watch. Really put me in a silly mood. I'm gonna buy DVD when it comes out of theatres. I just love those guys. Jackass 2 is a must see. Go see it now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was wayyy better than the first one, I went to see it Monday night!! Crazyness!! I freakin loved it. I almost peed myself laughing so hard! hahaha Don't judge this like you would a normal movie. For it is not. It's just like the first one but with crazier stuff. I'd mention some of the stunts but I'd hate to spoil it for those who haven't seen it. It got a 2 thumbs up. So that should say enough about it. Great movie. I loved it. I give it 2 thumbs up also. The stunts are more insane than in the first one. I am completely surprised none of them were killed doing any of these stunts. These Jackass boys are insane! I give them props. I don't think I could do any of that but once again this movie is like a must see if you have a sick sense of humor I suppose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Much Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for Jackass Number Two on television a while back, I literally jumped up from my seat and screamed in excitement. I'm a true fan of the show, and the original Jackass movie has always been a real favorite of mine. However, I did have one major doubt: Would this just be a stupid unfunny sequel? Jackass Number Two was the exact opposite! It far surpasses the first Jackass, and is packed with stunts that are just funnier, plain and simple. Every cent I paid to get into the theater to see this movie was absolutely worth it. I laughed so much harder, and when I walked out of the movie theater, I immediately thought "I want to see it again!" And there's no question, I will see it again because this movie was perfect for me. It was incredibly entertaining, despite what you may have heard.I believe the only reason this film has been deemed controversial is that people have been labeling it as "dumb", or "stupid", or "a waste of money". Besides the fact I have only heard this from people who have never experienced Jackass at all (whether it be the show or the first movie), these people just don't get it. Unfortuanately, they feel movies must contain an important theme, and have some element in it to really make you think, like a strong and powerful script. This movie was meant to make people laugh, which is what is does, and it does that very well I must say. You may hear of "unnecessary nudity", and "disgusting scenes", which I will tell you now is what Jackass Number Two has. But, these "disgusting scenes" are important to have, only for one reason: they're funny.Jackass Number Two is perfect, but only if you're looking to laugh, not if you want to see an Oscar worthy movie. So, see this movie! It will really make you laugh! This movie really does deserve to be number one on its opening weekend. This means that finally people are getting the message; see this movie if you're looking for something funny! I'm glad this film has become so successful, I love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>wow what can i possibly say when i hear that music i know I'm in for a laugh but this movie was much more than a laugh i literally cried for every stunt there was not one that was just"OK" this movie was amazing i am thirteen and my friends mom took us and laughed the whole time but thats besides the point we went with her and an attendant came in to check that everyone was 17 or had a parent so kids if you're planning on sneaking in forget about it there is no way so just convince a parent that they will love it like my friends mom did you will never stop laughing in this movie i think it is better than the first one all i can pray is that they bring the show back or that they make number three</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My girlfriend I and went to see jackass number two the other night, and let me say this I haven't laughed so hard in a very long time. This movie was just what I needed. It honestly makes what they did in part one COMPLETELY PUSSY. I don't think there was a single skit that they did that I didn't laugh at, it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. I honestly thought that Johnny Knoxville would pussy right out after all this Hollywood nonsense he has been involved with but I was 100% wrong. So for those of you who haven't seen it do yourselves a favor and get your asses off of the computer and go to the f***ing theater and watch it, it's worth the money!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes they are gross, but they are hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie does what it is supposed to do, hence the title "Jackass" because only a jackass would do the things these guys do. If you have a queasy stomach be forewarned this movie has some very grotesque parts which involve human feces and if you can't handle that, don't go see this movie. Other than that it is non stop laughs... boys being boys...boys being gross, boys being disgusting, boys being mischievous. I took my 9 year old son to see it, yeah so? He's my son! I wanted to share a good time with him and that's what we did. Parents are supposed to teach their kids what not to do and after seeing the dumb things these guys pull off and seeing them in such pain makes a kid NOT want to try these stunts, but it's sure as hell is funny watching some other jackass trying it. ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS, I TRULY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO EVERYONE! .... LOVED IT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just may be the funniest film of 2006</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into Jackass Number Two expecting to see another extended T.V. episode, just as Jackass The Movie was to me. (The Unrated Jackass The Movie DVD fixed that problem), and I was surprised to see the levels to which they take it to in Number Two. They come so close to killing or seriously crippling each other, that if Jackass Number Three comes around, that will now be the only way to top themselves. I laughed so hard I nearly cried, and I laughed for the entire running time of the movie. Some of the stunts are so dangerous they're right to place disclaimers as bookends to the movie.So the bottom line is that Jackass Number Two is the funniest movie of 2006, it rises above Clerks II and every other comedy that has come out this year, because it will truly make you cry from laughing so hard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a commentary on life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a disturbing film that showcases people getting seriously hurt and probably suffering brain damage. People were very lucky not to get more hurt in the film albeit there is at least one death listed in the credits. But it is a commentary of really living life to the fullest and not doing things out of boredom- really find what it takes and put in the effort. Sitting around seeing what happens in real life if you reenact famous cartoon gags ranging from Looney Tunes to Beavis and Butthead and others is death dude. A key point in the message is when the gang is singing the John Waters/Bugsley B scene about living life and to show it they do the stunts instead of really enjoying life and using the brain. And semi nervously laughing at the consequences in the process and one another. There appears to be a serious injury and Steve-O is shocked before he laughs nervously like he knows he is on the Bon Scott path to death. Dude none of the people think what they are doing in the film is cool and that is what you are supposed to see. By this point a large part of the under 17 audience has stopped laughing. The moral is you live life full like this but get an education and go to graduate school if you must to really afford things. Don't go psycho and get brain damage and act like a freak. Read diverse material, eat diverse foods, parachute, ride roller coasters, learn how to really hit topspin, see diverse films, work on moving up to a relationship over time, learn skills, move to travel to new places, learn to Scuba Dive, do what you can so you can enjoy life and learn where to go to do it without resorting to getting solid metal put on your hi-speed head and then bragging about it in interviews. Dudes going to have brain damage and with all his money anything more than chicks for a gang bang probably find him too much of a psycho. All the money in the world can't change being an action guy who winds up like Ali or worse at the level of Earl Cambell. Then the remain a permanent brain dead cripple. And I think the point of all the anal stuff is what girl wants to be around that or Steve-O. A chick like that probably has a lot of problems and needs therapy to deal with them. And then there is the point of how many companies sponsored this film and are in the credits. Do you really want to be the guy who is the jackass and people laugh at because it makes them feel better about themselves. Live life to the fullest and you don't have to become like this or have a dead life like in Clerks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie and it was the most grossest and awful film I have seen in a while. I have seen the first one and it was not so bad, however some of the stunts were inhumane. The language is horrible because every other word is fowl language. The rating that was given on the movie said it received an A, but I would like to know who would give such a grade. It was also nauseating and I left the movie about 1/3 the way through because I couldn't stand much more and it was a total waste of my money. You can only go so far when you are trying to be funny, but there is a line that has to be drawn. The movie theater was empty except for myself and two other couples. How can you be entertained when you are vomiting due to nasty scenes. I do not recommend anyone with a weak stomach or sensitive ears to see this film.</fullReview>

Unlike most movies, the previews don't show it all, or even show the best parts. The only part that was too much for me was the horse part (you'll see) Pontius is the man, but this one made me wonder...I would have slit my wrists if I did that...barf...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brown stuff from the rear end, puke and liquid from a horse (or is it just "staged" like the bear trap??) over and over again. Just disgusting.I expect to see some jackass fun (good old MTV style), but there is a LOT of "simple" hidden camera too. The end is also completely gay.I laughed for approx 2 minutes of the entire movie, but most of it is just gross and lame.I guess they wanted to try to do something even wilder and more fun for this sequel, but by the end of the day they did NOT succeed. It is way too desperate to be funny.Alright, this comment has to be 10 lines....why? There is really not a lot to say about this movie except that I have seen news on the television that was more fun than this. I guess it tells a lot about those people that think this movie is funny, it sure is a scary world we live in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a great movie to go see with all of your dumb ass friends! I was laughing hysterically during the entire movie. Afterwards I was sore from laughing so much. I think I spit my soda out a total of 6 times. I especially liked the old people suits, like the old lady that had her boob exposed and didn't know it. Or the old man that let his grandson smoke and drink at the restaurant. I think those were some of the funniest stunts in the movie. They had some crazy ass stunts too like when Johnny Knoxville was hit by the bull and he flipped. Or when the used Stevo as live bait with the sharks and one of them came at him and he kicked it in the head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really, the last movie comes nowhere near this one. The stuff done in this film really does push the limits of censorship, but as sick and distasteful as it, is you'll be pissing yourself laughing most of the way through. Hooks piece cheeks for use as live shark bait, buttocks are branded with penises, men are reduced to tears and a variety of bulls show no mercy for Johnny and his posse.Be warned though, there are scenes in this movie will force you to turn away or leave you gagging, but its worth it. If you love to see people put themselves in great pain and suffering, then you'll really love this monstrosity.</fullReview>

The games didn't make sense nor the explaining but when they did it, it was so funny,every one came out laughing and talking the funny parts from Jackass. The series, the first movie, now comes number two, I have to admit this was a 2006 top funniest movie of all time. Now everyone waits to see part 3 in a couple of years, then that will be the next now Jackass with better a newer ideas. We will not be disappointed in the next one, who knew that a name called Jackass affected many people to laugh really hard. And I'm sure that I speak to everyone when I say thank-you to everyone in the movie and to the director,hope you make the next part again.</fullReview>
