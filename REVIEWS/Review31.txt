		<shortDescription>Brilliantly cinematic adaptation in the grand Hollywood style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I discovered this movie only recently and have watched it three times in the last two months. It's the kind of movie that rewards repeated viewings. The story, as others have commented, is moving and inspiring and way ahead of its time, dealing as it does with topics (the philosophical/spiritual quest for meaning in life, alcoholism, psychic healing, class divisions, post-war trauma, greed vs. self sacrifice) that one would expect in a movie taking place in the nineteen sixties rather than one taking place immediately following World War I. It offers the pleasure of Hollywood glamour of a very high order with one spectacular set-piece after another. Over and over, one is amazed at the staging of scenes set at balls, restaurants, night-clubs, Paris streets, factories, etc. Many jaw-dropping, pre-steadycam long takes involve the choreography of dozens of elements, e.g. one long take outside a Paris railway station, or another crane shot in a Paris night club as the camera searches the crowd for the protagonists. Everyone involved with the film seems to be working at his or her peak, from director Goulding to composer Alfred Newman, to all the perfectly cast actors. The screenplay is filled with brilliant cinematic story-telling devices (ironic voice-overs, montage sequences, foreshadowings, symbolism (the use of water and the ocean in so many scenes)that keep a long and complex story moving so smoothly that the two-hour-plus running time is hardly noticed at all. The cinematography by someone named Arthur Miller is gorgeous with lighting effects and moving camerawork that rank in the pantheon of Hollywood's visual creations. This is a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a coming of age film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, and the book on which it is based, made strong impressions on me in my youth, but even more so now that I am past middle age. A magnificent cast - Tyrone Power, Gene Tierney, Anne Baxter, Clifton Webb, John Payne, Herbert Marshall, help to tell the story of a man who walks "in another man's shoes" -- and totally to his own drummer -- after the first world war. In his quest for spirituality and goodness, he is at odds with the materialism and obsession around him. The different layers of "The Razor's Edge" demand attention: Larry's physical desire for Isabel, a woman it turns out he doesn't even know; Isabel's cold-heartedness and desire to possess Larry; and Larry's search for the meaning of life, while the people he loves disintegrate around him from lack of values or hope. These are all seen through the eyes of Somerset Maugham, played by Marshall. Larry's final confrontation scene with Isabel (Tierney) about Sophie (Baxter) is bone-chilling -- Power, who had a tendency to be sometimes stiff and a bit removed from his material, uses that flaw to excellent advantage as Larry Darrell. It's not a showy role, but he's wonderful, and he's reading of poetry in Sophie's room is unforgettable.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be one of my favorite films of all. It ranks in my books up there with PLACE IN THE SUN, REAP THE WILD WIND and THE HURRICANE.Made in the 40s by 20th Century Fox and Producer Darryl F. Zanuck, it stars Tyrone Power as Larry Farrell, a man on a journey to find the values of life. This fascinating journey takes him all over the world until he reaches a summit in India and there he meets a Holy Man, superbly played by Cecil Humphreys, who helps him understand his questions and then sends him back to the real world where he must then take his place in life. Based on the 1943 book of the same name, by W. Somerset Maugham, it does the story justice with the help of Lamar Trotti in transferring it to the screen. I read the book before seeing the film and was not disappointed. Congratulations also goes to director, Edmound Goulding for bringing the truth of the book to life.Other noteworthy performances were delivered by the lovely Gene Tierney, as Isabel, again in Cassini dresses, and yet another co-starring Tyrone Power film; John Payne, as Gray, in a different type of role as Miss Tierney's husband, Anne Baxter, as the doomed Sophie, in her Academy Award performance, and was she excellent, Clifton Webb as Elliott Templeton, another of Webb's limp-wristed performances and another Academy Award nomination. Herbert Marshall as Maugham himself. Did anyone get the "gay" relationship between he and Templeton? Then there's Lucile Watson, Frank Gilmore and the delightful Elsa Lanchester in supporting roles. I liked Fritz Kortner as Kosti, the de-frocked priest Larry meets at a bar when he is working the mines.Ray Dorey along with Alfred Newman wrote the theme song "Mam'selle" for the film. This is the best of the times. You can't get better. Power was superb in this. He was an underrated actor because he was such a handsome man. Yet, his abilities as an actor were terrific. He brought the intelligence of Maugham's writing to focus. Miss Baxter showed you the stuff good performers are made of with her shaded performance in this film. Also watch Marshall's reactions. His eyes are fantastic. They way his looks go from actor to actor. And look for the gay undertones between he and Clifton Webb as the eccentric uncle who delves in the upper crust life. Even to the extreme of having a coat of arms embroidered on his underwear. In the final minutes of the film Marshall speaks to Isabel after Larry leaves her for good, saying, "Goodness is, after all, the greatest force in the world . . .and he's got it." This speaks for the film and it's greatness. I think Marshall should have been nominated for his underplayed performance. He is credited with many fine roles in his career. See this classic. It's on VHS. Not to be confused with the pale remake with Bill Murray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant script. Strong acting. Sensational Gene Tierney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The razor's edge" has outstanding merits and, unfortunately, remarkable defects. Balancing the ones and the others, it stands as a sound, beautiful instance of classic movie.The story, based on Somerset Maugham's novel, is certainly original, although some twists of the plot are hardly believable, others are naive and predictable. The spiritual quest by Larry (Tyrone Power) is an interesting theme. However, his yearning for living among workers and poor people is far-fetched, and fails to be touching. The director's job is just adequate. The cardboard backdrops are awful! The scenes placed in the fake Himalaya are laughable. The representation of French people is inaccurate and too picturesque. By the way, French people NEVER spoke a foreign language in those years (in truth, not much has changed nowadays).Fortunately enough, the merits of the movie overwhelm the flaws. The script is brilliant. A thorough psychological study of the characters is made, through lines at times dramatic, at times permeated with typical English sharp wit. A great acting is a major strength of the film. The whole cast, minor roles included, makes an excellent job. Anne Baxter deserved to win the Oscar for the best supporting actress. Gene Tierney is fantastic: her Isabel, fully believable and realistic, is the most interesting character of the movie. Gene's acting is willingly understated, but extremely subtle and accurate. Look at the glances she flashes to the drunk Sophie (Anne Baxter) at the tavern. Look at Isabel's expression when Sophie vulgarly sits down on the table, turning her back to Isabel and flirting with Larry. We feel that a mortal hate is soaring. The clash between Isabel and Sophie is a great scene. Baxter beautifully shows Sophie's tragic weakness, But Gene's icy attitude is even more effective. After all, let's take Isabel's point of view: we realize that she's perfectly right. It's true that Sophie is a hopeless drunkard. It's true that Larry wants to marry her just as an act of pity. And Isabel fights for her love. Why shouldn't she?Yes, Isabel is selfish, spoiled, even ruthless... and so? For all his generosity, sense of duty and so on, Larry neglected Isabel just to avoid such an enormous self-sacrifice as to take a job! And then Isabel shouts "Love me, Larry, love me!" Come on, Larry! How on the earth can you resist to such an appeal? Why aren't we audience allowed to replace you, undeservedly over-lucky fellow? Alas! Larry is "completely out of mind", as Isabel puts it. By the way, Larry's incoherences, in a world of people ever following their own way (snobbery for Elliott, comfortable wealthy life for Isabel, poised literature for Maugham, debauchery for Sophie), by no means are a flaw of the movie. They rather make a fine artistic effect, even improving the realism of the story.And how I like the scene when Herbert Marshall as Maugham makes a detailed description of Isabel's perfect beauty, loveliness, grace (Gene-Isabel staring at him with a half-dreaming, half-mocking smile). That's a much appreciated gift for all us devoted fans of Gene Tierney.Yes, I don't hide the defects of "The razor's edge". But it is certainly entertaining, interesting, even profound at several moments. A beautiful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ty goes to Shangri-La</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Darryl Zanuck gave in to Tyrone Power's request for some serious acting roles and not another costume part in his first post World War II film after returning from the Marines. The Razor's Edge is a bit overlong, but Tyrone Power and the rest of the cast is shown to best advantage.The Razor's Edge is the story about a returning World War I veteran's quest for spiritual meaning in his life. Author W. Somerset Maugham wrote this during the 30s and his themes then found a good audience in 1946. He appears in the movie, played by Herbert Marshall, and it is his eyes through which we see the action unfold.It starts at a party in the Midwest at the beginning of the Roaring 20s. All the principal characters are introduced there including Larry Darrell, played by Power, who wants to postpone his engagement to Gene Tierney. Power explains about his lack of spiritual fulfillment and his desire to do some global soul searching. Tierney's not happy, but she thinks all he wants to do is sow some wild oats and she reluctantly acquiesces. A year later she's in Paris and she finds Ty living on the fringe and she realizes he was serious. Now Tierney is hopping mad so she marries steady and reliable John Payne. Now the plot unfolds.As I've said in other reviews of his films Power was either the straight arrow hero or a hero/heel type. He's a straight arrow in this one as noble as you can get without crossing over into Dudley DooRightism.Gene Tierney had essayed bitchiness in Leave Her to Heaven and she refines it to a high art here. Even though she's married to Payne, she still has a yen for Ty and her machinations are what drives the rest of the story.John Payne, I have always been convinced was brought to 20th Century Fox as a singing Tyrone Power for musicals. So it is interesting to see them together. It is unfortunate that Payne wasn't given a better role because his part as Tierney's husband who loses his fortune in the Stock Market Crash wasn't better written. Payne proved on a lot of occasions he was a capable enough actor to handle more complex parts.Clifton Webb plays fussy Uncle Elliott Templeton and got an Oscar Nomination, losing to Harold Russell in the Best Years of Our Lives. Webb was the closest thing for years to an out gay actor and a lot of his roles reflect that part of him, like this one. My favorite scene is after Ty Power goes to India and in that Shangri La like lamasery feels he has been made spiritually aware, with the symphonic crescendos rising, the action cuts away to a Paris tailor shop where Clifton Webb is complaining that the tassel on his robe doesn't sway, but that it bobbles. Anne Baxter won a Best Supporting Actress Award for a playing a friend of Tierney's in the mid west. Baxter is a happy girl, marrying a young man she's deeply in love with. Her husband and baby are killed in an automobile crash. Baxter's study of physical and moral decline and degradation is some of her best work, maybe even better than Eve Harrington in All About Eve.The story is a bit dated now, but it's still a fine film and one that shows Tyrone Power capable of far more than swashbuckling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stately Exposition of Love and Riches and Meaning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Razor's Edge (1946)A stately, dramatic, richly nuanced film about love, true love, and the love of life. It's about what matters, and what doesn't, in a high society world George Cukor could have filmed, but this is by director Edmund Goulding, coming off of a series of war films, and with the great Grand Hotel from 1932 in his trail. Some people will find this a touch stiff or slow, or rather too nuanced, but I think none of the above at all. It has the richness of the Somerset Maugham novel it is based on, and Goulding had just filmed (the same year) Of Human Bondage, another Maugham novel. In both cases, the writer contributed to the screenplay, and the combination of the two of them seems really perfect. Tyrone Power is an interesting lead man, as the idealistic and handsome Larry Darrell, and in some ways his restraint and almost studied dullness at times is maybe what the film needs for its rich, calm trajectory through the twenty years it covers. He's as stable and "good" as the wise, knowing figure of the author, who appears in the form of actor Herbert Marshall. Gene Tierney as Power's counterpart and eventually counterpoint plays the spoiled woman with cool, dramatic perfection. She's got energy and edge and beauty from every angle, and she maintains just that slightest duplicity in every scene, so you are kept on your toes.The only forced and almost laughable section is the one that demands we think profound thoughts...the guru in India being guru to our hero. Unfortunately, it lasts for fifteen minutes, and though there is a spiritual necessity to the experience he has there, this spiritual aspect is implied just as fully in the worldly scenes that follow. I can picture a far better movie without this insert, and I can picture the director picturing it, too. Someone knows why it got patched in, and for whom, but this is what we have. It has to be said the filming, as conservative as it is in many ways, is spot-on gorgeous. The brightly lit, ornamented, busy sets are actually inhabited by the camera, and the figures move together not only across the field, but front to back as well, in triangles and curves of visual activity, yet with fluidity--it's all contained and lyrically delicious. This is done without ostentatious mood, without sharp angles and bold lighting, but instead with spatial arrangements, always full, no emptiness, no great shadows, always something more to see. A great example, easy to find, is the very last scene, just before the shot on the boat when the end titles run. Watch how Marshall walks the long way around Tierney, and then she walks around him, and the camera keeps them framed side to side, front to back. It's nothing short of brilliant, and yet, in style, so different than say Toland doing Kane or, at another extreme, Ozu doing Tokyo Story. But no less spectacular.At one point, a minor character, a defrocked priest, says to Darrell in a working class bar, "You sound like a very religious man who does not believe in God." The movie is really about godliness, or what Maugham calls "goodness" in the end. And some people have it, and share it, and make the world better, God or no God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zanuck's Buildup for Ty's Return</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Producer Darryl F. Zanuck fashioned a major production for Tyrone Power upon his return to 20th Century Fox after a stint in the military service. No expense was spared in terms of production values, and special care was taken to cast each role to "perfection."With master story teller W. Somerset Maugham joining in writing the screenplay from his sprawling, multi-character novel, and Edmund Gouling doing the direction and Alfred Newman the score, it was a setup that couldn't miss.The cast works at a thoroughly respectable level, and the film emerges likewise. Yet, it falls strangely short of the genuine masterpiece Zanuck obviously planned.There is a rather cold center to "The Razor's Edge," which prevents one from being able to completely empathize with and feel for these characters and their respective plight. While they are interesting, the characters fail to ignite a deep emotional response in the viewer. One ends more observing this enactment, which has the feel of a somewhat slick presentation.It also represents the best of what 20th Century Fox had to offer in the mid-forties. Power next went on to do "Nightmare Alley," for which he received some of the best notices of his lengthy film career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Perhaps, Gene Tierney and Clifton Webb's finest performances ever"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Razer's Edge is not a light film, dark and inspirational, and requires your full attention.Clifton Webb's best performance, even better than Laura, perhaps. Ms. Tierney's best performance, even better than Laura, as well.When I was growing up in Junction City, Kansas, Ms. Tierney, was at Menninger's Mental Health Hospital. She was working in a dress shop, in Topeka, Kansas, as part of her therapy.I have always loved The Razer's Edge, Herbert Marshall, is splendid, and provided the key support, for Webb and Tierney's performances.They all seemed to feel this picture was important, and did their best to bring the words to live on the screen. Ensemble acting by the group made this film, fly and become a hidden treasure in film history of its time, 1945-46. Perfect film for returning warriors from WW2, as a bridge of hope, to find themselves and repair the wounded souls of war.Alfred Newman's musical score, is one of his best. Bravo to them and what a treat for students of film, to learn from its presentation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somerset Maugham's epic novel becomes a glossy, ambitious, ultimately flawed piece, packed with serious star wattage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>British storyteller W(illiam) Somerset Maugham's 1944 speculative novel "The Razor's Edge," as did his earlier semi-autobiographical "Of Human Bondage," won a devoted following when it hit the book shelves, and so 20th Century-Fox wasted no time in securing the screen rights to this mammoth war-era adventure into existentialism. It was a difficult, elephantine undertaking but they somehow managed to carve out a screenplay and present the whole package within two years of the novel's first print.Awesomely produced and directed, the resulting movie, for the most part, propels Maugham's central theme -- that there is good and bad in all human beings. The focus centers in on the long, spiritual quest of Larry Durrell, a basically virtuous individual who, surrounded by wealth, beauty and privilege, abandons his enviable but superficial trappings to pursue a more humble, meaningful life. Oddly enough, it's the superficial elements of the story and the more pretentious characters that hold up "The Razor's Edge," while the spiritual scenes grow flat and weary, often times stopping the action dead in its tracks.In casting Tyrone Power as the protagonist, one finds THE major flaw in its presentation. Tagged as a pretty boy for most of his career, he managed to show only glimpses of dramatic aptitude from time to time ("Witness for the Prosecution" comes to mind). Earnest and utterly sincere in his approach, Power simply lacks the power (sorry) and the depth to carry off this complex, confused, anachronistic soul-searcher. His Durrell seems better suited amongst the shallow and superficial. One only wonders what a Robert Donat or Fredric March might have done with such a role.Surrounding Power, however, is a stellar list of names that gussies up this production, and it is in them that we find the film's emotional impact. In particular, Gene Tierney offers one of her finest performances as Isabel, the grasping, captivating socialite obsessed with Durrell, who shows her true colors in the end when goodness and all else fails to win her the love of a man. Like Power, Tierney is a flawless, incredibly photogenic beauty who tended toward posturing instead of acting. Here she is allowed to capitalize on her tendency towards elegant frippery, offering a cool, intriguing portrait of a woman who can and will never have enough.We are also blessed with the presence of Clifton Webb, the epitome of smug elegance, who is true to form here as the meticulous, wasp-tongued prig who is not use to being told "no." As in the classic "Laura," Webb is handed the film's most delicious lines as his character goes about buffering his unhappiness with scorn and witty sarcasm. He would warm over this character recipe many times in movies, but darned if you don't keep going back for second helpings. He is delightfully hateful and absolutely mesmerizing. Anne Baxter as the helpless, tragic Sophie is heart-wrenching, giving a florid, Oscar-winning performance that lingers long after the final reel. She, not Power, is the heart and ravaged soul of this piece. The hospital scene following her horrific accident will rip you apart, as will her subsequent degradation into alcohol and prostitution. Known for her flashy, theatrical roles, Baxter plays Sophie for all its worth.John Payne is typically upright and appealing and does what he can in a rather stiff, thankless "other man" part, while suave Herbert Marshall, who, in reality, lost a leg in WWI but continued to act (often in a chair), portrays Maugham himself with customary flair.Granted, "The Razor's Edge" is no "Lost Horizon" in the metaphysical department, but on its own it is quite admirable and engrossing entertainment. It manages to hold up exceedingly well under its great length and weight, feels only slightly dated, and prides itself with gorgeous production values and a handsome, handsome cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lavish But Superficial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The author of numerous novels, plays, and short stories, W. Somerset Maugham (1874-1965) was considered among the world's great authors during his lifetime, and although his reputation has faded over the years his work continues to command critical respect and a large reading public. Published in 1944, THE RAZOR'S EDGE is the tale of a World War I veteran whose search for spiritual enlightenment flies in the face of shallow western values. It was Maugham's last major novel--and it was immensely popular. Given that the novel's conflicts are internalized spiritual and philosophical issues, it was also an extremely odd choice for a film version--but Darryl F. Zannuck of 20th Century Fox fell in love with the book and snapped up the screen rights shortly after publication.According to film lore, THE RAZOR'S EDGE was to be directed by the legendary George Cukor from a screenplay by Maugham himself--and it does seem that Maugham wrote an adaptation. When the film went into production, however, Cukor was replaced by Edmund Goulding, a director less known for artistic touch than a workman-like manner, and the Maugham script was replaced with one by Lamar Trotti, the author of such memorable screenplays as THE OXBOW INCIDENT. Tyrone Power, recently returned from military service during World War II, was cast as the spiritually conflicted Larry Darrell; Gene Tierney, one of the great beauties of her era, was cast as socialite Isabell Bradley. The supporting cast was particularly notable, including Herbert Marshall, Anne Baxter, Clifton Webb, Lucille Watson, and Elsa Lanchester. Both budget and shooting schedule were lavish, and when the film debuted in 1946 it was greatly admired by public and critics alike.But time has a way of putting things into perspective. Seen today, THE RAZOR'S EDGE is indeed a beautifully produced film--but that aside the absolute best one can say for it is that it achieves a fairly consistent mediocrity. As in most cases, the major problem is the script. Although it is reasonably close to Maugham's novel in terms of plot, it is noticeably off the mark in terms of character and it completely fails to capture the fundamental issues that drive the story. We are told that Larry is in search of enlightenment; we are told that he receives it; we are told he acts on it--but in spite of the occasional and largely superficial comment we are never really told anything about the spiritual, artistic, philosophical, and intellectual processes behind any of it. We are most particularly never told anything significant about the nature of the enlightenment itself. It has the effect of cutting off the story at its knees.We are left with the shell of Maugham's plot, which centers on the relationship between Larry and Isabell, a woman Larry loves but leaves due to the growing ideological riff that opens up between them. Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney were more noted for physical beauty than talent, but both could turn in good performances when they received solid directorial and script support. Unfortunately, that does not happen here; they are extremely one-note and Power is greatly miscast to boot. Fortunately, the supporting cast is quite good, with Herbert Marshall, Clifton Webb, and Lucille Watson particularly so; the then-famous performance by Anne Baxter, however, has not worn as well as one would hope.With a running time of just under two and a half hours, the film also feels unnecessarily long. There is seemingly endless cocktail party-type banter, and indeed the entire India sequence (which reads as faintly hilarious) would have been better cut entirely--an odd situation, for this is the very sequence intended as the crux of the entire film. Regardless of the specific scene, it all just seems to go on and on to no actual point.As for the DVD itself, the film has not been remastered, but the print is extremely good, and while the bonus package isn't particularly memorable neither is noticeably poor. When all is said and done, I give THE RAZOR'S EDGE four stars for production values and everyone's willingness to take on the material--but frankly, this a film best left Power and Tierney fans, who will enjoy it for the sake of the stars, and those whose ideas about spiritual enlightenment are as vague as the film itself.GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sharp and biting social commentary beneath its regal facade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among titles that have been included in Fox's Studio Line classic DVD series, Edmund Goulding's "The Razor's Edge" is a leviathan of powerhouse entertainment. At 146 minutes it's certainly one of the longest films Fox ever made ? especially during its golden period. Based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham, the film stars then reigning heartthrob, Tyrone Power as wealthy Chicago playboy, Larry Darrell. Without much cause, except that he's bored with life in general, Larry breaks his engagement to Isabel Bradley (Gene Tierney) in favor of becoming a world traveler. Eventually, his trips abroad lead to India, to the very seat of spiritual enlightenment under the tutelage of a guru.Meanwhile, back in Chicago, the impatient Isabel decides to marry Gray Maturin (John Payne). After the stock market crashes, Isabel leaves Gray to go continent tripping with her social climbing, egotistical Uncle Elliot Templeton (Clifton Webb ? at his usual acerbic best). Eventually, all this intercontinental head bumping leads straight to a reunion of sorts for all concerned; one that is made bittersweet when it is discovered that an old family friend, Sophie Macdonald (Ann Baxter), after having lost both her husband and child in a terrible accident, has succumbed to a life of spousal abuse and drug use. Having awakened his moral center, Larry makes a vein attempt to reform Sophie. But Isobel's jealous need to have Larry all to herself ? even though his interest in her has never been rekindled ? leads to a bitter and tragic end.Goulding's direction on this magnum opus of a motion picture is slick, stylish and polished. Around every turn he imbues the staging of events with an overall sense of foreboding tragedy that, like the final flowering of the old south in Gone With The Wind, simply reeks of a time far removed from the currency of life in which his characters ultimately find themselves living. Only the central, world-weary performance of Tyrone Power seems to hit the high notes acting wise. For the rest, but especially with Gene Tierney, the cast seem to be going through the motions ? albeit with considerable flair and panache as is befitting classically trained actors from Hollywood's golden age. There is also something to be said for Herbert Marshall's characterization of the author, Somerset Maugham. Though probably inaccurate to history, it is nevertheless one of the great bits of character acting ever put on film.Fox's DVD is exceptional. The picture is sharp and nicely balanced. But an audio commentary is all one gets to augment the experience - a shame!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worldliness v. spirituality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Somerset Maugham was one of England's greatest popular novelists in the 20th Century. He's still among the most read of the 20th Century novelists, with Orwell, Woolf, Greene, Waugh, Amis, and many others. But he is not considered (outside of his OF HUMAN BONDAGE) a very deep novelist. His best work illustrates personality or areas of life, like the world of English letters (in CAKES AND ALE). When he tried to be "deep" he had mixed results. His best known misfire on this was his attempt to discuss religious spirituality in THE RAZOR'S EDGE. Written after World War I, he was trying to discuss how a survivor of the killing fields of France goes into the East (i.e. Asia) to recover the needed religious basis for his life that the senseless slaughter in Europe destroyed. As a counterpoint to this search by the hero Larry Darrell, we are shown the shallow, materialistic lives of Larry's lover Isabel, and her socialite uncle Elliott. Basically, Elliott (who never thought highly of Larry even before this search for spiritual purity) encourages Isabel to dump Larry and marry stock broker Gray Manturin (John Payne). She does this, especially when she finds that Larry is more interested in his spiritual quest than in her. The marriage does produce one child, but it is not a very close one. As for Elliott, he moves to France, and hobnobs with the ultra-snob set on the Riviera in the 1920s. He shows great concern about his clothing (does the sash of his robe properly sway as he moves or does it bobble?). He is into enjoying the finer things in life, like Polish liquors. And Larry? He finds contentment after going to India and finding inner wisdom. So who turns out to be the happier? Maugham is good enough a writer to make the personalities of his characters interesting. Elliott (played deliciously by Clifton Webb as the ultimate snob) is made to look shallow and ridiculous and "bitchy" but relatively harmless. Isabel is far worse. Larry's attempts to help his old friend Sophie (Anne Baxter) who is a recovering alcoholic after tragedy. He announces they will be marrying. Isabel (Gene Tierney) sets up Sophie's low esteem and then allows her to get drunk - which leads to a second tragedy). At the end, Isabel is resigned to remain married to Gary, although she may begin an affair with neighbor Somerset Maugham (Herbert Marshall). Elliott gets the highest recognition of his lifetime before he leaves the scene. And Larry - he's determined to continue his life of good deeds from now on.As you can see, the real issues of religious revivalism and spirituality are barely touched. Larry finds a secret - and he is a changed man. But so what! We don't know what the secret is. I doubt if Maugham did. Tyrone Power had been begging Darryl Zanuch for more meaty acting roles - less adventure parts. He did not realize that his acting skills in adventure films like JESSIE JAMES and THE BLACK SWAN were quite good ones, and that those roles were more realistic than this. But he acquits himself well, despite the real emptiness of the character. The real characters who bring the story to life are Webb's, Tierney's, Baxter's (an Oscar winning performance), and Elsa Lanchester in a nice cameo. This is the best version of THE RAZOR'S EDGE...but that does not say too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent try</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somerset Maugham was a revered figure in his time, considered both a literary AND a popular author. This version of one of his best books tries hard to match the book's powerful message but ultimately misses the mark.This was intended as a return vehicle for Tyrone Power, an almost impossibly handsome actor, very popular before the war and after it. The buildup to his entrance (the kind usually reserved for the female lead in an old-time picture or play) is almost campy in its excess, but fits the way the gay Maugham would have seen the main character. Power tries hard to make a go of the character, but comes across as earnest but shallow, which the Larry in the book is not.Tierney is good (and equally gorgeous of course) as the spoiled and selfish woman. Anne Baxter is wonderful as the alcoholic and doomed Sophie, bringing the right kind of callow innocence to the part at the beginning, and then worldly weariness at the end. Webb does his usual effete gay character, the kind he played before this, in "Laura", and then many times afterward.The production is studio-bound. The sets look like sets, the exteriors are unconvincing. Real locations (Paris, the Himalayas) might have added much to this film, and made it seem less claustrophobic, as would color, though the black and white photography is exceptional. The music is overdone even for its time, as if the producer realized the picture just wasn't making it and urged Newman on, "Write MORE music!", which is loud a lot of the time and quotes Brahms and Wagner to excess, perhaps to add "profundity" to the static proceedings. The music is the only thing that adds any spirituality to the story, even with its "spiritual" message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darryl F. Zanuck wrestles with enlightened goodness in Somerset Maugham's novel. Zanuck wins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What if Somerset Maugham had written a novel about a coal miner who decided to search for transcendental enlightenment by trying to join a country club? If he had, he could have called it The Razor's Edge, since the Katha-Upanishad tells us, "The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over; thus the wise say the path to Salvation is hard." But Maugham decided to stick with the well-bred class, and so we have Darryl F. Zanuck's version of Larry Darrell, recently returned from WWI, carefully groomed, well connected in society and determined to find himself by becoming a coal miner. Or, as Maugham tells us, "This is the young man of whom I write. He is not famous. It may be that when at last his life comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on this earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Yet it may be that the way of life he has chosen for himself may have an ever growing influence over his fellow men, so that, long after his death, perhaps, it will be realized that lived in this age a very remarkable creature." The Razor's Edge has all of Zanuck's cultural taste that money could buy. It's so earnest, so sincere...so self-important. As Larry goes about his search for wisdom, working in mines, on merchant ships, climbing a Himalayan mountain to learn from an ancient wise man, we have his selfish girl friend, Isabel, played by Gene Tierney, his tragic childhood chum played by Anne Baxter, the girlfriend's snobbish and impeccably clad uncle played by Clifton Webb, and Willie Maugham himself, played by Herbert Marshall, taking notes. The movie is so insufferably smug about goodness that the only thing that perks it up a bit is Clifton Webb as Elliot Templeton. "If I live to be a hundred I shall never understand how any young man can come to Paris without evening clothes." Webb has some good lines, but we wind up appreciating Clifton Webb, not Elliot Templeton. Zanuck wanted a prestige hit for Twentieth Century when he bought the rights to Maugham's novel. He waited a year until Tyrone Power was released from military service. He made sure there were well-dressed extras by the dozens, a score that sounds as if it were meant for a cathedral and he even wrote some of the scenes himself. The effort is as self-conscious as a fat man wearing a rented tux. Despite Hollywood's view of things in The Razor's Edge, I can tell you that for most people hard work doesn't bring enlightenment, just weariness and low pay. After nearly two-and-a-half hours, we last see Larry carrying his duffle bag on board a tramp steamer in a gale. He's going to work his way back to America from Europe with a contented smile on his face. "My dear," Somerset Maugham says to Isabel at the same time in an elaborately decorated parlor, "Larry has found what we all want and what very few of us ever get. I don't think anyone can fail to be better, and nobler, kinder for knowing him. You see, my dear, goodness is after all the greatest force in the world...and he's got it!" Larry and the audience both need a healthy dose of Dramamine. Maugham, lest we forget, was a fine writer of plays, novels, essays and short stories. To see how the movies could do him justice, watch the way some of his short stories were brought to the screen in Encore, Trio and Quartet. And instead of wasting time with Larry Darrell, spend some time with Lawrence Durrell. The Alexandria Quartet is a good read.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glassy-eyed soap...it pines for the cinematic equivalence of a literary classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lamar Trotti adapted this handsomely-produced, well-dressed version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel, starring Tyrone Power as the American WWI flier who shuns the corporate progress of his country (and the hand of débutante Gene Tierney) by 'loafing' in Paris, hoping to find himself; traveling to India to study mysticism, he later attempts to treat his ailing society friends with the methods of self-awareness he has learned. What promised to be a rich dissection of the classes (aided by Clifton Webb's lively portrayal of an insufferable--and insufferably wealthy--snob) is eventually whittled down into an episodic and overly-familiar tale of love and jealousy: man's need for self-discovery and woman's need to pin a man down. Anne Baxter won the Supporting Actress Oscar (most probably for her hospital breakdown sequence), however her role as a young widow who didn't marry for money and became a lush is rather preposterous (and Baxter's third-act scenes are unevenly performed). Power is handsome yet wooden, with a furrowed brow; Herbert Marshall (playing a humorless Maugham) is left rudderless; but Tierney, perhaps channeling the poisonous vibes from her role in "Leave Her to Heaven" the year before, glints with decadent evil like a society spider; explaining the meaning of goodness to this woman is just wasted breath! She steers the movie in an entirely different direction, as a weeper. This is both pro and con. Remade in 1984 with Bill Murray in the lead. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Semi Spiritual Melodrama By Somerset Maugham</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>W Somerset Maugham's is a character in his own "The Razor's Edge". He's played by Herbert Marshall and he's given the hardest lines to deliver: "He looks extraordinarily happy, calm yet aloof" He's talking about Larry, Tyrone Power's character, after his enlightening trip to India. Power returns and reintroduces himself in the life of Isabel, played by the impossibly beautiful Gene Tirney. The world that Powers discovers in India will give this all consuming melodrama a spiritual tinge. Edmund Goulding choreographs the unfolding with surprising results. Tirney's beauty permeates the whole film and her character is as truthful as it is cruel although she doesn't mean to be neither truthful nor cruel. Anne Baxter as the tragic Sophie gets an Academy Award while Clifton Webb camps it out shamelessly. Loved the scene of the coin and John Payne's headache. Gene Tirney's reaction to Tyrone Power, as he works the "miracle", is the best acting of her entire career. Deserves to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too long, too pretentious and too much Power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film which, in Shaw's words (about Henry James) has "chewed off more than it can bite", 'Razor's Edge' manages to last for long 140 minutes or so without hardly a single, original, thought in its head. The badly miscast Tyrone Power, wide eyed and gormless, tries to look intellectual but ends up appearing confused. As much as he works at his part, Power simply can't communicate philosophical contemplation adequately.. his single-minded odyssey appears shallow, trite, and selfish, ultimately achieving nothing but a good view of a sunrise from a private hut in the Himalayas.. His newly found enlightenment may mean a lot to him personally, but the film reduces it to the status of a hypnotist's act, useful in curing headaches. A moment's comparison to a similarly tortured soul, Kirk Douglas as Van Gogh in Minnelli's 'Lust for Life' (1956) reveals just how soft and insubstantial is the centre of Zanuck's would-be masterpiece; Douglas is neurotic, fierce and intense as the man seeking for great peace of soul - Power just stands around and looks mildly perplexed.There's some recompense in the splendid performances of Webb and Tierney of course, and Goulding's extravagant mounting of this prestige production makes individual scenes pass more easily than they otherwise might do. Some of his camera movements and set ups are complex, choreographed carefully, and reveal more about character relationships than the dialogue. But the Indian episode is trivial and unconvincing, while Darrell's querulous rejection of material shallowness beforehand is nothing like as full throated as one would like it to be. (Perhaps this coyness is an indication of the political temperature of the times.) Similarly, Sophie's degradation is hardly shocking to modern eyes, her final collapse in a vague 'smoking den' after falling prey to Pisovka (Absinthe) a relatively mild affair.As Maugham, Herbert Marshall gives his usual sophisticated performance, while John Payne remains obstinately wooden. As one might expect from such a project, Newman's score is opulent and lush, the cinematography crisp and detailed.Ultimately this ambitious, flabby, work makes one want to return to the more sincere, slimmer delights of 'Laura', where both Tierney and Webb were united earlier to much better effect. Or for a film where camp is worn on the sleeve rather than wrapped in the earnestness of 'art', I'd recommend Tierney in 'Leave Her To Heaven', made immediately after the classic noir. It may not be based on a grand novel, but it sure is more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many critics rate "The Razor's Edge" as one of Fox's best ever films - that is very debatable, but it certainly is very good, and much of the credit must go to the excellent cast, headed by a somewhat war-weary Tyrone Power, and this weariness suits his character of Larry. The part played by Gene Tierney did, in my opinion, need a better actress who could have really made a greater impact. Clifton Webb, Herbert Marshall and John Payne all contributed extremely well, while the prime part of Sophie (played by Anne Baxter) was very well done, and we can be thankful that Darryl Zanuck did not go on with his original plan to cast Betty Grable in the role. The settings were completely realistic and the music (including "Mamselle") was first class and added much to the mood of this, sometimes, sombre film. I have not read Maugham's book, but I am sure he would have been pleased with this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trash and very enjoyable as such</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tosh of a very high-minded kind and magnificently entertaining. W Somerset Maugham's novel was a po-faced tale of unmitigated seriousness filled to the brim with 'grand themes' and a better director than Edmund Goulding might have made an equally serious and po-faced film. Goulding's pedigree was trashy women's pictures and he had the knack of making silk purses out of sow's ears. He may have dumbed down Maugham's novel but at least it's lively and at times wonderfully over-the-top as well as being beautifully photographed and designed. It may be deeply silly but it's never dull.Unfortunately that handsome clothes-horse Tyrone Power is there in the central, crucial role of Larry Darrell, the existentialist hero traveling the world in search of 'enlightenment'. Power lacks the natural gravitas the part demands. Luckily he's surrounded by players who are so much better than he. The under-rated Gene Tierney is wonderfully willful as the rich girl who marries someone else, Anne Baxter, who won the Oscar for her part, is the dipsomaniac Sophie and best of all there is Clifton Webb, robbed of an Oscar, as the arch snob Elliot Templeton who, naturally, has all the best lines. Herbert Marshall also keeps popping up as Maugham, narrating the story as if it's all real.I think we were meant to find it all profound and uplifting and I'm sure some people took it all very seriously. But we can no more take this seriously than if the original novel had been written by Harold Robbins or Jacqueline Susann. It's trash and so long as you accept it as such you might just love it. The remake, with Bill Murray, did take itself seriously and failed miserably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Power's first post-war film about man's search for truth and salvation...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tyrone Power's studio gave him an ambitious project when he returned from the war--a screen version of Somerset Maugham's 'The Razor's Edge', the story of a man's quest for his spiritual side and salvation. Opposed to his quest is the selfish, beautiful Isabel (Gene Tierney) who marries another man (John Payne) but later, out of jealousy, tries to prevent Power's marriage to her friend, Sophie (Anne Baxter). The best scenes in the film come in the final confrontation between Tierney and Power when she reveals what she has done to help destroy Baxter. Tierney excelled at playing jealous, possessive women (as in 'Leave Her To Heaven') and her Isabel is just another extension of other such roles. But she is ideal for the part and is strikingly attractive in one of her best roles. Power meets her only half way. His Larry is not quite strong enough to be the protagonist described in the Maugham novel. Other performances are excellent, especially Clifton Webb who was nominated for an Oscar as the prissy Elliot Templeton. Anne Baxter is moving as Sophie and deserved her Supporting Role Oscar. But the film, although interesting throughout, tends to be a rambling, overblown story that seems as cold as its central character. We always feel we're outside looking in. It lacks heart--but from what I've heard of the more recent Bill Murray film, it is superior to the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT.....SPOILER ALERTMake no mistake, this was one of 20th Century Fox's big productions. The $1.2 million budget led to gross rentals of $5 million. The scenes here are lush, although it's a shame they didn't spend just a little more money to film it is color. Fox purchased the film rights from Somerset Maugham for $50,000 plus a percent of the net profit. It appears to have been a fairly lavish production. The musical score in part by Alfred Newman, is quite impressive, and was the original source of the song "Mam'selle". The film runs long (145 minutes), but it needed to, and I give credit to 20th Century Fox for allowing it to.I am updating this review to reflect my recent Blu Ray replacement of the original DVD. The first question that comes up is whether or not the Blu Ray is a significant improvement over the DVD. An improvement in this case, yes, quite good, although at points the film's score seemed just a tad harsh. At any rate, it is a good transfer and looks good on widescreen high-def television. Somerset Maugham (played here by Herbert Marshall) narrates the film, and drifts in and out of the story at opportune moments, much as he had in 1942's "The Moon and Sixpence". As the film begins, we see Tyrone Power romancing Gene Tierney. But, Powers also wants to explore the meaning of life and travel the world...but Tierney simply wants a proper and wealthy marriage. The fiancés separate and Tierney marries John Payne, a millionaire. Mutual friend Sophie Nelson (Anne Baxter) marries happily, but her husband and child are killed in a car accident. Power eventually travels to India where he seeks a deeper understanding of life from a mystic and time in the Himalayas, where he becomes enlightened. Power returns to France and becomes friends again with Maugham and Baxter and her husband. An alcoholic Baxter shows up, Power decides to marry her, but Tierney's scheming results in the death of Baxter. All this comes out at the end of the movie, when Power leaves for America, never to again see his circle of friends.It's an especially strong performance by Tyrone Power here. He's at his young (32) handsome best here, but what's most impressive is that this is one of his most impressive acting performances. His character wants to know what life is all about because of an incident that occurred during WWI; it seems cliché now, but it makes sense here...and frankly, always will. It's interesting here how through some vignettes they pack a good sense of Power's character traveling in Europe...and it's hardly the life that Tierney's uncle (Clifton Webb) intended in his scheming. Gene Tierney comes off as being a very unsympathetic character...but that was the role. Early in the film she stresses her desire that her intended (Power) be ambitious, and while she feels strongly about it, rather than seem unreasonable, she seems logical. At this point, it's simply a question of 2 people whose attitude toward life are simply too different to enter into a marriage. And so she marries another -- John Payne. Later she learns that Anne Baxter will marry Tyrone Power, and she leads the recovering alcoholic woman into a drunk resulting in suicide. That's when you realize that Tierney's character is evil. But of course, she has her comeuppance at the end of the film. John Payne and Anne Baxter played their roles very well, and Baxter even won the supporting Oscar for it...although I didn't feel she was that special here. Payne was always a rather pleasant B actor. Baxter here plays a pathetic woman who is handed some tragic events in life and can't handle it. She becomes a slut in a Paris bar...which I found rather far fetched. And then the bombshell -- Power is going to marry Baxter, and, though married herself, Tierney is livid. Sophie totally falls off the wagon and ends up murdered. Herbert Marshall is excellent as Maugham, although his role is sparse in the first half of the film.Clifton Webb, nominated for best supporting actor Oscar here, is superb, and perhaps never did he play his foppish character quite so well as in this film. Webb's character's demise in the film is a classic. Also worth watching -- mostly early in the film -- is Lucile Watson as Tierney's mother...a wonderful character actress. Fritz Kortner, a Viennese actor, has a nice smaller role as a European miner/unfrocked priest with a fair amount of wisdom whose talk leads Tyrone Power's character to India. Cecil Humphreys has an interesting role as the holy man in India; again, a rather small part. Elsa Lanchester has a small, but delightful part near the end of the film.Perhaps the biggest fault of the film is the small amount of time spent on Power's character's time in the Indian mountains where he became enlightened. What did he learn there? How did he learn it. It's given short shrift, and as such, I felt as though an important piece of the character's enlightenment was missing.This is on my DVD shelf! And should be on yours. I have given the film an "8", albeit a weak one, because I was disappointed in the segment in India. This film is good enough that it inspired me to seek Maugham's novel, but I was dissatisfied for the same reason with the novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the hands of a lesser producer and lesser actors, The Razor's Edge would have teetered dangerously close to bad melodrama, a la Douglas Sirk. However, this trite-on-the-surface film rises above the suds and is actually quite memorable, due entirely to an outstanding collection of performances.At it's core, The Razor's Edge isn't much more than a story of a vain and shallow woman who longs for a life with a man who is not her husband. On the periphery, a war veteran searches for meaning in life while trying to serve others in the process. Tyrone Power is excellent throughout as the veteran, and really shines in a couple of scenes in particular, namely, when speaking of Sophie's death. Anne Baxter receieved a well earned Oscar for her portrayal of an emotionally distraught alcoholic. Her subtle performance, particularly in handling the alcoholism, earned her the award more than anything. Gene Tierney is the catty and caniving woman who longs for Power. Her performance is good, but the character does not provide the dynamics that several of the others do, and even as the lead actress, she seems more in the background than the fore. John Payne plays her husband, aloof out of necessity, and is similarly good playing a character of limited depth.Clifton Webb practically reprises his role in Laura (1944), and steals the show, as he does in Laura. The Razor's Edge would aptly describe Webb's tongue in addition to Power's dilemma. Webb's deathbed scene should have garnered him the supporting Oscar, and I would imagine he was the most surprised when Harold Russell's name was announced for the second time at the '46 awards show.There's not much to note in the film in the way of story or direction. The ensemble owns this film and is entirely the reason to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Old Hollywood was always in trouble when dealing with Deep Think. That's because of the medium's commercial nature. When flirting with spiritual or religious beliefs, the studios simply didn't want to risk offending potential ticket buyers. So, when dealing with Deep Think (not their many biblical epics which were unabashedly Christian), the studios compromised to the point of absurdity by either flattening out the message or trivializing it. Here it's trivialized. After all, who's against Goodness. As a result, we wait 145-minutes to find out that, yes, Goodness is in fact a good and noble thing, and with that, Larry (Power) is on his way to enlightenment. And naturally, no one's offended, except maybe those who had expected something more.Of course, the profundity is wrapped in lavishly mounted studio soap opera, with two of Hollywood's most beautiful people surrounded by whirling hosts of well-clothed extras. In fact, that opening ballroom scene is a marvel of orchestrated staging as the characters are introduced by serially playing off one another. At the spectrum's other end, however, is that dreadful monastery scene with its painted mountain backdrop and facile dialog. Flattening the import of that pivotal scene are the repeated references to god as though that's where all paths must inevitably lead. And that's along with the spectacular alpine vistas fairly shouting celestial light from a heavenly above. I'm sure all that window dressing comforted nervous audiences who could then wink at Larry's spiritual quest and not feel the least bit threatened. But it also reduced a profound subject to a superficial level.Another area that gets a Hollywood treatment are values and class, always tricky topics for an industry backed by Wall Street. The movie goes to pains circulating Larry among the gilded elite of Chicago as epitomized by the petulantly snobbish Templeton (Webb) and the selfishly insulated Isabel (Tierney). But, the elite's values are clearly materialistic, a spiritual dead-end in Larry's view as he heads off to learn from suffering with the working class. The screenplay thus sets up an implicit critique of the gilded class and the values that guide them. Well and good. But then the screenwriters can't seem to decide what to do with this point of view; after all, that's another touchy topic among audiences, especially coming so soon after the societal upheaval of the 1930's.As a result, Larry never really criticizes the peer group he's been a part of, never really explains, that is, why he sees his social class as a spiritual dead-end, which of course would delve into a socially touchy subject. Nor, for that matter, does Larry explain why "salvation" lies through sharing a working class experience. We're left, I guess, to suppose the answer has to do with the suffering caused by hard physical labor and poor pay this class must endure. This subtext, however, is never really brought to the surface and remains unresolved at movie's end. Thus, big studio TCF and its head honcho, producer Zanuck, nibble around a second tinderbox topic, tantalizing us but never really delivering.The movie does have a definite upside. For one, it's exquisitely well photographed, compensating somewhat for the 2-hour-plus run time. At the same time, the ballroom scenes are especially well choreographed and lavishly upholstered, creating an impressive air of wealth and breeding that makes Larry's renunciation a genuine material sacrifice. Then too, there's Webb's lively version of an unregenerate snob, a character he could do to waspish perfection. Also, Marshall's quietly observant author provides a needed contemplative note. However, in the film's pivotal role Power fails to provide the needed depth his character requires, or as another reviewer observes, Larry is pretty much the same after his trip to India as he was before. Fortunately, Power would later find that depth in Nightmare Alley (1947).All in all, the movie remains an overlong visual treat that fortunately includes the exquisite Tierney. But as one might expect from old Hollywood, the film fails crucially at coming to grips with its two overriding themes?spirituality and class. As a result, two of life's most important questions are given unchallenging treatment. In short, here as elsewhere, where Deep Think is concerned, commercialism precedes all else.</fullReview>

This is not the redemptive journey of a broken man, but the journey of a self-respecting man who could have a secure, productive, prestigious, rewarding life, yet chooses instead to ask: Why? What?

		<shortDescription>Strange movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen a movie before as far as I can remember where the main character's philosophical quest was the primary motivation for the melodrama. That's the case in this one, where Tyrone Power plays Larry Darrell, a guy who just wants to "loaf" and try to "find things out about himself" instead of following the Great American Way and earning a lot of money after his combat stint in WWI. He's in love with a society woman named Isabel (Gene Tierney) who isn't happy about the idea of their living off a small trust fund, so she marries a rich stockbroker instead (John Payne). Along the way he befriends the author of the story, W. Somerset Maugham (Herbert Marshall) and alienates the girl's foppish uncle (Clifton Webb).This is a strange movie in my opinion from the outset, when Maugham himself is introduced as the first major character! His role in the movie and Webb's role in the movie are what really makes it stand out. Power's performance is fantastic, but he's saddled with Tierney as his co-star and she really can't carry the weight of her character convincingly. I liked all the scenes with Power that Tierney wasn't in, especially the scene in the bar with the de-frocked priest (Fritz Kortner?). Elsa Lanchester contributes one of her patented high quality supporting roles as well.I was so frustrated with the Tierney character, even besides her performance. I just wanted somebody to slap her so much. It was interesting how Tyrone Power's character was so gentle that he wouldn't even break it to her that he knows she destroyed Sophie (Anne Baxter).Good movie, hard to fit into a particular category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" A Universal Answer , To a Planatary Question "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>W. Somerset Maugham wrote this story for people in search of themselves. It is a journey for those who don't really know who or what or where they belong. For some it's not really hard to know who they are. For others, even when they find themselves, they realize it was not quite the big discovery they hoped it would be. In this 1946 film audiences get to see Maughams' hero, Larry Darrell, (Tyrone Power), realize that a simple act of heroism on the part of a fellow soldier, who saves his life, causes him to ask the unfathomable question, of 'Why'. It troubles him so much, he feels he must turn his back on a mundane existence and go in search for the Meaning of Life. Characters in his life which supply all the question include Gene Tierney who plays Isabel Bradley, John Payne as Gray Maturin and the talented Anne Baxter who plays Sophie Macdonald. As an added feature we have Clifton Webb who plays the know-it-all, Elliott Templeton and Herbert Marshall as the author W. Somerset Maugham. The quest our hero seeks is to discover the value of love, conviction and if there is such a thing as common good. The film, which stays close to the book, is itself a bit long. Still it sets the stage for the dozens of similar films which, all ask the same question. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Razor's Edge - 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic idealistic film about love, wealth and self-esteem. A man came back from war decided to go to Paris to find the meaning of life, but the woman he loved cannot stand the poverty though she was crazy about him too. She finally married a rich man but they still kept in touch with each other (as friends). The man went to India and spent several years as a pilgrim. When he came back, he was involved with the woman's friend who lost her husband and child, had a miserable life. He intended to save her but he failed in the end because the woman still loved him and jealousy made her wanted to get him back.I don't want to spoil the story too much and I love the story, I feel like a kind of pure innocence of love concealing in this film, all the characters are graceful, even when they are in difficult situations, they live for their dignity. The performance is powerful and Anne Baxter won Oscar for her supporting role as the main character's poor friend, She shows the intense struggle in her heart after tragedy has occurred, she's vulnerable and lost in a world she cannot face it. Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney are gorgeous as the leading actor and actress, Clifton Webb is memorable as the arrogant uncle.Some says love can conquer anything, in this movie the woman gave up her love for the wealthy, but she still tried to get her love back, people are just too greedy to obtain everything, and caused the disaster afterwards. We can miss something every day no matter we can on purpose or not, but only when we lose them, we realize the genuine value and try to get them back, seems to be cliché but it does apply to almost everyone.This films is adapted by a famous novel from W. Somerset Maugham and it's not that kind of film can entertain people in its screen time, but you can learn something after watching it, I might not have too much deep thought, but subconsciously I can taste the bitterness from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorite films. I don't know why people always thought Tyrone Power was a lightweight. Compared to the pretty boys of today he is a Giant. I always thought his good looks got in the way of what a great actor he was. I never saw him do a bad performance. Some spoilers ahead!!! Here he plays idealistic WWI vet who life was spared and he has a awakening to find good and happiness. Well the problem is that he has a few childhood friends that have some serious problems and almost get in his way. One being a old girlfriend who is bent on getting him back. She even gets married, but that doesn't stop her. Too bad for her Larry he is not the same guy she use to go out with , so even though he is attracted to her, he figures her out. She of course marries a guy who is shell shocked because he lost all of his money. Larry cures him. Then we have the Anne Baxter character...we all have some one in our lives like her. Nice person who bad things..real bad things happen to. We have a gay busy body played by...gee what a surprise Clifton Webb! His last scene merited a Oscar. Dying and all he is thinking about is not being invited to a party!! And Herbert Marshall as ...surprise again.. W. Somerset Maugham. I love the way he tells the story. Anne Baxter is heartbreaking as the dipsomaniac..I always wanted to use that word. And I like the way Larry befriends her when everyone seems to have shunned her. This is a great movie and book. I think it should be read and seen by everyone. And please why did that have to remake it??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Razor's Edge" (1946) is a solid film endowed with an equally solid cast. The plot concerns a young man, Larry Darrell (Power), whose life was saved during wartime at the expense of another's. Larry is haunted by the grim tragedy and journeys the earth in an attempt to find solace. Along the way, his path is repeatedly crossed by a scheming fiancé (Tierney), an egocentric socialite with a heart of gold (Webb), a childhood friend ever-beset by misfortune (Baxter), and the imperturbable W. Somerset Maugham (Marshall).The direction by Edmund Goulding is superb, but sometimes constricts the actors in their performances. Goulding indulges in very lengthy takes during which he displays his incredible skill at timing large crowds to do certain things at precise moments. Goulding would later soar to greater directing heights with such films as "Nightmare Alley" (1947) -- also starring Tyrone Power -- and "Everybody Does It" (1949).My sole criticism of this film is it feels a bit melodramatic. Nevertheless: a solid picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A superior film dealing with inner searching of the soul for peace, salvation and redemption, beautifully realized by a magnificent ensemble cast.Tyrone Power has never been better. We meet the tragic Sophie, superbly played by Anne Baxter. She won the best supporting actress Oscar for this film and it was extremely well-deserved.She portrays a woman who loses her husband and son in an auto accident. This tragedy leads to her ruination. She never got over it.We have John Payne and Gene Tierney, the latter, in a nasty role as a woman who would destroy another female (Sophie) to gain Power for herself. Power was going to marry Sophie. Tierney successfully gets the tragic Sophie to start drinking again and tragedy results.As the uncle, Clifton Webb was simply marvelous. A bon-vivant, but difficult, he yearned for acceptance by the elite. He etched an unforgettable character and received a supporting nomination.The end of the film, where Power confronts Tierney is soul-searching. He realized what she had been able to do to Sophie.A film of rare revelation of the struggle of the inner-self.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A drama with a promising start, but a dumb ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of those frustrating old movies. The first half is rather good - aside from Power's little soul-searching excursion to India - but things really begin to fall apart in the second half. Suddenly, Tierney becomes evil incarnate and sends Baxter on an annoyingly predictably road to self-destruction which culminates in the movie's worse scenes: the ones in which Power looks for her in various "Thief of Baghdad"-type Paris locales, in which the characters look/behave like a cross between barflies, Ali Babas, and Jimmy Cagney's partners-in-crime. We even have a silly fight between Power and a couple of Ali Baba genies, while Baxter acts ridiculously. Baxter serves as some kind of an ever-tragic martyr to whom only bad things happen, like De Sade's Justine, minus the sexual exploitation. What could have been developed into a very interesting story, ended up as just another soap-opera with predictable plot-devices.The one disappointment in the first half was definitely Power's experience in India. He went there as a near-atheist but once he saw sunrise, the Indian nature (and what-not) suddenly he saw God, the light, the meaning of (his) life, and all that other New-Age Far-East malarkey. This book's stuff was new-age before hippies were even born. As if spending a day in Indian nature should contain some revelations about life! I think any mountain in the Swiss Alps should do just as well.The cast and characters are a mixed bag. Power is very well-cast, and his character is quite interesting - as idiotic as the Indian episode may be. Tierney is no beauty, and plays the role like any other typical female role was played in that naive Golden Age period; she lacks charisma, but also suffers from her part, which doesn't make sense entirely. Her husband's character is that of a robot. Baxter is rather cute, and definitely upstages Tierney whenever they appear together. The French inspector at first acts almost like Inspector Clouseau! The rest are quite solid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We loved Somerset Maughan's "The Razor's Edge", as well as the rest of his literary production. In the 1946 film version of the novel, Mr. Maughan was asked to help Lamar Trotti with the adaptation, which can be considered contains the essence of the book. Darryl F. Zanuck entrusted the direction to Edmund Goulding who made the version of "The Razor's Edge" a favorite of the movie going public.As a big spectacle, "The Razor's Edge" had a lot going for it. It was Tyrone Power's first starring role after he came home from WWII. Mr. Power was one of the most handsome actors in Hollywood, then and now. His looks were a distraction, as shown in here. The basic flaw with the movie is the character of Larry Darrell, who in the novel is presented in a better view. We don't believe for a moment that this man was interested in nothing else but in his looks and the superficiality of being in the high circles of society of those years.The trip of enlightenment to India in search for the truth, is basically poorly handled. The mountain sets look cheap and unrealistic and doesn't add anything to the movie, at all. We don't believe for a moment that Larry has gone to work in such menial jobs, and the end where he is seen as deck hand in his trip back to America is also completely mishandled. Perhaps with another actor the figure of Larry would have come out stronger and in a more positive way, the way Mr. Maughan drew him in the novel.The rest of the players are wonderful. Clifton Webb, above all, is an elegant Elliott Templeton, the witty society figure that is obviously gay, but knows a thing, or two, about his enemies. Elliott is always ahead of the game, which in a way, doesn't explain well how he becomes so sick and dies in no time, but again, this is only a minor observation which had to be arranged within the almost two and a half hours of the film.Gene Tierney was a ravishing Isabel Bradley, a woman who wanted it all and thought she could have her cake and eat it as well. She refused to marry Larry because his income was a paltry three thousand dollars a year. Horror of horrors, how would she buy her Oleg Cassinis shmattes with that amount? She lets Larry go, but when he meets him again in Paris, she wants him back. Ms. Tierney made a great portrait of this woman with an evil streak in her character.Anne Baxter made a great impression as Sophie. Ms. Baxter was an excellent actress who gets under the skin of her character and runs away with it. The fact that Sophie is a prostitute is handled the Hollywood way, not dwelling on it, as the studio people want to keep the status quo of a woman who is seen in an Apache dive in the Paris of those years before the war.The rest of the cast is splendid. Herbert Marshall plays the author himself, Somerset Maughan, the man who is the connection among all the characters and situations. Lucile Watson makes another elegant society woman in the film, something she knew how to play well. Elsa Lanchester, that delightful actress, is only seen for a moment, but she is absolutely perfect as the flighty secretary to the princess that has slighted Elliott Templeton. John Payne plays his part a bit on the wooden side, but as a society man, what else could he do?The music by Alfred Newman is an asset throughout the film. Mr. Newman always knew what fitted best. The music fits well the proceedings. Best of all the scene at the low class bar where "Mamselle" is heard in the background.While Edmound Goulding's "The Razor's Edge" is flawed, it still packs a tremendous impact, which we have to recognize it wasn't as great on this, the second viewing of the film. Yet, the film will satisfy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Larry, how can you bear to sit here in a backwash when America is living through the most glorious adventure the world has ever known?" Isabelle BradleyThese words, spoken passionately by the very lovely and quite capable Gene Tierney, summarize the intense conflict that the two central characters of this excellent movie must endure. While they are undoubtedly physically attracted to each other, Isabelle's fiancé, Larry Darrell (Tyrone Power in what I believe was the best role of his career), is in search of the inner meaning of life itself. He returns from service in World War I profoundly impacted by his being saved by a fellow soldier, who sacrificed his own life in the process during the very final moments of the war. "So he's gone, and I'm alive. Why?" asks Larry. For an extremely socially conscious Isabelle, Larry's change and his pursuit of the very meaning of life is totally unacceptable. "I'm young. I want to have fun. Do all the things that people do. We wouldn't have a friend in the world!" Isabelle exclaims in utter frustration and disgust.Instead of selling bonds in Chicago's financial district and mingling among the empty, superficial country club set, Larry decides to leave Isabelle and Chicago's high society behind, traveling to Paris and eventually to the Himalayas of India to seek the answers as to why he has survived in the world while the man who saved his life has not. What does it all mean? Whether he succeeds in finding all of the answers or even some of them, he is determined to pursue them. His pursuit becomes the focus of his entire existence. With the love of her life gone, Isabelle marries Gray Maturin (John Payne), a wealthy securities broker, but do they live happily ever after?In the meantime, Larry's lifelong, childhood pal, Sophie McDonald (Anne Baxter), survives a horrible personal tragedy and resorts to alcoholism and prostitution as a remedy for her deep emotional pain. As it turns out, half of Chicago, including Larry, Isabelle, Gray, their two kids, Isabelle's caustic, pompous, and somewhat bitchy Uncle Eliot (Clifton Webb), and Sophie, somehow end up moving to Paris en mass. Who is left in Chicago? Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon? But that is another review for another time.At first, I believed Isabelle's attitude to represent the "can do" sentiments of many Americans following both world wars until the true dimensions of her jealousy and selfishness are revealed as this film progresses. Eventually, we see how Isabelle's viewpoint is much more sinister than the typical euphoria and optimism that accompanied our nation's ultimate victory after a costly and tragic foreign war. Instead of focusing on the pressing needs of her family, which had been financially shattered by the stock market crash of 1929 (another sudden reminder that we're not in 1946!), she deliberately and cruelly proceeds to ruin the lives of others. In extreme contrast, Larry follows the advice of his Indian spiritual adviser and returns to Paris from his remote Himalayan isolation in order to assist his fellow human beings by using the enhanced spiritual knowledge that he had gained there. He helps Gray recover from the nervous breakdown that resulted from the financial crash and then attempts to rehabilitate Sophie, who descends deeper and deeper into mental chaos, thanks to the indispensable assistance of shamelessly jealous and selfish Isabelle. The contrast between the development of the characters of former lovers Isabelle and Larry could not be more pronounced here.While Judy Garland and Betty Grable both refused the role of Sophie McDonald as too depressing, Anne Baxter should be commended for tackling the task so ably, an achievement for which she was richly awarded with an Oscar for her performance. I also enjoyed the all-too-brief and quirky appearance of Elsa Lanchester as the singing Scottish secretary to a magic princess with her spectacular office view of the Riviera. Quite a gig! The leads, including Power, Tierney, Webb, and Herbert Marshall as the original novelist, W. Somerset Maugham, are all excellent. At one point, Tierney descends a long staircase in a stunning black gown and Power, awaiting her at the bottom, declares that she is more beautiful than ever, and he is absolutely on the money here.This is a film that very successfully contrasts the serious pursuit of life's deepest meaning against the prevailing social and psychological norms of the times, whether they occur at the end of the first or second world war. Take your pick. Wars or no wars, what is this life all about anyway? No one should ever have to apologize to a self- absorbed and often silly society for asking the truly important questions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tyrone Goes To The Mountaintop.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a BIG Hollywood PRODUCTION. It must be Big because it deals with Big Ideas. And it's long too, very long. And it has 20th-Century Foxes most scintillating troopers doing their things. Also it must be big because, if I remember, there was a monstrous billboard advertising it over one of the theaters near Times Square. "The Razor's Edge," proclaimed the billboard -- in Big Letters. Starting next week: The Second Coming.Actually it's kind of an interesting story, full of romance, intrigues, slight conflicts -- all very dignified and full of civility, as Somerset Maugham's works tended to be. He was always understated in a British manner. When he was in the fullness of his years he gave a presentation on aging. "There are many advantages to being old," he said from the stage, and then stopped. There was a long pause. Too long. The stooped old Maugham stood still at the platform until the audience began to cough and squirm. Finally he spoke up: "I'm just trying to remember what they are." I don't think I want to try outlining the plot because it would begin to sound a little like a Russian novel. Basically, Tyrone Power returns from World War One. (Kids: That was the one before World War Two. PS: We won.) He's seen a lot of death and he asks his fiancée, Gene Tierney, out loud, "What's it all about?" It's always a poor idea to ask a question like this but in Power's case his search for an answer leads him to India, and although he loses his fiancée he gains a mystic experience.The rest of the movie, which is to say most of it, is taken up with a gaggle of Americans in Paris and other parts of France. They keep bumping into one another. Let's see. There is Tierney, of course. She's a materialist and after Power takes off she marries the rich, blandly handsome, slightly weak John Payne. She never stops loving Power in her own bitchy way. Then there is Anne Baxter, whom Power has known since childhood as a true innocent. A car accident kills her husband and children and she becomes a drunk and a whore in some gin mill where Apache dancers perform. Then there is Clifton Webb as the rich, snooty, but not inhuman uncle of Tierney. Finally there is Herbert Marshall, playing Maugham himself, who drifts in and out of the narrative as a sort of sympathetic flaneur.Over a span of more than ten years, a couple of the characters die, some "find themselves," others are disappointed and guilt ridden, and Power carries on secure in his knowledge of self -- a good, kind man.Frankly I didn't notice much difference between pre- and post-epiphany Power, except that after he felt God in a Himalayan sunrise he stopped asking what it was all about. I've always had trouble with mystic experiences, though I studied Eastern psychology and meditation in graduate school. I've experienced what might be called "awe" but never when I sought it and never in the presence of other people. But maybe it IS all an illusion and some cosmic force is behind it all. I once observed what was undoubtedly a UFO that defied the kind of physical laws we take for granted. My mind remains open, and I'll give Tyrone Power his mystic experience, though I wish the rest of his life hadn't led him into such difficulties. He never does explain exactly how his experience improved his life or, indeed, changed it in any way. Possibly the experience itself is indescribably and transcends language.The performances are all about what we'd expect from a cast of seasoned professionals. Anne Baxter, in particular, must have been a brave young lady because make up and wardrobe have turned her into a dumpy sloven. That takes guts. It may be the role into which Gene Tierney put most effort. It's a variation on her murderous narcissist in "Leave Her to Heaven," but more candid, more defiantly selfish. Clifton Webb was an aristocratic flit in "Laura," two years earlier, but here he seems to come brazenly out of the closet and it's amusing as hell.It's a masterpiece of middlebrow movie making. It ought to set most of us thinking. Here's one of the things we might wind up ruminating. In praise of the new Power, Herbert Marshall says something like, "He's a good man -- kind, gentle, forgiving." Is that today's idea of a good man?</fullReview>

I know that not much more can be expected, but it does weaken the movie by being included.Still, the Paris scenes are great. Tierney is at her thespian best; her great beauty adds to the ambivalence we feel about her character. Power is right for his part and does a first rate job, as do Webb, Watson, and Marshall.

		<fullReview>If anyone had doubts about where Gene Tierney should stand in the vast pantheon of cinema's lading ladies, this understated masterpiece should put them to rest. The chemistry between Tierney and Power is palpable, and makes compromises from Maugham's masterpiece superfluous. This is a movie in which the acting is everything, as far from De Caprio's sensationalism as can be. However, this is a literary adaptation, like Gwen Terasaki's memoir, Bridge to the Sun, or Fitzgerald's Tender is the Night, where reading the book beforehand is highly recommended. Watching Tierney and Power here makes it obvious why the gentleman turned down the lead in The Great Gatsby when Tiernney was rejected as being too pretty (as much as I enjoyed Alan Ladd and Betty Field); Mrs. Tierney was a fine actress, by any standard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fascinating movie, enhanced by luminous stars at the pinnacle of their careers. It was based on an intriguing novel by Somerset Maugham, but is a powerful work in its own right.Set mainly in America and France in the years just after World War 1, the story is seen through the eyes of Somerset Maugham, played by Herbert Marshall. While visiting his friend, Elliott Templeton, (Clifton Webb), he comes to know Elliott's family, his niece, Isabel Bradley (Gene Tierney) and her fiancée, Larry Darrell (Tyrone Power).Larry Darrell becomes the focus of the film and Maugham encounters him from time to time along with Elliott Templeton's family as their fortunes ebb and flow. Larry is a man who has had profound experiences in World War 1 and spends the rest of his life searching for something beyond the material world.Recently on Foxtel's "Golden Years of Hollywood", Bill Collins, Australia's legendary movie presenter, summed up perfectly what it is that Larry is searching for when he said, "He is a man in quest of making life worthwhile"."The Razor's Edge" has that slight detachment from reality that comes from being shot almost exclusively on the sound stage ? albeit with fabulous sets and sumptuous costumes ? giving the film a texture that it would not have if it had been shot on location. Obvious, painted mountain backdrops with rays of sunlight coming through the clouds may not be an effect that you could get away with today, but it all works in this movie.And what stars. Dazzling from the moment she appears, Gene Tierney had that amazing, exotic look, set off with cheekbones to die for. She was a visual feast in "Son of Fury" made a few years earlier with Tyrone Power, but here she is a little older; more mature, and even more stunning.Tyrone Power dominates the screen ? he always did. He had that great ability to be still, and the camera just sought him out. As Larry Darrell, we believe he would climb a mountain to find the meaning of life.Anne Baxter's suffering as Sophie MacDonald won her an Academy Award, and although there was no award, John Payne suffers as Gray Maturin who Isabel marries on the rebound from Larry. But the most arresting characterisation is Clifton Webb's Elliott Templeton ? cultivated, effete and pompous, it is an even wittier performance than the one he gave in "Laura".The dialogue sparkles. Whether it is the exchanges between Maugham and Isabel or the Holy Man revealing the secrets of the ages to Larry, the script is full of insights into human nature that make you think about the film long after it ends.The film is pushing 70 now, and the players have all departed the stage, but they still glow in a movie that shows how seductive films from that era of Hollywood could be.</fullReview>

He breaks off his engagement with his socialite fiancée Isabel (Gene Tierney) and travels the world seeking some answers to life's questions. While in India, he achieves some degree of enlightenment and also discovers a way to cure headaches! When he returns, Isabel has married another man (John Payne). Also his childhood friend Sophie (Anne Baxter) has lost her husband and child in an accident and has become a drunk living in a seedy part of town. Larry sets out to help Sophie but jealous Isabel doesn't take kindly to this.Thoughtful adaptation of the W. Somerset Maugham story. Maugham appears as a character in the film, wonderfully played by Herbert Marshall. Power and Tierney offer solid performances. But the real stars are the supporting duo of Anne Baxter and Clifton Webb. Baxter won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Webb was nominated but did not win against stiff competition. He's fantastic though. Baxter gives possibly the best performance of her career. Despite the length, I never felt bored. It's an excellent movie. A little pretentious perhaps but much less so than many similarly-themed dramas made in the last few decades. The 1984 remake doesn't hold a candle to this, by the way.</fullReview>

So, New York wouldn't do for this, and we then even hear Clifton Webb making periodic, deprecating remarks against the midwestern United States (even though he was originally from Indianapolis, Indiana).The motion picture was then also quite faithful to the book when they showed Larry Darrell somehow finding his satisfying philosophy in such places as India and Tibet. This then reflects Maugham's own philosophical beliefs, in that he rejected the concept of an after-life, subject to a possible negative judgment, if one's character in this life is found to be lacking. Better, he alleged, to think Himalayan etc. thought, possibly with repeated cycles of memory erasing reincarnations, or whatever.A final comment would be that the musical score by Alfred Newman is marvelous, and many Hollywood musicians from that period should be recognized as classical music composers, although that hasn't happened yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Razors' Edge is both a compelling drama and a most satisfying adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being an intellectually engrossing, enormously stylish, deeply emotional picture, The Razor's Edge is both the most captivating and the most satisfying adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's inspiring novel of the same title. Even though in its core subject the film has much to do with spirituality and self-realization, it also ponders such considerable topics as obsession, greed, alcoholism, war-related traumas, etc. Wrapped up in a neat package of astounding visuals and fascinating camera shots, The Razor's Edge proves to be a very successful collaboration between the director Edmund Goulding and the cinematographer Arthur C. Miller. Splendid performances by the stellar cast only confirm that The Razor's Edge is an irrefutable masterpiece of the Golden Era of Hollywood.The literate and dramatic script gives a thorough psychological insight into all the character's minds. Tyrone Power plays Larry Darrell, the main character, who is about to begin a long and demanding search for the true meaning of life. Gene Tierney is his fiancée Isabel Bradley, a girl who tries to trap him into a marriage she wants, but ultimately realizes that she won't be able to. Clifton Webb is Elliott Templeton, a shallow, pompous, and supercilious uncle who ? surprisingly so ? turns out to be a rather likable and reliable old gentleman.Larry goes to France and then to India, discovering many new facts about life and fulfilling his destiny as the passionate truth-seeker. In the meantime, Isabel marries Gray Maturin (John Payne), a man who's always been in love with her. Along with her uncle and a few relatives they move to a classy palace located in France and stay there until the heavy depression hits them really hard.The turning point of the film comes when a long-time family friend Sophie MacDonald (devastating performance by Anne Baxter) loses her husband and child in a car crash and starts drinking in order to forget about this horrible accident. After a while, all the characters meet up in France at the most unexpected time. Though married, Isabel is still fully in love with Larry. He, on the other hand, decides to help poor Sophie and proposes to her instead. Thing turn ugly, as Isabel tries to cause Sophie's final fall into alcoholism and dejection, just to get Larry only for herself. As the obsessive behavior progresses, she realizes that many people, even those that she truly cared about, desert her.Starting in the period ingeniously named the roaring 20's and following up to the difficult times of the Great Depression, the film exhibits ? in an utterly realistic manner ? how a social and economic situation in the USA shaped the way people corresponded to one another. Pretentious, shallow and greedy members of the aristocracy cared only about their own, mostly material, needs. However, after the horrible stock market crash in 1929 everything suddenly changed. It's perfectly exemplified in the way Isabel Bradley's closest relatives handled the loss of money, and how it actually lead up to the beginning of the respected family's end.Undoubtedly, Tyrone Power's performance is the greatest force of this picture. Avoiding many clichés, he presents a man who is as confused as he is curious about life in general. Handsome and charismatic, it's not hard to see why Gene Tierney was so obsessed with his persona. Her awe-inspiring portrayal of a woman who can't distinguish between what's good and what's bad is as convincing as it is heartbreaking. Exploring both an ill-fated love affair and a promising spiritual journey, the film is a 144-minute ode to effective and convincing filmmaking. Enhanced by marvelous supporting performances, The Razor's Edge cuts deep and uncovers a deeply sorrowful intrigue, promising neither second chances nor happy endings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darryl F. Zanuck Takes the Mountain to Tyrone Power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1919 Chicago, British writer W. Somerset Maugham (nicely personified by Herbert Marshall and directed by Edmund Goulding) recalls meeting handsome World War I veteran Tyrone Power (as Laurence "Larry" Darrell) at a party. He is engaged to attractive socialite Gene Tierney (as Isabel Bradley) and has a little money, but Mr. Power feels restless and uncertain about his place in the world. During the war, Power's life was saved by a buddy; the act killed his friend and left Power with questions about life. He and Ms. Tierney pledge their love, but decide to put their plans for marriage on hold while Power travels...The cast winds up in Paris, where Tierney's flamboyant uncle Clifton Webb (as Elliott Templeton) holds court. Powell is also admired by alcoholic floozy Anne Baxter (as Sophie MacDonald) while more sober John Payne (as Gray Maturin) remains available for Tierney. Power's inward searching becomes highly spiritual and he winds up spending some time in India where a bearded Maharishi-type tells him to imagine, "nothing above you but the sky." Imagine that. After the 1929 stock market crash, Powell returns to Paris. He attempts to bring God-given peace and tranquility to friends and acquaintances living on "The Razor's Edge"...******** The Razor's Edge (11/19/46) Edmund Goulding ~ Tyrone Power, Gene Tierney, Anne Baxter, Clifton Webb</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hollywood, But A Few Problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The direction of Edmund Goulding was excellent, great camera-work and lighting, it's a very lush, ambitious film. Gene Tierney look gorgeous and is a perfect b#tch as Isabel. I honestly think she's a better actress when she plays evil women (as in "Leave Her To Heaven"). Supporting performances were all fine, especially Anne Baxter playing the doomed Sophie.The biggest problem with the film was the performance of Tyrone Power as Larry Darrell. He's sort of stiff and unemotional. I realize Darrell is not the easiest part to play - he's almost saintlike. I think I prefer the way Bill Murray played him in the 1984 remake. Murray's humor helped the audience relate to Darrell.The script doesn't help Powers much. The scene where he cures Isabel's husband of his headache is almost laughable, the way Powers stares at him with those big black eyebrows. Did Darrell study philosophy or hypnotism in India? "The Razor's Edge" is still an enjoyable movie, though I think the 1984 version is probably a little better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And What A Sharp Edge It Is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful, home-hitting post war film that definitely succeeds in its touching and sometimes searing portrait of a young man searching for the meaning of life after witnessing such suffering, pain and sacrifice. After serving and surviving WWI, he is at a loss as to where to go from there.Larry Darrell wants to find himself, but his need is not understood or appreciated by his fiancée, the beautiful but selfish Isabel, who wants a good society position and money. Her stuffy, snobbish uncle Elliot wants Larry out of her life for those exact reasons - he's not wealthy enough. So we have the foundation for a watchable drama.Gene Tierney looks lovely, and Tyrone Power (who, along with Dana Andrews, was one of her best leading men) more than matches her, and they look gorgeous together. Their performances are superb and flawless, and the same can be said for Clifton Webb, Herbert Marshall, John Payne, and of course, the Oscar-winning Anne Baxter as the ill-fated Sophie.Biblical symbolism is evident in many of the scenes, and one cannot help but compare Isabel to Tierney's Oscar-nominated performance a year earlier in "Leave Her To Heaven". Isabel, like Ellen, is a manipulative, controlling and jealous woman, who wants Larry all to herself, even after she marries the gentle, wealthy Gray (John Payne), who doesn't realize how he's been used. Tierney's character is dressed in black and a floppy black hat when flaunting a drink in front of Sophie, tempting her like a serpent. And when Larry asks her about this incident, she proceeds to spin a lie, trying to make it look like an innocent misunderstanding, until he calls her on it. As with LHTH, she admits the truth with the line, "I did it and I'd do it again!", and goes into detail of how she did this for his own good, all for the love of him, trying to "save him" from what in her view was a disastrous mistake. How she could turn on a woman who was once her close friend is a question that, besides the jealousy factor, isn't really explained.Baxter's portrayal of Sophie is brilliant, and she justly deserved the Oscar she received. Sophie is like Mary Magdalene or Eve, tempted by the demon liquor (no thanks to Isabel) and lured into prostitution, and Larry tries heroically and compassionately to save her. Her death is something that she began seeking after the tragic accident that claimed the lives of her husband and baby daughter. It is so easy to tear up during the sequence in the apartment when Sophie looks at the photograph of Isabel and Gray's eldest daughter and thinks about her own little girl that she lost, and Isabel almost looks sympathetic. After Larry tells a shocked Isabel of Sophie's demise, he compassionately and gently states, "There's no need to be shocked about Sophie any longer, Isabel. I've had the feeling all day that Sophie's where she wants to be most - with Bob and Linda. I know that's a simple way to look at it, but it's comforting." Marshall is wonderful as Maugham, the narrator, who observes all this drama and who comments on it, and who even goes so far as to appeal to Isabel's vanity in order to get back on her good graces. The scenes with Isabel and Gray's children are very sweet, with Isabel speaking to them in French (Tierney was fluent in that language, as she attended a finishing school in Europe). Larry can't bring himself to be angry with Isabel, despite what she's done, and Isabel can't bring herself to hurt Gray, as much as she loves Larry. And Larry's travels (although those bogus backdrops do little to convince that he actually is in those exotic locations), are a definite plus, his experiences shared with the viewer in order to find what he's looking for, and in a sense, to help us discover the meaning of life too. "Do you know what it's like to see another man give up his life for you? That someone deliberately died so that you might go on living?" Larry asks Isabel, who obviously has never experienced what he refers to. Even as she declares her love for him, regretting how she rejected his marriage proposal years before, we know that a life with Isabel is no longer in the cards. And when Larry says, "Goodbye, Isabel, and take good care of Gray. He needs you now more than ever", it is a fitting exit line as Power decides to continue on his journey of self-discovery."You see, my dear, goodness is no doubt the greatest force in the world, and he's got it," Maugham explains to a sorrowing and astonished Isabel, letting her (and the audience) know what quality Larry possesses and what he is in search of - goodness.And we watch as Maugham's protagonist boards a ship, still in search of himself, but much more at peace.It's well worth the running time, although the novel was very difficult to adapt to film, and it's a rewarding experience for those willing to sit down and absorb the message of "The Razor's Edge".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old hollywood Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all the hard work that went into the 1946 version of The Razor's Edge one would have to call it a masterpiece. Flawed. Well, that's a matter of opinion. After all, it was produced in it's own era and had to conform to the code of movies at that time. I was greatly influneced by the character of Larry Darrell when I read the book and vowed to be like him when I grew up. Of course, he replaced Paris Mitchell whom I wanted desprately to emulate, unfortunately Larry was replaced by Howard Roark who I insisted was the mirror of me, alas, none of my dreams came true on that score but my real favorite was Larry from The Razor's Edge. True, Tyrone Power was a mite too old for the part but then Gary Cooper was positively ludricious in the part of Howard Roark in The Fountainhead. Anyway, Power was my idea of Larry as was the stunning beatiful Gene Tierney who was absolutely right as the scheming Isobel. Anne Baxter won her Oscar and baffling her studio beyond words. but I always thought that Tierney should have won for her Isobel. Clifton Webb was just right as "that old cissy" as Sofie describe him and of course, Herbert Marshall was superb as Somerset Maugham just as he was playing the author in the film The Moon and Six Pence. The Razor's Edge is one my favorite films and I never get tired of watching it, I suppose the production values have a lot to do with that. Aside from the phony Himalyas scenes the rest of the sets were alright, again, considering the era. I now own a copy of the film on DVD. As noted, they don't make 'em like that anymore. And that's too bad.</fullReview>

Also, Gene Tierney is one of the most beautiful stars ever even if she's a real b***** in this movie.Anne Baxter is a feast for the eyeballs as the doomed contender for Power's affections. I think this was her first role. Clifton Webb as the tiresome old homosexual trying to butt into everyone's business was right on the money. And how many novel adaptations feature the novelist in the framing scenes? (I don't know either, but not many, I'll bet).I like the scene where Larry is doing manual labor in Paris all day and discussing the Upanishads with wild-eyed old dudes in cafes at night.Damn!

		<shortDescription>Tyrone Power's first film after he returned from WWII</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somerset Maugham book was brought to the screen with a few changes to the original plot. However, once you have seen this movie, you can understand why Tyrone Power chose this particular role as his first film. He picked the right vehicle to star in, I feel, returning from his service in World War 2. Clifton Webb is his usual fabulous, ornery, opinionated, prejudiced character - Stealing every scene he is in. Gene Tierney is so gorgeous outside, dressed in Oleg Cassini's best. She is breathtaking in every scene. Anne Baxter was perfect as Sophie, the childhood friend, the fiance, the wife and the widow. However, I wanted to see more of Herbert Marshall, who played the author Mr. Maugham. Herbert is always great. Mr. Maugham wrote the book based on somebody he had met in life, and so he shows up throughout the movie. The only person I didn't like was the miscast Elsa Lancaster, however, can't blame her for wanting that role! I love this story, finally a picture where the hero "Larry" ends up doing what's right, instead of what is socially acceptable or expected of him by his family and friends. This is one of my top ten favorite movies because of the characters, the ending and the actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Two veterans each had to find some way to adjust to civilian life after years in various branches of the armed services. The role of Larry Darrell (Tyrone Power) demonstrates how adjustment was for many, some had rather a difficult time and others had things more easy. The film essentially covers the return to normalcy, when it was possible to do so. Most importantly, this film does not trivialize the process: in fact, the very strength of the plot lies in the parts played by characters that symbolized those who remained civilians and either had to adjust to the post-war years or help others to do so. Indeed, the supporting cast is amazingly strong. Gene Tierney (as Isabel) and Clifton Webb (as Templeton) are outstanding in this production, and need be recognized as such. Others deserve mention for their performances: Herbert Marshall as W. Somerset Maugham, Cecil Humphrey as the Holy Man, and John Payne as Gray Maturin. Even more minor characters lead to the complete quality of this film. In the final analysis, the movie's major theme is concisely put: "The time had come to put the world behind you." One wonders how many of those who experienced World War Two could.</fullReview>

How could anyone play a sophisticated English author better than Marshall? Webb is perfect as the snobbish, elegant, judgemental and prissy Elliot Templeton. Tierney is Isabel- beautiful, elegant, a little spoiled, sweet and a little conniving. Payne is Gray- loyal, pleasant, big, hulking, undemanding. Baxter won the Academy Award for her Sophie. One of Power's better roles. I own the video and have watched it at least a dozen times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Webb Owns It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clifton Webb gives a shockingly brilliant performance. We have seen him play a snob elsewhere. He's grand and snippy elsewhere. But here he sobs more movingly than anyone else till Juliet Stevenson in "Truly Madly Deeply." And seeing a man weep this was surely a departure for the time! Webb superbly plays a gay character in a time that big-budget movies were not touching such topics. (Film noir was filled with it but no one seemed to notice or care.) Anne Baxter is also superb as the ill-fated Sophie. I think it's her best performance. It's a heart breaker. She's good in the brilliant "All About Eve." And everything and everyone involved in "The Magnificent Ambersons" is memorable -- with the exception of the butchered ending.Herbert Marshall, not a particular favorite of mine, is very good in the role of Somerset Maugham, also.Gene Tierney looks gorgeous and is good. But her character is inconsistent. That's not her fault. But she was, though extraordinarily beautiful, not a great actress. Tyrone Power is OK as the nominal central character. I have to say that his finding salvation in India is thoroughly unconvincing. Again, not because of him but because it is sketched in and almost ludicrously implausible.John Payne does nothing with a role that could have been multifaceted. This may be a result of the direction, as Payne was a good actor generally.Overall, it is a superb movie. Without the Webb character it would -- yes -- be a lot less interesting. But clearly a lot of time and money went into its making. And that time and money paid off well.</fullReview>

"The Razor's Edge" is about a young man trying to find himself after WWI and the Depression. He tries to help people and himself, but sometimes disappoints some people by pursuing his life alone. Mr. Power works with Gene Tierney again. She was his perfect leading lady. Ms. Tierney plays a selfish woman like she did in "Leave Her To Heaven".

Zanuck was one of the legendary producers of the time, The Razors Edge is one of his finest productions.From the novel by W.Somerset Maugham; Lamar Trotti crafted a brilliant screenplay very ably directed by Edmund Goulding.The cast headed by Tyrone Power, Gene Tierney,Anne Baxter,John Payne,Herbert Marshall &amp; Clifton Webb. these 6 stars were among the best actors of the era. Each one was brilliant, Anne Baxter won an Oscar for her brilliant role as the doomed Sophie. Clifton Webb was nominated for his acid tongue performance. No one was able to top the actual supporting Oscar performance of Harold Russell in The Best Years of Our Lives.In smaller but equally excellent performances were Elsa Lancaster-the social secretary towards the end &amp; Fritz Kortner as Kosi--in the coal mining scene. These as well as others added to the full enjoyment of this powerful drama.I was filmed in beautiful Black and White,on the sound stages at the Studio. The scenes in India were filmed in Colorado, one mountain peak is the same as any other.There is very little action, just brilliant dialogue.lots of romance but no nudity or sex scenes. Non-the-less it still is too mature for children. It would get a PG rating today.I have seen this about 15 times since it was released, I can easily see it many more times. The running time of 145 minutes goes fast.Ratings: **** out 4 ---99 points---out of 100 IMDB--10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cavalcade Of Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several members of high society and their friends interact socially and romantically, and then through time go their separate ways, only to have their lives intersect again years later. It's a sprawling story that begins in 1919, and extends over several decades and more than one continent. "The Razor's Edge" is a kind of epic melodrama.Out of all these characters (Larry, Isabel, Gray, Sophie, Elliott, and a couple of others), the plot centers mostly on Larry Darrell (Tyrone Power), an unconventional young man more interested in wisdom and truth than in worldly success. In his quest, Larry travels to India, studies with a spiritual guru, then returns home where his "enlightenment" has an effect on former friends and lovers.The film's script is heavy on dialogue. Some scenes convey a soap-opera feel, as characters talk on and on about their frustrations, their hopes and dreams, their opinions of others, and their general outlook on life. The talk slows down the action, but allows viewers to get to know the characters. The plot is rather spread out, diffuse, headed in multiple directions. Some scenes are included only for their atmospheric effect, and do not really advance the story. Overall tone of the film is serious and at times somber.The B&amp;W cinematography is adequate. There are many long, continuous medium camera shots; few close-ups. The director relies on painted backdrops and process plates, which lower the visual authenticity quotient. Production design is lush; costumes are elegant. The film required some eighty sets and a huge number of extras. This is a very big budget film.As a character driven story, "The Razor's Edge" is okay, but a tad talky and pretentious for my taste. I couldn't really get interested in these people, their lives, or their drama. For me, the most enjoyable element was watching Clifton Webb give a terrific performance as a socialite snob, and listening to his opinions about himself and those around him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this on TV perhaps twenty years ago and it impressed me as a fine movie, so when I spotted the DVD at silly money I snapped it up and on balance I'm glad I did. It's an adaptation of one of Willie Maugham's less mannered novels and with six major characters plus literally dozens of smaller roles it's a classic example of the kind of movie that Hollywood has forgotten how to do. Journeyman director Eddie Goulding is at the top of his game and for good measure he wrote three songs heard in the background one of which, Mam'selle, went on to become something of a 'standard' good enough to be recorded twice by Sinatra. Initially the story has something in common with Phillip Barry's 'Holiday' (filmed in 1938 with Cary Grant and Kate Hepburn) inasmuch as an intelligent, well-educated young man, prefers to 'loaf' rather than settle down to a job, family, etc. The crucial difference is that the guy in Holiday merely wants to reverse the order of things by living life to the full whilst he's young and then, at forty or so, pay the piper by settling down to work, marriage, etc. Larry Darrell on the other hand is on a spiritual quest for nothing less than the Meaning Of Life, an attitude that tends to alienate his gotrocks fiancée, Isobel (Gene Tierney) and especially her uncle, Snob's Snob Elliott Templeton (Clifton Webb), others in their set such as Sophie (Anne Baxter) and Gray Maturin (John Payne) are more tolerant. The story is set up by Maugham himself (Herbert Marshall) and we follow Larry from Chicago to Paris, India, and back again. It would be difficult to think of another actor in Hollywood in 1946 who could better exemplify 'goodness' than Tyrone Power. Like Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt today Power was handicapped by his good looks but unlike them he could actually act and he does so here to excellent effect. Webb and Tierney team up again following their success in Laura a couple of years earlier but this time Tierney gets to display her claws and limns a fine study in hatred. Anne Baxter deserved her Best Supporting Actress gong though more so when she sheds her goody-two-shoes persona in the wake of the death of her husband and daughter and becomes a tramp. Overall an excellent film of the kind they just don't make anymore, at least not in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to give the 1946 version of The Razor's Edge a ten. One, because I think it deserves a ten and second, because of nostalgia. I was a teen when the book came out and I read it and began fashioning myself after Larry forsaking completely Paris Mitchell from King's Row. Ah,fickle youth. Anyway, I still think that this version holds up remarkably well after all these years. And I view it occasionally just to enjoy it and the wonderful way that Edmond Goulding moves the character around and his handling of the crowd scenes. Very well done.Although Gene Tierney had a full and varied career in movies her Isobel is my favorite. She outdoes herself and her role in Leave Her to Heaven pales in comparison. I don't know if many know that Eliot Templeton was closer to the author Somerset Maugham in temperament who was partial to lemon yellow slacks,fusha and mauve, and flowing scarfs, he always said that Herbert Marshall gave him class. He liked that view. Mr Marshall essayed Maugham in The Moon and Six Pence. But one thing is sure, Mr Maugham sure could spin a yarn and he is surly missed. As for Mr Power, it's true that his producer wanted to "pull all the stops out" for his return to the screen and The Razor's Edge is just the right vehicle for Mr Power, he really did want to expand into something other than a pretty face, at least he knew that he couldn't do this forever and his role in Nightmare Alley proved it. Unfortunately, Mr Power was diagnosed with something fatal but refused to hear what it was, he said that he'd just rather live and then let death come when it would come. The actor was serious about wanting to break away from swashbuckling roles and we were fortunate to see and Agnes Moorhead, Charles Laughton, and Charles Boyer in the reading from John Brown's Body. We were thrilled by that reading, and my opinion of Mr Power increased ten fold. Anne Baxter did a damned good job as Sophie and considering the time (1945) she essayed her character very well. Some viewers seem to think that Mr Power was too wooden in this part, I don't think so, you could see through his eyes what he was thinking. All in all, this is among my favorite moves. I hope it's found it's way into your film library. Also, I don't think that there are any Spoilers here but if they are forgive me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deep travel in the human soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the few real philosophical and enjoyable movies I have ever seen. The acting is perfect, played by the best actors (H. Marshall, whom you'll enjoy see act in "littles foxes" as well!0) of this time. The script is beautifully written, all characters have strong personalities, and it is not only a strong and easy introduction to the eternal deep human interrogations, which would never be enough to make a good film (for I think that films are made to show things from an artistic and not an intellectual point of view, also I don't like enclosing things like that!0), but also simply a touching film, a moving one. And it is certainly made of hope, but not a cheap one, because it doesn't hide the cruel part of the human soul. And hopefully, everyone is not only made of black or white, but of both of them, plus many other amazing things, like this beautiful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Razor's Edge', produced by Fox Studios, has a terrific cast and a storyline that is profound and deeply moving. This film benefits from repeated viewings- after my first viewing of the film my vote was sitting at around a 7 or 8, now with my third viewing it has a 9. Truly a wonderful movie.Tyrone Power delivers a steady, well-acted performance as Larry Darrell, a flier who returns from World War One with a new perspective on life after a fellow aviator saves his life, but is then killed. Darrell believes there is more to life than the accumulation of wealth and a good place in society, and thus begins to questions the values that his beautiful fiancé Isabel Bradley (Gene Tierney, in a great performance), and her social set, hold. We are introduced to the main characters in the opening party sequence, with the kind Sophie (Anne Baxter), watchful author Somerset Maugham (Herbert Marshall) and Isabel's eccentric Uncle Elliot (Clifton Webb) all having a presence.They want him to settle down, but Larry decides that he must go to Paris in the search for wisdom and knowledge. He spends a year 'loafing', much to the dismay of his snobbish fiancé, who he breaks up with. His quest to find out the true meaning of existence leads him to work in a coalmine in Northern France and love at a monastery in India. This is a definitely a spiritual journey for Darrell, but Isabel is tired of waiting for marriage and weds the straight, sensible Gray Maturin in America.Things come to a head when years later Larry returns to Paris and discovers that Gray's finance has been wiped out in the Wall Street crash, Isabel has two daughters and Sophie has lost her husband and child in a tragic accident and drifted into alcoholism. Uncle Elliot doesn't want to know him, but Larry's essential quality of 'goodness' may be the only thing that can help this sorry bunch of people.This is a rich, multi-layered film that is thought-provoking. It is glossy, and the Himalayan backdrop and other sets are very phoney, yet that doesn't take away from the good work that lies in this film. Gene Tierney is excellent as the manipulative socialite, Isabel. As we soon find out, Isabel has never gotten over Larry and will stop nothing to prevent others from disturbing his 'happiness'. She is a controlling, smart woman and the most interesting of the characters on offer here. Tierney is most beautiful here, and her underrated acting talent is on show. She really takes hold of this film by the neck in the second-half, with her and Baxter both lifting the production to new levels.That brings me to Baxter's performance. She is perhaps even better than Tierney as the tragic Sophie who the gang discover in a seedy Paris nightclub, drinking her life away. Baxter plays this difficult role beautifully, running the gamut of emotions from excited bride to heartbroken widow to jaded, hopeless alcoholic in a powerful performance. She won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar, and it was a well-deserved award.Clifton Webb is in camp-mode here as Uncle Elliot, but he too is excellent in his role. Elliot is obviously a homosexual, but of course that's never spoken about with the production code being in force in Hollywood. But the language of film speaks volumes, as Elliot demands tassels that 'sway!' and has other decidedly feminine qualities. Herbet Marshall is his usual steady self as Maugham, the 'watcher' of the piece. He is a wonderful, calm presence in the film and I really enjoyed his performance. Power proved he could act in this one, and is he handsome! Tierney and Power look beautiful together. The cast also includes delightful Lucile Watson and a small appearance from Elsa Lanchester.This film is interesting as we presented with two sides of the story. Is Isabel selfish in her resolve to only marry Darrell if he settles down or is she sensible? Indeed, no woman should want a loafer husband who has to scrape out a living to support her and her family. Is Isabel right about Sophie's decline into alcoholism, that she doesn't want to be saved by Darrell and instead has death wish? It certainly seems so, as Sophie and Larry's intended marriage is one of convenience, not love. Isabel is cruel in her assessment of the situation, but is it a cruelly honest one? Quality Fox Production that holds up very well after all these years.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awakening 101 with the Razor's Edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen too many movies that have been made prior to the '80s and surprise surprise, I was able to sit through this one.My reading on Bhagwan Ramana Maharishi, Shiva Darshan of Arunachala, led me to this movie, where the hills of Arunachala and the Bhagwan Himself have been depicted in this movie. Somerset Maugham visited the Bhagwan and got his inspiration to write this story. This is a classic indeed. I can understand why "Sophia" Anne Baxter won the best supporting actress Oscar for it. Tyrone Power's enactment of the lead character is truly magnificent and gripped me. The movie has surprises at every turn, never a dull moment and the black and white cinematography, though dated obviously, is amazingly well done. It is a classic in every which way. I had to borrow a VHS Cassette from the local library, and for the lack of a VCR, I had to watch a digitally converted version, but it was well worth the effort. This is one classic that I will need to watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fine film of the kind they don't (yet) make these days</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My comment is prompted by the BBC Radio 4 adaptation broadcast in late December (05) and which showed how much the story needs visual characterisation. On radio, Larry's explanation of his religious outlook seems remote, almost theoretical - and I doubt that many listeners got the point, unless they knew the story already. BBC did some good casting though, and maybe two hours was too short for the adaptation. Clifton Webb's performance in the film was memorable, one of the 'death bed scenes' that seemed to count for something, and unlike the radio version, the film ably contrasted the ephemeral views of protagonists vis a vis the reborn Larry. I last saw the film some years ago - I am in my seventies and have been an avid film-goer since the 1930s (see my book, 'What's on at the Pictures' (Evergreen, UK) so had opportunity to see major movies in their original presentation. Given the growing spirituality of the times, a new version might work, but would have to move back from the computer-image acting and production styles of our time. Maybe Somerset Maugham was a child of his age, but people still seem to be following Larry and going east.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good movie that should have been better. It is full of excellent little scenes and fine touches, such as the scene at the coal mine with the ex-priest. The photography and quality of the sets are wonderful. There are wonderful scenes in very believable little French hotels and bistros. There are subtle recurring symbols of a philosophical and religious nature.As others have written, it is centered on the story of a WWI veteran (Larry, played by Tyrone Power) who can't get serious about the routine kind of life everyone else seems to be pursuing in Chicago after the war. He wants more. He gives up marrying the beautiful Isabel (Gene Tierney) and has enough money to travel to Paris, then to India, seeking enlightenment and wisdom. That could be hokey, but it is handled well. He is gone long enough for Isabel to give up on him and marry someone she doesn't really love named Gray (John Payne). Also, an old friend of Larry's named Sophie (Anne Baxter) meets tragedy in her family life.Years later, Larry returns from India to Paris and meets Gray, Isabel, her rich uncle Elliott (Clifton Webb) and others there. The stock market has crashed and Gray and Isabel have lost most of their money. They are living with Elliott. Larry has an unusual hypnosis scene with Gray. I was intrigued and thought the situation really had a lot of potential. I loved the scenes with Anne Baxter in Paris. But somehow, after that the main thread got lost. It is a long movie, but maybe not long enough to really do justice to all the subplots. Some of them should have been toned down or dropped, though I admit choosing which one wouldn't be easy.Anne Baxter was superb. Every scene she was in was gripping. Clifton Webb was good, but I got tired of him. There was too much about him. Having Somerset Maugham appear in the movie as a character had its advantages, but somehow didn't really work for me, though the scene where he starts to seduce Tierney is great. Music, direction, plot, production values -- all are first rate. But the movie lives or dies based on the plot and the characterizations. For me, the two main flaws are Tierney and Power. Tyrone Power is just too handsome, in a plastic sort of way, and ultimately fails to be believable. Tierney is in one sense perfectly cast for the villainess -- maybe too perfectly. She is too obvious, too one-note. The contrast with the performance of Anne Baxter is striking. So it's a very good movie that makes me want to see the 1984 remake, and read the novel. I wish they could have cast someone other than Tyrone Power.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a long , but beautiful story of a man's search for what life is all about. The song, "Mam'sel" is heard hauntingly throughout the film. The rivalry between the characters of "Isabel" played by Gene Tierney and "Sophie" played by Anne Baxter, as a result of their feelings for Tyrone Power as "Larry", results in the latter resuming her drinking which ultimately leads to her death. The beautifully-read words read by Power in tribute to Sophie after he learns of her death is my favorite part of the film. With the song "Mam'sel" heard in the background, he reads the an ode from Keats, one he had previously read to "Sophie" when she was a small girl. Since first seeing this movie, I have always wanted to obtain a copy of those words and I have through another portion of this website that deals with this motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Tyrone Power movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the finest movie Tyrone Power ever made, in my opinion. Though the stage backdrops for some scenes are a little over the top and the thunder during one bar scene to drive home a point is a bit too much, it all works for a great movie. Really listen to Tyrone's explanation to Lucy (Gene Tierney) at the beginning of the movie and you can see why Tyrone nails this performance. He really projects feeling and the 1,000 mile stare from a war veteran. He seems to be speaking from experience from his WWII years. This movie would fail if Gene Tierney had not put in an equally riveting performance. She knows how to play the heavy when asked. She is also at her best. The camera really shows how beautiful she was. I only wish they could have worked on more movies together before Tyrone died.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very complicated and unusual existentialist film that's worth your time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly bizarre film for Hollywood, as instead of the usual shallow themes, this film is all about existential angst. The film begins with a group of good-looking and well to do people at a party just following the end of WWI. Here we are introduced to the main characters we'll see throughout this lengthy film. The most important character is played by Tyrone Power. While he isn't as rich as the rest of these people, he is comfortable enough. However, he surprises everyone by announcing he not only doesn't want to get married now that the war is over (disappointing his girlfriend, played by Gene Tierney), but he also doesn't want a fancy white-collar job but wants to do manual labor and explore who he is--an understandable thing considering that WWI shattered so many people's ideas of the meaning of life.Miss Tierney THINKS this is just a passing fancy, so she at first encourages Tyrone. However, when it's clear he's serious and if they did marry, they'll be relatively poor, she drops him and chooses a richer man. Tyrone is not hurt by this and encourages her to marry a wealthy man, as he knows it might be years until he's ready to settle down and he has no idea where his quest will take him.Other characters you meet at the party are the author himself, Sommerset Maugham (who was not a character in the 1984 remake). I'm not sure if he placed himself in the original story--I'll have to read up on this. There is also Clifton Webb playing a snobbish and acid-tongued uncle. Generally, he's like his Mr. Belvedere character but rich and more snobbish. Late in the film, the shallowness of this man actually leads to a wonderful but heart-wrenching scene on his death bed. In addition, there is Tierney's husband and Sophie (Anne Baxter).All these characters, in one way or another, explore or refuse to explore the meaning of life and either choose to step outside their comfort zone or they choose stagnation and self-absorption. These parallel stories are fascinating and make for a very deep and satisfying film as long as you are willing to give the story a chance and don't demand a by-the-numbers Hollywood style film.Excellent acting, writing and direction all in all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw The Razor'as edge for the first time on TCM, and what surprised me was that though the film begins in 1919, there is no sense whatsoever that we are not in the late 1940's. Of course it is difficult for a movie to recreate an era only 15 years earlier, but there is no concession to fashion, hair styles, or anything that suggests the Roaring Twenties. In the first scene, the band is playing songs of the era, but with 1940's sound and arrangements. Sometimes lack of time sense doesn't matter, but here I think it does.I'm not sure why Eastern Wisdom has held such a fascination for intellectual writers of the era. I wish some seekers would go off looking for enlightenment within our own culture. The movie reminds me of Lost Horizon where the protagonist goes seeking enlightenment in a thoroughly bogus East.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good film version of W. Somerset Maugham's epic novel, starring two of my favorite classic stars together?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having never read the original Somerset Maugham novel before, I discovered this film because it included two of my favorite classic stars together, Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney. I thought they had fantastic chemistry in SON OF FURY (1942) and they made a gorgeous couple. This ambitious film is their second film together and their relationship and romance here is far more mature than in SON OF FURY, but they are wonderful together nevertheless in a superb drama that includes an excellent supporting cast.Dare I say that Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney offer the best performances in their film careers here? Tyrone Power wanted to tackle a complex dramatic role after military service in the Second World War, and he finally got his chance by playing Larry Darrell, the soul-searching protagonist of THE RAZOR'S EDGE. Gene Tierney, fresh off her Oscar-nominated performance in LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN (1945), gives a marvelous portrayal as the cold and selfish Isabel Bradley. They are excellent together despite an underdeveloped script, giving the film a somewhat unemotional feeling. If the script gave the characters an ability to strike a deep emotional response for the audience, the film could've been the masterpiece Darryl F. Zanuck, the big boss of 20th Century-Fox Studios and the film's producer, had hoped it to be.Despite the underdeveloped script and the film's lack of heart, the supporting cast is excellent?including the likes of Clifton Webb, Lucille Watson, and Herbert Marshall as W. Somerset Maugham?and deliver some of their best acting in this film under the meticulous direction of Edmund Goulding. Only Anne Baxter, in an Oscar-winning supporting role, failed to impress me in a seemingly hammy performance. The film's production values are truly marvelous despite the obvious studio backdrops during Larry's journey within the Himalayas. Alfred Newman, one of my favorite classic film composers, delivers a gorgeous and incredibly lush music score that suits the epic scale of the film perfectly. Special mention should also go to Arthur C. Miller for his beautiful black-and-white cinematography.Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney would later star in an average romantic comedy called THAT WONDERFUL URGE (1948), their third and final film together at 20th Century-Fox. It's a shame that they didn't make more movies together despite their excellent on-screen chemistry in SON OF FURY and THE RAZOR'S EDGE. Personally, I would have loved to have seen them together in a series of THIN MAN-style mystery films if the studio had the temerity to make such films in the 1940s. In a footnote, let me say that Tyrone and Gene had their off-screen flirtations together during production of THE RAZOR'S EDGE. But in her autobiography SELF-PORTRAIT, Gene recalled that she couldn't fall in love with Tyrone because she was already married to Oleg Cassini and was having an affair with future president John F. Kennedy. Also, Tyrone was married to French actress Annabella at the time. So an off-screen romance between Tyrone and Gene was impossible.THE RAZOR'S EDGE is an entertaining and intelligent film that is very worthwhile despite its very long running time and cold center, but fans of Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney will undoubtedly be pleased by the wonderful chemistry and excellent acting of the on-screen couple together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a superb film and I have a copy of it in my collection., I am aware of a 1984 remake, but I cannot imagine it being better or even equal to this 1946 rendition of W. Somerset Maugham's work. I much prefer the cast in the 1946 version and I cannot imagine Bill Murray in the role of Larry Darrell. I thought the performances by Tyrone Power, Herbert Marshall, Gene Tierney, Lucille Watson and Clifton Webb were very good, along with that of Anne Baxter as well! Why is it that some clowns in Hollywood (The Twilight Zone?) these days seem to think they can do a better version of certain films made in the 1940s? I read somewhere that Brad Pitt wanted to remake The Fountainhead, a 1949 film that starred Gary Cooper, Patricia Neal and Raymond Massey. I can just imagine Ayn Rand rolling over in her grave at the thought of Pitt perverting her work. Brad needs to stay close to Jolie and mind the kids they have adopted or planning to have or whatever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not My Kind Of Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a case where I didn't like the original film - this one with Tyrone Power starring - nor the remake with Bill Murray. I have two major angles of this movie I simply didn't like. I say this because it really isn't a reflection of the film, just of my beliefs and preferences, which certainly weren't placated in this story.Rearding the story, if someone chooses not to be a believer in God, that's their business and they are entitled to believe what they want. But, hear me out on this. In this film Power's "Larry Darrell" says he wants to go to Europe to find himself, that he doesn't much believe in God and he's advised to go seek wisdom from some "wise man" in India (as if he would know more than God.) In one day of seeing a pretty landscape in India, Larry now has obtained "inner peace" and is a new man forever. Okaaay.Rarely has Hollywood, even in the classic era, shown people who have converted this fast to Biblical beliefs.....but when it is New Age mumbo-jumbo or a Far East religion or any other belief other than Biblical in nature.....no problem! This movie was ahead of its day in that respect, with all this secular "preaching." This came into vogue, big-time in the films beginning in the '60s and ever since.The other thing that turned me off was the long soap opera angle with spouse-cheater and just-plain-evil Gene Tierney's character, "Isabel Bradley," and the same for Anne Baxter's alcoholic role of "Sophie," although she was a much better person. Tierney, to me, is kind of a classic-era Meg Ryan: a beautiful face but always playing an ugly character.Hey, a lot of people like those immoral, bossy, bitchy-type women and/or they don't care about any religious angles in a story. I don't....and I do, so this movie was unappealing to me, and way too long at two-and-a-half hours. For others, this was 2.5 hours of bliss.</fullReview>

The Bill Murray 1984 version is to me far better in that it portrays Larry's agony and struggles far more vividly, shows why the subsistence life appealed to him, and shows the relationship with Sophie developing. This 1946 version is way overloaded with love story trivia, upper-class glamour and glossing over the major conflict (for me) of the illusion of control. The Bill Murray film helped change my life, empowering me to quit a bad job. This film would never have done that.

Clifton Webb, who seems to adore being cast as a curmudgeon, is characteristically annoying as Eliot Templeton, Anne Baxter the best of a bad bunch as Sophie and John Payne is competent as Gray Maturin.This film was actually nominated for best picture of 1946.
