		<shortDescription>Akshay stands tall as Rustum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Patriotism or Infidelity, Love for Nation or love for wife.. Was the director confused? So decided to keep both as main ingredients of this Thriller... So whats " Rustom " - Murder Mystery?? But then we know the murderer in first 30 mins.. Is it about " why she did what she did" Its easily given out in first half.. So here it goes- Rustom is a courtroom story of how a naval officer .. Defends himself.. How a judge gets in humour while the trial is on.. How a sister can wear a deep red pout while pleading to convict her brother's killer !! Ileana is overdosed on glycerin .. But so far this is her best.. Esha Gupta hired herself a new designer and she got this platform to show it all.. Otherwise who wears a page 3 outfit to court.. Arjan- nothing great about him.. His acting skills remain where they were.. Akshay... As good as he gets.. He is ageing gracefully and has totally justified his screen space. Songs can be given a pass.. Hats off to the casting director Shruti Mahajan for collecting together a well fitted cast.. Be it the investigating officer or the newspaper head who brought in the humour in n otherwise serious watch.. &#x1f44f;&#x1f3fc;&#x1f44f;&#x1f3fc; for you girl!! The story keeps one gripped.. Those who like courtroom drama .. Should watch!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>taut thriller! controlled and matured performance by Akshay!.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We went to this movie with a suspicion that this will be as usual Bollywood type glorified and twisted movie.. but we were in for a pleasant surprise. production values are great.. 1950's sets were decently propped and colorful retro chic style attire looked classy. the story is fast paced and takes the viewer for a good ride.. Akshay and Pawan Malhotra simply blow us away with their razor sharp performances. Akshay keeps his ice-cool composure throughout the movie.. and Pawan.. with his inimitable pout and with a ciggy in one hand.. is the movie's style quotient ;-). the actresses are passable..ileana looks gorgeous but wooden not classy enough for the Brit sylvie. esha looks chic and tries hard to make a presence.. unfortunately story has little for her apart from looking hard on everyone and loud-mouthing..for someone who would want to see a thrilling Hindi movie with a 1950 backdrop, this is the perfect one. but for someone who wants to see a 100% correct depiction of nanavati case, this may not be his/hers cup of tea :-).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for bunch of lies over Nanavati Case</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever Bollywood vomits any Akshay Kumar movie, one could expect a nonsensical patchwork of random stories which eventually make Kumar appear as the only virtuous Hero around. Movie is all set to blow up Akki's political dreams in smoke. It is bland and nowhere emotionally connects with the audience or lives up to their expectations. In fact the movie covers the old Nanavati case with patriotic excuses and bunch of lies that makes it to miss out on truth entirely. Moreover it gives a morally wrong impression that a Navy Official could get away with the murder of his slutty wife's boyfriend by bluffing the jury with a lame conspiracy theory. And Judiciary, Media and Public would in turn dance to his tunes under the strong peer pressure of patriotism attached with the uniform. I guess Akki was over-confident about creating a sensation with his 'holier-than- thou' mustache and those lame army trumpets, which jumped into action during his wisecrack moments. He expected the audience to do a victory-march out of the theater crying the slogan "Abki baar Akki-Sarkaar" over his extraordinary performance. But that moment never came. What's more outrageous is that the motive for murder wasn't that Vikram Makhija (Arjan Bajwa) was sleeping with Rustom Parvi's (Akshay Kumar) wife, but because Vikram was a small component of a big scam involving minister and navy seniors. Wacky, isn't it? While the truth was entirely different. Courtroom drama: allegations made by the prosecutor would make you wonder if they were purposely diluted to make a valid point in favor of Rustom Parvi by the scriptwriter or the Government is in regular habit of hiring loony lawyers??? Judge on the other hand was like a black-moody school principal, who went ballistic over every objection made by the prosecutor, no matter how rational it sounded. Movie in a nutshell is a failed attempt to bulldoze audience into accepting Akki's lordship. God save us from such movies</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very lil to do with the actual case. Nevertheless a decent one time watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I appreciate the fact that Akshay has started picking up some good genre n deviated from his usual stuff. The movie was a decent one time watch. It had very lil to do with the actual case. A really important case which really needed to be shown with responsibility. It could have been an awesome one if they had paid attention to the screenplay. If only they could have portrayed the courtroom scenes very seriously rather than making it a bad comedy. Why was there a need to show Esha Gupta as a courtesan? Why was there a need to show the justification of Illeanas adultery? Why couldn't they jus show that she was away from her husband for 6 months n that she jus felt the urge to satisfy herself. N why was the need to show that Akshay killed the guy coz he was doing some anti national shady deal n not coz he slept with his wife. One really good thing that caught my attention was the explanation given why he shot 3 bullets. Nice one. The opening courtroom scenes reminded me of Anthony Hopkins Fracture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>too many lapses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>keeping in mind the topic and the cast (well mainly Akshay), the movie showed a lack of effort on account of the production team. Imagine how poor that was that a person like me who rarely notices any lapses is writing a review.1 - When the newspaper guy brought a lawyer to Commander Sb in lock up, the lawyer said "Dont say stuff like this in front of anyone else, other wise forget GOD, even I cant save you" (forgive me if my translation is not exact but I hope you get the idea) Well I don't remember ever in the few hundred movies that I have watched, I have ever heard this dialogue like this. It has always been vice-versa and this doesn't make sense.2 - The prosecutor, don't remember his name, he was supposed to be a very big lawyer, well he was representing a very rich family and such families hire big lawyers, and his acting was more of a comedian than a senior lawyer.3 - The corrupt navy people paid 5 crores and Akshay didn't have the papers and they just paid him and didn't demand for the papers and they wont ask for the papers and nothing was done even in the regard to get them punished?4 - no one asked why on earth a naval commander called Defense Secretary before going to meet Vikram? specially as no one knew that Rustom has met Defense Secretary before and that he knew all about the corruption scandal? So I am amazed that this movie has got a 7.6 rating.Good things though were Akshay and Ileana, their acting and persona. Ileana with her teeth looks so cute, I hope she does not get dental surgery to get them straight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth a watch - Murder Mystery keeps the interest alive till very end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suspense thriller that succeeds in maintaining the viewers interest alive till the very end of the movie. Went to see this movie without great expectations and found it reasonably good. Everyone in the audience seemed satisfied. Personally for me it was worth the time and money spent. The main character of the Akshay Kumar and is well supported by all other cast. The story takes twists and turns with backstory revealed gradually. Watched the movie sitting in the fourth row from the front with keeping the head up throughout. The movie was engrossing and did not let me feel the pain in the neck. The visuals are pleasing and we feel like being in environment of 1960. It is definitely well worth a watch for movie buffs. You will enjoy it better if you avoid knowing the story details.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good one-time watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nanavati case of the 1950s seems to be hot on the literary and film scene in India right now. Just a few weeks ago I read R. Raj Rao's novel, Lady Lolita's Lovel, a clever and entertaining juxtaposition of the Nanavati case and D. H. Lawrence's novel, Lady Chatterley's Lover. Rustom, inspired by the Nanavati case, is entertaining to say the least. Just like Akshay Kumar's previous films Holiday, Baby and Airlift. And because Akshay Kumar seems to have mastered the formula of creating fast-paced thrillers with quick lessons in patriotism and nationalism, even Rustom, apparently inspired by an incident of adultery, too has been injected with liberal doses of patriotism.Most things work for Rustom. Though the period setting does not really impress, the writing does. The courtroom scene, especially, has been written quite well. There is humour in it, and a tongue-in-cheek feeling.Akshay Kumar, despite being the lead star, is not the best thing about Rustom. It is the supporting cast. Be it Pavan Malhotra as the investigating police officer, Kumud Mishra as the newspaper editor who turns the public opinion in Rustom's favour, Usha Nadkarni as the Pavris' domestic help, Sachin Khedekar as the prosecution lawyer, or Anang Desai as the judge&#x2796;the supporting actors have been given opportunities and they have delivered.The weakest thing about Rustom is, perhaps, its female lead: Ileana D'Cruz. Maybe the cue given to her was "look sad", so she has a crestfallen appearance throughout the film. Esha Gupta is better, though quite over the top. With a Zeenat Aman-ish appearance, Esha Gupta brings a certain glamour to her character.Not perfect - in fact, far from being perfect - Rustom is a good one-time watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging court drama with good number of twists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No wonder why Akshay kumar is the bankable star of Bollywood who scores a clean six in the box office for the third time in the year. Rustom story is based on the scandalous Murder case involving naval officer KM Nanavati of 1959 which gave a big scoop to the press media back then. Rustom Pavri a naval officer in a decorated position shoots his friend Vikram when he comes to know his wife Cynthia has an affair with Vikram who is a rich businessman. The post mortem of this three shots opens up as the rest of the movie questioning Rustom who is a strict martinet on the whys behind his impulse action. The transition from a Patriot to a murderer to a traitor and finally who is he kept the viewers puzzled till the end until the climax.Technical Side: I have to fragment each and every bit of technical that has gone into this movie to give us the wholesome feel of the period. Direction- Tinu Suresh Desai has done a brilliant job in handling the conspiracy of the case with a witty screenplay by Vipul that keeps the audience engaged from start to end. Hats off. Art Direction ? Backbone of any period film where the entire time has to be recreated to convince the audience was it done well here? Extremely well would be the answer starting from the background and the smallest thing example the biscuit packets kept in a tea shop was taken care. Costume Design- if this doesn't go hand in hand with the art department it will spoil the show and this was handled picture perfect. Worth mention would be the lead ladies attire well designed to reflect Parsi's and the aristocratic looks. It made the ladies look fabulous on their roles may it be the western outfit or the hair styling it was stupendous. Cinematography plays an important role her to show everything presentable and believable on celluloid. Camera well-handled by Santhosh Thundyil. Entire team stands as a proof of a well-researched play. I would say at least for the periodic time factors and not the actual case as definitely some fictions would have been added. Casting- Got to be Akshay Kumar no doubt is the show stealer here may it be his body language or expressions or dialogue delivery he nailed it. Ileana as the lead lady Cynthia looks convincing as a parsi community lady. Esha Gupta as Preeti Makhija has pulled the aristocratic attitude well even the way she stood in the witness podium was justifying. All the other support cast did a fantastic job I would say special mentions would be the Judge and the publisher. Overall an out and out crime suspense interrogation court drama well enacted. Don't miss if you like drama thrillers. Rating would be 8 on 10. - Sivaklumar Balachandran</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Celebrates crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rustom is a perfect example of how tawdry cinema gets showcased in India. This is what sells, unfortunately seems to work as well for the Indian multitude.RUSTOM DEBRIEFING Neeraj Pandey walks in again, this time in a courtroom, with Akshay Kumar in the vanguard as is his constant wont, the face he still encashes upon without batting an eye. Neeraj invariably manages to find the actor in him somehow, and as long as they deliver nobody's really complaining.The movie released as part of Plan C Studios is helmed by Dharmendra Suresh Desai (Tinu Suresh Desai). The story of Rustom is inspired by the original 1959 Nanavati case however crashes in with a sub-plot that tries to celebrate the anti-hero primarily to justify murder.The case that had the nation by its throat finds itself in the spotlight again. It is a sad country we live in. Crimes tend to find poetic justice by the crowd. Criminals are worshipped like Gods as they bend the rules to their will. Courtrooms are akin mockery stages. Judges are like those people on the podium who fail to pacify the crowd despite bestowed with unrivalled power.One good look at the movie and you will feel how it is nothing but a societal mockery of the Indian Judicial System. Oh wait! We have a living exemplary proof of that too. (Remember Bhai's hit and run case?) Also, Rustom depicts Journalism in a way it has often worked in reality. This façade of it is abhorrent ? trying to manipulate judgments, creating sympathy to save someone by painting its very own picture, inadvertently overlapping its thoughts on others and showing them a falsified misleading direction.MOVIE'S DIRECTION Tinu Suresh Desai is ambitious; you could see that from his frames. He occasionally tries to experiment by breaking the usual monotony of Indian Cinema by trying to make a scene fully furbished. Like that interrogation scene where he changed frames incessantly covering subtly and quickly the primal inquisition. Also, when the Prosecution lawyer asks Preety Makhija played by Esha Gupta to calm down and sit, we find her actually sitting in an altered setting ? the courtroom. Well thought of, and superbly edited there! Also, there are miniscule aspects consumed, like a waiting courtroom where close ups of fans, switches, gavel and door are covered beautifully from various vantages.Whilst the direction had brilliant frames to show, there were numerous instances wherein enough ideas weren't spread. Like the insipid build up and revelation of a second sub-plot that went on to create sole doubt in the brains of the Jury. Also, there was no follow-up that went on to show why the Jury system was shut down in India after this unique trial.HUMOUR IN SOBRIETY The stratum of prison is no longer demeaning. So Rustom proves by showing an unbothered Kumud Mishra giving mosquito ointment to Usha Nadkarni after she openly involves in an act of irreverence with the Judge. You can't help but shake your head when you realize Desai found it funny enough to be included.A guilty man walks out like a king, and the movie still celebrates him overlooking the despicable cold-blooded crime. The tone of the movie, the 'story-ball' is deliberately put in the court of Pavri. So that like million others in time, you too appreciate what he got away with. Rustom gives out the message:"It is alright to kill a bad man." When are we going to truly escape this lawless pandemonium? THE INEFFECTUAL CASTING Also, Rustom has cheesy lines in profusion which might make you grit your teeth when they fall on your ears. There are some lines that are well executed, like when Akki and Pavan Malhotra play a game of chess in the prison. Others get lost in theatrics. Other important ones find themselves blended in with its lyrics.My biggest complain however stays with the casting of the movie. Whilst there were actors that sat perfectly in their roles, like that of Kanwaljit Singh, Akshay Kumar, Pavan Malhotra and Parmeet Sethi there were others that didn't fit the bill at all.Brijendra Kala shouldn't have even been there. He was too overqualified not to get a proper screen time.Ileana tries hard to wash away Cynthia Pavri's acts with her tears. Vexed under her own guilt and Rustom's wit, she portrays a character that is annoyingly contrasting. Her cheating act suddenly becomes an act of her helplessness which was obviously not the case at all.Then we cannot overlook the chemistry section either. There was none. Period. Neither between Cynthia and Rustom or even in that feigned display of lust in the case of Vikram and Cynthia.The cast made everything animated with their banal acts. It took out its staid naturality from the movie. Little things like the Jury shaking their heads when spoken to insinuated the apparent deficiency of vigour and verve that a court movie calls for.THE FINAL VERDICT Rustom Pavri wasn't a national hero. But this movie toils hard on making him one. We should not forget that it is just a perspective. Then again, when closely looked at, it isn't that bad either. Because it touched a sensitive topic, it piggybacked mighty expectations naturally. On comparing it with other mainstream movies that Indian Cinema has been recently celebrating for no reason at all, I would say Rustom stays well above their echelon any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Akshay Kumar always stuns viewers into creating good characters and stories.There is an elegance into which he fits according to the Genre wheather it is fun or thriller.Illeana D'Cruz, known for chubby roles in small films continue to mesmerize differing from the previous roles.Esha Gupta starring a negative character is not shady enough rather than showing how a captains family will be.All other characters are filling spaces beautifully.The composition of songs is fantastic as in airlift movie.The climax is also very surprising.This is how a good husband has to be.A person everyone wishes to have.There is comedy part where the maid says that if Rustom has killed him,it might be because he did something wrong.All in all,it is a clean movie with great singing artists and ravishing locations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie with some glitches in direction and screenplay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts with introduction of Mumbai(was Bombay) in 1950's and then a Patriot and a naval Officer Commander Rustom Pavri. They show the love life of Rustom with his wife in the beginning. His life is drastically shook when Rustom comes to know that his wife has an affair with his close friend Vikram Makhija who is a Businessman and a Womanizer(Unknown to Rustom). He shots Vikram dead with 3 bullets in heart, in anger and himself surrenders to police. Vikram's sister cases against Rustom but when he is given benefit to live in Naval custody, he refuses. The media stands with Rustom as he was a honest solider and the public prosecutor and Vikram both were Sindhi while Rustom was Parsi. Then film slowly starts to take turn as offices from Navy search for some special documents in his house, and also by means of bribe. Then Rustom himself defends himself in the court, which is shown mind-blowing(Some comedy, some drama, etc.) After a span of witnesses, defenses, the affair description of Rustom's wife and finally Rustom's explanation to the jury that he shot Vikram in his self defense, when it is clear that he will win, the movie takes a BIG LEAP. The main investigating inspector comes with an audioclip where Rustom seems to be very angry on Vikram and wants to kill. But then the movie takes another turn when the inspector meets him personally. Then Rustom tells that there was a corruption going on in Indian Navy for an aircraft carrier deal, where classified Naval Officers, Vikram and even Defense Minister were involves. They wanted to buy an aircraft carrier that was a piece of junk where high profile corruption was going and Rustom was Inspection officer of that carrier. When Rustom refuses to take bribe from Vikram, his ego is hurt and decides to take revenge from him in the form of the affair. Rustom understands that when he is sent to 6 months assignment, then he bluffs about the documents of inspection of the carrier, and that's the reason he kills Vikram. But at the end he is released by the jury. THE FILM IS A MUST WATCH, ITS A GREAT MOVIE BUT 2 STARS LESS DUE TO SOME DIRECTION GLITCHES. DIRECTION IS GOOD BUT NOT UPTO THE MARK. THE INCIDENTS ARE SOME TIMES IRRELEVANT AND SOME JUMPS. EITHER AN EXCELLENT MOVIE TO WATCH.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining thriller of a sensational crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nanavati case of 1959 affected several facets of a newly independent India. While the citizens favored the celebrated naval officer who was accused of murdering his wife's illicit partner, the media's sensational coverage of the trial sent people into a frenzy that wouldn't even spare the jury's ability to deliver unbiased justice. The patriotic purity of a naval officer's white uniform was stained with blood but people didn't seem to care. They had already passed their verdict. Director Tinu Suresh Desai uses a lot of dramatic freedom to keep the general audience engaged in the trial's proceedings. For the most part, he deviates from the actual happenings, thus setting the stage for Akshay Kumar to emerge as the nation's most patriotic hero. 'Rustom' is a fictional account of the famous Nanavati v/s State of Maharashtra case that delivers justice in quite an entertaining manner. Prolonged periods of absence on official duty brought Officer Rustom Pavri's (Akshay Kumar) wife closer to Preeti (Esha Gupta) and her brother Vikram (Arjan Bajwa). Upon his early return from a deployment, Rustom is surprised to find an empty home and soon discovers that Cynthia (Illeana D'Cruz) has been gone for 2 days. His concern turns to suspicion and his instinct leads him to Vikram's home where he sees his wife cheating on him. The following morning, Rustom confronts Cynthia and immediately heads over to Vikram's house before making two crucial stops. One, to pick up a pistol from the ship's armory and two, to make a trunk call to Delhi. Vikram is shot 3 times in his room with Rustom subsequently surrendering himself to the Police. Vincent Lobo (Pawan Malhotra) is the investigating officer, who suspects that there is something amiss about the truth that is in front of him. Citizens pick their sides with Preeti Makhija hiring the best Sindhi lawyer (Sachin Khedekar) to prosecute the accused while the Parsi community, including a local newspaper's editor, rally behind Rustom's defense of himself. The investigators, the city's citizens and the entire nation were embroiled in this sensational case that threatened to stain the patriotic image of a naval officer. While most saw the murderous act as just punishment for Vikram, others would claim that murder is afterall a crime. Popular sentiment would play a major role in the judicial system which was then based on the jury's vote. As the courtroom drama unfolds, truth hinges on perceptions and fabrication that lead to both comedy and tension. There is also a secret concerning national security that will put the pieces of the puzzle together. With the plot revolving around its protagonist, Akshay Kumar beams in the spotlight in his impeccably white uniform. With barely 2 minutes of action, the majority of his screenplay was with him either listening to accusations and narrations or arguing in his defense. In the courtroom, Sachin Khedekar leans mostly on the comic side with most of his serious accusations falling flat. Anang Desai was an unusual choice to play the Judge but it brought levity to what would have otherwise been a pretty serious court trial. The underrated Pawan Malhotra brings the sincerity and composure that come so natural with his performances and it's great to see him in a meatier role. Arjan Bajwa plays the sleazy rich playboy quite convincingly while Esha Gupta's attempt at being a vixen is simply acceptable. Illeana doesn't seem as comfortable in an altogether serious role when compared to her other outings such as Main tera hero. Unlike its producer Neeraj Pandey's more serious film-making style, Tinu Desai's Rustom doesn't take itself seriously once we enter the courtroom. While fictionalizing the facts of the 1959 case, the plot liberties taken by writer Vipul Rawal mock the system and media's influence on gullible citizens. Add to that, Tinu Suresh Desai's direction that makes patriotism and old school Bombay appear tacky versions of themselves. The music is merely added to portray the romantic relationship of the Pavris without wasting time in their courtship scenes. But barring these modest attempts of entertaining a more general population, Rustom is an engaging film that covers a sensational crime and its thrilling investigation. Another blockbuster feather in Akshay Kumar's hat that should hopefully keep him away from his crass comedy ventures.7.899 on a scale of 1-10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rustom - A blunder came out of reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akshay is one of the leading stars in Indian films. He is in fact a good actor and certainly all of his recent movies from Holiday to Rustom have one common theme -"Patriotism" which made him the "Manoj Kumar" of current times. But ,as his previous movies were good in content and performance, Rustom, unfortunately falls flat.The whole inspiration from Nanavati Case is such a big blunder and joke.What the director was thinking? Is he trying to make a movie based on real story or he was trying to make a documentary? God knows!Performance wise nothing new to look out , Akshay looks good as Navy officer but his performance was repetitive, nothing extraordinary to look at.He is very comfortable with such roles. Illeana, she is gorgeous but she has nothing to offer in this movie.Same CID like stupidity,extra marital affair with a conspiracy that looks very childish and over the top.Same goes with Esha Gupta, in the whole movie she maintained same expression with a filter pipe.Off course she is stunning, no offense to that.The main actor of the movie was the maid.She did the real acting (LOL).Such over acting (over the top). Other actors did their roles decently.Direction is OK OK and music has nothing overwhelming.Going by BO collections, Rustom is a sure shot winner because it's not a bad movie but certainly not as great as other Akki movies.It has entertainment value. It's a one time watch movie but not worked for me.I can't say about recommendation. Akki fans will watch it anyways and others also can go if they want to time pass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my second review on IMDb after I watched terrific movie Sultan. Though I am a huge fan of Akshay. But, this movie did not appeal me much. It's over exaggerated. No doubt, Akshay and Ileana both complement each other. But story lacks plotting. I did not find it captivating. May be my expectations were too high owing to the reviews I read. So, my friends its an average movie with one-time watch tag unlike Akshay Special 26, Rowdy Rathore, Airlift or any other movies. Well, Akshay we still admire you. You are truly awesome playing diversified role through the year. And, after so many good movies the expectations levels are rising so please maintain that momentum in future too. Thanks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Likely Entertaining Legal-Suspense-Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one begins "RUSTOM", it almost becomes apparent that it's one of those flashy period-dramas presented in typical BOLLYWOOD- Masala style; all inclusive of a majestic-looking peek into the 1950s era and that dramatic "hero-ki-entrance" of Cdr. Rustom Pavri. However, little do we know that the mystic events to follow surrounding the depicted seemingly 'open-and-shut murder case' shall lead us into a gripping legal whodunit.Based upon the 60's "Nanavati Murder-Trial" of a decorated Naval officer, that was encircled by nationwide public and diplomatic curiosity, the first major instances of "trial by media" and all nothing short of a phenomenon back then.As firmly quoted, "kaanoon ke pehle public decide karti hai" ? indeed puts the public with its mainly authentic narrative hooked for longer run. Cdr. Pavri defends himself for being "not guilty". Subsequently, during the course of film, one realizes that the differences between "not guilty" and "innocent" may seem the same and yet, distinctly different. Akshay Kumar is "good". Emotes his early-seasoned skills as the protagonist who murders his friend for adultery with his own wife, and gets apparently entangled in the multi-facet theories of a murderer, and even a traitor.The director Tinu Suresh Desai, whose previous "1920 London" didn't turn out very interesting, has made a major improvement. Though, the real-winner this time is the screen writing by Vipul Rawal where, perhaps a historically-significant case could have been turned banal, though, the legal-suspense-drama almost lives up-to the expectation of becoming a "thriller" which is ably and much- engrossingly supported by the very known faces - Pawan Malhotra (as the Senior Investigator), Kumud Singh (as the news-paper editor), Sachin Khedkar (the public-prosecutor), and especially Anang Desai (the hilarious/serious judge). Arjan Bajwa, Esha Gupta, Illean D'Cruz, Parmeet Sethi are all fairly decent as well, though, could have been utilized better.The viewers would find themselves laughing hard on silly-quips and also, holding breath amidst the tension. Though, the historical goof-ups and the undulating pace of the film could have been managed better.Passable as a decent watch. I am going with 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>murder mystery on real incident</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i read many review with negative comments for this movie. BUT I am against all of them. I saw Mohan jo daro and Rustom on same day. while Mohan Jo daro was not upto mark Rustom did a great job. story of Rustom is based on a real incident. I don't know how much reality in this movie but it binds the audience till end. How press manipulated the mind of jury and two community took the case very seriously. the story was clear from the beginning but how the director made all aspects to work together is great. if we talk about the actors Akshay Kumar is superb. with time he has become a legend. his previous movies like Soldier, Baby proved his high level acting. Ileana did normal job not so much impressive. while Akhsay was leading the movie there was less work for her. on the other hand Esha Gupta took the screen with her hotness. She looked fabulous in those old days fashion. I couldn't move my eyes from her. rest were normal and do their work good. but there were some mistakes which we can ignore like opposition lawyer was like comedian, discussion with witness etc. but in whole the movie is goodPrashant Gupta www.caprashant.in</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st half is promising while then the plot is being weak. The ending is happened unexpectedly as if it can be widen more more like rubber band. Mystery shattered after the 2nd half begins. Courtroom sequences are not organized. The courtroom treats are not behaving professional, only comedy. Courtroom comedies are only comic scenes of the movie. Akshay Kumar is the heart of the movie, while other are trying to 'cast only' or 'just the shooting complete'. The background scores and songs are boring, in fact unnecessary. the rating 7 is only for the acting of Akshay. Directing 5, Plot 6, Story 8, Acting 6, Camera 6, Overall 7 - Out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The storytelling is brisk with tight editing. The 70s style loud background music is a bit annoying with its dramatic overtones. The courtroom scenes were overall OK but contained several procedural errors. The similarities to the Nanavati case cannot be missed and can have one confused and disappointed. This a 100% Bollywood story and is somewhat loosely based on that case. As a Bollywood product, this is above average but in the global scene well below average. It did not meet its potential. It could have been a great thriller like "Presumed Innocent" or like a Perry Mason episode. Instead, the Bollywood treatment gives the story poetic justice and an implausible conspiracy theory twist. Still, this is a step up for Bollywood. Akshay Kumar has acted well if somewhat too stiff and wears in Navy uniform even in jail as a suspect. Only Bollywood can be that way. My vote reflects an initial score of 4 upgraded considering that this is a Bollywood make. They just cannot help being over dramatic and silly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Akshay Kumar is back with a bang. the movie is good to watch. All the actors were just brilliant with their performances. Plot could have been better as the story was almost predictable by the interval. The movie is based on an original story but also contains fictional story. The trial scenes had many lapses and it was clearly visible. The movie appears to be hyped and over rated not sure why. The songs were good and beautifully displayed. The overall set up, retro style etc were beautifully executed. The individual performance of the actors were amazing especially Akshay and Esha (who has a negative role) but the plot and the thrill quotient could have been much much better. To be honest Akshay's movie Sepcial 26 - plot wise and thrill wise was far far better than this movie. This was not even close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review. I have gone through a series of negative reviews about this movie. Thus I decided to write down something about the movie. This was expected to have a quality something more like of Neeraj Pandey's movies as in Baby and Special 26. Indeed it lacked in some points but it is not so disappointing. The script was good but the director got somewhere confused between the conspiracy, love and patriotism. Akshay was awesome as he is the most suited person for this role. The second half was much more entertaining than the first half. Most funny part was in the courtroom. Altogether it is a nice effort and must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One time watch if you are a Akshay Fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rustom is one of the hyped movies of this year. Projected as a thriller and based on the Nanavati case. Well this is not the 1st movie based on the Nanavati case.. We have had 2 movies in the past that I remember based on the same plot Sunil Dutt starer and the movie made under his banner " Yeh Raaste Hain Pyar Ke " in 1963. Then in the year 1973 Gulzar's "Achanak" starring Vinod Khanna.This movie is visually good as the set looks quite of 1950. But technically has lot of flaws. Story I'll not discuss as for some of you who have not watched this movie could be a spoiler.Acting wise Akshay Kumar and Pawan Malhotra are the only saving grace. Rest supporting cast is very commonplace. The courtroom scene an integral part of the movie cannot be taken seriously and the director has taken no pain to make them look interesting. Even Adalat TV show has better courtroom scenes. All said and done music and unnecessary songs were not required ( Imagine 3 or 4 music director's share credit and not even a single good song). Direction is not up to the mark. Cinematography is good. Overall just a one time watch for a Akshay fan...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Story Killed by Ordinary Screenplay, Unnecessary Humor and Waste of Acting Talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rustom brought in a lot of promise from its promo. Unfortunately, the full movie fails on many accounts which give a feeling of a wasted effort. With a gripping story and powerful actors, this movie could have been one of the best movies of the year. However, technical mistakes, unnecessary humor and unbalanced screen time eventually kill the movie. Story (7/10): Based on the 1959 Nanavati vs. The State of Maharashtra case where a naval officer kills his wife's lover but is, surprisingly acquitted by the jury - which brought an end to the jury system in India - the movie had a very solid story, to begin with. Screenplay turns out to be ordinary - a combined mistake of the writer as well as the director for conceptualizing very poor sequences. Some of the pieces just didn't add up to the main story and rather, leaves question marks. Acting (7/10): The movie boasted of powerful actors like Akshay Kumar, Sachin Khedekar, Parmeet Sethi, Pavan Malhotra, Anang Desai and Usha Nadkarni. Akshay Kumar has shouldered this entire movie and given one of his best performances. However, except for Akshay Kumar, for obvious reasons, no one else had been given scenes and the dialogs worthy of their acting talent. The movie misses the bus in terms of utilizing the acting capabilities the star cast had. Illeana D'Cuz is mostly weeping throughout the movie. Esha Gupta's character was very much redundant. Arjan Bajwa does impress to some extent with his expressions and dialog delivery. Direction (5/10): Dharmendra Desai is a very new name to the Indian audience. He does a commendable task with very high attention to detail in a period film. The length of the movie is just right and he did a smart thing by merging the background of Rustom-Cynthia's story with the initial credits, saving some time. The flow of the movie was well maintained. What I also loved was reduced melodrama in some of the intense scenes which gave a very realistic feel to some of the situations. However, the movie fails big time in some of the aspects such as the unnecessary and unbelievable humor in a supposedly serious courtroom drama kills the impact of an otherwise very intense case. Some technical mistakes such as jury timelines (the judge assures the jury that they have all the time in the world to reach a decision and then, in the very next sentence, mentions that the decision will be announced the next day) leave much to ask for.Overall (6/10): Overall, the movie could have been very powerful, if the director hadn't bothered making it a comedy-drama and provided a screenplay worthy of the story and the actors. You may watch for once but it would be more interesting to read through the actual case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underwhelming. Waste of Potential.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sepia tone in the beginning ? Check. Typical Villains and vamps ? Check. Overdressed actors overacting ? Check. Big cars, empty roads and horse races ? Check. Incessant smoking as if it were a fashion statement ? Check. Poor visual effects ? Check. And that sounds exactly like a Bollywood film trying too hard to be a period film. And what about the script? Oh well, nobody seems to have given it a thought.Based on the film's posters, if you thought that the movie was made by Neeraj Pandey (of Baby, Special 26, and A Wednesday fame), you have been fooled. IMDb merely lists his name as miscellaneous crew with the title 'presented by', not sure whatever that means! The film is instead directed by Dharmendra Suresh Desai who is two movies old and Rustom happens to be his first featuring a big star. The story is apparently inspired by the real life 1959 court case of KM Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra which was the last case to be heard as a jury trial, after which, the government abolished the process. The film deals with the events leading up to the eventual acquittal by the jury. A simple reading of the Wikipedia page on the case tells you that the story had enough meat and didn't have to resort to extraneous stories.Akshay Kumar plays the lead character, Commander Rustom Pavri who discovers that his wife Cynthia (Ileana D'Cruz) has been having an affair with Vikram Makhija (Arjan Bajwa, remember the 2008 film Fashion?). He obtains a pistol from the navy and uses it to kill Vikram point blank and then surrenders before the police. Pavan Malhotra plays Vincent Lobo, the cop who digs deep to unearth the multiple layers in the story. The filmmakers chose to complicate the story by bringing in the angle of corruption with the antagonist being involved in it. It somehow rationalizes the protagonist's act. Also, the portrayal of Cynthia seems to have been done keeping in mind the views of the Indian audiences on extra marital affairs and have therefore shown her as a victim and Rustom as someone who had to kill Vikram to avenge the latter's wrongs to the nation.Bollywood is far below the Hollywood benchmark when it comes to making serious defense based or courtroom dramas. Case in point was 'Shaurya' which was a poor remake of 'A few good men' which failed to impress despite casting some of the finest character actors. Rustom is also no exception as it fails to deliver on the promise.Numerous clichés and caricatures spoil the seriousness of the film. The newspaper editor who runs articles in support of Rustom is almost shown as a buffoon. Esha Gupta plays Vikram's brother Preety Makhija in an utterly vamp-like manner, replete with smoking through long cigarette handles, elaborate makeup and garish lipstick. And then we have the classic Bollywood movie judge who goes on hammering 'Order, Order'. Akshay Kumar's primary costume in the film is his pristine white Navy uniform.. It doesn't matter whether he is working aboard a ship, drinking at home, cooling his heels in police custody or his multiple appearances in court; it stays spotless. While appearing unreal, the only purpose is can possibly serve is to help woo women audiences!With a 50 crore budget, it could have surely done better on visual effects. The orange sky behind the ship and the artificial fluttering flag in Akshay's entry scene look utterly unconvincing. Instead of wasting money on shooting a romantic song in a foreign locale, they could have at least made the Indian setting look more convincing. Talking of music, it was mostly forgettable and the film would've done well without songs. The background score is loud in an attempt to build seriousness, but doesn't impress. I would be surprised if someone came out of the movie hall humming any song! Despite its flaws, Akshay Kumar is the sole savior of an otherwise disastrous film. He is convincing as he plays an upright defense officer. Among the others Pawan Malhotra does well as the cop. Ileana D'cruz and Arjan Bajwa are passable. Sachin Kehdekar the annoying lawyer. Manoj Bajypayee was an invisible narrator and rather unimportant. Verdict: Rustom had the potential of being a gritty courtroom drama, public sympathy and relationships gone awry. Instead, we get a sympathetic portrayal of an honest officer amidst a corrupt defense deal and a whole lot of inane caricatures. At best, it can pass boredom on a Sunday afternoon whenever it is aired on television.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up watching Akshay Kumar's movies.What makes me wonder is why don't these arthritis ridden coots make way for new performers? It was horrible act by Akshay-Director duo to mess with the navy uniform with everything going against the code of conduct and decorum. With silly old punch lines like Desh ki Raksha/Ladkiyo ki izzat which means nothing for these actors people are done watching these bunch of lies. I guess Akshay is excessively overrated by his paid social media workers. About story-line I couldn't stop laughing when I found the reason why Rustom killed his friend. It wasn't that his wife was in illicit relations with his friends but because the poor guy was seen talking to some shady looking foreigners.In reality K.M.Nanavati was no saint, he shot his friend because he wasn't ready to accept her and Nanavati never had balls to divorce her himself. Absolutely shoddy movie with innumerable goof ups. catch some soap operas instead like Crime Patrol which portray the truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rustom is packed with good performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rustom, a much awaited film by Tinu Suresh Desai, has received mixed reviews from various corners. The background of this film is based on a naval officer's life - Kawas Manekshaw Nanavati. Previously also, two films Yeh Rishte Hain Pyar ke (1963) and Achanak (1973) were made with the same plot. KM Nanavati, naval officer, was happily married to Sylvia, British by birth and settled with three kids. His keeping away from home for long duration due to work made his wife feel lonely and engage herself in an extramarital love affair with Prem Ahuja. She herself confesses about her affair with Prem. Nanavati ends up killing Prem and surrenders himself. Then starts the legal battle. It is said that this case, which happened in 1959, changed the course of legal operation in India. Nanavati's case was the last one where case was heard by Jury. Nanavati was proved not guilty in the court, although this verdict was later challenged in higher courts. He was even sentenced for life imprisonment, but later on, political connections helped him to come out of jail within 3 years. After getting the release, he went to Canada along with Sylvia and kids. He died in 2003 whereas Sylvia is alive and in Canada. The film Rustom brings a few parts of Nanavati's story on celluloid. It keeps one engaged and glued to the screen. It is Akshay Kumar's another best film. The story covers love, passion, adultery, murder, forgiveness, patriotism etc. The film begins with the actor Manoj Bajpayee's narration. The titular character Rustom is played by Akshay Kumar. Commander Rustom Parvi, a naval officer, is in love with his beautiful wife Cynthia (Ileana D'Cruz). Their meeting, falling in love, and getting married etc. are beautifully conveyed through the song 'Tere Sang Yaara?'. Rustom used to travel due to work. Once, his ship is rescheduled to reach prior to the planned date / schedule. Rustom gets astonished not to find Cynthia at home. He explores and finds out about Cynthia's extramarital affair with his acquaintance and a businessman Vikram Makhija (Arjan Bajwa). Vikram had the image of a playboy too. Rustom confronts Cynthia, but did not give her a chance to explain herself. He then goes in search of Vikarm to his office, later to his residence. Three bullets straight into his heart, Vikram is dead. Rustom goes to the Police Station and surrenders himself. Naval officials wanted his custody but that doesn't happen. Rustom who chose to surrender himself for the murder of Vikram, decided to represent himself in the court for his defense. Public prosecutor Lakshman Khangani (Sachin Khedekar) gave Rustom a tough fight in the court. Preeti Makhija, Vikram's sister (Esha Gupta) wants Rustom to be punished. Legal battle continues unveiling the motive of Rustom behind the murder of Vikram Makhija. It is said that in Nanavati's case, a tabloid 'Blitz' through its opinionated statements were able to create a sympathy wave for Rustom in the minds of common people. In this film, Erach Billimoria (kumud Mishra) heads a tabloid, which largely influenced the course of the case. He was able to influence the thoughts of common man as well as Jury through his articles. Police Commissioner Vincent Lobo keeps his investigation going parallel to the hearings in the court. How did Rustom plan Vikram's murder? How Cynthia handle all these turbulence ? Does Rustom forgive Cynthia ? Was Rustom's motive behind Vikram's murder purely a personal one ? Was Cynthia a victim of a conspiracy ? When Rustom surrendered and admitted his crime, what logics he brought up during the trial in his defense? Was there any layer of patriotism to the whole story? Why were the naval officers keen on taking Rustom under their custody ? How the trial moves further ? Who all were cross examined and what story it could bring out? How does Rustom fights back for proving his not being guilty ? Does it turn out to be Parsi versus Sindhi revenge too? Akshay looks absolutely dashing in Naval Officer's uniform. He has once again proved that he is one of top notch actor in the Bollywood, who could do complete justice to Rustom's character. Illena looks beautiful on screen. Arjan Bajwa as Vikram Makhija is very much convincing in his role. Sachin as the Public Prosecutor is very good. The only character I felt weakly developed is that of Preeti Makhija of Esha Gupta. Jamnabai, the house-help's role by Usha Nadarni is also good. Kumud Mishra as Erach Billimoria brought humour to the plot. Pawan Malhotra as Police Commissioner Vincent Lobo has less screen time, but he is good. Parmeet Sethi is also seen as one of the naval officer. Other cast is also good.Certain scenes are worth watching. When Rustom comes home prior to the scheduled date and his pain on exploring Cynthia's extramarital affair. His confrontation scene with Cynthia. The scene where Rustom agrees to meet Cynthia for the first time in jail, the body language adopted by Rustom generates lots of emotions. Court scenes were dealt lightly. It appeared at times as attempts to make fun of the legal system. This could have been dealt in a better manner. Also, the voice of audience supporting Rustom was justified but their standing with weird placards viz. Marry Me Rustom diluted the scene. Also, I felt that the dynamics of Rustom-Cynthia's relationship before and after tragedy could have been given a little more screen time. Rustom, inspired from the real incidents of KM Nanavati case which ended the Jury system in India, is definitely a very well crafted film. It is packed with good performances, special mention to Akshay's performance, clubbed with good music, suspense, love, betrayal, adultery, murder, forgiveness, patriotism etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining film which required a better treatment from its makers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"RUSTOM" is another movie made on the premise of 1959's famous Nanavati Case others being YEH RASTEY HAIN PYAR KE (1963) and ACHANAK (1973) which was directed by Gulzar. As the makers have taken the case as their base and have made a more or less fictional story out of it so there shouldn't be any comparison between the actual incident and the film. Talking about RUSTOM, it is an entertaining movie with some really funny moments in the second half. Still, the kind of script it was dealing with; you expect something more. "AKSHAY KUMAR" plays his part well and not being biased but, any type of uniform suits him whatsoever. The whole film moves around him and he does full justice to his character otherwise the supporting cast is just about okay and doesn't contribute as much is required from them. Overall, RUSTOM is an entertaining movie but being released as a patriotic movie it turns out to be just another drama on extramarital affair. Many may differ from my views but I personally expected more from it as the trailer for the same was really appealing. I would give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange take, a strange angle to look at from, on a strange case!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not sure what to say, since criticising films based on true events is always tricky, since the film-makers will make the point in their favour that they didn't have the room to work on the story or change it even a bit, fair enough. But my online researches suggest that the film is a bit misleading, as events that happened after the events depicted in the film get no mention in the end, and what happens afterwards actually is of great importance. It's like showing half the story, a bit like if I were to make a film on the famous Johannesburg ODI of 2005 and were to end the film on the innings break, ending it with the crowd clapping for the Australian team for making the first 400 in the history of ODIs, and end the film with the big, broad smiles of the Australian players.So even in a film based on true events, you still can decide which angle to show the film from, and the film-makers decided to take the side which was cringeworthy to say the at least. A better angle would've been to show it as an incident where the jury went all bias in their judgment, and how the public was sold to the propaganda of the media and blinding by the sentiment of patriotism. A pity that they took the other angle, portraying Rustom as that superman who knows what he is doing, glorify "Honour-killing" (of a different kind), and with much pomp show him walk away as if he'd pulled off the most epic heist of the human history.Fact of the matter is, he just got lucky there as the incompetent jury was heavily influenced. The threatening phone made to the Home Minister was not only a proof of Rustom's intentions, but also contradicted Rustom's earlier testimony that he'd only gone to ask Vikram whether he is ready to marry his wife! Yet that phone call is interpreted differently, and to top it all, the cringeworthy weak defence of Rustom to the "towel" point raised by the lawyer, which was a very valid point.*Note: the above should be read carefully. Whereas the towel story is true, the phone call to the Home Minister and all that corruption scandal within the navy seems like a piece of fiction added to spice up the film, which makes the film lose further ground!*Anyway, coming back to my "... events that happened after the events depicted in the film get no mention in the end, and what happens afterwards actually is of great importance" point, the fact is that the case was re-opened, Rustom's guilt was established, he served over three years in the prison, and was pardoned by Vikram's sister, the same cigar-smoking girl who has been portrayed as the younger sister of the devil! The jury's incompetence was recognised to the extent that jury trials in India were abolished after this case.Another thing that I felt to be extremely odd was, the crowd clapped when he walked out of the court with his wife. Surely, if the public did think that Rustom did the right thing or that he was wronged, then why would they clap at his wife too? Add to this the news article that showed how wronged Rustom by publishing that Cynthia had in the past even aborted Vikram's child that she was pregnant with! Either there's something seriously wrong with the film in that aspect, or the public was smoking something, since, as it is, the whole point that made people sympathetic towards him was that he'd been wronged.If it was to be purely a piece of fiction, the film is enjoyable and engaging. Throughout you hope for "that" moment to arrive which would kind of leave a lasting impression, but it takes a rather strange turn. A strange film, a strange happening. I must stay fair here and mention that performances were brilliant from almost everyone, but Akshay was flawless and that man playing the role of the judge deserves a mention, too. I've seen him in many films but it was nice to see him get a role of note. He's a good actor.*Note: for the sake of clarity, I've chosen to use the names of the characters that appear in the film, as opposed to the names of the real characters that it is based upon.*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star tattoos were not the norm on the wrists of Indian woman in 1959. The fire arm might have been an anachronism. The Oxford platforms for women were probably unheard of then.Look hard enough, and find a flaw, you shall.But movies are not about flaws. Movies are all about willing suspension of disbelief. We know Dogs can't talk, and humans no matter how super they are cannot be bullet proof. This does not stop us from enjoying our movies.Rustom is a thorough entertainer and should be considered as such. If you want an accurate depiction of what happened and when, try looking for a documentary.The acting by everyone was superb (Illeana D'cruz being the exception, and, and Esha Gupta - was just a prop that had to make a few faces). While Akshay Kumar was his usual stellar self, the supporting cast here takes the cake.Pavan Malhotra as Det. Lobo, Kumud Mishra as Billimoria, Usha Nadkarna as the maid, Anang Desai as the judge, Brijendra Kala as the police constable all did a spectacular job in the movie.The comic relief in the court scenes was superbly timed and executed. I watched it in a cinema and all through the court scenes the audience were thoroughly entertained.It is definitely worth the time.One of those movies where the supporting cast overshadows the protagonists.PS: Props to the press-photographer who accompanies Billimoria to the court proceedings!</fullReview>

I am not in that camp. although there is a disclaimer, from what I gather the basic plot is stolen form the headlines of the time. the late 50's, 10 or so years after India gained its independence. true or not, this is a very entertaining movie and if you've seen other Bollywood films, you'll have a good time. some in the audience laughed at what must be inside jokes, which went over my head. maybe you should just go enjoy and relax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting plot ruined by lack of strong acting and dialogues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like the writing behind this movie, the twists are timed well. Actually well done. Really liked the heroin's acting (character Cynthia). ****SPOILERS**** But kind of unfortunate that such an interesting story with growing twists and plots within itself got so cheesy and unfolded as a typical Hindi film post intermission. It started slow, but was becoming interesting slowly and right before the intermission the excitement level was increased with the twist in plot as Rustom after his surrender changed his plea to "not guilty". Some of the actors weren't convincing at all, especially the jury members.. they were the deciding factor in this case. No discussion was shown at all except anger and shoutings. (After watching ek ruka hua faisla, it seemed really cheesy). The Judge after the 1st round of seriousness was merely there to act as a comic relief. And all Vikram's sister would do throughout the movie is give an oversmart smirk in every scene. It seemed like overacting. And if they came from such an influential and rich background, and their reach was powerful as they claimed to be, their lawyer would not be a joker that he was shown to be in the movie. One of the dialogues: Rustom saying he didn't want the story to come out in public about naval corruption so public doesn't lose faith? But hello, letting them still continue to use their high ranking positions to make more such decisions is not wrong? What kind of avg mind it takes to believe this? It's why its hard to digest Hindi movies most times, they lose the plot with such filmigiri. And what about the 5cr he took? Whose account was it? Isn't that actually taking bribe to keep matter shut indirectly, LOL! come on man... Indian viewers aren't so pathetic, give us a little credit. There were some other loose ends, like tattoos in the movie set in 1950-60s time in India. But they could be ignored as they don't interfere with the plot. Good movie for those who can ignore such things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start with Akshay's fantastic performance, rest eliana esha and the rest are good performers and on top of all the judge of the court has done a very good job.Rustom is one intelligent, intellectual and interesting movies not made in Bollywood or seen for long time. Rustom is not for audiences who are looking out for stupid rap songs dancing around in bushes or stupid slow motion or overdone action sequences Rustom is intelligent intellectual and very interesting from the very start. It's an intelligent film making thanks to it's director and his cast and crew. Once again akshay Kumar has chosen a subject that shows how well tailored acting skills he has got. And on top of all i would say for my country JAI HIND. And a quote from Rustom . "I WILL WALK FREE TOMORROW ".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two things you need to know. Its doesn't even show a half of the story which actually happened and and its almost a comedy movie with a lot of really good jokes in it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RUSTAM - So m not gonna rate this movie very high due to wrong expectations , and then i m gonna tell you what to expect so that you will really enjoy this movie , because there are actually really good things in the movie , if only your expectations are on the right way. First of all i would like to state my biggest disappointment. The trailer of the movie shows with CAPITAL BOLD LETTERS that - THE CASE WHICH REMOVED THE JURY SYSTEM FROM Indian COURTS. So by that according to my understanding i expect to see how and why JURY SYSTEM has been removed from Indian COURT because of this case . RIGHT ? WRONG. It didn't happen. The final decision in the movie has been declared by the JURY ITSELF. So why they promoted the movie in such a wrong way. I was expecting the truth , and the thing i get is a fictionalized and Bollywoodized version of it. And i have read the whole case in Wikipedia , the movie didn't even showed the half of it. i don't know when exactly BOLLYWOOD is gonna make true stories in a true way. Then my 2nd disappointment. I was expecting some hard hitting court room drama in it . WRONG AGAIN. The proceedings are far from anything which actually happens in court. The whole proceedings were filled with so many jokes that sometimes you would think , is this the way people behave in court. There was very less seriousness in the movie. But let me tell you something in defense of the movie. The jokes were really really good. Some of the best written this year so far. I mean the jokes were making me angry but on the other hand i was not able to stop myself laughing. What i am trying to say is that Rustam is very much a Satirical Comedy , more then its a biopic or a courtroom drama. So that must be the area of your expectation. Thankfully Tinu Desai has done a pretty nice Job in the director's chair as compared to his disastrous work in 1920 London. Akhsay didn't get a challenging role but he suited the role brilliantly. Everybody will surely love him in this. Illiana was there for crying only. But i can surly say Esha Gupta is a one lucky girl in the Industry who is getting more and more roles despite giving horrible performances. Yes there are some serious topics handled in the movie , and also some small twist , but those things are totally side-kicked by the comedy. So , as i said just put your expectations in the right box , and you could find this a really enjoyable film. If only it has not been promoted wrongly , i would have liked it too. 6.4/10 ANuP APu KuMaR</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am disturbed to see how is the level to which bollywood has deteriorated. Such clichéd acting of Akskay Kumar. We see the same repetitious act in all his movies now. He wd randomly pick up several stories and add patriotic lies and chivalry to it, and hey presto! another manure is ready for his fans to gulp down. Wish to see more movies like "A Wednesday". I remember the Nanavati case, it was nowhere close 2 what was depicted in this disoriented movie. The actress ileana has a disfigured body and was covered under tons of cheap make up. Whereas actual wife of K M Nanavati was a beautiful foreigner. And yes Akshay should retire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film started slow,picked up after 15-20 minutes. Songs were decent. First Half was decent .2nd half's only highlight was comic sequences. Anang Desai was at his typical best. Comedy was good until they made a joke out of Jury. They showed a murderer as a hero,as a patriot. They even promoted the film as a story of patriot. Ileana D'Cruz was bad. Esha Gupta over-acted like there was no tomorrow. Esha was loud and disgusting no wonder why nobody casts her anymore. Akshay Kumar was good. Overall 5/10. A Decent watch but yet cringe-full at points. Another overrated Akshay Kumar- Neeraj Pandey film. Another poor display of direction from Tinu Suresh Desai after 1920 London.</fullReview>

But other actors acting is pathetic....Esha Gupta is horrible in this movie...she is wearing page 3 outfits in court room (awful)......Songs are not great......Surely it is a over hyped movie....Direction by Neeraj is very much disappointing...I was having a lot of hopes from him after Special 26 and Baby....Unnecessary hype as if its patriotic movie where as its just a murder mystery...nothing related to patriotism... So I suggest everyone to don't waste your money on this movie....If you have enough time to waste on such faltu movie, then wait for 1 month and watch it for free on your television.

		<fullReview>Director/writer were confused and don't knew what they want to say; so don't even try. Pieces of the movie are loosely coupled and it was in limbo and that too under a false pretext. Since it was an adaptation of a real life story one can at least expect why this case was selected but no. And the funny thing is on one side most of the stars were casted to put the feeling of 90s movie on the other hand Esha, Ileana. The one thing which shows that movie belongs to 90s era was its CGI, seriously i can say it was even better in 80s;com'on grow up. Like other Akshay Kumar Starrers movies focus was not on the story or element X which they wanted to show but on Akshay itself. I wouldn't recommend this to any one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now a days bollywood is getting monotonous.Bollywood movies are getting terribly boring.It has nothing new to offer.Rustom falls in that category.It is based on the real life incident of Naval Officer who kills his wife's boyfriend with three bullets.The story sounds good but the execution is pathetic.Almost 80 percent of the movie takes place in the court hence it becomes a tedious watch for the audiences. The comedy parts should have been avoided. You will feel as you are watching Crime patrol on a big screen.Its strange to see crowds gathering and making this movie a housefull.Apart from the music nothing is good about this movie.The story itself doesn't make any sense.The genre of this movie is thriller but it fails miserably to thrill us. Akshay kumar must read the script first before he starts shooting.As far as acting is concerned all the actors have done done a decent job except Esha Gupta. Overall Rustom is a huge disappointment.If you still want to watch it then God Bless you. Don't forget to take a saridon pill along with you.Thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I don't judge movie based on my expectations but this one was really bad. The only reason I watched this movie was because of Akshay Kumar and I had faith in his movie selections with movies like Baby, Gabbar, Airlift. But this movie disappointed me on so many levels. The worst thing about this movie is it's highly illogical. It's so inaccurate and unreal that it's laughable at some points. The drama felt like a 3rd grade TV serial, it was forced, cheesy, clichéd and unimaginative. The movie was filled with unnecessary jokes letting down a tale of immense complexities and a case which shocked the whole nation. It also made fun of the court procedure with unreal characters.Talking about acting, Akshay's acting is impressive as always. On the other hand Esha Gupta delivers a distasteful performance, Ileana was no better, Arjan Bajwa's role is clichéd to extreme and his acting was worse and overdone.The film is badly written and predictable, screenplay is average, dialogue writing is awful, cinematography is uncreative, lousy use of sound effects, VFX and set design is poor, and on top of inexperienced direction.Summing up, It's a really boring and tedious movie, there was nothing to watch except Akshay's acting. Don't go for it, it's not meant for a sensible mind.</fullReview>

Lots n lots of comedy moments where even kids were seen laughing. Cute and balanced. Simple script, editing and acting are notable. Sort of seen as an eye opener to people in many respects.What is unexpected : Not a thriller or intense movie.What is disappointing : Technically not greatly directed. Lot of flawed moments and thus Rustom lags way behind Drishyam movie. Music is not really memorable. Defending statements were imposed and could only create short term impression.</fullReview>

Now to the performances! &#x202a;#&#x200e;AkshayKumar&#x202c; does a complete U - turn with Rustom. Delivering from the mostly comic / action roles he is recognized for, Akshay truly reinvents himself with &#x202a;#&#x200e;Special26&#x202c;, &#x202a;#&#x200e;Baby&#x202c; &amp; Now Rustom. This is, without doubt, one of the most challenging roles in his career. Not only will Akshay's Fans adore him in this new avatar, even the skeptical types will applaud this superb act. National Award Worthy Performance by him seriously! &#x202a;#&#x200e;IleanaDCruz&#x202c; also gave one of the Best Performance of her Career. She Steals the Show all the Way. &#x202a;#&#x200e;EshaGupta&#x202c; also gave TOP Notch Performance. &#x202a;#&#x200e;ArjanBajwa&#x202c; is First Rate. Excellent Performances by all supporting actors. Watertight Story &amp; Screenplay. Dialogues are Clap Worthy. Production Designing is Classy. Music is already Chartbuster. &#x202a;#&#x200e;TereSangYaara&#x202c; is TOPPING the Worldwide Music Charts. Editing is Sharp &amp; Crispy. Direction is simply Mindblowing. On the whole, Rustom is an intelligently woven, slick and smart period Thriller with its subject matter as its USP. It's sure to get listed as one of the most gripping heist dramas based on real life occurrences. A film that's sure to win accolades, acclaim &amp; awards. Also, Box office Rewards. Strongly Recommended to all of u.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a bit above the boredom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director's approach towards this subject is unbalanced. He prefers to highlight comedy in serious court room drama scenes, which minimize the few good points in argument. Makers underline the place of applause by constantly showing, clapping persons sitting in court room when you wonder, was it worth clapping? It was just like few comedy shows who dictate audience where to laugh by slapping back ground sound of laughter. Even judge takes typical tension building pause to give the verdict!? Director taking style is old too. Showing slow moving ceiling fan as metaphor of tension inside character of scene is stale but this is in abundant here, especially in court room scenes. Yes, court rooms do have such type of fan but rather than avoiding such old metaphor they try to highlight it. This story had its moments but gets ruined due to weird way of inducing comedy in emotional and dramatic scenes too. Girl showing placard of 'Marry me Rustom' even being aware that he loves his wife too much in pre climax!? It all happens when you don't know how to handle the subject. A smart comedy scene of a person selling victim's towel by describing its feature that it remains tied even on dead body is inserted between dramatic court montages, making it ineffective while child vendor selling news paper serves its purpose of humor due to its good placing. Screenplay doesn't offer anything new too. For flirting, gifting necklace and sprain in girl's leg, so person can lift her are too much. Husband wife romance or chemistry is not well established so they look separate even after wife shedding tears. Navy officers send some persons to search a document but that persons were more interested of throwing paper rather than looking into it, foolish way of highlighting drama. All this finished its real look even great work done by production designer Priya Suhas, to give a real feel. Film is slow in first half and has its good witty court room scenes in second but unnecessarily comedy takes over. When you know that what has happened then long scenes to show that fact is very boring. Background score is notably loud, repetitive and irritating. Performance wise Akshay Kumar is very good. Ileana D'cruz is good in emotional scenes. Kumud Mishra as news paper owner Billimoria is perfect. His Parsi accent, way of walking and expressions are fantastic. Pawan Malhotra as investigating inspector and Sachin Khedekar as lawyer are fine. Arjan Bajwa as Vikram Makhija and Esha Gupta as Preeti Makhija are just OK.</fullReview>

Besides Kumud Mishra has also fit the role. In Airlift he had shown his flair for sincere acting and every movie he makes his presence felt. But on top it is Akshay who steals the show.

		<fullReview>Despite its multiple flaws, Rustom can be watched for Akshay Kumar, whose action/comic brilliance often overshadows his acting prowess. He reminds you to value the honest officers who serve our country with dignity and valour. He makes you want to support the man who probably did the right thing the wrong way. Akshay proved yet again he can play range of diverse roles with brilliance. Rustom was based on real life story of K.M Nanavati who killed her wife's lover and was one of the most sensational court cases in India. Rustom has its flaws, but was overshadowed by Akshay's performance. With good soundtrack and brilliant acting, Rustom is one of the best movies of Akshay Kumar. I go with 3.5/5 for 'Rustom'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"This just cannot be a film directed by Neeraj Pandey." It was the first thought that came into my mind after I took him mistaken for Rustom's director while the fact is he isn't the director of this film but the producer.Being a huge fan of Neeraj Pandey for A Wednesday!, Baby, and his upcoming biopic M. S. Dhoni: The Untold Story (I'm already more than positive by just watching its trailer), I knew it was just not possible that Neeraj would direct anything as lackluster as Rustom.Guess what? I was right!Written by Vipul K Rawal and directed by Tinu Suresh Desai, Rustom is a courtroom drama, which is inspired from 1959's famous K. M. Nanavati vs. the State of Maharashtra case.The story begins with a Naval Commander Rustom Pavri (Akshay Kumar) who finds his wife Cynthia Pavri (Ileana D'Cruz) having an affair with a businessman Vikram Makhija (Arjan Bajwa).Emotionally shattered Rustom then goes to Vikram's place and fires three shots in his chest. Vikram dies on the spot while Rustom surrenders to Mumbai Police. Later in the court, Rustom pleads not guilty. Why does he do that is what the film is all about.The first half of the film is dull, boring, and somewhat predictable. The second half, however, is comparatively better. Actors, especially Usha Nadkarni (as Jamnabai) did a great job. Overall, Rustom lacks action, suspense, thriller, and good direction.I wouldn't have recommended it even if Neeraj had directed it.</fullReview>

Camera work is of high class? Perfect casting of all characters and all landed their support to move story to next frame smoothly?Songs are accurately placed and the lyrics of the songs by Manoj Muntashir (Extremely talented among new batch of Lyricist) very nicely pend.Background score is of the standard of Movie "Baby"?I was happy to hear perfect blending of background score with pace of the movie and Dialogue.I felt movie could have been more intense and supporting characters could have been used with more punch lines (One Liners) ?. But when you give it a thought, the makers were right in making this movie less Intense and showcasing not 100% true facts ? In India you cannot play much with true stories which had caste and community angles to it.We normal watch 3 Bollywood Superstar's movie without giving a second thought on the content of their movie's?With reference to above line, I would definitely recommend to watch Rustom (It has appropriate content, Pace of the movie is Amazing, Background score is brilliant, Good songs and Absolutely perfect acting by all characters)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A court room murder mystery- it does not disappoint.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rustom based on K M Nanavati case, a Naval commander who shot his wife's lover and surrendered to the police. This case got an exceptional media coverage and became a sensation back in 1959.The writing is good; the screenplay unfolds the layers of the mysteries successively, it keeps the audience guessing the plot however, some of the twists are predictable. There are also some elements which are unbelievable like 5 Crore transferring to Rustom's account and defense minister directly offering the money.The cinematography is good. First half is little slow, however it gains momentum in second half and never escapes the audiences' comprehension. It gives us a perspective about the court room when the verdicts were established via jury.The art direction is worthy and we can certainly reckon that because the producer is Neeraj Pandey and we had already seen it in Special 26, the late 60's era is created wonderfully.Akshay Kumar as Rustom Pavri did an impressive work, he carries the persona of a naval officer with panache. His expressive mannerisms of calmness and solemnity, carts the entire film. Kumud Mishra is amazing and brings some natural comic relief. Illeana D'Cruz could have done it better as her character was pivotal but we mostly saw her sobbing. Sachin Khedekar and Anang Desia are veterans and can do any role flawlessly. Esha Gupta and Arjan Bajwa were fine. Usha Nadkarni leaves a stamp in one of the hilarious hearing ever in any court.Music and background score is average, some of the songs are good.Largely, it is Akshay Kumar whose movie choices maybe erratic but lately he chose some authentic subjects and filled it with great endeavor and diligence, to name a few Special 26, Baby, Airlift etc.Overall 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Akshay Kumar saves the drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akshay Kumar is back with his much awaited movie Rustom. The story is very much an adaption of much talked about and historic Nanavati Case. Two movie had already been made in the past on the famous case. Although in the opening itself it says it's a work of fiction but it is very much inspired by the case. Rustom (Akshay Kumar) after returning from 6 months of his duty from INS Mysore returns early to surprise his wife Cynthia (Ileana D'Cruz) finds that she is having an affair with his millionaire friend Vikram played by (Arjan Bajwa). Rustom overheated anger towards Vikram knows no bounds and he is killed. Rustom then surrenders, he decides to fight his own case and he is clever in his act. Set in Bombay (Mumbai) there was a jury system in which jury by unanimous decision held a person guilty. Rustom has a long way to go. He gets help from a Newspaper publisher and also his patriotic image helps in creating a heroic image among the people. On the other side sister of Vikram, Preeti played by Esha Gupta makes every attempt to held Rustom Guilty. The movie is very much identical from the renowned original case. There are events which one can directly link as it happens to be identical to the original case. Although one part of the story is factual, it's over the edge drama keeps it as a thriller. The first half of the movie is based on the dramatic crime taking place and characters adding up the value, its second half is based on the court drama which keeps everyone on the edge of the seats. Having said everything, the heroic Naval Officer played by Akshay Kumar keeps everyone amazed by his performance. All the characters are well written and have played their respective role very well. There are even comic dialogues and characters such as the Maid and the Newspaper publisher which provides some sort of laughter by their fantastic comic timing. The movie looks promising when you are watching as it takes you back to the Bombay era. Music of the movie goes very much hand in hand with the situations. Tere Sang Yaara is the song which already is the chartbuster among the songs helps in creating the magic. the movie. Director have tried to recreate the magic of previous movies of Akshay Kumar like Baby, Special 26 and Holiday but somehow fails to recreate the magic because of bad screenplay and direction. Akshay Kumar continues to entertain his patriotic role once again with Rustom.Rustom is still worth watching because of the characters and the court drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth watching. Highly recommended for intellectual people.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie is well executed. An intelligent as well as intellectual movie. Respect for Navy and Nationalism. Shows beautifully the love of a couple in all thick &amp; thins. Akshay Kumar gets into the character so well that you can connect well with him playing his role forgetting the outer work. Illeana and Esha are gorgeous, have done justice to their roles. Good work by all the actors. Director has elegantly connected all the dots and right scenes at the right time has been shown. There are multiple scenes of light moments, where people would laugh. I would rate it 10/10.If you appreciate Akshay Kumar's work in Holiday, Gabbar, Special 26 etc... This movie is a must watch! Money well spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for Akshay's Acting &amp; Illeana''s looks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rustom is a court room drama the kind which are seen or made very less lately in bollywood.Akshay is very convincing as a Naval officer who had his heartbroken and Illeana looks absolutely stunning as his lovely wife which even you wanna marry.The film stays on point and do not lose it''s focus till the very end.The tracks tere sang yaara and tay hai are very soothing and I recommend adding them into your play lists. The jokes don'the end neither the drama and in the end you feel nothing but empathy for the Actor.Mumbai in the late 60's as shown in the film feels like a paradise and is portrayed beautifully,vintage cars, colorful bungalows makes you to fall in love with the era.Watch it for Akshay's acting and for the director who has given us a classic like A Wednesday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One more masterpiece by Akshay Kumar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story is set back to 1959, an Indian Navy Commander is accused of murdering his wife's lover. Whole story revolves around this murder case, role of newspaper, public, court jury and police is in main focus after the man Rustom himself. Rustom Pavri is one hell of character, patriot, killer or what? What's Good:*Akshay Kumar back in uniform, we all love him. *Movie keeps interest alive till the very end, never lets you get bore. *Storyline is gripping, very well written. *Good performance by stars.What's Not:*Music not up to the mark. In fact it's below average for a Bollywood movie. *Some flaws which makes this movie to rank below Drishyam. *Direction could have been a little better.Our Ratings: Story: &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 10/10 Music: &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606; 5/10 Direction, editing and screenplay: &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2606; 9/10 Star Performances: &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 10/10 Overall: &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2606; 9/10 Final Verdict: Must watch movie!!

		<shortDescription>Failed in Few things but won it in few thing, overall a Decent Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RUSTOM REVIEW :- Akshay had 2 releases in this year and i watched both films on First Day. Airlift was a Good Film, still disappointed a bit, Housefull 3 was a good entertainer and now he came with Rustom which is carrying higher buzz than previous 2 films. Expectations were little high due Akshay's some quotes about Film but sadly film did not match those high expectations. Failed as a Thriller, failed emotionally but entertained as a Court Drama. Few things just didn't work, looked funny and few things succeeded to entertain. It totally looks a Fictional writing so i don't know why makers showcased it as an Inspired story from True incidents? Let's have an individual review of every field of movie.Acting - Very Good ! Akshay Kumar totally nailed it, he completely looked a Navy Officer, carried intensity throughout the film. His Best Performance of the year. Illeana looks gorgeous due to high make up, acted well in emotional scenes. Sachin Khedekar gets place in memories as a lawyer. Esha looked arrogant and beautiful rich girl as per her character was written. Supporting star cast succeeded to make you laugh with their punches.Music - Good ! Tere Sang comes at the beginning, and it works like a Magic, the best song of the film as audio and video as well. Other songs just didn't work, forgettable.Screenplay - Average ! Strictly Average First half but Interval appears on a twist note which we've already seen in trailer. Better second half but bit stretched, film could have easily been trimmed 10 minutes more.Writing - Average ! It was supposed to be an inspired story from a Real incidents but on screen it looked completely fictional. Some scenes irritates, for e.g A Navy Officer is Being a lawyer, collecting documents like a Spy. There was a big scope to write a better story than this.Direction - Strictly Average ! Direction is like a Half Baked cake, simply you can't digest it. He tried to add all the elements such as Thrill, Patriotic feel, Husband-Wife Emotions, Sympathy, Crime, Court Drama etc. Which looks like a mixture which is messed. Director spoiled the script which was weak already, still i feel a better film could have been made.Final Words - My final verdict to the film is Above Average to Good ! Film neither impresses you much nor disappoint. Commercially this film does not deserve 100cr club but it could manage it due to holidays in weekdays, i feel same for Airlift and film did it. In a Clash Factor i feel Rustom will beat Mohenjadaro critically and commercially both. Overall this one looks another success for Akki this year, but this time despite clash. A honest try by team which could be watched once. I'm going with 6/10 stars as i feel this film didn't match my high expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fairly Decent Crime Drama That Will Be Forgotten. &#x2666; Grade C-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vipul Rawal gave us the excellent sports drama (Iqbal) in the last decade, and this time around tries his luck by fictionalising a sensational incident into a crime drama. However, the cardboard representation his director provides causes the film to look appealing without a strong foundation.Rustom Pavri (Kumar) is a highly decorated and patriotic Indian Naval officer who returns home from an assignment one day only to learn that his pretty wife Cynthia (D'cruz) has been going out with an acquaintance, automobile mogul and playboy Vikram (Bajwa). Already stressed with the unethical goings-on in the Navy, Rustom plans a plan to kill Vikram, on the grounds of something more than just the good old adultery. The story is basically a courtroom drama which begins gathering moss only in the second half when Rustom decides to play both the victim and the advocate.Rustom is the protagonist here, much like Devgn's character in Drishyam. I compare these two films mainly because of the problem I had with them: they challenge the code of self-righteousness. While in the 2015 film, Devgn's character tries to cover up a murder his wife and daughter committed, here Rustom tries to cover up his own crime just because he wants to hit two birds with a single stone. 30 minutes into the film, Rustom surrenders at the nearest police station and confesses about his crime.Deviating from the primary problem, Rustom mainly relies on the effervescent glamour of the post-Independence era (60s) and strives too hard not make any anachronistic mistakes. While the effort is lauded, it does come out as cardboard at times. The plot is too basic, and becomes predictable after a while, giving out thoughts that one has seen these cinematic elements before. So, is the whole recipe a mixture of popular crime and mystery stories? You can say that, but it does have the backing of a real-life story that I am told shocked the nation.Kumar is compellingly fabulous with his role as a Naval officer. He keeps his cool throughout the film and reminds us how good an actor he is after just having marvelously played the role of a homosexual in Dishoom (2016). D'cruz is gorgeous in her air, but is mostly seen sobbing or staring deadpan at her co-stars. Gupta and Bajwa both do a fine job among other cast members. Overall, appropriate casting helps the film.BOTTOM LINE: Tinu Desai's Rustom may not be a shocking and novel tale, but it's at least not boring considering that it's a rehash of all those crime mysteries we have seen in Bollywood. Wait for DVD and then rent it.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not met the expectations!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rustom is the typical Indian drama film with cliché story line and emotional songs. The first half of the movie is very boring and the tone that the film sets makes even the second half of the movie look pale. The comedy in the court room seems unnecessary and gives the film the feel of watching Adalat TV show and not Akshay Kumar starer. Akshay Kumar as Rustom Pavri has done a brilliant job and lives up to his expectations. Kumud Mishra actually brings the much necessary momentum in the movie with Ilena as Rustom's wife is poor in the emotional scenes and they seem artificial from the start. Vincent the investigating officer played by Pawan Malhotra is convincing and he does justice to his role. Overall Rustom does not meet the expectations set out in the trailer and fades away as yet another murder drama. I would go with 5 out of 10 as Akshay has given a great performance yet again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Akshay is the real captain of this movie...forget rest of others......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Akshay Kumar and after Baby and Airlift, my expectation is much higher than any time. I always judge a movie with very strict way and full of proved way. I am not a fanboy or a biased critic. I just try to ensure the right review for the people who want to know about the movie and the actual review. Anyways, this is a movie about the true event of a naval officer and the incident took place in 1959. The story's central character is Rustom Pavri and he committed a murder. And the rest of the story is how Rustom sustain by proving his innocence.Rustom obviously a crime thriller but I think the script doesn't have any mystery or thrill element and the story completely fail to create the suspense. The second half of the movie is full of court drama but the director missed the opportunity to create high tension for the courtroom. Otherwise, this is a good movie and the screenplay and character development is well made. All of the cast has done a good job and the captain of this movie is undoubtedly Akshay. This is a 100% Akshay Kumar film and he carried the entire film on his shoulder. Without Akshay, the movie may be turned into a garbage film but Akshay saves the project. After Airlift and Dumb movie Housefull 3, Rustom may be another profitable venture for Akshay. Recommended for everyone.</fullReview>
