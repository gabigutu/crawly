		<shortDescription>A morbid psychosexual thriller that flirts with both silliness and cinematic greatness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After skimming through some of these reviews, I'm not sure what people were expecting from Knock Knock. It plays out like a cross between No Good Deed and The Loved Ones. The story isn't original of course but this is Eli Roth's take on a home invasion thriller and it's refreshingly sadistic. Two strangers knock on Keanu Reeves' door, he invites them in, their sociopathic tendencies start to peek through, and things escalate from there. The acting is largely impressive. Keanu comes across as silly at times but, for the most part, he fits the part of the innocent dad and he bounces off the chemistry of the two female leads very well.Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas really make this movie what it is. They have palpable charisma, and they provide Reeves excellent scenarios to react to. The dialogue could sound outlandish and childish if read in a different context, but Izzo and de Armas pull it all off with a straight face and their character's intentions progress to the downright sinister. It's actually interesting subject matter, and Roth does have something to say with this film, and I believe he accomplishes it elegantly with as little blood as possible.Knock Knock is not perfect - it goes on for a few minutes too long and sometimes Reeves reads lines as if he'd just shot up heroin, but it's intriguing and truly captivating once it gets going and becomes a psychological horror house in its finest moments. Callously covering up a dead body with papier-mâché? That's chilling. Being buried alive? Macabre. It's nice to see Roth hasn't lost his touch, and the humor is definitely there intentional or not. I highly recommend this movie to fans of home invasion thrillers. Just don't go in expecting a polished masterpiece; Knock Knock is depraved, raw and filthy in the best ways possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Knock knock most ridiculous movie of 2015</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Such a pathetic movie. Watched the movie 'knock knock' because of Keanu Reeves and am so disappointed with the story line and there is nothing thrilling about the movie. What really irritated was Keanu Reeves was like a helpless moron who just couldn't do anything against two teenage girls who go to his home and take him for a ride throughout the movie. Keanu had chances to kick back but instead gets hit by a fork by a teenage girl and gets tied up and that's so ridiculous and finally when you expect some twist you will find that both the girls will bury the so called matrix hero called Keanu Reeves in his own backyard unto his neck and there ends the movie all of sudden...such a waste of money and two hours of precious time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want a revenge sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Eli Roth immediately after Hostel 1. I knew this man can deal with human nature. I follow his work since then. This feature shows a man taken at his soft spot when he was not expecting any trouble. Sometimes people give in to temptations of much lesser magnitude. He made a wrong decision, he got what was coming. But the ending! Imagine he is an idiot and cannot explain his wife that he was attacked and framed. Imagine his wife is an idiot, did not believe him, took the kids and divorced him. That would be the suggested ending, won't it. What seems to be a moral story leaves an unfinished business. I want to see the architect taking cold revenge. Track down the ladies, think a little, and turn their lives into a living hell. They'd played their game and had had their fun on account of the architect and other people; now they have it coming. Give us the revenge sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After spending a Saturday night watching a film I've been looking forward to see since I first saw the trailer, honestly I feel robbed of an hour and a half I'll never get back. This movie was nothing but a let down. To call this film a horror is like calling Spongebob Squarepants and Thomas the tank engine both horror programs.You cannot tell the difference between normal Keanu Reeves and tied up petrified Keanu Reeves, it all sounded the same. Whenever he shouted it reminded me of the best cry ever/worst cry ever video in YouTube.Overall this movie was a huge let down, very good idea for a film but a horrific execution. Save yourself a tenner and buy yourself a Chinese instead of a ticket!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Neo...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are already ...261 (!) reviews for this B (or maybe C?) movie that came out only 2 months ago and that means something, i think.First of all this is a remake of the movie "Death Game (1977)" starring Sondra Locke and Colleen Camp. The 2 women are serving as producers in the 2015 version while Colleen Camp also stars in a minor role.This is Camp-y movie (pun intended!) with a lot of torture horror and a couple (mild in my opinion) erotic scenes. The 2 main actresses Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas look crazy enough but Keanu Reeves's performance leave a lot to be desired. Maybe we have used to see him as a hero (from the Matrix to John Wick) and we cannot accept to watch him being lame and weak.There is obviously a moral here, but the question "who could resist" is also strongly present.As a movie it's OK and you might have some fun watching it, but if you can't stand movies where the "hero" does all the wrong moves maybe you should avoid it. The direction of photography is bright and that's a plus, but if you are a careful viewer you will find a lot of goofs including numerous continuity errors which could ruin some of the fun.In the end you might want for the movie to last a couple of minutes more to see the outcome or even the true motives of what just happened...Overall: Not as bad as most of the other 261 reviews might want you to believe. (Some of them compare Keanu Reeves's recent choices to those of Nicolas Cage, so they might be driven by some hate). See it if you want a light campy thriller for the evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first review of a movie I've ever written and I wouldn't usually do this, but felt the need to advise people to steer clear of this movie. It was truly one of the worst movies that I've ever seen in my life. I had high hopes for the movie before seeing it, especially since I'm a fan of Keanu Reeves in many of his other movies. However I found the movie to be utterly bizarre and ridiculous and struggled to sit through the whole movie and resist the urge to leave. The acting was really over the top at times and so painful to watch. The plot did have potential and could have been so much better but unfortunately it did not work at all in this movie. Many of the scenes are extremely creepy and perverted, and not what I would expect to see in any movie. I found parts of this movie very difficult to understand and follow, so that I eventually lost interest completely. The ending was one of the biggest disappointments and left me with feelings of relief that it was finally over and feeling like I'd just wasted the last 90 minutes of my life. Avoid this movie at all costs!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curiosity kept me watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the warnings from negative reviews and low IMDb rating i watched it anyway... I've always liked Eli Roth mainly for his near show stealing appearance as 'The Bear Jew' in Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds and his movies, though never groundbreaking for me, offered playful b-movie fun. His efforts here seemed to diminish after the initial creation of suspense. Once we move to the second act the script loses any credibility and little is left for creation of further suspense. It's almost as if the idea was to get Keanu to behave somewhat like Nicholas Cage in OMG mode. That idea i couldn't shake and ironically it became what kept me entertained, imagining cage instead of reeves, which wasn't too hard as Keanu seemed to channel the spirit of the rage cage as if he were possessed by him. Don't let my mention of cage fool you, the acting in this movie is sub par, if Keanu isn't The Wicker Man he's the wooden man and the girls act like female villains in a made for TV batman movie. In summary; I found a few things Keanu said in a serious monologue quite laugh out loud funny and the use of a popular pixies track at the end credits reminded me of a student movie using cool music to be cool. All it did was remind me of it's already iconic use in one of my favorite movies. The movie was just bad enough to enjoy it's shitness or i'd have not sat through it. Avoid this if you get offended by crap movies but I'm almost recommending you to watch this for the points I mentioned for your own curiosity. The movie stuck in my mind enough for m to waste time writing this review, i wonder if that was Roth's intention for the audience or he actually took this movie seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh my freaking God this is so terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a rare poster here at IMDb. Good movies? They get enough praise without me joining in the chorus. Average films? There's usually enough people on each side to adequately debate the pros and cons. But a film this ridiculously bad has, if nothing else, crossed whichever threshold is required to motivate me to reset my long forgotten IMDb login details and hopefully save some poor souls the 90 odd minutes of their lives, and (god forbid) their hard earned on a ticket.It's so hard to know where to begin, so, as a wiser person than me once suggested, I will begin at the beginning. The acting, from the get go, is so wooden, unbelievable and shallow that not only did I not feel any connection to the characters, they were actually making me angry! Keanu is has always been pretty one dimensional, but he takes it to a new level with his performance here. In this role as a supposedly doting father, it felt like he has never spent more than five minutes around any kid. The wife was equally unconvincing and the kids were so bad they wouldn't get a role on a home-brand cola commercial. I did however quite like the Boston Terrier playing the role of the family pet, 'Monkey', and I feel like he did his best to carry this stinker, but with limited screen time there was only so much he could do. Enter the 2 mysterious young women...who continue what has become the well established, by now 20 minute old tradition of corny, unconvincing Knock Knock performances.The direction is lousy. I'm no film buff, but I watch enough of them. When I saw Eli Roth was the director in the opening credits, I said to my wife 'I think he has done some cool stuff'. Half way through this stinker I looked him up, and realised that, no...no he hasn't done anything even remotely decent in his entire career. A bit of shock horror in Hostel, a tenuous claim to fame at best, and then nothing. And his lack of talent is glaringly obvious here. I think I had confused him with a hybrid of Tim Roth and possibly Elijah Wood? I dunno...but Eli Roth shall forever more be the huge red flag he rightly is. The story...let's call it a "story" for the sake of this review anyway. There's so much that could be said, so I'll simply say that it sucked in ways that few things have ever sucked before. It pioneers new ways to suck that modern scientific research in sucking are yet to even discover. And the final cherry on this s#!t cake, was, after breaking my spirit and will to live, to break my heart to. Using the Pixies classic Where is My Mind as the closing track. Which the Pixies must have authorise...which defies comprehension. They made great money off their last tours, and allowed it to be used to close that all time classic Fight Club. And so ends my review of this diabolically bad film. If I save one person the price of a ticket, or an hour an a half of their precious existence, it'll have all been worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Further Proof That Eli Roth is Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holy sh*t do I hate Eli Roth movies. Ever since Hostel and Cabin Fever I've found his films to border on the unwatchable, and yet I watched this one (and fully plan to watch Green Inferno), knowing that I wasn't likely to enjoy them. Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment, or maybe I just like spreading the Eli Roth is not very good gospel to anyone who will listen. So, what about this one?It's not good, at all.We start the movie having Keanu Reeve's being a "family man" shoved into our faces for an unbearably long time as we take a tour of his house, which is plastered with photos of the family, evidence of children and family is practically wallpaper in this house, and then we see Keanu and his wife have an attempt to have sex interrupted by this extremely loving children who have prepared a cake for father's day, and they all spend a solid 15 minutes of the movie talking about FATHER'S DAY, and LOVING DADDY, AND HOORAY FOR DAD ETC ETC, until you feel like you just might throw up. They also introduce us to the family dog (who somehow makes it to the end) and to a VERY IMPORTANT WORK OF ART THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT (which is smashed with hammers, obviously). So, with that extremely subtle set up, Keanu is left home alone when his family goes on a trip without him (for some reason), and the movie actually starts.This has to be one of Roth's more gutless films, we've grown accustomed to his brutal gore and violence, but this one is surprisingly void of that. Instead, we have one death that is minor and Keanu even makes it all the way to the end, and the girls get no comeuppance either. After having a weird Keanu Reeves threesome, the girls reveal that they are 15 years old and Keanu is now a pedophile, which seems like it might be the bold line that this movie takes, sort of a Hard Candy type story, but even that turns out to be untrue when (spoiler alert) the girls admit to being in their 20s.The acting is awful, the story is garbage, and it's really hard to get yourself invested in the movie at any point. Even when you think the girls are as young as they claim to be, you find yourself wondering how the hell they were able to subdue a full grown Keanu Reeves more than three f**king times in the movie. In the end, because who cares, they post a video of one of the girls having sex with Keanu (while he is tied to a bed and protesting), as proof that Keanu is a horrible monster, on Facebook (because?Facebook), and of course people start responding in horror and disgust. The girls leave him buried up to his neck in the back yard and run along scott free, while Keanu frees a hand (somehow) and accidentally likes the sex video instead of deleting it. Is? is that a joke Eli Roth? Because it's not funny.Hands down, this is one of the most offensively bad movies that I've seen in a long time, and you're much better off to skip it. Check out John Wick instead, that movie is f**king awesome. Look forward to seeing your next one Roth, I'm sure it'll be a masterpiece.www.barleydoeshorror.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underlying Meaning???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this film by renting it from a Redbox. The rental is only $1.50 and honestly the amount is so little I usually do not care if I rent a bad movie but, I really feel like I actually wasted my money on this film. At first this film seemed good from the trailers, it seemed like a good twist on a thriller and it really piqued my interest. So when I saw it on Redbox I was excited because I haven't seen a good thriller in a long time. So when I got home and popped it in my player after the first ten minutes I knew this film was going to go downhill and had no end in sight. Keanu Reeves usually plays as a strong, smart, and capable character in his movies; not a wimpy, stupid, and really a down right moron. This fact alone disappoints me because I am a Reeve fan and a little part of that admiration just went away. The film started well, with him sidestepping their advances and being seeing the girls as young and stupid, but in the bathroom scene apparently all of that goes out the window just because they're naked. Wow. As the film progresses it seems to become a slight against men, by portraying them to be these idiotic, misogynistic, and sex on the brain oafs that will do anything as long as there is a piece of "meat" hanging in front of them. This becomes overly clear when the character, "Genesis" has the line, "You all are the same" and "They never say no." I understand that this is a film but to create something so bigoted and dogmatic and think that it is acceptable; it really begins to bring to light the morals and philosophies of the writers and producers. I know that this will probably make some folks mad or angry but flip the situation around. If it had been a woman on the bed getting raped by a man, I'd put money on the fact that this movie wouldn't have made it beyond the notepad of the first writer. We as a society tend to have double standards that usually benefit one party or another, and I completely understand why this happens and why it is bad. But to campaign against this problem and to become a more accepting society, movies like this are not helping whatsoever. I am not trying to suggest censoring literature and media, but to have a film that is so one-sided is very detrimental to furthering our society to become rational and fair. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this film. It will only make the viewer angry and frustrated. I feel this film will only please one particular group of people, the more radical feminist groups. More liberal feminists will probably be angered by the movie because it really puts a bad name on the movement, by making it seem that this is what feminism hopes to prove. The intention of my review is not one of contention and hostility but to give my opinion and hopefully shine some light on the reasoning behind it. I just ask that before you go and fire away a comment or a reply to this review, to try and see it from a different my perspective, a 22 year old man that is still trying to understand how the world works. Thank you. P.S. I use the word "feminism" and "feminist," not as a derogatory remark or slight, but just as a descriptor of a noble movement or person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really excited to watch this film as the trailer had me hooked, but I clearly was hoodwinked. The storyline sucked me right in and knowing Keanu was in it made me think I was in for a treat.Worse mistake ever....The acting was stiff like an iron board and the moral of the story was....well to be honest I don't even know as it was totally confusing.****SPOILER ALERT****A hole was dug and it was deep, clearly it must've taken ages to get it that deep yet the male actor sat in the chair and only decided to try and get help once the girls had finished digging. What a load of rubbish. Sorry, but I clearly think whomever wrote this rubbish lacked in emotional intelligence. Either that or I've been living under a rock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't expect serious performances as this film is over the top!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently seen the thriller movie Knock Knock and here is my review on the film. There will be some minor spoilers throughout this review.The film is about a seemingly happily married couple Evan and Karen living with their two children, Karen is an artist and Evan is an architect. When Karen goes away for a weekend vacation with the children so that Evan can stay at home alone to work on a project, he is interrupted one evening by a knock at the door. Evan is greeted by two young women who introduce themselves as Genesis and Bel and after being in a rain storm need some help in order to contact a friend so that they can get an address to attend a party. Before long the conversation turns sexual and instead of Genesis and Bel taking the taxi waiting for them outside they seduce Evan and have sex. It is not until the morning that Evan realises he has made a mistake and when he sees the ladies are not respecting his home he gives them little choice but to leave his home promptly. Genesis and Bel are not prepared to take the treatment from Evan lightly they turn into the femme fatales from hell when they return to his house with vengeance in mind.I think for the majority of the film it was very straight forward and i don't think the film was supposed to be taken too seriously for the most part besides one or two controversial aspects which are revealed towards the end of the movie. It was still fun to watch at times and Genesis and Bel do shine in some fun and sometimes exaggerated scenes in the film when they are either violent or when they explain their behaviour. There was also one scene which was not supposed to be comedic although made me laugh when Evan completely lost his temper with the ladies and tried to turn the tables on them knowing full well he was partially to blame for the ongoing situation.In the final scenes the fate of Evan, Genesis and Bel is revealed and i thought it was an interesting one, it could have gone down the typical road of similar type films although the director chose to include a modern theme.I would give this film 7 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first time I've ever decided to write a review about a movie but I really have to express how I wasted one hour and thirty nine minutes of my life. How am I going to get it back? This movie sucked from minute one till the end. Please do not waste your time and even watch this trailer. I really can't wrap my head around the fact that Keanu Reeves actually signed to do this garbage, I am extremely disappointed, even Keanu acting was horrible. I wish i could have given this movie 0/10.I have to submit a minimum of 10 lines so i will constantly just tell you to not watch this garbage. My night is ruined, my eyes are hurting, my ears are done, my everything is just messed up because of this rubbish. Keanu, Keanu, my man...what was that? Worst. Beyond Ridiculous</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's honestly no point in seeing this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start this off I want to let everyone know this is my first review, so please bear with me and I'll do my best to bring you a good review.I was excited for this movie for two reasons. One because of Keanu Reeves, I mean who wouldn't be excited to see him after thoroughly enjoying John Wick and I wanted to see if he could keep climbing back up to the popularity he used to have. The second reason was that the trailer looked quite interesting when I saw it, really made me want to see it.The problem is it's another one of those movies that we've seen before where the only interesting parts of the movie have already been shown to you in the trailer. The story just seems to have no substance and the characters are just not fleshed out at all, not to mention there really is no Horror or Thrills as the genre listing would show. I admit there's mystery, but not in a good way.**********SPOILER WARNING**********This whole story is bonkers, the girls that show up at Evan's (Keanu's character) door end up seducing him after his repeated attempts to stave them off and a whole series of weird stuff happens. They overstay their welcome and claim they're underage so that Evan won't call the police, which is completely dropped 4 minutes later when he actually does call the police and one of the girls hangs up his phone and just asks for a ride home. After Evan is back home, he hears a noise and decides to check what it was, always a good idea, right? They knock him out of course and start having some sick fun with him like recording him having sex with one of the girls while she's dressed in his daughter's clothes. Then after an escape attempt Evan's incapacitated by a fork stab to the shoulder, oh yeah he had surgery on his shoulder, the opening of the movie makes sure you know that. They then tie him up in a chair and play a gameshow they called "Who wants to be a pedophile?" furthering the supposed belief that they are underage, so I just gotta kinda roll with it here even though they don't look anything like they're underage.The acting by Keanu through the whole rest of the movie is pretty bad, like when he gets an answer wrong during the gameshow he gets a loud high pitched squeal played in his ears via headphones, which I don't know why he didn't just shake his head and make them fall off but oh well. He says "stop stop stop, my ears my ears, I'll go deaf I'll go deaf" in the most unbelievable way possible, doesn't sound like he's in any pain whatsoever. The rest is actually pretty boring, Luis (guy coming to pick up a sculpture that Evan's wife made for exhibit) dies after tripping and hitting his head; the girls Papier-mâché and dispose of his body; the girls tell Evan they're going to kill him at dawn and proceed to tear up and vandalize the house; Evan tries to knock a ceramic egg off a shelf that contains a gun but the girls accidentally knock it off and find the gun first and Evan is given one more chance to escape. He grabs a knife and runs outside only to trip and fall and be captured again by the girls. Alright, the ending. After this whole debacle of a movie, the girls start to bury Evan with his head sticking out of the dirt, and just as one of the girls is about to smash his head with a stone, she smashes it beside him and starts laughing about how he thought they were actually going to kill him. At this point we hear about how they do this kind of thing a lot and how no one ever refuses them, these sick people spy on loving families and tear their lives apart on a regular basis. We also learn that they weren't actually underage therefore and tension that was built up when it was threatened that he would go to jail were completely fabricated. They then upload his sex video to his facebook and leave him there in the ground. This is where the funny part is, people start commenting about how sick it is that he posted that and he pulls his arm out of the dirt to try to press delete (crazy because the 'delete' and 'like' buttons are right next to each other) and he accidentally clicks like, to which he then lets out an angry yell. Then his family gets home and sees the mess, the son says "dad had a party." and the movie ends. That's it, cut to black, the end.I've probably bored you with this review, but now you know how I felt during the viewing of this movie. 1 Star for this, especially after listening to Eli Roth's interview because he made it seem like he thought the movie was good but you'd have to be delusional to think that. Well guys, thanks for reading my first review, hopefully I get better from here, and don't see this movie if you want to have a good time. It's not even a "so bad it's funny" watch, trust me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it was just hilarious.. I mean whats not to enjoy by watching this movie? Yep the acting is not great but who cares. Its a movie and it for sure is entertaining .. have a sense of humor for franks sake.. I thought that the story was great and they built it up to a point where the audience can for sure relate to at some level. Not bad for Ole K. reeves.. I would probably not buy it or watch it numerous times but I figure its worth a second watch on some lazy afternoon with nothing left to do but chill and watch a movie that at least is funny. I just love the horror on K reeves face as he is going through this ordeal. Believe it or not I can relate to some extent. Good movie if you ask me. Trust me there are a lot of movies out there right now that are complete garbage. And this is not one of them..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>intelligent competent architect overpowered and outwitted by two loony girls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie is unrealistic in these ways. Keanu's victim character actually called 911 and reported a break in. One of the girls quickly hung up the phone before he could say more. In such an instance it is police policy to visit... they would have been there within minutes, taking a report and names of everyone. Game over right there.Size and strength advantage was overwhelmingly in Evan's favor. Even when he realized the seriousness of the situation, he was overpowered by just one of the two girls in a fight, not a tag team attack (even then, in real life they'd lose every time).With his life clearly in grave danger, and within grappling distance, Evan makes no move for the girl pointing a gun at him. For one, I watched closely and her fingers were BEHIND the trigger. Not to mention it's a Beretta 92fs with a very slow heavy double action first trigger, also to his advantage. It's his gun, he'd know both of these things. Further considering the efforts to hide it from his kids in the sculpture/vase, it's very likely the SAFETY WAS ON. I rewound and it appeared to be on but somewhat dark and blurry. Either way with your life on the line you lunge, especially with an obvious total gun novice that is stupidly too close with her fingers BEHIND the trigger. All of this was unbelievable.Digging that hole would have taken those little girls hours (they likely would have been exhausted and totally spent, unable to chase Evan down later when he made a break for it). Further, the girls would have been too deep in the hole working and distracted, and that ridiculous cord tie up job could have been quickly worked loose with any adrenaline fueled effort while they were toiling away. He could have gotten his gun and game over.The comedic 'liking' the horrible Facebook post by accident and the kid making the line about daddy having a party took away from the serious thriller aspects that the director tried but failed to achieve throughout the movie. Still, bad call, counterproductive decision.Not realistic enough to be terrifying, more like a bad unintended dark comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Save the movie theatres from movies like Knock Knock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eli Roth is back! Eli Roth is back! Eli Roth is back with a movie that might just be worse than all the other dreadful crap he made. If he thought that the status and talent of Keanu Reeves was going to save a script that can have only been written by a ten-year-old, well, maybe he should stop thinking altogether. Knock Knock, a cheap copy of Funny Games, Fatal Attraction, and god knows what else,, is a sexual but not sexy thriller that tells the story of Bel and Genesis, two "Femme fatales" that wreck not just the home of a married Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) but also his life. First and foremost, Genesis and Bel are far from being femme fatales. A femme fatale has a certain look. A femme fatale uses and hypnotizes a man and with it has the ability to get him to do anything she wants him to do. A femme fatale is a woman a man would do just about anything for. A femme fatale is a woman whose sex appeal is so deadly that just looking at her will make anyone, even the viewer, drool. I don't see any of that in Knock Knock. Yes, they are "attractive" in their own way, and being all wet from rain certainly adds to that, as most guys would say, but that is where it all ends. I do however have to admit that the first act that focuses on the seduction was pretty believable. The girls sure know how to seduce a man. But even that ends as the story progresses (or not so much). The performances by Lorenza Izzo ( Misses Roth) and Ana de Armas made me want to knit my eyelids close. It was forced, amateur, risible. Maybe they should take some more acting classes. Keanu Reeves is the only reason this movie is not going to get the same rating all his other trash movies got. But even this does not have a happy ending. While Keanu Reeves is an actor with class and talent, Knock Knock should have not been on his "to do list." I felt so bad for him for having had to memorize such awful, on the nose dialogue. If he hadn't been Keanu Reeves the great actor and had been a newcomer instead, Knock Knock would have closed the career doors for him. I guess the lack of good acting in Knock Knock takes us back to the directing. Eli Roth compares himself to the great ones like Hitchcock, Polanski, Tarantino. Eli Roth claims that he is still growing as a director, and developing his style / taste. There is no such thing as "growing as a director." You either have the skill, or you don't have it. If you make ten crappy movies (like Hostel and everything else he made) , please don't try to come back twenty years later with a copy movie and claim that you can still convince people of your "hallucinated directing skills." Here comes the worst part: As the IMDb states, Knock Knock was written by three writers: Eli Roth, Nicolas Lopez, and Guillermo Amoedo. It looks like Roth works with these writers on all of his movies. But what surprises me is that none of the movies they wrote together ever received superb reviews / ratings. They can't write. The stories are predictable. The dialogues are boring and on the nose. They fill their stories with clichés and cheap jokes. So, this is it. Knock Knock. A movie that should have not been made. It would have spared many people's eyes from seeing such trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>waste of time...Keanu Reeves we didn't expect this from you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keanu Reeves , I am huge fan of Him, but he disappointed me and all his fans by signing this senseless script. All team of this movie are sick ..you guys need some serious treatment.No message, no story, no suspense, no climax..only irritating madness of two stupid girls are shown in this movie.There should be a penalty charged to director and script writer of this movie. Keanu Reeves..what has happened to you...U gave us Point Break..and now you doing this ???Such a pathetic movie. Watched the movie 'knock knock' because of Keanu Reeves and am so disappointed with the story and there is nothing thrilling about the movie. What really irritated was Keanu Reeves was like a helpless moron who just couldn't do anything against two teenage girls who go to his home and take him for a ride throughout the movie. Keanu had chances to kick back but instead gets hit by a fork by a teenage girl and gets tied up and that's so ridiculous and finally when you expect some twist you will find that both the girls will bury the so called matrix hero called Keanu Reeves in his own backyard unto his neck and there ends the movie all of sudden...such a waste of money and two hours of precious time.Keanu Reeves ..next time please sign a better script.Do Not spoil your name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrifically Bad. Pathetic. Offensively Bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pathetic. Highly Disappointing. Offensively Bad. I read the poor reviews, but there was nothing of interest at the Redbox. I usually like Keanu in his action movies, so I thought, how bad could it be??? Don't follow the white rabbit!I am yet another person who usually does not take the time to write a review, but if I can save only one person from wasting an hour and a half of their life, then it was worth it. Knock Knock is absolute filth &amp; swill from the beginning. Keanu, as everyone knows, is a horrible actor. Why was The Matrix so good? Because he wasn't acting. It was an action flick. He ran around and did cool things. Come on guys - even Arnold can make a great action flick. Just don't let them talk. In this movie his acting was wooden, one-dimensional, and shallow. But thank God he was surrounded by seriously poor talent with no hope of providing any entertainment value whatsoever!!! Anyway, it was painful to watch from the beginning when he was with his family. As someone pointed out, he sounded exactly the same whether he was playing with his family, or being tortured by the two girls. The first act seemed rushed and forced, but I thought maybe once we got to the main plot, things will get interesting. Not!It turned into one of those movies, you know the kind, where the victim keeps making stupid, utterly ludicrous mistakes. He is never able to defend himself, nor turn the tables on his captors. Defeated by a fork in the chest? Are you kidding me? Running away with a knife and tripping over something and, oops - there goes my knife! Yep - time to be tied up once again by two bimbos with a combined IQ lower than a guppy. Eventually I lost interest completely. A part of me was rooting for the girls because he was just too stupid &amp; inept. I mean are we really supposed to root for a complete moron??? At some point I figured it would turn into a revenge movie. Now I really like revenge movies, I mean who doesn't. So I kept waiting and waiting, and what was my reward? One of the worst endings of a movie ever!Arghhhhhhhh! Seriously? Did you guys just forget to finish this stupid movie???So what we have here is a bad, forced, poorly done beginning. A pathetic Act II. Then cap it off with one of the worst endings ever. And you guys are giving it a 4.9??? Apparently 21% liked it on another website. I find it hard to believe that it was more than single digits. You know, if you really need a Keanu fix, just pop in The Matrix, and sit back and enjoy a far better movie, and don't waste your time here.In hindsight, instead of watching this stinking pile of rubbish, I should have taken the blue pill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Knock Knock, Who's There? Crappy Movie. Crappy Movie Who?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the less than stellar box office return of Hostel Part II, Eli Roth blamed the internet and swore off making films for a long time. In fact, he hasn't directed another movie since then. He's produced, starred in and wrote a few, but never touched the camera again, except for the sniper film that plays in Inglorious Basterds and the Thanksgiving segment from Grindhouse. Almost ten years later and we have not one, but two feature films from Roth. The Green Inferno, which was actually completed in 2013, but held up until now, and the erotic horror thriller Knock Knock, which is a remake of 1977 film Death Game.Did Roth coming back from "retirement" encourage me to see the film? Was it the deranged sexual element that would draw me in? No, it was Keanu Reeves my friend. Everything else didn't matter to me, I wanted to see Keanu Reeves in movies again. He did a kick ass job in John Wick, now I was going to see if he would be able to play a helpless cheat who is terrified for his life. A role that is really against type for him. Can Reeves pull it off? The man has been labeled emotionless in a lot of his film roles, so this would seem like it would require him to dig down and actually act. Now, he does manage to scream, freak out and indeed, act terrified at times, but there is always and I mean always, something off about his performances. Maybe it's his monotone voice or the deadness behind his eyes, but it doesn't always come off well. Don't get me wrong, I highly enjoy a lot of his work, but a great thespian the man is not. It looks like the man is trying here, I'm not too sure if he pulls it off too well.Reeves plays Evan, an architect who has to stay at home for the long weekend and work, while his wife and two kids go to the beach house. One stormy night, he hears a knock at his door, two young beautiful women are stranded and need his help. While inside, they manage to seduce him, despite his constant resistance. The next morning he finds out that they won't leave, not without playing a game with him being an unwilling participant.So the premise alone seems like a typical invasion torture horror flick, with the added element of sex and the intruders being young hot women. Once that is out of the way, the film offers nothing new or insightful. Roth, a man who knows a thing or two about the genre, tries to amp of the suspense a bit, but falls into the same generic traps all these films do. Knock Knock isn't sexy enough, nor terrifying enough. I guess it must just feel weird to direct your wife in a naked threesome with Keanu Reeves. The question people will be asking themselves is, will Reeves live or die by the end of the film. I won't spoil how it ends, but the build up to that final situation is decent enough to make the film almost watchable. The denouement is completely wrong though and adds an unneeded comedic joke that is literally the very end of the film. You go through this long torturous journey with Reeves, only to have it end with a one liner? Really odd choice that left me scratching my head with disappointment. I wanted some kind of answer to what would happen next, but never got it. Roth leaves a little hint here or there, but I guess I wanted something a little more concrete. What the film does accomplish is me, never opening my door to anyone. Not even two young, beautiful, wet women who beg me to let them inside so they can have sex with me. That's just for my dreams.</fullReview>

Don't know how Keanu Reeves accepted this movie and acted in it. Acting was bad. His performance was so terrible. I was laughing. During hide and seek game also Keanu Reeves doesn't think to kill them but tries to run away. Even that guy Louis jump for the medicine but doesn't get idea to beat those girls and take it. No neighbors in that area. What a waste story! Never thought Keanu Reeves will act in this kind of movie. Seriously it is waste of our time and money. I suggest you stay the miles away from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst film I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Worst film I've seen, disappointing script, photography and cast. I used to love Keanu but u can tell him and the movie are very poorly directed, the script is the worst thing, nothing of what happens is justified, nothing makes sense and stereotypes of the lovely family are always used. I'm a filmmaking student and although I love Keanu reeves and I think of the stuff Eli Roth has done isn't that bad, I highly recommend you not to see this movie, instead watch something worth your time. The girls aren't bad but their acting is not as good, some of the stuff they do seems premeditated and poorly executed, the camera movements are simple, they didn't give that much thought into them. The traveling that marks the beginning keeps coming back many times, couldn't think of a more original way to introduce the perfect family eh? The last line is the worst thing, the kids could use more coaching but the thing is, the entire story is poorly written and executed, so if you ask me, the problem doesn't start with the cast, it's the started since the preproduction, the script like I've mentioned, is poorly written so whoever authorized the money for this movie is the one to blame, they clearly haven't seen actual good movies before. My advise is, don't see this film, don't waste your time,go watch something worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The short summary line was "A pair of femme fatales wreak havoc on the life of a happily married man."The film was literally just that... The guy who is very reluctant winds up having sex with 2 girls and they then pretty much torture him... That is all that happens, like... Literally there are no developments or advancements to the story or any twists, it really did disappoint me.Keanu Reeves' acting is so unnatural that it is actually laughable, like... He just doesn't seem natural at all.If you want a decent home invasion film, watch You're Next... It gives you the action and an alright story... This however, was just a huge disappointment.I'm giving it a 3 based solely on production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a movie. A psychothriller at its best, by the meaning of the word. Keano Reeves plays a loving father and good husband. He has a nice job and a great home.Everything is turned upside down as two young women knock at his door while the rest of the family is away, seduce him and then pretend that he is a pedophile. As they keep torturing him and destroy more and more of his house and life, it becomes clear that they are deranged, evil psychos.Nothing that you haven't seen before. The surprise in this movie (and probably the reason why so many people hate it) is the message. The movie gives you the impression that it suggests that Keanu Reeves really was a pedophile, terrible father etc. and that he deserved whatever he got. This is furthermore confirmed by the two psycho-girls getting away with everything they done and the attempt to turn the ending scene into something silly and funny.This is just wrong. And this kept me from giving the movie more stars. But if you can ignore the questionable morale views of "Knock Knock" and focus on the story, you will find yourself well entertained. The performance of the young women was great. Sick and twisted beyond good and evil. Keanu Reeves was decent for most parts, but he got a bit too whiney towards the end.Anyway, the amount of tension was enjoyable. You couldn't stop wondering what would happen next and you had a hard time dealing with it too. Some of the scenes were almost disturbing. But in a good way. An interesting flick and recommended for anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers.</fullReview>

I picked the movie because I watched "Exposed," which was good and the same main actors are in, but this movie just puts their good acting to shame. I was generally annoyed at the girls in the movie and sadly the only good part was shorter than 2 minutes. I watched this on Popcorn Time but I would've walked out if i paid. If you want to waste your time, if you want to be annoyed, if you want to be bored or if you just want to watch a terrible movie--my friend-- this is the movie.

Everyone including Keanu does the best they can but the mind boggles on why they even tried - it's as if they were the ones under siege having to act in inappropriate circumstances. Avoid, then come back to it in 30 years but I'm not sure that will improve it enough, a strange combination of terrible dialogue, plot and budget - Keanu ca do so much better so it does beg the question - what favour did he owe in order to do this movie, it must have been a big one. It may have approved with age, but I doubt it.</fullReview>

I have not seen a movie soooo bad in quite a while. Sometimes, if it doesn't grab me within the first 1/2 hr., I will just turn it off. For some ungodly reason I continued to watch this entire movie. Coming from Eli Roth (loved Hostel I &amp; II, Cabin Fever, Grindhouse) I expected more from this movie, especially since IMDb listed it under "Crime, Horror, Thriller". What???!!! The only crime about this movie is watching it!! There was absolutely no horror nor thriller to speak of. Keanu Reeves was completely emotionless even when yelling and trying to be tough. (Not sure if this is considered a spoiler - As far as the girls go, what was with the damn giggling throughout the entire movie - compelety annoying) The acted like they were 10 years old if that. Believe me, if you come upon this and other reviews such as the same, save your 90 min and do anything else!</fullReview>

Because that was by far the worst movie I have ever experienced.Keanu Reaves acted horribly - which was unusual (he probably hated the script as much as everybody else), the girls in the movie were over the top and the story had potential but threw it down the toilet.What the movie is basically saying that these sadistic girls get to ruin a man's life, and kill one of his buddies at that, and leave unscathed. This movie leaves you angry, empty and unsatisfied. There was no revenge scene in the movie for Keanu, the ending was garbage and the overall movie experience was you getting kicked in the groin repeatedly.Spoilers - it sucked</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Keanu Reeves, revived as John Wick. No wait that's a different movie. But a movie that helped him come back to the sights of different filmmakers and producers no doubt. And maybe something that helped either this movie or him starring in it. There are worse ways and roles a man has to play than being seduced like he is in this movie.But everything comes with a price. And though it is established that he had some issues with being faithful at the beginning, what he has to go through can not be described as learning experience. But how can this all end? I wouldn't say it's too surprising (the alternate ending would have been, though I don't think it would have fitted the mood of the movie), quite the opposite. Whether you like that or not, is up to you as viewer. Also if you want to pass moral judgement on any of the characters involved in this ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A promising opening descends into a gratuitous, stupid mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Architect Evan (Keanu Reeves) lives in a nice, swanky house with his wife Karen (Ignacia Allamand) and their two young boys. One weekend, Karen takes the boys away with her, leaving Evan on his own. He gets a surprise one night when two young women, Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bell (Ana de Armas) knock on his door, claiming to have broken down and in need of a shower and a taxi. Initially pleasant, after luring Evan into a night of soaring passion, they then refuse to leave and subject him to a relentless, psychopathic barrage of violence and humiliation.Playing like a variation on The Human Centipede set-up (and, by the end, astonishingly much more horrible than that film), despite not having much opening development between the main character and his loved ones, Knock Knock does manage to generate an interesting premise for the beginning. As soon as the girls arrive, knowing that things are going to take a sinister turn, it's intriguing to see just how this will play out and why. But after that, it just goes to pot and ends up leaving a really nasty taste in the mouth.With elements of Phone Booth and Hard Candy chucked in to the plot, this skirts around the issue of young girls looking older than they are, and suckering older guys into going with them, an issue that's been playing in the media lately. But rather than using this as a plot device for some deep thought, it just degenerates into a relentlessly gratuitous and nasty piece of work, like a long winded, less grounded version of the superior British flick Cherry Tree Lane. Izzo and de Amis are a pair of seriously deranged, psychotic devil women, who just serve to distract from Reeves, who is as wooden as ever.By the end, it's just started to become annoying and stupid, with only the theme from the end of Fight Club playing over the end credits to remind you of something better. You think of those two girls up the north of England who battered that woman to death in her house, and when you're expected to be entertained by something as dispiriting as this, it puts things in perspective. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler! - Keanu Reeves digs himself into a hole and can't get out. No, not the character who also ended up in a hole but the so-called "actor" and if I was him I'd have paid them not to release this and buried the film instead. This could be the worst film I've ever watched - bad storyline, bad directing, bad acting but....on the upside, from a production point of view, it must have been cheap to make so wouldn't have cost Keanu much at all..... I've watched a couple of not very impressive KR's films recently - John Wick, 47 Ronin and I think, after this one, I'm wondering more and more whether he's grasping at straws and, instead, perhaps needs to step back and examine a) what he decides to do a bit more closely and b) when he does decide to take part in a movie, tries a bit harder....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie compelled me to sign up for an IMDb account just to hopefully save a fellow human from watching this heinous film. A friend recommended we watch this movie but now we realize we want to punch him square in the mouth for wasting 99 minutes of our lives. This movie makes Keanu's performance in the matrix look like an Oscar winning performance. If it wasn't for the constant f bombs and hilarious sex rants, we would have turned it off. If you have at least an average intelligence level, you'll find his movie utterly ridiculous. Too bad IMDb ratings bottom out at 1 star! Even Tyler would think this is effin retarded. Half a bottle of captain Morgan's couldn't save this movie.</fullReview>

This movie climbed easily to my top 5 worst movies ever, and I have a very "hard to beat" top 5 list. There were moments while watching the movie that I felt awkward, like I was doing something wrong. I never felt this way before. Keanu Reeves should play in movies like matrix that you don't need to actually act, just fighting and staying without any expression for the whole movie. Don't try acting man, you just can't. This movie is a "never ever watch" movie. The scenario its like someone got drunk and wrote it in 5 minutes and then another one more drunk than the other, thought to make a movie about it..

		<shortDescription>Strong start, but falls flat in a hurry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film draws you in. It does a great job of building anticipation and you really start to feel for Keanu's character. He is a very likable guy and the antagonists are genuinely disturbing early on. Everything is set up so well for a classic B horror movie. Unfortunately, I wouldn't hold it to even that standard. Everything goes to crap after the first act. As another reviewer stated, Keanu's performance after the introduction is pretty reminiscent of Nicolas Cage in 'Wicker Man'. He's not entirely terrible, but the script doomed him from the start. The weird factor of the villains essentially went from good to just plain stupid. Lots of awful, awful clichés also pop their heads out in this film. There's nothing subtle about them either. Lots of events and stupid decisions are very lazily thrown in so that the writer could force certain things to happen. Even the way these things happen is ridiculous. One scene in particular made me cringe and almost turn it off halfway through. Terrible, terrible writing, even for a horror movie. I shouldn't have to say it like that, though. Just because it's horror, doesn't mean you don't have to put some original thought into your work. If you enjoyed the theme of the film, but want something a little better, check out 'Hard Candy' with Ellen Page. Still a bit weird, but certainly superior to 'Knock Knock'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keanu Reeves in something different...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Knock Knock" is a Thriller movie in which we watch a man staying alone in his house for a weekend because his family went to spend the weekend to the beach. At this time two strange and beautiful young women knock on his door for help.When I watched the trailer of this movie my expectations were not so high but I wanted to watch something more interesting than this. The interpretation of Keanu Reeves who played as Evan in this movie was not the best and I believe he did not reach his true potential. That happened of course not only because of the plot of the movie but also because of the cast of it. The direction of the movie which made by Eli Roth was not something extraordinary because there is not something more to show.Finally I have to admit that I expected something better from this movie and of course from Keanu Reeves. "Knock Knock" is not so bad if you low your expectations before watch it and not after, you just have to be better prepared when you will or if you go to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly expected a lot more from this movie. I normally do like movies with Keanu Reeves but this one is for sure not one of his better ones. He acts okay and tries to save the movie but it was just not enough. The other two main actresses Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas drag the movie down. I thought they were annoying, and not only because of their characters. The story itself is quite boring and leaves you with unanswered questions and that I do not like. It's also categorized as a horror movie and I absolutely don't get why. You could maybe call it a thriller, even though you won't be thrilling a lot, but certainly not a horror movie. Knock Knock is just a disappointing movie if you ask me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I understand that some newer actors (like the two female villains) need to get their start in B rated movies, but Roth and Reeves should know better than to create a piece of garbage such as this. KR wasn't the most complex of actors, but he did have a decent resume. To see him stoop to being the buffoon that gets outwitted constantly throughout this movie is pathetic. On top of that, hearing him begging to these halfwit girls for long lengths of time makes one consider suicide by drinking paint. When I see a bad movie, I usually appreciate the fact that I got it out of the way and at least I know that it's a bad movie. Not so much in this case, it's an overwhelming and frustrating waste of time. Move on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie made my brain sore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't even want to review this movie. I told myself that after the green inferno, I was done review Eli Roth movies. I personally just wanted to watch this movie and not have to worry about anything because there's nothing Eli Roth can do to make me feel terrible like I did with hostel. I fact it doesn't even matter if I review because no one looks at my reviews. Well, I was wrong. This is a painful movie to watch, and it's worse than anything Eli Roth has beaten into existence. Oh boy was this movie terrible. The entire movie is basically summed up like this... Keanu Reeves is a family man. Seems like a nice guy. Doesn't have anything to worry about because he has a family. Then one day, family goes away on vacation, or something? Then girls hot show up on door step, and Keanu f**ks them. Then the girls turn out to be crazy and they torture him in the least Eli Roth way possible. I swear, they spent all their money on Keanu Reeves who gives off a hilarious performance, and probably the worst I've seen from him. Eli Roth was lacking his famous gore. Their was no gore in this movie what so ever. Maybe a squirt of ketchup on Keanu Reeves arm, but aside that, there is no dismembered body parts anywhere. It didn't feel like Eli Roth at all, or maybe the gore in Eli Roth movies is the only thing I recognize him for by this point. That's the only good thing about his movies is that the violence is well executed. This movie was poorly done on every level. The main focus is that bad things happen to Keanu the whole time and nothing else. They try making Keanu out to be the character your suppose to care about, but at the same time you're not suppose to care about him because they play him off as some kind of villain for cheating on his wife. Eli Roth, there is so much more you can do with all the resources you have, and you wasted it on this miserable pile. There is a scene where Keanu Reeves friend is trying to buy some art from him, I guess, and when he sees that the art is vandalized, he freaks out like he's just seen a man murdered. Then he freaks out and the girls take his inhaler, and throw it around like monkey in the middle. Then he just falls over, hits his head on the art, and dies. WHAT!?!? "Quality film making. 10/10 genius." I couldn't take it seriously, because of how bad it was. Another scene that comes to mind is when the girls are vandalizing Keanu Reeves house. It was a pain scene to watch and the music choice made my ears bleed. Believe it or not, Eli Roth hasn't made me mad from one of his movies. I was more disappointed and bored with the hostel, and both cabin fever and the green inferno didn't surprise me at all because I knew what I was walking into, but this is the first Eli Roth movie that I straight up hate with a passion. 1/10. Not being nice for the sake of being nice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beginning of movie suckers you in. You believe Evan (since he's Keanu Reeves for Goodness Sake!!) Is going to turn out to be the upstanding 'good-guy'but you learn quickly he's not. The rest of the movie he continues to scream about how he is indeed a 'good-guy' but by this time you've already seen him be a really horrible husband, father and male role-model. For the life of me I can't understand how these two young chicks were able to tie him up in bed... then untie him and tie him back to a chair and then untie him again and again until he ends up in a hole tied with a hose in his backyard. Especially since he's had more than one chance to escape: once while playing 'hide N Seek' if you can believe that. Yes he gets captured only to be facing down the barrel of his own loaded gun that was HIDDEN. The dude just has to be the worst escape artist in history... I know DOGS that can escape locked cages faster than this guy could get out of a wet paper bag. Quickly you no longer have any feelings for the guy you just want the movie over because you have this issue of 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure' and how it's the same ACTOR!!! You can't UN-SEE this movie. It's best to just rent Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure or you'll lose most of your respect for Keanu Reeves. Oh by the way if you're into role-playing during your sexual romps this movie will KILL most of the fun in that too. The real shame of it is no matter how many bad reviews this movie gets, there's always going to be some sap out there with nothing better to do on a Friday night but ruin his pleasant memories of a once great actor named Keanu Reeves!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My honest review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. The only reason why I watched this was because it is an Eli Roth movie and I thought Hostel was decent. But seriously, the premise of this movie is just terrible. And the only reason why Lorenza Izzo has any type of career going is because she is married to Eli Roth. Apart from looking physically attractive, she serves absolutely no purpose in film. So our protagonist (Keanu Reeves, who while I like him in some movies is a god awful actor) decides to keep these two girls in the house for this long for what reason? Because he wants to have sex that badly with them even though he is happily married? The only lesson learned that one can come away from this movie is for guys to think with their brains instead of their you know what, otherwise it will lead you down a bad road. But a 100 minute movie did not need to be made in order to tell that to the audience. Extremely slow, not really all that entertaining, and terrible acting on everyone's part. Eli Roth's movies have declined fast since Hostel. I am just extremely disappointed in him. I know, duh, he's obviously made so much money and I should just shut up, but this movie is pure garbage. The last thing I will say is that I cannot believe for the life of me why Eli Roth is remaking Cabin Fever (2016), which by the way WAS HIS OWN MOVIE! So this guy is so brilliant in the industry that he is recycling his OWN IDEA! Just pathetic! #endofrant</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unwatchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My standard review disclaimer: I never talk about plot in a review enough others do. Rather I discuss a movie's merit or in this case lack thereof. I bought this as a PPV at 8:15 on a Thursday morning, and I'm writing this 1 minute after I've finished watching, at 3:16 p.m. It literally took me 7 hours to get through this pig without being distracted by, say, trimming my eyebrows. Questions: 1. Why, after 30 years has Reeves not perfected his craft? 2. Why has he not made more movies that were "accidentally" good. The Lake House had charm. Speed had tension, and The Matrix had, well, everyone else that was IN The Matrix. John Wick was stylistically cool but when I quipped to my friend that I was going to "look for a good Keanu Reeves movie to watch tonight", his defense of John Wick over and over was that "...it's a Keanu movie!" I realized what he was telling me: he understood my joke of finding a good Reeves movie but even if I'd been serious, such an endeavor would be futile. This movie starts out bad, the scenes with his family have you drowning in sappy syrup. It gets a bit interesting when we are anticipating the antagonist's role and plan for Keanu's character "Evan". Then, although the young actresses don't perform poorly, the joke is on us as the movie falls off the edge of the planet. I mean, wow this was bad. Reeves over acts when subtlety is called for, under-acts when he should be pushing a plot device..... it'd be like a writer misspelling every other word or an orator placing emphasis on the wrong syllables every sentence. It's my fault. I made my bed and I laid in it. I should have just gotten up sooner.</fullReview>

Without the slightest doubt "Knock Knock" falls in the third category.Hands down, I barely made it through the first 10 minutes. Heavily loaded with cliché and abysmal acting. Plain torture. And no, it wouldn't get any better, but worse and worse! Those 40 minutes I watched of this piece of incredibly awful directing and acting, felt like 4 hours the least - almost like eternity.It is really thaaat baaaaad... It's shocking! Honestly speaking, I cannot imagine anyone who actually made it through the whole thing. Maybe if you are a complete masochist, but otherwise there is absolutely no chance. Try it yourself. And find out.There is absolutely no doubt in my mind, that Knock Knock is one of the worst movies ever made. And a 5.0 rating (by the time of writing) can only be a bad joke...

I suppose it could have been meaner, a little more violent, perhaps more eroticism, but overall It was a satisfying movie experience. It definitely had me and my guy friends talking about what we would do in Keanu's situation, and any movie that generates hilarious hypotheticals in conversations is already doing something right. I don't know--I think horror fans are probably more demanding than those of other genres, so maybe I don't expect enough.

How bad is this film? Well any movie that makes the god-awful Mortecai look like a Hitchcockian masterpiece has to be considered pretty awful by anyones standards.Normally a really bad film can be considered so bad its good as they will normally have at least one redeeming quality, in the case of Knock Knock however there simply is none.Eli Roth is the man in the directors chair here and personally I've always found him to be over-rated and his movies have always left a bad taste in my mouth. As bad as his previous movies have been however nothing can prepare you for how atrocious Knock Knock is. A laughable script is delivered in the worst possible way by KEanu Reeves who here plumbs new depths of his own unique one dimensional acting 'ability'. In fact it would appear that he is deliberately attempting to outdo his usual brand of awfulness here by channelling his inner Nicolas Cage.I could go on but the plot is rubbish, the direction appalling and the acting about as bad as it can get.I only wish I was able to give this film the zero score that it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first movie review I have ever bothered to write. I am doing so purely because this creation is so bad it's criminal; I would implore anybody reading this review not to waste 90 minutes of your life watching this abomination. That is time you will never get back, time that could be put to better use watching infomercials - they would have a stronger plot and more engaging characters.Speaking of plots, it was so weak it had me lurching between two polar states of either uncontrollable ridicule or seething rage. The flaws were endless, so plentiful in fact that I felt compelled to keep watching to make absolutely sure that the utter nonsense unfolding before my burning retina was not going get any better. Needless to say, it didn't.All that said, the plot was by far and away not the most offensive aspect of the whole sorry episode, oh no. The acting I was witnessing had me blinking in disbelief; it is no exaggeration to say that I've seen more convincing, skillful performances by naive children in nativity plays. Keanu was at his dismal worst, fighting to inject some believability into the situation; however his efforts were completely and utterly nullified by a duo of the worst 'actresses' ever to offend my eyes. With utter disdain I gritted my teeth through their hackneyed delivery of horrendous 'performances'. It occurred to me at one point that they were actually getting paid for this assault on the acting profession and a little bit of vomit involuntarily entered my mouth. Both of them managed to compete constantly for the dubious honour of the 'World's Most Clichéd Acting Style'. Both managed to deliver entirely unconvincing performances that should be instantly forgotten but unfortunately are now etched into my brain in slow motion like a harrowing train wreck. I'm convinced they watched the 10 cheesiest thriller/suspense movies of all time and set out to beat them all for a lack of originality, believability and depth of character.Having said all of that, I am literally baffled as to why Keanu agreed to do this movie.In short I have three recommendations for this attempt at a movie. I like to call them the 3 A's....Avoid.Avoid.Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eli Roth goes from bad to worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I thought "The Green Inferno (2013)" was bad. Eli Roth, going from bad to worse, reunites with the same actress (Lorenza Izzo, now his wife in real life) and most of the same crew in what gives the term "horror movie" more than one meaning.Basically, it's the same plot as Michael Haneke's "Funny Games", but done completely wrong here. The script is awful and the movie is boring beyond belief - it just goes on and on and like the character in the film, you just wish for this torture to be over. The entire plot can be summed up in one sentence and couldn't hold even a short, let alone a 100 minutes film.If all that wasn't enough, the movie has one of the worst endings I've ever seen.Sitting through this film is almost impossible and I'm still trying to figure out what on Earth made Keanu Reeves participate in this abomination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't have time to write reviews, but this one deserved some lines. Basically what this movie want to say is that if you abused during childhood, it's perfectly fine to spy on someone else life, even if he has nothing to do with your life, destroy his/(her????) life, torture, kill and simply walk out the door looking for next victim just because you are a female!Script has many problems, including:1. No beginning2. No ending 3. A good man? good father? and then what? 4. Just call 911 from a land line, hang up and see what happens 5. You have 30 seconds to hide, a 43 years old man cannot hide! can't ever run! or go outside. 6. A man made a mistake, what's your problem with his wife's art?This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I wish I could give it a zero star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this film. And I liked Generation Um, which also received very low ratings. See, everyone has a different perception.There are age groups and gender groups and people with different cultural backgrounds,there are teenagers and there are middle agers. So everyone sees something others are unable to see. Americans don't get French or Japanese movies, Europeans hate Hollywood crap that American teenagers and dumb people love (J.Aniston movies anyone?). First of all the acting was great. The story realistic and believable. So saying don't waste your time is like saying I like vanilla ice cream so you don't eat a chocolate one. 9 out of 10 Hollywood movies of the last 10 years are utter crap. Argo or Gravity (7.9 ratings???? How in the world?) are awful all around in my opinion. In fact Gravity is an insult to one's intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another very bad Eli Roth movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I did not like this movie at all! Why? Because, well, it began like any other movie, but within two minutes I was shaking my head at the corniness of the lines and the acting. This plot has been done over and over again with a heck of a lot more Whoompf than this Eli Roth gbg! But, what else is new about an Eli Roth movie eh...I am not a fan. Let me tell you about another flick i saw, and IF you watch this Roth thing and then see the film I write of...well you decide. I won't give you the title, see it and you will know. A director who is irritatingly obnoxious and extremely egotistical is auditioning actresses for his "New Hit" An actress enters, she is shy, and very innocent, he immediately hits on her, then dismisses her and ends her audition. She returns, dressed to kill, and the director, not knowing this is the innocent from earlier, tells her she has the role but he wants to discuss it at his place over dinner. His best move. She says alright and they meet at his place, But she isn't alone. Her "friend" has come along. the egotistical director see's an opportunity, or so he thinks and hits them both up. They trick him, tie him, torture him, and then when he thinks they have finally left him after breaking a lot of bones etc, He begins to crawl only find they are not gone.Surprise! The End. This movie "Knock,Knock" wasn't as good as the "B" movie i write of. I hope you get to see this other movie, or anything instead of Knock Knock, because as bad as it was it was a lot better than this Eli Roth piece of ... Movie. Don't watch it if you are a Keanu Reeves fan. Don't watch it if you are a movie fan. Just Don't Watch It! But if you do at least you were warned right? Enjoy your time at the movies folks ltr!</fullReview>

John Wick was a great action flick with great cinematography and wicked action scenes but this is just, his acting is just hideous in this one. Finding out that one of the main "actresses" in the movie was also a director's wife didn't help the already horrid impression that's for sure.

		<shortDescription>Why didn't I believe the bad reviews.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read through lots of the reviews, and thought these guys are being harsh, it can't possibly be that bad can it?.....well the answer is yes.In brief, Keanu Reeves plays Evan, an architect and former DJ, seemingly with the perfect life, he's successful, he has a beautiful wife and two kids. On the morning of his birthday his family go off to the seaside leaving him alone. He's hard at work when he gets a knock at the door, two rain soaked teenage girls, claiming they're lost, looking for a family. Reluctantly he takes them in, they flirt with him, and end up seducing him and sleeping with him. Next morning they've trashed the kitchen, and refuse to leave, behaving rather oddly. The girls claim they were under 15, leaving him guilty of rape, he manages to kick them out. Not done with him they later break in and tie him up, and then the real torture starts (more so for the viewer then Keanu.)There are times when the acting becomes rather woeful, the scene with the neighbour, is like something out of a budget horror movie, it was shambolic. The torture game show part too, just horrendous, I mean could he not have overpowered them?Evan says the following 'I'm so f***ing stupid,' he wasn't wrong.There aren't many good points unfortunately, I believe when they thought of this film, someone fantasised about breaking in and seducing Keanu, then made a bad film around the one concept. One of the main problems is that there isn't a single likable character in the film, who really cares what happens to any of them. It's a shame are there was lots of potential.Fair play to Keanu, he's playing a character of 43, I had to google his age, playing this he was fifty, he doesn't even look 40. He's ageing very well, there i've found a positive.The film flopped badly in the UK cinemas. The moral of the story is believe the reviews on IMDb!!</fullReview>

There were many explicit scenes. Which made not only me but a couple of people walked out. I honestly regret seeing actually even buying tickets for this film. Reeves is a very good actor. But in this one, he just seemed so awkward. And i felt like at a point he was lost or something. It was just too twisted and sick. Please think twice of watching this movie.

		<fullReview>It's hard to begin with dreadful film. I went into it with low expectation's and was still utterly flabbergasted by how awful this was! Knock Knock makes Batman &amp; Robin look like Oscar worthy movie.I don't know what Keanu Reeves was thinking when he agreed to star in this movie but after the incredible John Wick I thought he was getting his career back on track after a run of disastrous movies but I guess not. His performance was so terrible that the audience were laughing out loud, laughing. I won't spoil the film for you but it's difficult to watch, I've never seen so many people walk out of movie before, honestly.This is 99 minutes of pure hell as a viewer. It's not even in the "it's so bad it's good" club. The film is tripe, utterly unwatchable completely unredeemable in any sense.This film is a career killer and I suggest you stay the hell away from it.If you want to watch an adult movie in the cinema go see Mad Max: Fury Road. Trust me, Knock Knock is one you don't want to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER AHEAD*Eli Roth had one good movie in him: the original Hostel. Everything before and after sucks. Including Knock Knock. After John Wick, I started to respect Keanu Reeves again. But in this movie, he delivers a performance worse than... well everything else he has ever done. But his wooden terrible performance is not the worst part.No the worst part are the shameless product placement of Apples crappy phones, tablets and computers. How they even have to be mentioned over and over again + we have to see an app that can call a cab and that a wet iPhone can be dried in a bowl of rice. + of course Evan's (Reeves) DJ equipment. It made me sick. The second worst part is how ridiculous it is how easy it is for the two girls to overpower a man twice their size. How Keanu's art-dealer friend is so incredibly stupid that he actually kills himself, without those girls ever even touching him. The third worst part is that it's never scary. Just unintentionally funny and even boring once the sex scenes and the nudity is over. I don't know if Eli Roth was trying to copy Fatal Attraction, but I think he was more occupied with finding two hot girls, marrying one of them in real life and jack off to the sex-scenes, than he was with finding good actresses that could act as psychotic as they're hot.It tries to come off as a serious erotic thriller, but it fails completely. Evan (Reeves) is so stupid that he deserves everything that he has coming. It might have been a little scary if the girls had actually tried to kill him instead of just tying him up and torture him a little bit. Or if they had allowed his family to come home and then have the girls return and terrorize him and his family. Or Evan could have killed both girls in the end to cover up his infidelity. Only not get away with it in the end. Anything other than the actual pathetic ending. The fact that the entire cast, except Keanu and 4 other actors, are unknown European actors, that we've never heard of before and probably never will again, says it all. And how pathetic is it that Keanu plays a character 7 years younger than his actual age at that time. And the exact same age as Eli Roth. Again this is probably Roth's fantasy and since he could only marry one of the girls (the brunette) he made his fantasy come true by making a movie that would have been great if it had been actual porn. At least we would have seen more nudity and actual screwing. Instead of most of the sex scenes seen through a steamy shower window. And the bad acting would have been expected. Pathetic!! Eli Roth should never be allowed to make movies ever again!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Knock Knock is carried by 2 things, perhaps 3. 1. The first 40 minutes were what you'd expect from an erotic thriller, and it's done well enough to grant a solid 6/10 rating.2. Ana de Armas's beauty is not a joke. She is, seriously gorgeous. So much so in fact, that her beauty takes the rating from 6/10, right up to 8/10.3. Lorenza Izzo is also a pretty face to look at, that adds more than just 2 cents, whenever she was on camera. Her acting, for a movie of this nature, could've been worse. Her performance and allure, take this picture to 8.5/10.Now for the anchor.1. I personally, love Keanu - because he is good at what he does (or doesn't do I suppose), however it is popular knowledge that his roles in the past have generally demanded not too great of a necessity for him to, well... Act. Funny enough - given how feeble of a tale this is, Knock Knock required a certain amount of acting prowess, that Keanu, sadly could not deliver. Actually, convert this movie from a Thriller to a Comedy, then I assure you, it would've garnered a much more positive response. This, drops the rating from 8.5/10, to 5.5/10.2. The story, is so thin, that, it had to constantly keep forcing in some way, these 2 girls being able to over power Evan over and over again... Especially after how Evan was so quick to let them know, that he could over power them both. From 5.5/10, to 4.5/10.3. The ending. I would've preferred to see, just how Evan attempts to worm his way out of the hole he dug himself into... In regards to explaining himself to his returning wife, hahaha.So, with that said; "Knock knock". "Who there"? "3"! "3 who"? "3.9/10"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't the best film I've ever seen but I am quite surprised to see such poor reviews. Yes Keanau's acting isn't his best but I thought the girls were credible. Some of the reviews are criticising the film for flaws in the story line, whereby Keanau could have killed the girls at certain points, but I think his character didn't realise until too late just how dangerous the girls were. Also, the film does explain why there are no neighbours at home. Basically the girls were clearly reeking revenge on all men and said that they had never ever been refused, however much the men claimed to love their families. In a strange way I was left feeling pity for the girls with their clearly hideous pasts and also for Keanau's character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In short, one of the true cult classics and best kept secrets of our era among the classic genre of fake underage 3some kidnapping murder plot line...In giving this film it's due, understand the elaborate texture that director Eli Roth balances. in all kitchen scenes, we see the mental anguish of Keanu slowly build behind each scene of "child's play" - and do not underestimate the high level performances of Izzo and Armas. what may seem to be XXX kitchen foreplay is in fact a unrelenting psychological thriller of epic proportion. the financial information of this movie does not give it justice (2.5M operating budget/$4k opening weekend/$34k gross) ... fairly depressing numbers by any standards, at any level of film production. this is one case of having to delve into the movie on your own terms and find how deep you can accept this feasible plot. could i have enjoyed more detail into the girls home life? sure. do i fully comprehend the lack of surrounding help? probably, but this is a level of thriller that you have to embrace from the start and enjoy it at face value. very few times in your life will you be able to become fully engrossed in an intricately woven plot. as for all the 1/10's, i'm disappointed to see it but do not allow that to hold you back. grab some popcorn, sit back and let this fantasy/nightmare tuck you into bed...this is a high-caliber, 9.5-10 level Keanu production that you'll be thankful for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I created a new account because I lost my old one, but after watching this, I have a lot of mix feelings that got me do this review after a long while. I'm not an Eli Roth fan or a Keanu hater (enjoyed him in Constantine and the movie in general) so my opinion is a bit unbiased compared to the reviews here. Ill start with some of the good points. The first I noticed is that the film has a nice vibe to it. The colors they used were really pretty. The location and set, all in all was aesthetically pleasing. This is an effective trick sometimes with thriller/horror genre because it can balance the tension without too much negative energy. kind of like "zombies in a nice super-mall" movie setting, if you know what I mean. This is one of the main reasons why I kept watching hoping that something good will come out of it. But alas...The bad. The most important part that could save the movie because the concept could actually work with some solid acting. The acting is ATROCIOUS, I found myself shaking my head from the dialogue alone. All the people saying it was done on purpose do not know what good directing is. The whole thing seems like a miscommunication from what the director had in mind or someone was not listening.The script\casting. Bad acting can only *sometimes* work with a solid script. This is what successful comedies are like. Even unintentional ones. Now if this film is a "subliminal comedy" Then why is the script more of a "dafuq..." instead of "LOL"? Many, many cringe worthy lines were said up until the end.I felt bad for Keanu honestly, it's like the movie is trying to showcase his "acting capabilities" and it did in a shi*** way. I was thinking though, who would be not the better actor for the role but an actor that fits the role. I came up with Sharlto Copley, that guy can be pretty funny with that accent. He just fits the role. The two girls were just plain retards They could at least make their characters extremely evil like portrayed but also a bit likable in a sense. that would have worked LOT better.I hate long reviews but I felt ranting a bit because of all the pseudo intellectual "film expert hippies" that claim it more than it is because they are smarter than us. It really just felt like a cluster fudge of miscommunication issues. If you want decent film similar to this go watch Hard Candy first.</fullReview>

Keanu Reeves has fallen far from the heights of Speed and the Matrix. Roth makes his characters suffer in his films and also his audience as you endure a pointless exercise of sadistic behaviour. I thought Reeves could do better than this, but apparently not.The ending is what you expect from Roth, unsatisfyingly disappointing.

		<fullReview>.. having read some of the other reviews on IMDb and seen it's low rating I was unsure about whether to watch this or not. However, there was nothing else on TV so I thought I would try it and see. Actually it's not great but it's not quite as bad as some of the other reviews suggest. It's reasonably watchable - I stuck it out till the end really because I was curious to see what would actually happen, so it did keep my attention, but the whole things is slightly bizarre.There are just so many holes in the story I can't even list them all but the most obvious is where are the neighbours? Yes I know the girls checked and no-one else is at home but that was the night before! It's 12 hours later or whatever and they're running round the garden smashing stuff up and screaming ... where IS everyone? And the taxi driver - he just turns up, they don't come out and he goes away? No banging on the door wanting payment for a wasted journey etc? Maybe that's how they do it in the US but you would never get away with that in the UK! The girls themselves are a weakness of the plot - both attractive enough but even the most horny bloke would surely find them annoying and not quite "all there" from the outset? Yet we are supposed to believe that this happily married family man, faithful for 14 years is seduced by them. The trouble with that is neither of them are alluring femme fatales - they're just nuts! However, I guess that's the underlying message of the whole film. All men are ruled by what's in their pants. Even the most stable, loving and loyal man will take it if it's handed to him on a plate (and he thinks he won't get caught of course).So the acting is pretty average. I don't really rate Keanu as an actor anyway and this film hasn't changed my view. The girls are okay but then the script probably calls for them to be OTT. There are very few characters in the film anyway and I imagine it would be hard for any of them to play this straight-faced.There are some really unpleasant bits, particularly the whole "daddy" thing but the sex is not particularly graphic. I did quite like the ending - it wasn't really what I expected which I like in a film. So all in all I would say it's not the worst film I've ever seen but I'm really glad I didn't pay money to see it at the cinema!</fullReview>

As he tries to make them leave the next morning, they turn out to be less than stable.The idea of hot crazy chicks as horror villains could be fun. Reeves is playing a relative douche which is hard to root for. The girls are not scary. Their characters border on being comical. They keep threatening as underage but they don't look underage. The first time I took as a comedic hollow threat but it's annoying when it keeps coming back. Eli Roth seems to be going for a different kind of horror. I would be a lot happier if Evan punch out the girls and chop them into pieces. This way is a lazy, silly 'Fatal Attraction'. The part with Louis gets too annoying. Everything is too broad, and too obvious. This is not scary nor thrilling. One could almost see this as camp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big potential - bigger letdown.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see Eli Roth as the director of a movie with Keanu Reeves having a leading role, you would expect it to have a certain degree of quality. While this is true in some aspects, the overall experience from Knock Knock is one of disbelief and deceptiveness.Knock Knock has its own merit. It offers a sort of unique premise and originality in the thriller, drama and even 'horror' themes. This is not your typical or traditional thriller-horror movie where jump scares, blood or gore are present and abound. The premise is simple: A man is home alone and receives an unexpected visit from 2 girls whose intentions seem unclear. Keanu and the rest of the cast do a good job overall with the acting but it does not save a movie that traps itself in a hole where it cannot dig out of.The movie preys on sexual themes and the 'what-if' hypothetical questions a normal person could be facing with after doing something they are not suppose to. This sets it aside from other movies. But from that point onward, Knock Knock is incapable of climbing any higher and eventually falls off its own constructed steps. After the message of the movie - or lesson if you want to call it that - is delivered, nothing new is added. The worst part is there actually was a lot of potential to be offered with the premise presented. Like stated before, this is not a typical thriller movie. It could have taken a different path, focusing more on originality and 'mind horror'.The movie is literally unable to advance and offer any new content. Eventually it becomes tiresome and tedious to watch. And this is on a level unlike other horror/thriller movies that, while not being original, still advance the story or plot with new content - whether they be deaths, story elements or just plain gore or action.With Knock Knock, the movie just plainly stalls and offers no advancements after the theme has set in. There actually is no plot to begin with, although this is not that uncommon in the thriller-horror world. But in Knock Knock we hardly even have a motive or 'raison d'?tre'. It can even become painful for the viewers to watch when they are left with skeptical and unrealistic actions scene after scene. Does a man let strangers wander around in their house unsupervised, more than once? Can a 40kg skinny woman overpower a man twice her size? If a man made a huge life mistake and someone witnessed it, would he just go about his life normally the next day as if nothing happened?These and other actions are presented to the viewer on a constant basis and just inject more cynicism into the movie. When you ultimately reach the end, you are glad it was over not due to the plot or story but due to the boredom and unconvincing behaviors.I was disappointed to the point of writing this review minutes after watching the movie. I felt compelled to warn other viewers. It started so well and promised so much. But we all know the saying: "The higher you climb, the harder you fall" - this movie is a perfect example of that.

		<fullReview>After Wasting 99 minutes on that piece of ****, i would like to announce it is the worst movie i have seen in my whole life. how can an actor like Keanu Reeves accept something like that. Mr. Matrix just seemed like a weak moron that cannot defend him self against two teenage helpless girls with a spoon . Are you kidding me :( .. After all the horrible movie is trying to send a message for any man. the message is it is your fault if some pretty chicks tried to seduce you in your own house using your own bathroompretending that it is not their fault either. After all i was disappointed and i will think 100 times before watching Keanu again :(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you feel disgusted, this movie did its job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing I can say about this movie is I'm glad it's over. I didn't exactly enjoy watching this movie, but this is not the kind of "glad it's over" that's result of a really boring, bad movie that mostly made me frustrated. I wanted to see this movie because it is directed by Eli Roth, yet I had no idea it would be this twisted and sick. And when we're talking about horror movies, twisted and sick isn't a bad thing. And the biggest reason for the relief when the closing credits start rolling is the fact that you feel so hopeless during the whole movie. Evan tries his best yet he can't do anything, and all that. While you're watching you think "Even if he is left alive, how could he ever overcome this", and all that.While Knock Knock is just 99 minutes long, the structure is amazing. The film is very slow, yet that 99 minutes doesn't feel too short. The whole situation develops slowly: at first it's seemingly normal, then turns weird, then turns disturbing, then it's just twisted and you experience all kind of feelings in the "What The F**k" - spectrum. And that's the most wonderful thing about this film. Every other good technical detail feels kind of blurred after this really f***ed up story in general.Since this film is a remake, it's hard to say which parts of the writing come from the original movie, and what comes from Roth, López, and Amoedo. The dialogue is good. I always say good things about horror movie dialogue: it's natural. Well, maybe not during the most stressful scenes, but when nothing bad is happening, the dialogue is natural, relaxed, and extremely realistic. Another interesting thing are the few humorous moments. The thing is, their timing makes them so bad. They shouldn't be funny but that's why they make you laugh or at least chuckle: they are so horrible, ironic, whatever is the right word.There are a lot of weird, awkward moments. One semi-annoying scene was when Bel and Evan discussed music, and Evan talks about how diverse his taste in music is. That's like one, two lines, but it feels like it's the writers patting themselves on the back, because they know weird bands or artists they can use in the movie. While all of that chit chat type of dialogue is quite unnecessary, that felt even more gratuitous.It's hard to say what score Knock Knock would deserve. I was mostly so disgusted and confused it was hard to concentrate to if this is good in the most objective way possible of reviewing a movie. Thinking about the story, cinematography, and all those little things, Knock Knock is average. A viewer's opinion is mostly affected by how you feel during this film. And you without a doubt feel sick and disgusted or maybe even angry about how a movie like this ruined your night. Well yeah, the writers probably wanted that to happen. I don't think a movie like Knock Knock is made so you can enjoy it, it's a sick, twisted horror movie. It's meant to make you feel negatively, so this film definitely did its job.</fullReview>

I actually hate myself a little bit more for actually sitting through it, and I actually hate these actors now for even agreeing to do such a stupid film. I genuinely feel bad for anybody that paid money to see this garbage can of a movie. Redbox sucks, this movie sucks, and I want to die. Do not watch this movie unless you really hate yourself that much.But honestly, do not watch this movie. Awful plot, pretty bad acting, irritatingly stupid scenes/lines, and I personally guarantee that you will regret ever seeing it. Knock Knock must have been in the top 5 list for the worst movies of 2015, or even the worst movies ever recorded. I honestly would rather crawl through 3 miles of broken glass, eat an LCD TV, and then do the milk gallon challenge than set my eyes upon the abomination that is Knock Knock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually can love anything with Keanu Reeves in it because he makes everything so much better. Unfortunately, this movie is probably one of the worst I have ever seen. I can usually appreciate watching every movie at least once even if I wouldn't watch it twice, but this one is painful to watch. Keanu was completely wrong for this role. The movie doesn't really even seem to have a point except to those that wrote it because you are left asking yourself what the motive even was for the characters doing what all they did. It is almost like watching sports to people that don't understand them. You see the characters doing things, but you can't quite ever figure out why and what the point of it all is. Reading the description I thought it would be awesome. Wrong. You can't even watch it for the steamy scenes because the chicks in the film are unattractive. I know it's hard to believe the reviews on here because a lot of times they are overly critical, but believe it on this one.</fullReview>

Had I done that I wouldn't own this piece of junk in my Blu-ray collection now. Trust me folks, wait for this to come out on Netflix and/or Amazon video. They both get plenty of movies that are 3 or 4 out of 10 stars. I didn't think Keanu Reeves could act this poorly (stick to playing Neo and John Wick). He was probably wondering why he was making this movie himself, when he was acting... you'll see what I mean when you watch this. The two girls made absolutely brilliant psychos. They played their roles well, but it was just way, way, way too much. I have to wonder if this situation actually happened to someone and then wrote a screen play.

		<fullReview>Knock Knock: Seducción Fatal is the full title of this little film written for the screen by Eli Roth, Nicolás López, Guillermo Amoedo based on a story by Anthony Overman and Michael Ronald; Eli Roth directs. Five years ago this film would have been one of the many porn hours on late night television ? and I suppose that is a comment on how far we have become relaxed in our standards of language (more F bombs is this 'story' than any film in recent history) and in your face sexuality on the screen. There is most assuredly an audience for this (Keanu Reeves fans who will watch anything he is in, people hungry for young naked women with fine bodies, midnight home intruder tales, etc), so why did it flop when released? A question worth investigating?..The preponderance of Latino actors and crew may be due to the fact that it was filmed in Chile.The 'story': 'When a devoted husband and father Evan (Keanu Reeves) is left home alone for the weekend (his artist wife Karen (Ignacia Allamand) and two children head for the beach on Father's Day!), two stranded young women Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bel (Ana de Armas) unexpectedly knock on his door for help. What starts out as a kind gesture results in a dangerous seduction and a deadly game of cat and mouse. Evan falls into temptation and the seductresses wreak havoc upon his life, turning a married man's dark fantasy into his worst nightmare.'If you really want to know the details of what happens, watch the film ? or not. It is an assault on the ears and eyes ? but is fairly in keeping with today's relaxed sexual mores. Grady Harp, June 16</fullReview>

And believe it or not an even worse plot, mainly because there is no plot to this disaster. It's just one massive plot hole. You'll see what I mean if you're silly enough to waste your time watching the film.This is proof that Eli Roth has no talent. He would've done much better to record himself on the toilet for an hour and a half. I have no idea how he was able to secure funding for this, unless he stole the money from someone.

It looks like they have ended up lost looking for a party in the neighbourhood, the gracious Reeves invites them in even offers to dry their clothes but the girls start to make their moves on him offering themselves to him how can he resist even though he does try but, it is like being offered free pizza.Soon the Izzo and de Armas are playing bizarre mind games as they tell him they are underaged and he has committed a crime, they have filmed him having sex with them. This is a sleazy, erotic dark thriller as Reeves becomes desperate. He does not want his wife to find out that he has cheated on her and he does not want to go to jail. The women turn increasingly violent towards him and their behaviour becomes deviant even leading to death.Director Eli Roth might had been aiming for some kind of lurid black comedy about the dangers of marital infidelity but the material is just too ridiculous and their are not many laughs to be had in alleged underaged sex and misandry.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, it emerges, neither do the filmmakers. What follows is an inexplicably stupid parody of 2005's Hard Candy, rather than an a genuinely scary gore-fest that Eli Roth is known for. We get an hour and a half of painful cackling, cringe-worthy dialogue, false moral dilemmas and a story so beyond laughable that I was genuinely rooting for the protagonist to die, simply so the film would finally end.Eli Roth seems to be bored of torturing the characters in his films, and has instead turned his sadistic streak onto his audiences, for all the wrong reasons.

		<fullReview>The writers were grasping for straws on this one.Let's face it, as viewers we want to be sucked into the middle of the story; we need to feel the excitement; our emotions have to be pulled from us and our intellect stimulated.This movie had me almost constantly saying to myself that the situations were unbelievable. Time after time it was obvious the writers would do almost 'anything' to try and create drama, thrills, and/or cause me to become emotionally involved, no matter how absurd the notions behind their ideas were, such that it came off as a comedy; a comedy spoof on how not to write a screenplay.If you're a highly sexed male that loves to see hot young women naked, you'll see them for a couple 'seconds,' which is probably the movies only redeeming quality, because Ana de Armas (Bell) is definitely a hottie; other than the imagery of Keanu's (Evan) and Ignacia's (Karen) successful family life and home, which was very pleasant, (the setting was nice).As soon as the antagonists Lorenza Izzo (Genesis) and Ana de Armas (Bell) arrive on screen, which isn't very far into the movie, it goes downhill pretty quickly, except as mentioned immediately above, not that their acting was bad, it's just the writing. The word 'Thriller' should absolutely not be used in the same sentence with any dialog pertaining to this movie, unless to say the supposed thrills were shrouded by unbelievably.I've loved Keanu since the debut of Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure, but let's face it, he's not the best actor when it comes to delivering believable lines. Unless of course he has very few lines to say. So to say that his lines in this movie were beneath him is a statement indeed. Sorry Keanu!The only reason we didn't turn it off before it was over was because we paid for the rental, and would feel even more ripped off if we had. At least we could laugh and make fun of the writers. So a comedy it was!In the end I was left wondering what the moral of the story was. I actually felt for the very first time, that the writers really had no idea, that it was only ever about two crazy hot chicks and nothing more. Good Luck, if you choose to pay for and watch this movie, as you might just regret it. Then again maybe not, after all, art is in fact a subjective experience!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Knock KnockI'm at a loss for words with this film. Let me see if I can muster up some comparisons. Eli Roth loves to add in foreshadowing into his films. I wish things were not so predictable though, but Eli shows he can really write characters well.Genesis played by Lorenza Izzo, who was also in Green Inferno, show her range in that she can play both the innocent virgin in Green Inferno and the very definition of Chaotic Evil in Knock Knock.Bell played by Ana de Armas was seriously crazy. I mean textbook thrown into a vat of melted lead, crazy. I look forward to seeing her performance in War Dogs.As promised: the comparisons. I think the best comparison for this film is Scream, in that the villains of the movie are seriously messed up in the head and are willing to do the most extreme measures to see to their perfect ending and are truly methodical with how they unfold their diabolic plan.Ladies, you're gonna hate the first act. Just saying. My wife couldn't make it through the first act. Ann Frank could see what was coming. (Referencing: Clerks II)Verdict: Watch it. It keeps you wanting to know how it's going to end.

		<fullReview>Eli Roth directs and co-writes the screenplay with Nicolás López and Guillermo Amoedo. It stars Keanu Reeves, Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas. Music is by Manuel Riveiro and cinematography by Antonio Quercia. Reeves plays Evan, a devoted husband and father of two, who while he is left home alone, is visited by two young women soaked and apparently lost. Letting them in to his home as an act of kindness, things quickly spiral out of control.You do wonder if Eli Roth sits at home looking at the reaction to his movie and giggles like a schoolboy. It's invariably a distinctly average film, but it does get a reaction from the audience, something which Roth is gleefully aware of. Pic is actually a remake of Peter S. Traynor's 1977 movie, Death Game, which starred Sondra Locke and Colleeen Camp, both of whom lend their names to production for this release.At times it feels like we are part of one of Roth's wet dreams, or conversely one of his sick jokes. Yet as the cast struggle to instill acting gravitas (the girls actually become more annoying than frightening), and Roth chooses psychological themes over blood and guts, there's a deft whiff of a moral fable hanging in the air. While also of note is the nods to film noir, both in story and visuals. It isn't enough to save the piece, but it's interesting enough as an aside to the chaos inside the house. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly original plot falls victim to a dreadful script and jaw-droppingly bad acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review I have ever written on a film and I have decided not to look for a template for 'how to write a film review' and have decided to go off my own back and try to be original (a.k.a it's more than likely going to be a load of rubbish set out poorly.) I don't want to do this to Keanu Reeves because I have seen him in The Matrix and thought he nailed that, but from the outset of 'Knock Knock' he was just truly abject. His enthusiasm for his children in the first scene of the film could be an advertisement for 'what you will look like if you try to act out of your comfort zone, when your comfort zone happens to be the only zone you can act in'. His performance later in the film regarding his almost comedic way of warning Louis about the two girls is another devastating indication that Keanu Reeves must be limited to more subtle roles, such as the one he so brilliantly portrayed in The Matrix.The premise of the film however is highly intriguing. After waking from his adulterous-ridden night I think it is quite easy for the majority of the audience to be able to empathise with this character, i.e doing something terribly wrong with no way out other than to face the music. When the girls claim to be underage to Evan his whole world is hanging from a thread just above extremely thin ice. It is from that moment where the creators of this film should have been more creative as they have wonderfully crafted a situation where they have a very capable, strong and wealthy man in a situation of absolute desperation. Instead they decided to never put Evan in a position where he would have to make any decisions based on his terrifying and unorthodox situation.I think it is worth noting that when Ewan accidentally selects the 'LIKE' button and not the 'DELETE' button his reaction is almost exaggerated (purpousely) for comedic effect, which calls in to question my approach to this film. I started this film thinking it was going to be serious and creepy however when I actually look back to certain parts of the film I can't help but think it was actually made to be a bit funny. Would Ewan seriously describe the girls to Ewan as 'CRAZY'? If I was in his situation I would ensure that Louis fully understood the seriousness of the situation. Would Louis really confront two 'DANGEROUS' kidnappers because of a piece of artwork only to suffer from an asthma attack? I think there is obviously an element of humour in this film which almost makes me feel guilty for the criticism I gave Reeves. I think he'll get over it.I'd like to finish this with one of my favourite lines from the movie 'The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance' which exposes the futility of writing a homicidal review and hopefully expresses my intention to not offend anyone related to this film but instead expresses my utmost respect as they have attempted to create an original piece of art, an endeavour I one day wish to take upon myself."Tomorrrow night, at 8 o'clock he's going out on that stage and risking everything, what'll you be doing?" Granted you needed some context but hopefully you get the point. Hope you enjoyed reading.PatientViewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Funny Games years ago and loving the concept of two villains just wanting to have some "fun", I was really hoping for the same type of great story in a more modern setting. I had my reservations, but I still went into this excepting something at least decent.What I actually got was horrible acting from Keanu Reeves, lots of plot holes and a bad script, and two girls who were the only saving grace in the whole movie, thanks to their charisma and energy. To make matters worse, the audience is forced to sit through what I feel was a constant slight against men, based on some of the dialogue and overall feeling throughout the movie. At times, the usage of social media "culture" is so obvious and shoved into your face, that you can't help but roll your eyes. I'm giving this a 4/10 because I enjoyed Lorenza Izzo and Ana De Armas' acting, but I'm sorry to say that everything else was horrible and no one should have to sit through even 30 minutes of this movie. Eli Roth should be embarrassed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Should Have Known...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should have know this movie was going to be sub par for the mere fact Keanu Reeves hasn't been in anything remotely notable since the Matrix trilogy and other movies within that time frame. He has been reduced to pulpy "suspense thrillers" and action movies that focus too much on CGI. I like watching suspense/thriller/horror type films, even some that others could consider bad, so I took a chance considering Eli Roth can be good and Keanu is a big name actor in this type of movie. I figured at least the acting would be good. Not a chance! Keanu was one dimensional, as he frequently is, but worse than usual due to the atrocious writing. He is a smart, attractive dad who is devoted to his wife. Except the fact he is "coerced" into a threesome with 2 idiotic teens maybe twenty-somethings... How he couldn't see that they were trouble the moment they stepped into his home and took their clothes off to dry is beyond me. That's because this character is a douche and wanted to have sex with them the second he saw them, so its pretty hard to have sympathy for his character. The girls are crazy and annoying beyond belief. He could have admitted to his wife what happened at some point and get them to leave and, of course, tries to cover it up instead. The story line borders on sexism, as the story tries to make Keanu "the good guy" (although unsuccessfully) who is being framed for sex crimes by crazy girls. He is the "victim" even though he is the one who gave in to his sexual desires, willingly. It was one of the most annoying films i have seen, but o gave it a 5 because it was nice to see his character suffer. Not the worst I have seen, but still a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only thing that describes it is an Atrocity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is a third remake of the seducers or death room, which was remade also as vicious and nude i must admit this is by far the worst version of it. Although the other two weren't good either, at least they were not awful First of all the dialogues or the script lines are so empty, plain and flat, that a high school kids play has more meaning and acting than this. Two bimbos taken from the real world, with every day chat lines of the world we live in, are not an excuse to be used in a movie. Secondly the acting of all 3 main actors are hideous and what is even more disappointing is seeing Keanu reeves being one of them, and especially the fact that this makes 2 bad films he made this year (2015) What took my attention is how the film although trying to raise a common problem of our world, does not synchronise with reality. What i mean is certain things happening in the film would have not happened in real life, as if a man would jump like a 5 year old kid to get his inhaler from two teenagers and not push one on the floor to get his item seeing the severity of the situation, and how conveniently he slips, he hits his head and dies. Thats it, i will not continue because i am giving even more value to this film The director better change his job, because he has not done something meaningful so far, and this was his worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally i don't write reviews about movies, but this one made me loose 1:30 hours of my life, and that only because the trailer wasn't that bad and it had Keanu Reeves in it. Disappointing, without sense and annoying. From the way the actors played to the so called action, this movie is a catastrophe that will make your eyes bleed. I'm sorry i didn't read the reviews before watching it. IMDb tells me i have to write 10 lines of text for this review but how can you do this after watching such a piece of crap. I thought that Keanu Reeves would never end up in a joke of a movie like this. The quote and the end was meant to be funny? Well, it wasn't!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent premise, awful execution: quickly turns to (unintentional) comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As it often happens, behind a mediocre movie, there was an interesting idea that, unfortunately, wasn't developed into a good story.Knock knock is one of those cases.The quintessential "family man", vaguely goofy, devoted husband and father, gets himself dragged into a dangerous situation involving two alluring strangers who shows up at his door on a stormy night.Things goes south pretty soon, and the poor, naive, guy finds himself trapped, with charges for paedophilia and murder looming over his head.Sadly, instead of providing a tense experience, like many other "home invasion" movies, Knock Knock flirts with the comedic side of things, trying to be creepy, scary and quirky at the same time, failing miserably to deliver either scares, social commentary or even uncomfortable fun.The vaguely ethical theme about all men being potential sexual predators just doesn't work, and the whole paedophilia-incest thing sticks up like a sore thumb.It's heavily implied the two girls were victims of sexual abuse when they were younger, so they're out for revenge, but then again, maybe not and they're just crazy or deranged women... Whatever ambivalence there was, it was made null and void by the absurdity of the situation.Even accepting the "good, unsuspecting Samaritan" premise, no man in his right mind would have bought those girls were 15! And who wouldn't have thrown them out long BEFORE they could have had a chance to work their sexual magic on him? Not to mention the defense would have had a field day with housebreaking, assault and battery, property damage...Bottom line: the movie isn't scary, isn't thought-provoking, isn't even morbidly gory (like other Roth's works)... It's a poor attempt at mixing up several styles, based on a story that doesn't have a much substance or credibility.P.S. the least said about acting, the better...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having seen the impressive original ('The seducers') and the rather okay (unofficial) Spanish remake, I got pretty much what I expected from Eli Roth's attempt^. The whole thing is pretty generic 'horror' stuff, with most of the generic elements one may expect; the establishing of a happily married man with kids, plenty of silly choices and characters, and the seemingly inescapable 'clever' use of modern day gadgets and stuff.The really big trouble here is, though, that the original given has been watered down once again (after the Spanish remake had done the same, but still had something to say). 'Knock knock' has no particularly clever message for anyone with half a brain.So then, the cast could add something to the whole, maybe, and keep the viewer interested somehow? Well, the two leading ladies are cute enough, they try their best with the meager dialogue and plot which they were given, and Roth even dares to have them do some rather steamy action, wíth a proper amount of nudity. So, kudos for that. But then, Keanu Reeves... he really did a terrible, terrible job, although I don't know if it's for a lack of trying or a lack of talent and / or charisma; I've seen him do decent enough stuff in the past, but this just didn't come off right - at all.4 out of 10.^ That doesn't mean I never liked any of Roth's work, au contraire, but it was only just about gory, fun and interesting enough (and it's been a while since I've seen those...).</fullReview>

After that i did not feel sorry for keanu reeves anymore. I thought he deserved all that torture because his character was so stupid. I laughed so hard after they buried him and thought it was so funny watching his little head out of the ground bobbing back and forth yelling and screaming... And then the accidental like on the facebook sex video turned this movie into an epic comedy! Omg i laughed so hard! Overall i enjoyed it. Great comedy thriller!</fullReview>

I understand the message of this film, but it is so awful what is happening. I understand the character obviously let in good looking girls in his home, because so confident of his charm. I am sorry to say but it was typical, this mistake will not do only the sexual predators what Keanu Reeves acting person. Actually he try to speak himself by the good man,but come on You let in people Your own house. You believe totally strangers anything what they say. Just because they were good looking. I know he was sexually frustrated because of the rareness of sex in his marriage. Come on people You let anybody to have sex with You without You know anything of them. It is scary and it is mad. They killed a person who have bad breathing and get the situation quick enough. They leave in him in a living hell, what he can't explain because what they did. The film finishes like anybody can do with anybody that without any jail or something. That makes me very angry. If this could happens it is awful. The film maker should think about it how great idea gives about 2 billion angry young girl to make people sad and live in a living horror. This is a retarded finish is killed the believe Movies for entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The artists responsible for this film did a great job with the build up during the first half. The introduction of the main characters is what I would expect. The seduction of the primary character happens just like I would expect, and left me wondering what the outcome would be. The transition of the villains from intelligent and seductive to childish pranksters was unexpected and distasteful, in my opinion. And their further transition from childish pranksters to psychopaths disrupted the possibility of the story going anywhere interesting. First the film alludes to their being some rational twist that it's building up to... but then what? nothing. It leaves the viewer with nothing. Their was no logic behind the behavior of the villains in this film. The story is never finished. And the contents of the second half of the film seemed rushed and purposefully unbelievable. The victim reacts in various different ways, momentarily, but like the villains he never follows through with what would appear to be the logical conclusion of his actions. I kept watching in the hopes that the direction the film was going would switch at some point, and come to some believable conclusion. But it never did. I absolutely would have stopped watching had I known the story wasn't going to go anywhere. This film left me feeling cheated and lied to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I am a fan of Keanu. That may put me in the bottom percent or not, if you're also a fan, but it does give perceptive about this review. I enjoy the thriller genre and Eli Roth has made some artistic and well executed films in this field. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. I watched this movie on DVD and watched "the making of" featurette, in order to understand what the people involved were attempting to create. In one word, art, seemed to be the intent. Both director and writers speak of creating suspense and psychological intensity, neither of which this film offers. As with many movies as of late, the best intentions of those involved, end up being driven by their own ego and ultimately making a film that is just huge disappointment for an audience member. There is nothing artistic or poignant about this drivel. It just ends up being absurd and flat. A character driven story, with characters so cartoonish in nature, I kept waiting for Batman to make an appearance. At least then, there would have been a character with some small amount of intrigue to hold my interest. The acting is quite good, despite an awful script, which is the only reason this picture was given more than 1 star. But hey, at least I had time to finish a rather difficult sudoku puzzle.</fullReview>

One possible use for this sad attempt at film making would be a parlor game of sorts...Push the PLAY button, and the first viewer to look across at the other in amazement gets a point.

		<shortDescription>Terrible, even by my standards.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I really enjoy a lot of Eli Roth's work. Cabin Fever was the first of his films that I watched and I love it. Hostel was not too bad for what it was, and I've watched it a few times- while many don't like the "torture porn" aspect of it, I've always thought that it was a very creepy, unsettling movie and had great atmosphere. I recently watched The Green Inferno and enjoyed that a lot as well, despite it getting fairly bad reviews from a lot of people. At any rate, the point is that I've definitely been an Eli Roth fan for a while now.I'm also a huge fan of Keanu Reeves. I've seen nearly every film he's been in- that's how big of a Reeves fan I am. That doesn't make me blind to his acting capabilities though. There are definitely movies he's been in where his performance leaves much to be desired. But I thought he was amazing in certain roles, like Constantine, The Devil's Advocate, etc. and even some of his romantic roles like Sweet November were pretty decent.But my god. This movie was just horrible. It pains me to say that, since it combines two people I'm definitely a fan of, but there are no redeeming qualities about this movie except the very cute French Bulldog.The girls' acting was pretty good; they were seductive and psychotic and did well in their roles. But Keanu was terrible; the scenes where he's being hurt in some way and screaming are completely unconvincing. I did like the first bit of the movie with his family, I'll give him that.The "plot" is pretty bad, the pacing is just terrible and overall I found this movie just really...boring. That's probably the best way to describe it. I was thinking for a Roth film that there would be more awful things happening but in all honesty, without trying to spoil anything, the physical stuff that the girls put Reeves through is mild at best.I also would have liked a bit more depth to the girls and why they were doing everything but I suppose that's probably a minor complaint compared to the rest of the problems with this movie.Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed such masterpieces as "Wrong Turn 3: Left for Dead" way more than I enjoyed this movie, and Paris Hilton's performance in "House of Wax" was superior to Reeves in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is my first movie review I have ever written as well so bare with me. I love reeves, and I cant think of one movie he is in that I didn't like except this one. This movie is not only the worst movie I have ever seen, but it was the MOST ANNOYING MOVIES I have EVER sat through. I am not a picky movie person at all, as long as there is good acting and a good plot, I can enjoy the simplest films. This movie on the other hand, mostly consisted of annoying "15 year old" acting. girls screaming the whole time. They torture the man for cheating on his wife..when he was clearly subducted by two girls. he fought his hardest to resist, and gets instantly accused of being a pedophile when he wakes up..as if any man could resist two insanely hot woman forcing his junk into their mouths when his wife went on vacation. by nature, any man would get instantly aroused. no way around that even If a man still ran away from the situation, he would still be aroused in some way.the only slightly good part is when the woman are naked. other than that, it is all annoying screaming after that. legit the entire time. they make reeves act way out of his usual parts, making the movie instantly awful. he is normally calm and bad-ass. he is one of my favorite actors actually. in this movie he acts too nice..doesn't fit him.its one of those movies that gets you aggravated for people having the chance to escape, but they somehow just don't get around to it do they?I don't care about spoiling it either..i am legit going out of my way to save your life, you have 90 minutes left in your life that is not wasted with complete nonsense. a mans worst nightmare actually..getting tricked into being a pedophile....it ends not with them killing him like you are going to think. but with his video that they took of them raping him, posted on his facebook. yes I said it, facebook. that is it. just screaming around a house, vandalizing it by writing things teenage girls could come up with. all while keanue reeves is tied to a chair. legit that is it. don't watch this movie.shame on you for making men look like mean people. when in reality, WOMAN are the ones who cheat and lie. they might be able to resist rape unlike men are able to, but statistically 90 percent of woman cheat and lie in this day and age, and that is a fact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From thequickflickcritic.blogspot.com/ I thought I would give the Keanu Reeves vehicle "Knock Knock" a shot. So I did. I now wish to beat hell that I would have shot down this abundantly ill-advised notion the instant it germinated.This purported thriller was silly, superfluous, banal and just plain BAD beyond all reason. There was but a solitary redeeming element in this entire merciless mess for me. And that pertains to the pair of young actresses who starred in the movie upon which this disaster was based, 1977's "Death Game", which I saw, liked and was shaken by for days. "Knock Knock" was Exec Produced by Sondra Locke and features a brief cameo from Colleen Camp, the two women who played the pair of deeply disturbed yet ravishingly beautiful home invaders of a well-to-do suburban family man left all by his lonesome nearly 40 years ago. Why they would tarnish the genuinely terrifying work they delivered then to be part of this trashy tripe is simply beyond me.Knock knock.Who's there? Thistle.Thistle who?

No sensible adult is going to allow two airhead young women to get away with what they did. Whoever conceived this story should visit an analyst immediately. The whole thing is ridiculous and unbelievable, and perhaps should have been labelled 'comedy'. But it isn't, so I take it for what I'm told it is. On so many occasions one thought Reeves was finally going to take matters in hand, but he never did, and I thought this character really a damned fool to tolerate all this nonsense. This film is surely an excellent candidate for the Movie Hall of Execution where the Producers, Reeves and the Writer can get what they deserve.</fullReview>

I give this film a 6/10 because the acting is good it has its up's and downs its how you say "teenage humor" which is okay. Keanu Reeves does an alright job i felt toward the middle of the film he started to drift away a little bit. "Lorenza Izzo" and "Ana De Armas" do an excellent job in there roles playing deranged and mental women. I was satisfied with what i watched. This film is definitely at least a rent definitely not worth spending $20, $15 or even $10 dollars. This is a watch though with some friends or even a sleep over watch. It is an average movie with eye openers, "wows", laughs, and eye rolling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Eli Roth,this film was a huge letdown after the impressive THE GREEN INFERNO. It is not really worth writing a review. But the sex scenes where great. I only wish you had done away with the fast cuts.I don't know what you were thinking casting Keanu Reeves in this film. He played another one of those vacuous and empty rich American liberal males.Anyway, you really seem to want to be politically incorrect. I noticed this in The Green Inferno as well. Over here, you have two female rapists and sadists running amok. It was a pretty good idea. These two women were rapists. But the fact that the male almost willingly has sex with them indicates that this was another pathetic attempt to criticize the male sexual urge. It was a very interesting scenario. But you were simply aiming for the shocks (nothing wrong with that but the shocks and thrills were nothing to write home about) rather than provide some sort of commentary.Anyway, I am sure Vikram Bhatt and Madhuri Banerjee would remake this. And the Shiv Sena would go crazy on the first day of the remake's screening. Best Regards, Pimpin.(5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gone Girl on crack: A masterpiece, but not for everyone...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoiler alert for both 'Knock Knock' and 'Gone Girl'**In today's feminist society, people aren't ready for a film that depicts the extent of female sexual power over men. This movie caricatures and exaggerates just what two cute women can get away with, to delicious and frankly, genius effect.Eli Roth knew what he was doing (for instance) with the scenes where the girls grill the protagonist on what happens to alleged sexual predators. They can do what they want and they will get away with it because they're young, attractive white women and they can always claim victimhood. It's the world we live in at the moment. It is completely ridiculous when you see it. Most men are too naive to acknowledge it and most women are too reliant on this status quo to admit it.The script is perfect because very few (if any) straight men would have been able to resist the sexual aggression of the women (Keanu's character did the best any man would do - which is why they resorted to physicality, essentially rape - and Keanu's character later had to apologise for this, whilst tied up! You see? Ridiculous). Taking the utter ludicrousness of this situation to it's extreme, and then taking it further and then a bit further is just the sledgehammer approach needed to tell this story. And yet, as evidenced by the reviews, people are still reluctant acknowledge it. They can't swallow it.This exact story is told in 'Gone Girl' but with a lot more subtlety. Similarly, in Gone Girl, Amy accuses someone of rape, and gets away with it, then accuses someone of murder, and gets away with it, then rapes and murders someone... AND GETS AWAY WITH IT! You see? Ridiculous. And in today's feminist society, most people are too brainwashed to comprehend the enormity of this situation. Bravo to Eli Roth, Keanu Reeves, Lorenza Izzo, and Ana de Armas for putting together a modern subversive masterpiece.</fullReview>

For one I hate movies, books, or anything that puts a nice person into looking like the opposite, and this does that to full impact and then some. Instead of getting into that he slept with them so he's to blame, or this or that, how about his wife is Spanish, one of the girls is, nothing explains this at all, they know things about the family that could only come from some type of knowledge beforehand .... NOTHING is done to explain this, they kill one person, and hint about someone who will easily get rid of the body, but the death wasn't planned, so how did they have access to this person, when figuring in the ending, they don't need anyone to get rid of a body. The whole movie is beyond stupid, sold on the fact that Keanu has fans, well count me out on that from now on ! How he sank quite so low is just ....... Sorry Keanu but as in th movie, you choose who you sleep with, you slept with a total loser IMHO movie wise, and I'm moving on. Adios</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Awful I Had To Turn It Off Midway Though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the ... My lord it's so awful .. I can't seem to find the right words to express it It was terrible just nasty wrong sickening and stupid! I'm trying to wrap my head around why someone as amazing as Keanu would star In such a crap film! I mean the only reason I rented the film Was because he was in it I even paid extra to keep it more than one night and now I feel ripped off because it was so terrible I had to turn the movie off halfway through. Why why? Such a perverted film I need holy water sprinkled in my eyes to try to get out the vision of what I've seen out of my head. No wait better yet I need some kind of movie memory eraser type of pill that I can take and hopefully I'll forget I ever rented this depressing awful movie. I wish I'd never rented it I think I may be scarred for all eternity!! Again don't rent it people you'll thank me in the end! :(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie of Keanu Career!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything about this movie is garbage! The writers, the screenplay, the actors the cinematography, the producer. Keanu Reeves should be embarrassed to have his name all over this garbage! Hands down the worst movie of the year! If you're a Keanu Reeves fan do not watch this! How can you go from John Wick to this amateur crap? How in the hell was you reading the script and be like "damn this is the next blockbuster, hell I think I even want to be the producer"? What's the moral of the story? What was motivation behind the supporting actors? This movie did nothing but give anxiety, so bad I even skipped forward through several scenes. Where was the climax? I want some bloody answers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Want to screw up a movie? Hire Keanu Reeves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A promising movie that fails to deliver on all counts, but the most glaring problem is the star. A cigar store Indian could act rings around Keanu Reeves. Bill &amp; Ted, River's Edge--yeah--he was great. Because he was playing himself. A weird, stiff, plastic moron. But since then he hasn't been able to find a role for a weird, stiff, plastic moron and yet he's made a career for himself. Hard to understand. The film is 90 minutes and the first half hour was the most excruciating period of time I've spent in a long time. You could honestly pick up a bum on the street, get him to read these lines, and he'd do a better job than Keanu Reeves. The only time he doesn't act stiff is when two young girls in bathrobes are dancing around his living room which is exactly when he SHOULD be acting stuff. If you want a real treat, try to last until the 35 minute mark when he says, "It's... usually... not... as... exciting... around... here." I laughed myself sick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keanu's Most Wretched and Embarrassing Role!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the name of Eli Roth as director of this film, I should have taken that as a warning that this was probably going to be a bad movie. Roth's previous work either as director or writer were mostly crazy violent and gory just for the sake of being gory. Unlike his other films though, like the dreadful "Hostel" or the awful "Aftershock", this one had a known movie star in the lead role -- Keanu Reeves. It was because of Reeves that convinced me that I could give this film a chance.Successful architect Evan Webber is an ideal husband of an artist wife and a model father of two. One day (ironically it was Father's Day), Evan was left behind at home because of work while the rest of his family went on a beach vacation. That night, two sexy young ladies show up at this door lost and soaking wet from the rain. Evan kindly admits them into his house so they can get dry and call for a cab. However, these two liberated girls had kinky shenanigans in mind for Evan, and then some.In spite of the fact that the script and the acting were already pretty cheesy from the very start, the premise of the film actually seemed promising at first. Things do get interesting when the girls came into the scene and turned on their charms in an attempt to seduce the faithful family man. After that key scene though, the rest of the film turned south and just got more and more ridiculous up to the very end which unfortunately did not come right away.Keanu Reeves is one enigmatic star whose career definitely had its ups and downs. In the beginning, he was able to balance his comedy ("Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"), romance ("A Walk in the Clouds"), drama ("My Own Private Idaho") and action ("Speed" and "Matrix"). Since the turn of the millennium though, his career turned for the worse, with no really memorable roles to speak of. His last two films, "47 Ronin" and "John Wick," brought his name back up for the better. However, "Knock, Knock" knocks him down again with a performance so dismal it will be long-remembered for all the wrong reasons. Keanu Reeves' wretched portrayal of Evan Webber is simply beyond embarrassing. Reeves playing monster with his family at the start was just the first of many cringe-worthy scenes for him in the whole course of this film. As his character was threatened with death later in the film, Reeves' impassioned appeal for his life was so hilariously delivered with the craziest of words, it actually had me laughing out loud in spite of myself. Finally, when a scene came when we see Reeves' head on the ground with only his comical facial emoting, I totally lost it laughing. I cannot fathom how a star of his stature could have allowed himself to suffer such shameful indignities.We can't really expect much from the other relatively unknown actors in the cast who also came up with similarly ludicrous performances. Lorenza Izzo (Eli Roth's wife in real life) and Ana de Armas (the hotter blonde vixen) played the two seductresses Genesis and Bel with such loony, over-the-top abandon. Aaron Burns played the gay friend Louis, who was more concerned about the artwork than people. They did look like they were having a lot of fun doing their inane scenes (even though the situations were not supposed to be funny).What was on Eli Roth's mind when he wrote and directed this? Were all the outrageous scenarios and lousy hammy acting done on purpose to somehow make this film stand out? Was this all an elaborate warning about logging out of Facebook once you are done with it? Anyway, everything was so exaggeratedly bad it was actually uproariously funny. It was definitely not what I expected going in, but I did get a good laugh out of it so I won't call it a total disaster. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worst movie i ever sew</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first review of a movie I've ever written and I wouldn't usually do this, but felt the need to advise people to steer clear of this movie. It was truly one of the worst movies that I've ever seen in my life. I had high hopes for the movie before seeing it, especially since I'm a fan of Keanu Reeves in many of his other movies. However I found the movie to be utterly bizarre and ridiculous and struggled to sit through the whole movie and resist the urge to leave. The acting was really over the top at times and so painful to watch. The plot did have potential and could have been so much better but unfortunately it did not work at all in this movie. Many of the scenes are extremely creepy and perverted, and not what I would expect to see in any movie. I found parts of this movie very difficult to understand and follow, so that I eventually lost interest completely. The ending was one of the biggest disappointments and left me with feelings of relief that it was finally over and feeling like I'd just wasted the last 90 minutes of my life. Avoid this movie at all costs!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute brain-rot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do NOT waste your time. It's a rare thing for me to rate a movie so low, but this warped brain-rot excuse for a social commentary did in fact waste my time and seems to exist only to twist the minds of the audience and gratify deranged perverts (with such imagery as graffitied penises scribbled onto pictures of children). Obviously the director, or this pitiful excuse for a director, Eli Roth, wished to anger the audience to the point of frustration and then fail to provide any sort of satisfactory resolution as some sort of sick joke. Such failure to provide adequate closure is the ultimate flaw a director and their film can exhibit. I could've lived with the emotional strain if there was some sort of payoff in the end; however without that the film becomes little more than 90 minutes of chaos and ultimately fails. I'd also venture to question the mental health of Eli Roth with such a disturbing fascination with pedophilia. He seems to promote it more than he does criticise it, by glorifying the goblin-like antagonists and the sick and cruel deeds they carry out. Perhaps this is some twisted social experiment aimed at desensitizing the public. And why create a film which seems to mock and ooze contempt for art and then expect to be considered such? Because if he never intended this mess of a film to be considered art then all it is is just that, a mess. Awful. Absolutely awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, the movie is disgusting. It is not something to be watched with a girlfriend or wife or family member. It does have a place though in the film world and I am glad that these issues were brought to light.The premise of the movie has happened to so many men... But not in so drastic of a manner. This is a problem that needs addressing and this film approaches it with the extreme. I can honestly say that younger women can sometimes be less innocent then a gentleman just a few years older. Yes, Keanu Reeves is MUCH older.. But current laws leave much to be desired for youngsters within just a couple years of each other who are not aware of the consequences of what they are doing.</fullReview>

The premise is conventional but the hammed up acting makes the delivery a great choice for an early evening halloween movie! ( not for the kids mind you )Especially the last 20 minutes where the acting when into overdrive and crazy over the top. I watched it with some friends and we were all in stitches laughing and had to play it back a number of times.This has now replaced the Nic Cage 'Not the Bees' effort as my new favourite !

		<fullReview>I'm not sure where to start with this train wreck of a movie. I think this is the first home invasion film I've seen where the invaders just walk off grinning having won. How can that be you ask? Since when do brutal, torturing, psychopathic invaders destroy an American family and just walk away? When they're feminists, apparently and their victim is a man. Anything they do is justified--because he's an evil white man. They leave him buried up to his neck in the dirt watching a video of his sins and he'd can't reach the delete button--how profound. He can't delete the sin of being a white man. Thank God for Hollywood to lead us on the path to righteousness. Man-hating blue-haired lesbians will probably love this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friends were telling me about what a twerp Eli Roth was, so I watched this film to find out if it was true. All I can say is WHAT A TROLL. Why would anyone make such nasty insulting movies? I mean, they're not even funny. Usually there's a element of camp to bad horror but Eli Roth is simply an arrogant maladjusted attention seeker with nothing useful to offer humanity. His psychopathic behavior appears to be consistent with the traits common to most criminals, including sensation seeking, a lack of remorse or guilt, the need for control, and predatory behavior. There is not a single shred of anything redeeming in his work. Seriously, what happened to this guy? Was it lack of attention during his upbringing? Bullying at school? Poor potty training? What created such a useless psychotic troll as Eli Roth? He makes his movies so people know he exists as an immature, callous, inconsiderate and pitiful human. The truly insulting thing is he stands there like a smiling, petulant 8-year old saying that's the reaction he wants. He wants to present us with this type of challenge because he is a TROLL MOVIE DIRECTOR. My friends were right. Our culture would be considerably improved if Eli Roth would fall backwards off a cliff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The two thing that led me to theater to see this movie was the cute girls and Keanu. Keanu is bad from the beginning trying to act as a dad, and then as the victim - really, the worst thing I've seen in ages. The only good thing about this movie is I got to see the girls naked. I know that might sound sexist, but sadly that is the only good thing I saw in this movie. The script is so bad that they had nothing else to do than look cute at the first half of the movie and look crazy for the second half.This movie makes Eli Roth look like an amateur, a kid in the movie business making his first movies. Sadly, he's been making movies for about 13 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potential but no delivery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was able to view this at Sundance and couldn't have been more disappointed. I'm not sure if Eli Roth was trying to make this a campy horror, a legitimate horror, or a social commentary. He failed miserably in all three regards.1. As an adoring fan of Cabin Fever, I keep hoping Roth with find a way back to creating edgy horror that doesn't take itself too seriously. The last two minutes did elicit a few chuckles from the audience but seemed inconsistent with the rest of the movie which had a very serious tone. 2. The movie had the potential to be a thrilling horror along the lines of Fatal Attraction. Unfortunately the seduction felt forced and the mental instability of the girls completely unbelievable. Furthermore, the horror scenarios were so contrived that I found myself getting bored rather than terrified: a small Lorenza Izzo overpowering a large Keanu Reeves, using extension cords for restraining when they can't generate sufficient tension, being held at gun point just inches from a semiautomatic gun that likely has not had a round chambered, Aaron Burns leaving a tied up Keanu Reeves because the girls are destroying art, the cliché tripping while trying to run away, the premise that all neighbors within earshot of a screaming Keanu were on vacation?the movie was one "Oh come on" after another. 3. The movie ends with the premise that, presented with temptation, all men will succumb. As mentioned, the seduction felt forced and completely unnatural. Keanu Reeves was a great father and husband. His obvious discomfort at the two womens' advances vanishes instantaneously as he becomes a flirtatious DJ and the rather irate Keanu, upon finding the two naked women, is suddenly pacified as soon as they unzip his fly. I find it hard to believe that Keanu Reeves character would have done anything he was shown to do in the movie and therefore reject the social premise that men are sexual deviants.Most of the conversation I heard after the movie was negative. I'm still holding out hope that Eli Roth has another great movie in him. But this definitely wasn't it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eli Roth's "Knock Knock" Is A Psychological Thriller With Common Appearance, But With A Disturbing Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intervening moral issues of fidelity and sexual drives (usually, present in married men), Roth, Nicolás López and Guillermo Amoedo conceive a story with references - or possibly based - on "Death Game" film of 1997 with almost the same plot. With better performances, uses of technology, a story with appropriate plot twists and a better directing, this new version shows the multifaceted that could be the director, without the presence gore that characterizes him, OK, at least without so much blood.With a predictably moderate result at the box office, "Knock Knock" is a fresh and lush proposal to the commercial films and while it is not the masterpiece of the season, it is one of the independent films more entertaining of the year. Roth arrives with strength to the suspense genre, with one idea we've already seen, but with a view more modern and modified about itself, perhaps is a remake or maybe not.Keanu Reeves plays Evan, a happily married architect, father of two children, with fortune, love, DJ hobbies, a beautiful house, in summary an idealized life, what else can he ask for?. Then, his two children and his wife take a nice vacation to the beach - on the occasion of father's day, a big irony-, Evan and Monkey left alone at home working on his project. On a rainy and simply sinister night, two beautiful and stunning girls innocently knock on the Evan's door, under the pretext of help, since they have lost on the way to a party. This merciful man - though, after I watch this movie so many times, in the third time, I can see the desire of Evan, it is logical, he is a man - allows them to enter for one call or maximum one coffee cup. Bel (Ana de Armas) and Genesis (Lorenza Izzo, the wife and constant contributor to Roth) are male sexual fantasy. After asking a taxi and have a talk about faithfulness and sex, things become dangerous and Evan's love for his family is thrown into the toilet.Evan has sexual relations with the two girls - something relatively impossible considering the age of Evan, but relatively possible considering that morning his wife not wanted help him, affirming that he took more than three months without having sexual relations -, naive and innocent of the hell that was to come. Once the guys begin to show their bad behavior, Evan feels in trouble and goes in a direction that will not help him. Things come up to the limit of gag to Evan, unintentionally killing a person and destroy all the house. The previous is made to give a lesson to all husband who believe to be faithful, but that "fidelity" word is what less used inside their mind.Idea is completely brand-new, however, its end leaves the audience unsatisfied, thrilled and even disappointed. It feels like a failed experiment, feels like a work that had a stupid ending, it is illogical to which after a great development finishes with a finish so poor and cheap in order to show a consequence.Moral themes is most used in dramatic and thriller films, but the issues touched in this film are substantially used them and share a better connection with the audience due to everyday life and reminiscence of them in life any common man. It is not a feminist film, it is not a male chauvinist film, Roth manages to get that balance of genre in order to do not be wrong about taking his project where it should not go.Ana de Armas and Lorena Izzo are fabulous in their roles, however, momentarily, they get rid of the psychology and strange behavior that had. The classification R, they gave to the film is opportune, since, in addition to having strong sexual scenes, profanity and violence, these girls transmit horror, a genre that apparently are not visible, but after seeing the work these two women, the horror reincarnated in the beauty. Reeves also makes a great role here, different than what he has done so far, revealing its full potential with his monologue "free pizza".Technological contributions make much with little, recorded in one house with fascinating interior design, Roth knows how to slide his camera through the corridors and walls full of art and paintings, giving a modern twist to a house of a familiar aura.Last Roth's film- and hopefully it is not the last, really - plays very well exposed moral issues, with photography and cinematography very well executed, but narratively falls short and not in its development, in its empty and simple end.</fullReview>

I should say This film is weird. A loving husband invites two young women in to call for Uber after getting lost in the pouring rain. What follows next is something no self-respecting family man would do and the women make him pay for this action.and Keanu...Keanu is one of my favorite actors and he was OK in this movie. In the beginning it kind of felt like a little Ted came back, but man... towards the end when he was screaming and trying to get away you could tell he was struggling trying to find his acting skills. The plot was strange and yes it was sometimes entertaining and only had a few slow spots. I still love you Keanu!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Alleywood skanking escort agency, providing your friendly neighborhood services. It sends a couple of tramps to the man's house. While the wife is away, he plays, but when it was time to pay up the 200 bucks, he thought, no, it must have been a free ride. So the pimp comes around to collect, blackmailing him extortionately, turning it into a home invasion. The pimp conducts more deals bringing more gangsters descending into quiet suburbia, turning it into chaos and it soon shoots into some other kind of porno, because them cats are just clawing for more revenge. If only, if only it were a horror.No no no. Instead the little cats are supposedly like 15, no, that licensing was 18, they blackmail him for another ride instead of the nick, because he had gotten their kitties wet. It should have been a care face. Instead he drives them back to the streets. Yea, homeless people you can just drop off anywhere. They must have thought, what a soft mark. Later coming back to his unlocked home. Because that is what you do in suburbia, you let all the dog's in. They knock him out, tying him up with tights. By that point I was all about the fast-forward, because of this crap; Does a bear poop in those woods? Bear 200 pounds, versus dog 70 pounds, and it is a one hit wonder. Unless there is weapons, no, it was fork the shoulder. I mean fork in the shoulder, what? Playing their tease games all over again. Ssshhh Keanu has a fetish. They weren't the killing machines bred in the art of combat, disabling pressure points efficiently, and so any Hulk rage would have not even bothered watching this other beeping beep, beep beeping. Much later on some how a gun came out of no where, and he got tied up even more. How? They were like naked, their clothes were off in his dryer, being wet. But that was like the last I paused to actually watched this. Hmm they must have found his stash. Argghhh.

		<shortDescription>The film doesn't makes sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly i didn't like the film, I thought it was poorly written at times and some parts just didn't make sense.For example, how easily two girls are able to overpower a man like Keanu Reeves like in the scene where he breaks free from his ties on the bed and is then stabbed and knocked to the floor by one of the girls armed with a fork... i mean he could easily of just pushed her off and escaped. Or the scene later in the film when she holds a gun to his head from about a meter away, i don't know about you but in a life threatening situation like that i would try i take the gun off her because he knows they want to kill him so what does he have to lose. Oh and he obviously has to trip over when he runs out of the house otherwise it wouldn't be a horror film.Another issue i had was the fact that in the end of the film it is revealed that they never were going to kill him and they just wanted to conduct a social experiment but didn't they already kill that guy Louis i mean they caused him to brake his neck even though they later said that it was all just a hoax or did everyone just forget about that guy.Finally although i didn't really like the film it did make me laugh at the end when he accidentally liked the video i feel like if the film had more dark comedy i would have liked it more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply the best fantasy movie 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie very much, and what more can you expect from a movie. I do not agree at ALL with the other low ratings. The question is simple- What will you do if 2 girls come to you in the middle of the night and fulfill your deepest fantasies. The story is woven beautifully. The acting was perfect mostly from Ana Armas who played her role perfectly. The movie is highly sexual in nature hence children should stay away. But the crazy girls made me laugh out through out the whole movie with their strange behavior. Maybe some king of sexual exploitation in the childhood drove the girls crazy. I want to term this movie as a great SEXOLOGICAL THRILLER.. Recommend watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main character , the loving devoted Evan did a good job in this movie, good actor. I felt sad for him towards the end part, You can kind of feel the frustration like How you just want stab those young girls who seduced him at first. I was hooked to the screen, It kept me interested with what is going to happen next. I liked the ending where the girls finally leave "They never say no." "Your all the same.", A new way to twist things up actually. Wish it didn't end so half anti- climax but it still did it for me. I would off just called the cops on the one side but he is clearly a bit too easy if you know what I mean. So do not expect a hero or the matrix. Like the other person said in the review, Have a sense of humor. I also loved the horror on his face. It's an entertaining movie. There has been worse off movies than this, it deserves better than it got. I can understand why some would say it's just another typical movie but I liked the actresses only because they are good at acting, although the one with the dark hair did a better job than the blonde because The blonde disgusted me a little bit,but it still kept the story interesting. They are psychopaths so I found the job done well, I didn't expect it to turn out this way. Give it a chance. Not for everyone though. Some movies just do it so well to make you think , Is his wife going to believe him. Relate to the frustration.</fullReview>

Sex scenes are nothing that you can't watch on TV nowadays. Horror?

It ends into be a stupid thriller based on some kind of strange semi-moral lessons to be learned. It fails anyhow to be credible because of a really unbelievable bad plot development. It starts quite good and has some succeeded moments in the beginning. This ends really soon and start being really forced and artificial into narration. One wife overwhelmed by artist life rigors and kid's related responsibilities is urged "to the beach" for the weekend, leaving behind a devoted husband, a busy architect and a sexually frustrated 43 years old guy. Some maniacal girls pop up to his door, get invited inside and force him into having sex with. Then they decide to punish the unfaithful husband and presumed pedophile father. This part is really mental, but this is not the worst aspect. It is really not credible. Has nothing in common with real human behavior in the context. The end is hilarious, even more than the strange guy popping in at a point in time just to get killed for some wrongly added "tension". I could watch sometime a bad movie (kind of third category), if it at least deliver the normal dose of assumed absurd. This is a bad movie delivering half dose of stupid happening.

		<shortDescription>One question. Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was ever any doubt that director Eli Roth is a misogynist then Knock Knock absolutely confirms it. His portrayal of woman in his films have been appalling in the past but what we see in this movie is staggering . This is the story of family man Evan Webber ( Keanu Reeves ) , who while his wife and kids are away , has a knock on the door from two young woman looking for help . The turn out to be Evan's worst nightmare. Despite Keanu Reeves typically wooden acting I actually didn't mind the first forty minutes of this. It's only when the girls start to go nuts that film immediately falls apart. The problem is Why? What is the motive of these girls? It's never explained despite a spurious " catch a predator" line ( which makes no sense ) as to why these girls terrorise Webber. Eli Roth not only turns these female characters into nasty , violent , sex machines he also treats the audience like idiots . This is classed as a Horror film but I would describe it as horrible.</fullReview>

I wonder if Nicolas Cage was the star of this film or Keanu Reeves i just hope he gets a golden raspberry nomination for worst actor because he acts like a girly man seriously he is annoying and laughable even tho the girls are crazy and you want to actually kill them they have more talent on their roles than Keanu Reeves has. If you see this film with low expectations and expect to see a dumb film then you're going to love it or maybe not even then and by the way the ending sucks. I give it a 6 because it was a dumb fun film with Keanu Reeves being so horrible he went from 47 Ronin to John Wick to this film getting his ass kicked by a couple of 20 year old chicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plenty of energy, decent production values, but muddled script with murky theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies can increase our awareness and understanding of complex social, political, scientific, historical and other issues or they can misinform and perpetuate misconceptions. Unfortunately, filmmakers often deviate from the dry facts of reality to sensationalize. Pedophilia is a serious issue with profound implications for both public health and law enforcement. Pedophilic disorder has a specific definition among mental health professionals, as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Jurisdictions may define a dozen or more forms of child molestation, depending on the nature and severity of the act and the ages of the perpetrator and victim. Yet people often use the term pedophile as a catchall term to refer to a hebephile, ephebophile, child molester, or other sex offender, even though the psychological and criminal implications may be vastly different. Physical attraction to two sexually mature females played by actresses who are in their mid-twenties has nothing to do with pedophilia, even though the characters may later falsely claim to have been underage. The film does a disservice to its audience by presenting and perpetrating a muddled view of pedophilia and by suggesting it is primarily a form of criminal behavior rather than a psychological disorder with profound psychological implications for the victims and severe criminal consequences. As an example of what Blake Snyder calls a monster in the house film, one expects to learn that Evan (Reeves) committed some act of child molestation. The typical plot for a horror film is that a sinful act unleashes a supernatural force that seeks vengeance against the guilty but spares those who repent. But Evan seems completely innocent and the intruders apparently chose him and their prior victims somewhat randomly, although they apparently monitored his activities closely before choosing him. This weakens the moral of the story. If the film had somehow demonstrated that many ordinary men would be inclined to a sexual liaison with a prepubescent child, it would be an alarming revelation, although not particularly credible. Instead, we are given a muddled cautionary tale about marital infidelity in which a forty-three year-old man succumbs to the deliberate efforts of seduction by two attractive girls who look to be in their mid-twenties, the age of the actresses cast in the roles, but later engage in psychological torture by claiming to be underage, impregnated and experienced in murder. The motives of the two girls are unclear. They seem to have daddy issues and issues with marital infidelity. But it's not clear if they were molested as children or as teenagers or how that relates to their current activities or even how they managed to meet one another and develop their scheme. Considering that their threats to murder Evan are a sham, they seem strangely unconcerned about the accidental death they cause to another character. Despite the muddled story credited to five writers (never a good sign), the production values are solid and the three main performers deliver unabashed and energetic performances. It's a remake of a 1977 exploitation film, which I haven't seen. While the production values are vastly superior to typical 1970s films, the script is a muddled mess. Nice job of trashing the house, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel like there is a certain line that you just don't cross but this movie crosses it anyways. Eli Roth is known to make some controversial stuff. You could say that might even be part of his genius. However, this was just too much. I enjoyed Cabin Fever, I enjoyed Hemlock Grove, and I knew they weren't meant to be taken seriously. I didn't get that feeling with Knock Knock. I couldn't wait for the movie to be over. Keanu Reeves is a terrific actor. We can't really hate on him for this movie turning out the way it did. My problem isn't with the acting or the story. If anything I thought both were really good. That doesn't take away from the fact that this movie made me feel extremely uncomfortable. I felt terrible after watching it. Thats not why we watch movies is it? A movie is supposed to make you feel excited and have fun. I mean, come on. There were some things in this movie that could have been left out or done differently. My problem is that this movie is nothing but pure evil. I think it's disgusting. If you scroll down to the soundtrack there is a song called "talking to the devil" performed by Sorcery. If Hollywood really wants to be that demonic I guess this is where I start to tune out as a viewer. I might not ever look at an Eli Roth project the same again. Is he in the movie making business or the devil worshiping business? Because im really upset about what I saw here. My 5/10 rating only goes to the art form of telling a story and the acting that went into it. This doesn't excuse the evil behind Knock Knock at all. If you haven't watched it yet please stay far away from it. Im gonna have to spend next Sunday in church after seeing this film. Totally disgusting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I say confusingly god because after watching this movie, I could not tell if the movie was a passable thriller or was just completely god awful. Which I guess could be argued that this is the mark of a god movie because it stays with you for a little bit. Let me get one thing straight however, this is not a good movie. The script is very juvenile at best and downright horrible at worst. There is very little, if any, character development that makes us want to feel something for the characters. We have two attractive women who seduce a devoted father and then torture him because he let them. Yes. That is the entire plot. But there are some true saving graces with this film in it's acting. Say what you will about Keanu Reeves as an actor, this may have been one of his best performances hes given in a long time, only because he is real and gives an honest performance of a man who has been taken hostage in his own home by women who are slightly insane. Director Eli Roth makes use of long takes which is refreshing to see in a medium that has become known for shorter and shorter takes. And the two actresses, Lorenza Izzo and Ana De Armas, do a decent job with the characters they are given. Again, this is not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but if you look at it from a purely acting standpoint, Knock Knock can be given a little slack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will give this movie one huge kudos?no spoilers, but the LIKE in the ending made me crack up to the point I was finally enjoying this viewing.In the end. Took that long.But, to start from the beginning, let's imagine a world where entire neighborhoods are on holiday for?the Father's Day weekend. I had absolutely no idea that stalkers who focused on one family man were lucky enough to have an isolated target in the middle of a grand suburb. I'm getting ahead of myself. Whatever redemption Keanu Reeves, one of the worst actors in the history of cinema, created for himself in the awesome John Wick-flick was wasted here. At least, he knew how to backtrack to what made him famous.It's the story of two increasingly annoying party girls who, ah-hem, knock-knock on this father's house one father's day weekend when he's alone. This leads to that, that leads to a fatal attraction. I know the girls are supposed to be pretty and willing, but damn, they are annoying as fvck from minute one. We've seen all this before, but this time they never convinced that he was a bad man that cheats on his wife with these two valley tramps. Personally, I wouldn't have answered the door in the first place. This would be the simplest "How This Should've Ended" video. But, because this dad's a moron, he continuously allows these scummy chicks to dominate and torture him. I'm assuming at some point, lost-along-the-way-filmmaker Eli Roth, wants us to side with the Satan Spawn Sluts and say he's a bad man for cheating. Nope. They're simply one step below Eve and any rational wife would've forgiven him long before she takes a knife to their throats.I was hoping this movie wouldn't have made me mad (with all the choices the dad makes and I wouldn't have made one of them,) but damn, it was so irritating on how many plot holes this had and how many better decisions could've been made. Not to mention, the terribly obvious foreshadowing and that Reeves did one of his worst performances to date immediately after his strong action film, John Wick. Tisk.Don't get me wrong, I like sex, as well, but I'm more suspicious and weary of my partners than someone that accepts it from two idiots that "happen to come in from the rain."Director Eli Roth, whatever you had before this and the equally terrible and preceding The Green Inferno?it's gone.

		<fullReview>I do not understand how Keanu could even associate his name with such 'an insult to our intelligence' enterprise, not to mention the fact he is 'starring' in it. Let aside Raspberry Awards, a special price 'Dumb and Dumber' should have been especially invented for this exploit (my hand will fall off if I write 'movie'). I gave it a 3, as I was laughing with tears while the fading shadow of Matrix was fighting with all his stamina to avoid being raped... This is a lesson for all men wanting to either preserve their chastity, or remaining faithful to their loved ones - to walk on the opposite side when encountering sexy girls heading in groups larger than 1 (one)! Or, for Keanu's credit, the actual rape scenes were the 20th take, assuming the Director was not pleased with previous takes; the poor lad was exhausted by shooting the same scenes over and over, so he finally gave up and succumbed to Eros... I could better live with a retinal image of a tired actor giving in to pleasure, than being overcome by two horny teens. All in all, I suggest to poor Keanu to undertake face modification surgery, if he wants to avoid his (remaining) fans (of any gender!) chasing him relentlessly upon eye contact...or obtain a restraining order against humanity for a min. 50 cm, a safe distance for any sex tool or organ! The 2 girls - they did their job properly, so now - after this... 'film', they can find their glory in less promiscuity indulging strip-joints or massage parlors. Finally, the screenwriter must be paying a hefty bill to his shrink, as such sex obsessions take long to heal - let us all encourage him to write a sequel, in which - after Keanu would take fence painting lessons as in Karate Kid 101, he indomitably holds the line against evil, men fluids thirsty nymphos - until police arrives and saves his (mental) virginity! Shame on you, Mr. Von Trier! This is how you do an art movie, not your recent years tribulations. Shame on us the petty viewers, for not being able to comprehend such a capo d'opera!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another flick that sets in an isolated place with the limited cast. A low budget film, which was a remake of the 'Death Game'. After playing a strong character in his previous film, Keanu Reeves is back exactly opposite to that one. Yep, remember what happened to the two men who break-in into his house in 'John Wick', but here it is like what if he's not able to handle them or to do anything about it kind of Circumstance.He played a normal family guy, a father of two children with a beautiful wife and a big house. The trailer itself revealed half of what the movie's. But the rest of the film is not bad at all, and that does not count as I'm praising it. The movie was average because of the writing was too loose. Not only predictable, but aimlessly moved and the motives were never explained. So the mystery remains mystery.It was one of those films that leaves behind us to suspect the possibilities. A broad open for a sequel, but likely there's very less chance for another film. The girls were so good looking and performed well. The theme aimed for erotic-crime-thriller, but did it achieved? I don't know, the original was released in the 70s, which might have been too sexy for that time, but in the present world, it is not that special or effective, just like 'I Spit on Your Grave'. You could watch it to enjoy your moment, but it would be a cinematically impressive with the great writings, actings, with twists and turns and all.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard Candy, but an out there, strange, and different candy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knock Knock is a film that truly had, "Are you f..king kidding me moments?." On the whole, I was expecting a much bigger picture, as in terms of plot. I saw much wanted to know, why these two sexy honeys were terrorizing our poor. overacting thespian, Keanu, where always towards the end, I wanted to smash the screen. For part we believe, while those girls are theatrically playing their torture game show, for Keanu, a much an unwilling participant, is to do with Evan's (Keanu) predatory acts of past, that he is a pedophile, and this movie starts to become a another Hard Candy, amped up with vengeance, where it looks like they've even borrowed the same house, from that 2006 movie. But that motive was quashed. The reason is simply, they are two hot psycho bi..hes who just want to get off, where in one mind, after seeing this, I thought, well, hey that's different, where the other I was kind of disappointed as in that shot down motive. Regardless, Roth manages to still induce a nasty aura of moments, into the scenes, by camera work, or what's happening, in the story itself, which we know is true Roth. Honestly though, he puts too much into it, with sudden, impulsive touches, where he's trying too hard, but that's how our likable over enthusiastic director is. Don't forget, he gave us that wonderful horror shocker masterpiece, Hostel. Reeve's acting truly has laughable moments, and there's a few, where now I can really see why he sucks as an actor, while also being voted worst actor, in the top ten, but the character is there though. He just doesn't show a range of emotions to it, like he should, or isn't very changeable, when seeing him in a few other flicks, as though he's winging it. A corpulent Colleen Camp, also overacting, appears briefly, playing a friend of the wife's, providing just another laughable "are you kidding moment?". Again ref: Hard Candy, neighbor scene. The girls are hot (especially Belle) and funny too sometimes. Take Knock Knock for what it is, certainly something different, but also quite a stupid movie to behold. Sorry Eli.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>clearly biased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea is good and the performance of Keanu Reeves is reasonable, but the message that the film makes is purely unfounded, as if the fact of the protagonist have succumbed to the seductions of the girls even after high strength, justify all torture, sexual abuse and games subsequent psychotic made by them. It was expected that there would be punishment for them, which did not happen. I believe that if we reverse sex of the participants, that is, if they were two men sexually abusing and torturing a number of ways a woman and leave unscathed, the film not be displayed due to the protests of the "feminist", which clearly makes it biased. Sometimes it's nice to see a movie without a happy ending, but it certainly should not be the case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining in a sick and twisted way!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't get the negative reviews that movie has received. I mean for the past 2 years there has not been one horror movie half as good as this one. If you like Eli Roth and his way of directing you will like this movie. He brilliantly displays the characters of 2 very dangerous girls and their sick games. The plot is good and the suspense is built up from the beginning. It's very different in the way that it depicts two pretty females as perpetrators, which makes it unique. Keanu plays good, but really all credit should go to the girls, especially to Ana DE Armas. Some parts of the movie were ridiculous, but all in all it delivered. It all really comes down to what you are looking for. If you are looking for a entertaining movie with 2 hot females as perpetrators and their cat and mouse play, you will love it. If you are looking for a Lars Von Trier drama movie, you will not like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I don't believe that people just meet randomly." Evan Webber (Reeves) has just said goodbye to his wife and kids as they leave for the weekend, allowing Evan to finally get some writing done. That night two women knock on his door in the rain and ask for his help. What starts off as a gesture of good faith soon takes a turn and Evan does something he shouldn't have. Now the women won't leave, and Evan is forced to atone for his sins. There have been a ton of home invasion movies like this one, usually the same thing happens in all of them. This one is different, in a good way. Part Fatal Attraction, part Hard Candy, and all tense and creepy. The most disturbing part of this movie is that it isn't that unbelievable. Nothing is really over the top or cheesy?until the end. This is more psychological than straight horror, but the pacing and the events really work well together and I found myself really enjoying this movie quite a bit. Keanu Reeves' acting leaves a lot to be desired (as usual) and is actually unintentionally comical but I recommend this and liked it much more than I expected to. Overall, tense and pretty believable, which added to the suspense. I give this a B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>not a massive fan of Keanu but loved John Wick. So as i liked Hostel too, i'd thought i'd give this a go. Big mistake. Is this some Eli Roth fantasy or personal experience. Idea is there, but the execution is appalling. Keanu taken down by a girl with a fork. Need I say more. Keanu, what possessed you to sign onto this? Unless that was a genuine 3some, then I get it. Stick to John Wick and focus on the sequel to your version of the rampage/revenge gender that is Taken.Eli, what were you thinking? Where was the disturbing, close your eyes, gore seen last in Hostel. So many missed opportunities. What a let down all round. I actually switched it off 3/4 of the way through, because it was so bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's almost impossible to write a review without spoilers, since there is so little content and the mistakes are so obvious it would be a crime to not mention them here. But I'll try.Keanu Reeves is a loyal family man, who is tricked into cheating with two women. What begins as a one-time mistake, ends up in a lethal cat- and-mouse game as the girls turn out to have a crazy agenda.There. That's the story. Unfortunately the huge gaps are filled with: mistakes, lazy writing and absolutely terrible (over)acting. The ending is illogical and won't leave you satisfied.The only ratings over 3 or 4 are from people who enjoyed the few nude scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outrageous Ordeal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knock Knock is Eli Roth's second movie this year and we see that the craft has been better compared to the other one and he is handling the erotic thriller territory than just another torture porn refuses to be an exploitation film. And to be honest, this turn is far more interesting. The film builds an atmosphere and lets the audience dive into it. The self-aware humor works better as well. And then it eventually gets obnoxious, I believe that's the entire point of it, but what kills it when it's trying to say something directly important, except it's not wise enough earn that sentiment. It's still reasonable that it catches your attention from beginning to end, but the final note is not as strong as it hoped to be.The film opens showing us that the main character has a happy family and eventually it will all fall apart once the two girls enter the picture. But how these psychos tear this guy's life down has an entertaining slow burn. Regarding this as a hospitality went wrong, how these two girls win Evan (Keanu Reeves) over is not just some typical seduction. They interact with him like he is being demeaned into mid-life crisis. Right after he gives in, it's fully revealed the two girls are downright psychopaths and they're clever enough to give Evan a serious excuse to not arrest them. It's an intense conflict, not by physical torture, but by wrecking one's own dignity. And it gets out of hand until the two girls become too obnoxious rather than dangerous. While that's the movie's sense of humor, it also messes with its potent themes. This is mostly concerned on the ending, which could have been powerfully uneasy when it stops there, but the film wants a final punchline which foolishly leads itself to a safer direction.The direction knows how to manifest a very, very atmosphere, even if the conflict are just insane hot girls, it doesn't always become predictable. And the acting is just priceless, this movie gives people a reason why to love Keanu Reeves even more. This is a role where he finally gives in, by broadening the single insane moment he had in John Wick to the entire haunting experience he had in this one. He comes close to Nicolas Cage's The Wicker Man performance, except in this context, it seems more appropriate and just equally enjoyable. Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas are ultimately campy enough as some of the most outrageous characters you'll ever see.Knock Knock is probably the most entertaining of Eli Roth's oeuvre. Sure, it doesn't contain the amount of violence and gore he is known for, but in this unlikely turn, I think this movie has more intriguing and really outrageous choices to bring shock value. Then again, the final punchline just kills the momentum, underwhelming what you're already experiencing. Besides, it's starting to get annoying once it gets too far, and there isn't really much about it in the end. Keanu Reeves's total madness is kind of magical to witness, but the movie itself is just designed to have fun until it finally get on your nerves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My quick rating - 5,4/10. When two attractive young girls show up at your door in a torrential downpour, "What do you do?" OK, so I couldn't resist using the quote since Keanu Reeves is the main character faced with this dilemma. Of course, the ditzy girls are borderline nymphos so the temptation is there for our "victim" (term used very loosely). After the obvious happens, the girls played fairly well the batsh!t insane part, move forward in torturing him. And at the point, the movie ends. There is no movement forward or plot beyond that really. I did find some of this amusing but also there is way too much entire stupidity in this film up until the very end leaving anyone wondering "how?" It was of course a quality production thanks to Eli Roth directing (not his typical flick, but OK)so points are there but the story itself just wasn't. Nice late night cable flick, not much else.</fullReview>

And here I mean, they had a story line, which was bad. They had a good actor, which I didn't think could do bad acting, which he did (probably because of the script, but just refuse the roll then). And overall... If I was a sponsor, I would ask my money back. It was just that bad. As a viewer... dude... I would ask money back AND refund for my time wasted...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad acting. Even worse sculptures.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't want to bash this film although I gave it only 2 stars.I found this film rather revealing. It belongs to a very special movie category. It's a kind of movie which exposes an actor to his dedicated fans, it just shows everybody what a terrible actor he is.It also exposes the great job all the directors did to hide this terrible actor. If it wasn't for them, Keeanu would have probably ended up playing records on weddings and taverns. His performance is as stiff as a 2 weeks old roadkill covered in cement and thrown to the ocean.Furthermore, as far as the "female" actors in this movie are concerned, I can't really say anything about them except that they were just being themselves. Absolutely no acting there at all. Can't say if that's good or bad. It's a really weird idea to hire non actors and pay them to be bad actors. That's how the women felt like to me from start to finish.The script was taken off the wall of a public toilet, thank God we didn't endure that public toilet odor as we did with it's spoken words.This movie is a disgrace even to the old slasher movies which also featured boobs and sex, for the obvious reasons. Couldn't they just show us the boobs and spare us the rest of this terrible film ?The impact this film had on me is like someone farts in your car and you can't open the windows. You can't escape it, you think it's horrible and yet it doesn't kill you. That sums it up for this one.NEXT !!</fullReview>

It might have probably been a good movie if Keanu Reeves was able to escape from those two girls and could kill them or at least take them to the police or something. I mean come on, he could have attacked the girl when he was released, they could have had a fight over a gun, since he's a man he could have probably win, but he chose to run away. Also he could have tackled the girls from behind when the dog was distracting them, he already had a knife and a pan. It just annoys me that this movie has potential but it looks like the ending was written by an amateur writer who doesn't know anything about plot twists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Jew Bear makes a half soft porn, half eh... not really horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knock Knock. Who's there? The Jew Bear. Jew Bear who? Eli Roth, a director who only cranked out 2 movies (Hostel Part 2 &amp; The Green Inferno) in the last 8 years. So he had plenty of time to think about the script for this movie which he wrote and directed. Turns out the plot is a rather simple one: A fancy architect (Keanu) stays alone in the house to work for the weekend while the wife's away with the kids. On a very rainy night 2 steaming hot girls ring his doorbell (well actually they knock coz otherwise the title wouldn't make much sense innit). He invites them inside where they need to take off their wet clothes and put them in the dryer... If you're reading this and you're thinking to yourself: this seems like the plot of a cheap soft-porn film you're actually partially right. The first 30 mins Keanu tries to stay loyal to his wife while the girls try to get into his pants and eventually he buckles and has a threesome. But as this is a Eli Roth film all hell breaks loose after that. So here the rub: the 'all hell breaking loose' part is very well done. You'll wanna kill these bitches yourself as you'll feel as powerless and frustrated as poor Keanu. So a job well done there Eli. But...all the while you're watching the film you're thinking it's gonna lead up to something but it simply does not and in that sense it's somewhat of a letdown. The film get's a rather unjust low score on IMDb probably because of this. However if you're an Eli Roth fan or you like these rather intense films I would recommend it but maybe this film is not everyone's cup of tea. I found it a good watch and suggest you check it out.</fullReview>

So wrong!When a director is bad, the actors are bad as well. Reeves' acting was terrible, he looked like an amateur porn actor.The plot leads you to Nowhereland. It's predictable and simple, but, as always, Roth tries to force art into a film, which makes it look cheesy and clingy. The lines, along with the acting are just cheap.The music selection it's quite good, but they ruined it at the end, by using (once again) "Where is my mind" by Pixies... There're so many songs, and they chose a song which it's played in so many movies? ... Couldn't they use another song? Liiiike "Innuendo" by Queen? It could fit much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailers, I was tricked into thinking this might be similar to Trespass with Cage and Kidman. The plot twist and characters were one-dimensional and lacking, in fact there was none. The obvious plot of having two females knocking on your door late at night, wet, and it just happens that your wife is out of town, wouldn't raise a red flag but got a raise out of Keanu's pants, was laughable. Watching him go through the awkward motions of seemingly playing the good samaritan allowing strangers into his house was pretentious as well as disappointing. Not all men would be so stupid, but then again, Eli Roth doesn't think so. I was hoping it might turn into female version of A Clockwork Orange, but I was again disappointed. I was hoping there would be some blackmail twist or a Karma payback, but disappointed again. I saw the Death Game with Locke and Camp back in 1977, and remembered I hated that film too, but at least Locke and Camp were more believable. This film focuses on the husband (Reeves) and not enough on his assailants, when "daddy had a party."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Knock Knock overstays its welcome with repetitive plot and silly antics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of John Wick I was interested to see next Keanu Reeves' movie. I believe Knock Knock can now be certified a disappointment, a sentiment shared by many others. It's a juvenile attempt at thriller that goes literally nowhere. This is not a thought-provoking drama, far from it, it's a shallow use of home invasion theme and despite having attractive actors performing clandestine meetings, it looks so bland and boring.Evan (Keanu Reeves) is a loyal husband, who is also home alone at weekend. Two beautiful ladies come knocking for help, and eventually they seduce him. This is basically the entirety of the movie. It wants to be charming or seductive, yet it ends up insipid. Certainly there's no dangerous game of wit here, even if the two shady ladies are meant to be flirtatiously menacing.The premise could have worked for a brief period of time, and admittedly the characters look the part, but it rehearsed the same angle until the end of movie. Keanu Reeves looks confusing throughout the movie, he's just baffled like Mark Wahlberg on The Happening. There's no depth on his emotions, and this is a clear miscast. There might be some thrill, a little hope that he would break free in a clever way, although even this aspect is overly streamlined.Knock Knock is ironically a timid drama, and it overstays its welcome with repetitive plot and silly antics. This is the ridiculous version of Wild Things without the wit and charm.</fullReview>

What on Earth were they thinking writing this movie, and how did they get Keanu Reeves to start in it?! I've never felt so angry watching a movie before this one. It made me want to physically punch something. Everybody who is involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves. The script is childish, the 2 girls are even more so. The acting is abhorrent at best. Stay away, far far away! If I was Eli Roth, I would feel completely ashamed of myself for this nonsense. I don't get it. Is it supposed to be a revenge film? Some sort of twisted domination film? What? What's the point of it at all. Two young girls trap a guy into having sex and then destroy his life for no reason. Then at the end of the movie they walk away heroins??? It's a joke and a farce.</fullReview>

I have no time to watch movie often and the feeling i get after watch this movie i got total ripped off by that low grade movie. Strongly recommend not to watch this movie. Craziest ever. How come two strong guys cannot be able to control two crazy bitches. I wish i could rate -10 for this movie. Will remember this director and never to watch any of his movie again. Cheap, low grade, very inappropriate for minors, waste of time watching this, craziest plot. This kind of movie should never ever come to market. I am very surprised this movie still hold 5 point rating out of ten. What it deserves is -10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>0/10 for a sick absurd movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know people who made IMDb account just to rate this movie 1/10. A sick movie which wasted so much money and time for the fantasies and sick view of the writer and director over life and people. It is a shame there are so many good writers which are lonely and poor and some rich sick people who has money and relations make these kind of absurd movies. (Spoilers alert!-although it has no plot to be spoiled but whatever)It has no plots, typical crazy person who suffered when they were child tried to revenge from others, typical don't trust anyone, typical crazy killers who enjoys the suffering of others, an anti-art movie which can be categorized as garbage-anti-art-anti-drama! I saw this movie because I'm a fan of Keanu Reeves, but he disappointed me so much, I lost all my respect for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoying, uninteresting, and poorly acted, Eli loses further points as a director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The joke among horror and film buffs is that Eli Roth is not a great film maker. Not having seen many of his movies, we could never really attest to that fact. If Knock Knock is any indication of his talents as a writer or director then we might have to believe the naysayers.Keanu Reeves plays Evan, a loving and caring husband who is left alone for a long weekend to work while his wife and two children take a mini-holiday away. Two women knock on his door in the middle of the night, they are lost and soaking wet and need help. Ever the kind man, he lets them into his home, but what was initially a good- natured action turns into a game of dangerous seduction.There really is no way to put this nicely, so I will put it bluntly: Knock Knock is a poor movie, even a bad one. It seems however that most of the responsibility for the substandard execution should fall on the director's shoulders.Right off the bat, the acting in Knock Knock is awkwardly bad. The dialogue is drawn out in an unnatural manner for real conversation, and the interactions are pointless. Almost any subject our key players talk about could easily be interchanged for something else with no repercussion on the remainder of the film. With no merit to the dialogue, there is no hope for the characters or narrative to feel like it is evolving, and that is bad writing. This is clear by Evan's two female tormentors coming across more as annoying brats than twisted sociopaths.Sometimes slow pacing works in a film, because it builds tension and sets a longstanding tone for the film, creating a mood that captivates the audience. Knock Knock is not that type of film, and while slow, it completely misses the mark in creating anything, let alone tension. This film could have been some creepy horror version of Wild Things or even a version of Hard Candy, instead it is nothing of merit.This whole review may sound harsh, but considering I went into this film open minded and completely without expectation and had such an adverse reaction to it, I think it is justified. Knock Knock is goofy, no scary and the only time I had any reaction to the film was with Louis's line "Bitch, I am from Oakland."Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not even know where to begin with this one. I hated, hated, hated, hated this movie. They should have used someone other than Keanu for his part, because at least then I could just forget I ever saw this mess. I never write reviews, just too lazy, but I am so irritated right now and just want to let off some steam. The movie looks good, no problems there, but the storyline is just awful. I did sit through the whole thing and now I do NEED a revenge sequel. It would only be fair. Did I mention I hate this movie??? I can sit through a lot of horrible movies, but I'd rather see a movie that is just bad because it lacks budget than seeing a movie that infuriates me because of other things. I hate the girls. I just seriously hate them. I hate them so much, I never want to see them in any other movie ever again. This movie is in serious need of a very fast horrifying over the top revenge sequel. Even if only to calm me down.....</fullReview>

I was seeing the rates here before i went to the cinema and made a wrong decision to watch 'knock knock' than 'the witch hunter', the rates for knock knock was higher than the witch hunter and the description of the movie sounds interesting, so i was more determined to watched it.

Keanu Reeves is an excellent actor and he proved it again and again in every movie he does and this film he shows his incredible acting abilities .the other actors are not really famous but they did a pretty good job.. I read the reviews here and i'm really surprised. It's a brilliant movie. i found the screenplay very fascinating. also the dynamics between the actors is really good and you just feel sucked in easily. This is an horror story film but its almost without blood, its very psychologically attractive and easy to relate to.9/10 because i didn't enjoy the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I sat down to watch this awful film, I checked the reviews and stupidly I ignored them!The acting is good considering it's Keanu Reeves...the two girls did a good job however there is no development in terms of character. This is not a horror or even scary, the film spoon-feeds you the whole way through. The girls Bell &amp; Genesyis do not even have a good motive for what they do there is no back-story to them, Quite simply they are two incredibly beautiful girls who are totally F***ING BOONKERS!!The ending of the film basically leaves you feeling sorry Even(Reeves) as his life is completely obliterated, he may as well commit suicide because the is no way he will ever recover from this expirence:He's been framed for murder of an irrelivent character called Louis. All this friends &amp; family have seen a video of him having sex with Bell Dressed his own daughters school girl outfit, whilst she calls him daddy!(insert Vomit face here).His home is trashed his wife(Karen) art is trashed and the crazy girls stole the family pet.In summary this movie is waste of roughly 2 hours, avoid at all costs! if there was some backstory, motive and some actual horror this movie could just about be bearable to watch p.s Keanu needs a haircut he looks like an old homeless Bieber! - No Seriously!, he really does</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am convinced that Keanu Reeves must have been held hostage to not only act in this film but to Executive Produce. Perhaps Eli Roth and his young wife (annoying chick with dark hair) drugged poor Keanu to this garbage. He must have also been drugged to give the worst performance of his career. Who the heck are the people in this film? They are all the worst actors I have ever scene and all appear to be related somehow. (Even the Uber driver is in all the same films as one of the crazy girls)I would be incredibly embarrassed if I were Keanu to have had any part of this trash. I would spend all of my money trying to get this offline immediately.Do yourself a favor, if you like Keanu DO NOT WATCH this. It will forever scar you.</fullReview>

Could not watch it for more than 20 minutes.Awful lines, awful acting, awful 100%. In 20 minutes I have not seen a decent line or a decent performance. Keanu is awful in this movie. Don't know why to accept acting in this movie. Only reasonable explanation would be that he have not read the script. Or the lines. Ever.Do not waste your time with Knock Knock (better said ''Knock Out'' for Keanu fans).Matrix is one of my all times favorite movie. Keanu was one of my favorite actors thanks to Matrix. Now he erased all that. And joined Nicolas Cage on their way to mediocrity. I understand you have to earn money to sustain your way of life, but, do it in a way that you don't embarrass yourself forever.Awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware of the girl scouts!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's be honest, shall we? Most of us are regular movie theater goers. We love movies; good acting; we go to a place where we can have a good time, we can indulge ourselves with what I call "movie theater food", which is not even fast food. The company, we try to stay away from reality, it is good for us to "travel to places and meet with people", and most of us have the dream of maybe someday write a script or even a book that can become something good. However, if you do that, I totally doubt someone related to the movie industry will ever read your stuff if it is not delivered from somebody with influence in the industry. OK, my point is many of us saw Keanu Reeves -- trailer, magazine, news or even the sign as you were heading to buy your ticket and we gave it a chance. Totally waste of time and money! Any big fan of movies is capable of writing something better than this movie. I can make a better story on the screen in 2 or 3 hours. I am very disappointed with the producers. Maybe something went wrong and they had to finish it anyway. The scenario of the movie invites you to a good story that never happens and as the movie gets to its end, you realize it is what it is: totally nonsense! So, maybe there will be a sequel: Bad girl scouts or something like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reeves hits rock bottom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie about a married father(Reeves) being left alone for the weekend. Two girls unexpectedly turn up on his doorstep on a rainy night and they are invited inside. While waiting for their ride to turn up, the girls quickly seduce him. They then go on to become more trouble than they were worth and it seems he is unable to get rid of them.Right from the start it looked and sounded B grade, the kids were wooden and the direction and dialogue was very badly staged, we didn't see much of the family except for the first few minutes, as they were just used to try and set the scene of a typical happy upper middle class family. It all felt very weak and transparent, even Reeves playfulness with his kids was bizarre, then he continued his moronic monster act, playfully begging for sex with his wife, who was a successful, but actually quite horrible sculptural artist.The overall acting by Reeves was really terrible, I lost count the amount of times he pathetically wailed "Please, Please I love my family" and would start sobbing. Many times during the film he has a chance to retaliate or escape and failed miserably, it was painful to watch, not exactly suspenseful, more like ridiculous. The Matrix is one of my all time fav movies, and it was clearly a great movie whomever played the role of Neo, cause he really struggled to be convincing. the girls were attractive, and both believable as sexual hustlers praying on older men, but when they turned on him, it lost a lot of credibility, became even more ridiculous with stupid Jeopardy type games with Reeves tied up in a hair, trashing the kitchen like 3 year olds. The whole point of the movie was a payback for something that had never really existed in the first place, he was a pedo, then he wasn't a pedo?. The movie plot lines really had basis for their actions except to prove that men won't say 'no' to rape, from 2 attractive, young, sex crazed women...doubt that anyone was surprised with that outcome. 1 star for the Spanish pop song, 1 star for the funny phone call to the wife, 1 for Reeves role in 'Parenthood' that still lingers with me, great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Knock Knock Proves Eli Roth Should Give it Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the 'original' film Knock Knock is a remake of, 'Death Game', so I can't do a 1:1 comparison but after Eli Roth's film I'm not even sure I want to give it a look for fear that it is as dreadfully and mindbogglingly bad.Knock Knock is the story of family man Evan, played with typical woodenness by Keanu Reeves, who invites a duo of rain soaked hotties into his home to wait for a cab and winds up having sex with them and ultimately becoming their prisoner.Once the setup has been established, we endear a procession of obnoxious behavior from his captors and some seriously milquetoast psychological and physical torture. While Roth enjoys a somewhat misplaced reputation as a goremeister, Knock Knock's assault on Reeve's 'victim' probably wouldn't even stir the squeamish.Probably the most effective portions of the film come in the first act, and there it is the 'uncomfortable' social awkwardness of Reeves as his interaction with the girls becomes progressively more sexual that registers the loudest. Not exactly the stuff of horror.The 'plot', if you want to call it that, has pretty much already been blown here with the two breaks already described. There is an ending, of course, and it could have been more effective had Roth succeeded in producing some actual suspense, but as it stands it delivers as just as much of a ripoff as the rest of the film.Knock Knock is firmly situated in the 'Home Invasion' sub-genre of horror and honestly it's a lot more embarrassing of movie when held in the same company as Ils, The Strangers, or You're Next to name a few.Remember when Eli Roth was the savior of horror? Those days are long gone now. With Knock Knock and his other recent release Green Inferno Roth has shown that he can't produce scares, he can't produce atmosphere, can't produce suspense, and can't produce story. Even though his earlier films succeeded in some of these columns, that success was not sufficient to elevate him from being a 'promising' talent; Knock Knock proves that this evaluation seriously overestimated Roth's potential.</fullReview>

The trailer promised some intrigue and maybe a different type of movie, (which we all know is much needed these days). I am a "somewhat" fan of Keanu Reeves so I was willing to take a chance but, like all of his latest movies, his parts to play are questionable and I don't know whether to blame his acting or the writers for the crap he's been involved in. This one, by far, is the worst. So many unrealistic situations where any 110 lb nerd could defend himself but Keanu just can't muster the testosterone to get it done. Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed of the product they put out to torture us with. The ending was especially bad. So bad, I momentarily hoped for a sequel just for some closure but quickly disregarded that particular thought and I just hope I can forget I wasted my time watching this. Stay away.

		<fullReview>Keanu Reeves has only one character depth so asking him to play something outside of that was pretty desperate. His doting father was way over the top and most kids would have run from him screaming 'my father is a dork'. In fact, the best actors in this whole movie were the two kids and the dog.Keanu really needs to stick to his monosyllabic roles such as John Wick, John Constantine and Neo. As soon as he tries to stretch his repertoire of characters, it comes off as really false.As to the story, what a pile of steaming dog poo. The direction was awful, the acting terrible and the storyline stunk to high heaven. The only saving thing in the whole movie was that Reeves ended up buried up to his neck in dirt, a situation that he should get used to if he signs up for any more garbage like this.Finally, just what did these two stupid girls think was going to happen once they did all this damage? Did they really think that they would get away with it? That is perhaps the single most stupid thing about the whole movie. There is no reason for their actions and there is simply no way that they would get away with it. Did they think that the film of them shagging would stop someone pursuing a prosecution, hell, it is evidence not a deterrent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If "Knock Knock" is supposed to be a horror film, it did not do a good job. I was not scared one single time, if anything I was rather horrified by the pointlessly evil actions. It did not provide any storyline as to explain any reasons why this was going on. Instead of spending one and a half hours watching a moderately scary horror film, I spent one and a half hours watching a film with no intentions but to show cruelty. The film started off in somewhat of a cute manner, preceded by being annoyingly immoral and then turned into a frenzy of just plain animalistic cruelty. "Knock Knock" did not pull on any of the strings I would have liked it too when watching a horror film. If you want to feel miserable, this is just the film you want to watch.

He has declined somewhat in this crap fest. Secondly, I know its a movie but how dumb do you have to be to let these 2 "semi-hot" girls in and the lies that they spouted off, he had to be the dumbest main character I have ever seen. Not sure about some of you but if I had some stranger in my house (which I wouldn't), I wouldn't have to move chairs three times to have a conversation. That would have been when I made them leave, clothes or in robes. Actually, I don't think they would have taken their clothes off and went through all the array of BS that they did. My husband and I sat and watched this, we kept saying "Can someone be that stupid?" This in turn, made the movie completely unbelievable. This movie would have been a thousand times better if I don't know maybe he had gotten to punch one of them in the crotch. You will be highly upset at the end. I won't give it away. Its terrible,watch something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knock Knock follows Evan Webber, a devoted husband and father who is left home alone for the weekend when suddenly two stranded young women unexpectedly knock on his door for help. Which starts out as a kindly gesture results in a dangerous seduction and a deadly game of cat and mouse.That's it, you reading that description basically implies that you've just seen the film because that IS ALL that happens. This would have to be one of the most disappointing films of the year, I mean, I was so mad how it ended up being. The plot NEVER develops, no twist or surprise ending, it's just two woman harassing Keanu Reeves the whole time with no explanation why, just for fun, I guess?Speaking of Keanu Reeves, his character felt pretty unnatural and very predictable consuming the fact that he always failed at every scenario in the film, I wanted to root for him but it became pretty tiresome after a while since everything he thought of got butchered down by the girls. Lorenza Izzo &amp; Ana de Armas weren't bad but they weren't great either, it's just everything they did felt unbelievable.Everything the girls did felt forced, from how they try to seduce Keanu to how they present their mental instability just felt so hard to take seriously. Even when they won every scenario in the film became a bit silly after a while because every time Keanu had the upper hand, a unbearable cliché would happen like him tripping over something so the girls had a chance to catch him.The film didn't give a lot of sufficient tension or horror to keep me at the edge of my seat but just left me checking the time every ten minutes or so. The ending I even found very cringeworthy, it ends on a joke of something mentioned earlier in the film that comes off very embarrassing than anything. Being a fan of Cabin Fever &amp; Hostel, this was a huge disappointment from Eli Roth, I just hope he has enough steam left in him to make something more edgy, witty and original in the future.Knock Knock would have to be one of the worst films of the year so far, it had potential of being a thrilling home invasion film but it ended up being something very silly in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Eli Roth Film :(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where should i even begin with this review. I swear there is so much to say about this film and Roth's films in general. The film begins with an establishing shot of a beautiful home, the only character in this film that Roth choose to give development or depth to. From there we view Our main protagonist and his family. Cozy, loving idyllic, a happy family. And from there are movie begins... We are introduced to the femme fatals. Our antagonists. Or are they simply are voice of reason... The films conscious. This is the way Roth presents it... He allows us to view and justly decide if our protagonists is guilty or deserving of the torture he endures throughout the film. As someone who really does not care much for Eli Roth or his films... I feel i am being a little harsh with my rating. If you are a fan of his work and style of writing then you will have a much better time with this film than i did. My problems with Roth lie in storytelling. Visually he can create and guide us through an eerie hallway or cannibalistic rain forest. But when it comes to character development or dialogue he fails utterly in that department. Overall, Knock, Knock was a film i was eager to see after first glance of the trailer... Now its a movie i'm eagerly trying to forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Knock Knock not a good role for Keanu Reeves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that actors at times like to work different roles into their portfolio, but this was not one for the famous Superhero we have all come to love in the Matrix,the bad ass FBI agent in Point Break, or the retired hit-man from John Wick. Keanu Reeves, AKA (Evan Webber) from Knock Knock could have very easily accessed the hidden hand gun very early on in the movie once he realized he was dealing with 2 sychopathic nymphomaniacs that wanted nothing but to run some scam on him. Horney or not, he was supposedly a very happily married man in this movie. So there was no sense in making him appear to be a helpless walking hard on that didn't know any better. This movie was just a disappointment for such a great actor. I hope that this is not a sign of what the future hold for Keanu Reeves. Hollywood, get off your duffs and give this guy the roles he deserves and give us, his fans the films we have all come to love to watch him play in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the trailer, and having been a (former) fan of Keanu Reeves, I was looking forward to the film.As it started, I thought for a second that it was not the thriller that was advertised, but maybe a tongue-in-cheek goof film.I was wrong...very wrong.This ranks among the worst films I have ever wasted and hour and a half on. The story could have had some merit IF there were any trained actors in it...oh wait, there was...but you would never know it. I thought I was watching a poorly directed high school play.I realize that when actors become big enough they sometimes get the urge to try out experimental ideas (al la Johnny Deep)...but this experiment was a dismal failure.Still I would have expected that actor with the talent of Mr. Reeves would have at least TRIED to earn his (I am assuming) very large pay check. But alas, he did not.Maybe he was experimenting with the idea of NOT acting in a film.I gave it one star because you have to give it at least one to write a review and I felt it was my responsibility to warn humanity to avoid this horrible waste.</fullReview>

I mean we have been indulging Keanu Reeves with his pseudo-roles for years now, and we've allowed him to act the same way for all his different characters, and we watched him anyway. But this was so terrible that I'm sure he's also crying himself to sleep now. Seriously, I don't understand how it's a 5 on IMDb.

		<fullReview>Dear Keanu Reeves, This was the worst movie ever I have watched, I mean the worst, come on mate, I have watched all your movies, and this was so horrible and most of all your acting was also not up to the level because this is not your style mate. I'm very much surprised that the rating is even 5. I was trying to give a zero but 01 is the least level. Please don't ever act in such movies no matter how much they would be willing to pay you because it' not worth it. You're a legend and people love you for your acting so it's not worth anything to act in a crappy movie like this. At least?. I mean at least there should be a proper ending (what happened at the end? Did you die??). You may want to give a message to the public but then you could do some other movie not like this, and anyway people see you as a hero, not as a helpless fellow to be buried alive. I'm not blaming the director or the producer because anyway people will never stop making crappy movies and there will be a crappy audience to say good about it, but I'm telling you, please don't take movies of this nature because this is not who you are, you are just putting yourself down. Your fans all around the world like you for the personality that you have created in their mind, so think about your fans before you take up movies like this. This movie was so bad in so many different levels. By the way, not for a second think that I don't understand the movie and what it is trying say (Although how the story was written was a pile of crap), I do but it's just not for you and I'm talking on behalf of all the millions of fans around the world. Thank you.</fullReview>

I wish I could get a refund from iTunes. I kept enduring this gawd awful movie "hoping" it would get better (plot, sense) and it never did. When it was over...your thought will be about what million others things you could have done in 1:30 mins you just lost. Most movies with annoying characters get that people don't care to watch it for an entire movie. But, Eli Roth in all of his "genius" doesn't get no one wants to see annoying/obnoxious characters behavior for an entire movie.

The entire production unit should be held responsible for this disaster, and confusing the boundary between insanity and morality. The movie teetered towards the former at the start, and veered towards the latter shortly thereafter. When insane teenagers who don't bat an eyelid about murder start moral-bashing the protagonist without any reason, who then starts behaving like a helpless infant, its asking too much of the audience.Usually, not one to write reviews, this movie just warrants it.

		<fullReview>Not gonna lie, I expected to like this. It started okay, a bit weird, and Keanu showed us glimpses of what later will be hilariously bad, but enjoyable performance, starting with his "Monster" scene. First half an hour or so I found to be quite okay, and it looked to me like it was intentionally funny and was made to be considered as one of those "so bad, it's good" films. So, I thought, cool, it's stupid and fun, I like where this is going, I may give it 7 or something. And then, rest of the film came, which just proved to me that Eli Roth is most childish director currently working. The torture is pointless, sadistic, idiotic, and thousands of harsh words I can throw to it, but I won't. I think it wasn't even intended to be stupid in his eyes; intentionally funny, yes. He just enjoys violence, with no real purpose portrays it in his films, and I guess his perverted imagination enjoys watching immoral people winning, and of course, someone being tortured for no reason of telling something with it. And I don't like saying films should have messages, but if this had one, it's laughable and wrong attempt of supporting feminism; picking two girls, who are clearly obnoxious sociopaths, his portrayal of feminism easily can be read as misogynistic actually, considering countless of shots he made with this film. Either way, it's just not right. I felt guilty for enjoying it at beginning and I felt manipulated at the end, and I really wouldn't hesitate on punching Roth in the face for this piece of sh*t. He can't even produce scares, atmosphere, suspense, story, etc., if we were to talk about his directorial skill. Unlike Michael Haneke, who made Funny Games, Roth with this film leaves impression of indifference in creating true tension, or digging deeper and showing allegory of moral consequences, which is main problem of this film.</fullReview>

With every progressive scene, the non-existent plot disappears more and more and the acting, as if it can't get any worse, actually becomes pathetic. This movie will actually give you a headache and make you cry wishing you could have back the last 90 minutes of your life. This movie actually makes Gary Busey commercials look like Academy Award winning performances. I am so annoyed at how insanely dumb and mind numbing this movie was. Seriously, if you an experience with more depth, better acting, and some as semblance of a plot, watch grass grow for an hour and a half.Eli Roth went from some rarely intelligent and entertaining movies such as Cabin Fever and Hostel to the darkest depths of stupidity and brainless creativity with Green Inferno and now, Knock Knock. The only reason you should be watching this movie is because you have a gun pointed at your head or you are forced to reenact the "conditioning" screens from A Clockwork Orange.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my review of Knock Knock (spoiler free). Eli Roth's chiller didn't leave me chilled it just left me bored out of my mind it started good but then it just started to fall. After the first hour I thought to myself "what am I watching?" Here are the points in which I think you must stay away from this film:1. Bad acting: This film has a well known actor Keanu Reeves who is good in a lot of films but this film isn't one of them. The two women Lerrenza Izzo and Ana de Arma were worse than him. 2. No story: This film has barely any story or non at all.3. Bad directing: This film has a well known director Eli Roth but this is probably his worst film yet with really bad camera angles.Finally I had really high hopes for this film considering some critics said that was Eli Roth's best film since Hostel I one on the hand don't agree. This film is just awful and I don't recommend you watch it 1/10 STAY AWAY! forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roth's class shines through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eli Roth is one of the best filmmakers working today. He's notably a member of the "Splat Pack" - a group of filmmakers notorious for the overly violent and explicit style of their films. 'Knock Knock' is quite unlike anything Roth has done up to this point though and it caught me quite off guard. This time around he's gone for a more thought-provoking style, and whilst it's far from perfect, it contains a uniqueness that all his films have and which brings an added layer of quality to the story.Roth has an ability, possibly superior to any other current director in the horror genre, to build tremendous characters. One of his earlier films 'Hostel' is known as one of the most brutal, hard to watch films ever created. However what people rarely mention about that film is that nearly the entire first half is taken up purely with character development. He takes the extra time to make us care for the characters so that later on when they meet their fates it has that much more effect on the audience. 'Knock Knock' has that same endless patience for the first half, and whilst it is undoubtedly a very different film to 'Hostel', the same affect is utilised. This is a very similar film to 'Funny Games'. It catches you off guard with with its almost complete lack of motivation. Is it more disturbing to know why someone is ruining your life, or to have no idea whatsoever? Probably the latter. It's not a perfect film. The ending wasn't as cleanly done and memorable as we are perhaps used to from Roth films. The ethics behind the girls actions are questionable but they're a good conversation starter so that probably remains a good thing. Keanu Reeves in the main role actually impressed me. He plays "likeable" just so well that he's ideally suited to a role like this. Overall a good film but I hope Roth keeps churning out out-and-out horror films because he's just so damn good at them.</fullReview>

Also, I honestly don't know why art was such a big part of the film... It went no where. Just a story filler I guess. The whole film is based on a 48 hour span of nothingness. Reeves' Character Evan is some kind of awkward. Kind of like he doesn't know how to use his manhood. (Who would after being deprived of sex for 3 weeks-poor guy, Ha). And WHAT IS WITH HIS DOGS ALWAYS BEING SCREWED OVER. Is my review a little all over the place, null of story, and boring?

		<fullReview>I had prepared myself for the worst, as all the reviews i had seen prior to watching were saying that the film was terrible. Well i thoroughly enjoyed it and so did my husband. I'm so pleased because i had been looking forward to it ever since i had watched the trailer. I have actually enjoyed a few of Eli Roth's movies so maybe i am a fan of his film making style and that helped my enjoyment factor? To be honest i'm starting to feel that Eli is one of these directors that a vast majority of people just automatically dislike, a bit like the Adam Sandler effect (they will just automatically hate the movie without giving it a proper chance). This isn't a horror movie, well at least i didn't find it to be. It's more of a thriller and a comedy (some moments intentional but most moments probably not...). Now this film is definitely not amazing, it won't win any awards, apart from possibly another Razzie nomination for Keanu, but i enjoyed it for what it was - an entertaining movie. I thought the girls were brill and they were very hot, especially the blonde girl - Cuban actress - Ana de Armas. They were definitely over the top at times and some moments were definitely taken too far (I can see why they would offend some people) but i found them very fun to watch. Now...Keanu! oh dear! John Wick was definitely a fluke, he was back to his usual acting ways in this film but i loved it because i found him hilarious. I definitely laughed at scenes i shouldn't have been laughing at. So if you watch this film not expecting Oscar winning acting or scares, it's an entertaining watch, well it was for me...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, we all like Keanu, we all love the Matix, Speed and Bill and Ted's etc. etc. but even the most ardent Keanu fan can't help but notice he's been notching up more than his fair share of stinkers over recent times; and Knock Knock is about as low as a Hollywood A-lister can go...It's John Travolta in "Battlefield Earth" bad...If you look at the 11000 IMDb user ratings split, there is a miraculous 1020 people who rated it 10/10. Uh-huh. If you remove those, the average goes down to 4.3 - which is still a massive overrating for such a diabolically bad film. There are almost no ratings between 6 and, all the others are 5 or lower. This is a movie company fix, 100%. 1000 10/10's massively increase the statistical mean, and boy do they know it... And now, the savaging...The story is threadbare, the script woeful, Keanu is really scraping the bottom of his very limited range in terms of acting, energy, delivery... (And lets be perfectly honest, he can only ever play one character - and it doesn't work here in the slightest...). There is nothing original, no reason, I just don't even understand how this could have been made - unless Mr Reeves is being blackmailed or lost a bet... its so damn bad a lot of smurf accounts have clearly ramped up the scores and written some truly fake reviews.It lacks any form of merit, ANY. It was based on a 1977 film which despite being based on a real story, is also not very good; I promise you - this is a whole world worse than anything else you will see this year; possibly ever... Keanu no longer has a career, unless he can pull another Matrix out his backside; he is toast. Save yourself 2 hours of your life.

		<fullReview>I am not the only person to register with this site to write a review on this film which does not surprise me given what I have seen.This film is about a happily married family man(Keanu Reeves)who is targeted by two young women who appear on his doorstep one evening when his family are away. They proceed to seduce, blackmail, overpower and torture him. The film ends with an explicit video of their encounter being uploaded to his Facebook account and his family returning to their vandalised home whilst he is left immobilised in the back garden. At the end we learn that the modus operandi of the two girls is to find and seduce married men and then ruin their lives by revealing the depravity to their loved ones to teach them a lesson. There is no discernible plot. The acting is mediocre and there are simply no positive comments I can make about this film. The whole concept is ridiculous and there is never any real suspense other than hoping the film will end swiftly.Now, I could have ignored this movie had it not been for Keanu Reeves. Once it would have been inconceivable for a distinguished man of his standard to accept a script like this. I am worried for him. Is he in decline? On the evidence of this movie he could dare I say it end up like Nick Cage and so many others. It's a sad day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS ABOUND. FULL MOVIE COMMENTARY BELOW. 5 minutes into this movie I knew something was up. This movie uses tired clichés as a vehicle to progress the story. I am not going to list them but most of the details I list are clichés in some way. I am going to give you a brief rundown as I saw it so that you can avoid the mistake I made. For starters, it has product placing from Volvo and Apple right from the get go. Keanu's acting was bad, but his family's was way worse. The movie opens with the wife and Keanu having some quality private time, which is busted up by the kids who rush in to wish dad a happy Father's Day. Their interactions are just awful and Keanu acts circles around all of them, which is really saying something. Him running around yelling monster was more convincing than every other action his family had combined. His wife is not likable, apparently they haven't had sex in three weeks, don't think she really cares about that either. Just wants to go to the beach with her kids. But the movie isn't really about his family, they are only really in it for 10-15 minutes. The movie is about Keanu's interactions with two young girls who knock on his door in the middle of a rainstorm on the following night. When we are introduced to Keanu he is nursing a recent shoulder surgery he underwent when he injured himself chivalrously helping what his wife describes as a young attractive woman. The movie subtly drops this 'hint' like a 20 lb bowling ball in your lap. "Oh, well I guess Keanu has a penchant for helping young women out and getting in trouble for it, I wonder what this movie is about. I hope it is like the Matrix! (its not)" His shoulder injury is probably the main reason why he was unable to physically defend himself against these women, one of whom disables him with a fork to the shoulder. The movie doesn't really show a lot of Keanu grabbing his shoulder or wincing about the pain. It is an afterthought when you are wondering why he is getting completely dominated by two young women whose combined weight is probably less than his: "oh...yeah. the shoulder." Come on, Keanu, Bruce Willis walked on glass in Die Hard, you can handle two high heel wearing sorority girls. These girls knock on his door and ask to use his computer to contact a friend so that they can figure out the address they need to be at. The girls look like trashy party rats, makeup all jacked from the rain, totally soaked wearing skimpy clothes. A fast talking brunette American and her petite Spanish blonde. Keanu lets them in, they use his apple brand mobile tablet device, Keanu calls an Uber for them, the Uber takes 2 hours. In the time in which they wait for the Uber the girls are running through the house trying to get closer to Keanu by engaging him in conversation and flirtatious banter. They eventually corner him and just as the Uber is arriving, they take his pants off in the bathroom, give him oral sex and he succumbs to their siren's song. He bones them both, finds them still there in the morning, gets angry, then drives them home. They come back, he doesn't detect them, and the American bashes him in the head with one of his wife's art pieces. They tie him up, torture him, kill his wife's assistant, destroy all of his wife's artwork, bury him up to his neck in the back yard, and let him live, buried up to his neck in the back yard, the house a total mess. The end. It is so bizarre; at one point the wife's assistant comes to pick up the giant statue she made to bring it to an art exhibit. He detects that they're doing something weird when the statue is messed up, he finds Keanu tied up, then actually leaves him there to go see what the girls are doing to the statue. The American had pickpocketed the assistant's inhaler when she cleverly saw he had used it when he got all worked up when he first saw what they had done with the art. He sees them bashing it with some hammers, has an asthma attack or something, the girls play monkey in the middle with his inhaler, he trips and bashes his head on the corner of the statue. Dead. So just to recap, Keanu helps these girls, succumbs to their temptation, they hold him hostage, kill his wife's assistant, destroy all his most valued possessions and then they leave. That's it. Don't see it, there is very little to take away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not a bad movie at all! Ignore the bad reviews. It doesn't have to be to the taste of every horror/thriller movie fan who seek blood and violence in every movie. You will get amused from beginning till the end. Let me brief you on the movie. All the movie is a game played by two hot girls on a family man (Keenu Reeves) whose family is on weekend holiday, so he's alone in the house. He is a good family man therefor, shelters two soaked girls in a rainy night, cliché of thriller movies, I know. He tries to be very polite and well behaved with them but he notices they are kinda different and weird. The game is lost when he can't resist their seduction and submits to them. In the morning he drives them to their so-called home. The next night they come back and continue second part of the game, torturing him for cheating and for bending the rules. He tries to escape but all comes to no result and at the end of the movie he is buried in his yard with only his head above the ground, watching his previous night's video clip on his Facebook which is uploaded by those girls. It is not a top notch movie and no one expects it to be. In its genre it's a good movie, at least one-time watchable. Give a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>********SPOILERS AHEAD****************The only good thing about this movie is that nothing happens to the cute dog.I had to give it something so I gave it 1 star, but I'd rather give it zero. Don't go thinking this is one of those "Oh it's so bad you gotta see it" movies. It's really not. At one point it plays like a really cheap n nasty porno movie but don't let that fool you into thinking it might be titillating, when I say cheap n nasty I mean that in the worst possible way.Reeves is absolutely terrible but that didn't surprise me to be honest. He's never really come across to me as much of an actor - he's just been very lucky to have made a couple of movies with good directors who know how to work around a lead "actor" who can't act to save his life. I had to laugh at one review here that said he gave a "strong natural performance". ROFL He really didn't. He was embarrassingly bad. The two girls were marginally better but all of it was excruciating to watch. There was nothing clever or interesting, nothing believable, nothing funny or shocking. The "torture" was really lame. I mean give me a break!!! I don't even know what else to say.Just please don't waste your money. If you're curious to see why everyone's saying it's bad wait till it's in bargain bins. In summary - the dog is cute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't believe I didn't EVAN-tually turn off this movie halfway through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****Contains some spoilers**** I just had the grave misfortune of having seen "Knock Knock". There are many horror aspects to this movie; the terrible acting, the Diablo Cody-esque dialogue, the tricks meant to be "twists", pretty much everything but the movie itself. I should've known better than to think Keanu Reeves could partially save an Eli Roth production. At this point it feels like I watch Eli Roth films as a form of self torture, to bad nothing Roth creates could ever compare to the actual torture of watching one of his movies, more so than any, this one.Frankly men should be insulted by this movie, not only because it somehow managed to exist, but because they are portrayed as mindless animals, unable to defend against the sexual advances of young women. The movie's intro is pretty much the kind of made up fantasies you'd find in "Penthouse", fiction, so unrealistic it'd have to set in a different universe, like those created for Superheroes to exist in. Unfortunately even the Justice League could never save this movie. Men aren't sharks in blood infested waters, they're human beings capable of thought and logic, to say that ALL men that have been victims of these girls couldn't resist them, that no man could ever said no is blatant misandry. Something that as a feminist I struggled to believe could happen to men until I managed to finish this movie. The girls then proceed to act like children, destroying everything in sight, not really doing anything calculating or taking anything of value. For me to believe that they had done this before, for the "four years" they hadn't been home is ridiculous. Surely someone would of eventually called the police, someone would of found them. Even if the victim lived alone by the time the body has been discovered there would be countless fingerprints and bodily fluids to sift through. I saw this movie not 5 minutes ago and somehow it's already managed to blur into obscurity in my mind. It was so cliché ridden and without cohesive thought, monkeys in a room with a typewriter could assemble a more thoughtful movie than this. The only way i'd ever recommend this movie is if you've eaten something poisonous and need to induce vomiting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The message of the movie is pretty interesting, and one I do agree with.Everything else seemed pretty cheap. The beginning was interesting, but it seemed to drag on for more than half the movie. Felt like watching a cheap porno. The second half, the torture was not particularly terrifying and the actions of the characters were neither here nor there. Also Keanu Reeves was not very convincing in the film.Hard Candy did a much better (and terrifying) job of exploring the shallowness of man(kind), so I would suggest that over Knock Knock. Overall though, the movie was an interesting watch and definitely different to most films currently out there. So, if you're bored with the regular thrillers, this might just be for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do I start with this mess, I was hoping that the negative reviews were wrong but that just wasn't this case. The film is centered on Evan, a nice family guy who is taken hostage by two pretty women who randomly show up at his house and practically force him to have sex with them. These two women are two of the most obnoxious characters that I have ever seen in a film, and we are forced to listen to them try and do their best impressions of a crazy person for an hour and forty minutes.Roth uses ever cliché in the book to keep Evan in the grasps of his annoying captors. It gets to the point where the movie is just so dumb and unrealistic that it is actually physically frustrating. I found myself fighting to not turn off the film, I stuck with it hoping that there would be some big pay off, but nope. It all leads up to a very underwhelming and stupid ending. Imagine if the film "Funny Games" replaced the two twisted killers with two annoying females, and then you have "Knock Knock"I am a big Eli Roth fan, I have been since I saw Cabin Fever. I have enjoyed every film he has directed and I even liked "Aftershock", a film that he wrote the screenplay for. I have defended a lot of his films to people who call him a hack, because in my opinion all his movies before this have had a nice charm to them that made them a little bit more than just gore movies. The charm and the gore is gone in "Knock Knock" and there is no way I can defend this one.It really does bum me out to write a review trashing a Eli Roth film because he is one of the few horror directors we have left and up until now he has done a pretty good job. But this was really bad and there really weren't any redeeming qualities. Stick to what you know Roth, fun gore movies.2/10</fullReview>

That wouldn't make it past a full script review.This isn't enjoyable at all like I've said, but its hard to sum up how bad this is.</fullReview>

Reminded me of a remake but could not even be bothered thinking about which one. Have heard there is an after credit scene but why you would sit an extra 2 minutes in the theatre to watch it is beyond me. Eli Roth is pretty useless at direction I think and gets less than nothing from his cast. One scene in particular where she is stabbing him in the shoulder could possibly rate as the daftest scene EVER..and bear in mind I have seen Conan The Barbarian.I would say go see this as it would make anything else a treat.</fullReview>

When I watch the trailer I said like "oh there is Keanu and Eli Roth and two chicks omg there will be some blood, some terror and action, this gonna be a great popcorn film... but it is not that film at all. The plot was promising but that was just all. I lost in facebook, on my phone... while trying to keep attantion to film. There were really messed up scenes without a point, if Eli Roth tried to tell some story and wanted to make a point I can easily say he failed hard this time. I watched the whole film to the end with thoughts like "cmon Eli Roth show me some surprises of yours" but the finale was just bizare like rest of the film. As a result, avoid this film and save your 90 minutes.</fullReview>

This is the most irritating movie I have ever seen with all the characters demanding your anger to break the screen on whatever platform you are watching it. I could have stopped it after 10 minutes only but I had read the review where it was said that a "good" twist is in the store at the end. OMG!...nothing... this movie is nothings and I pity Keanu for producing it. How can he be so dumb to produce a movie where he did the worst acting of his career or for that matter worst of the worst actor's. Both the female characters were so dumbly irritating that you want to kill them while watching the movie. No story, no background music, no plot, no thrill nothing....even nothing has something but this movie...its vacuum!!

		<fullReview>Knock Knock (2015)*** (out of 4) Husband and father Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) is home alone working during a storm when two ladies (Lorenza Izzo, Ana de Armas) knock on his door asking for directions. Both women are wet and cold so Evan invites them into his house to wait for a taxi but they soon seduce them into a threesome. The next day Evan realizes his mistake and tries to get rid of the women but soon he realizes they have different plans.Eli Roth is best known for his sadistic horror movies but he tries something different here and while the film is highly flawed I thought it was good enough for what it was trying to do. I'm not going to spoil what happens throughout the movie but I thought the twists were rather good and for the most part we got some nice performances. Again, if you're wanting high art then this isn't going to be for you but for my money it was a nice erotic thriller that was at least entertaining throughout.On a technical level this is the best thing I've seen from Roth has he actually does a very good job in the directing department and there's no question that the film is well-made. I thought the director did a very good job at establishing the Evan character by showing him to be a good guy but of course even the best of people can make a mistake, which could change their life. Again, I'm not going to ruin the plan of these women but it's an interesting idea and I think the story is good enough to hold your attention throughout.The performances are for the most part good. Reeves does a nice job in the role that requires quite a bit from him. This includes playing that lovable father but he also handles the seduction scenes quite well and the various scenes where he is being tortured both physically and mentally. Both Izzo and de Armas are good in their roles as they both play erotic very well and I thought they also managed to be believable in the more deadly nature. Most importantly is that all three have some good chemistry no matter what they're doing.As I said there are some logical issues that I had with some of the things that happen throughout the picture and at times you want to hit Evan over the head yourself for doing some foolish things. Still, KNOCK KNOCK really did keep me entertained throughout the running time and I found it to be interesting and worth watching.</fullReview>

Then, during a very rainy night, 2-girls knock on his door claiming they can't find the address they are supposed to go to. Evan lets them come in and what started out as innocent encounter turns into a bizarre time for Evan. He is seduced by the girls who end up torturing him and trashing the house and desecrating his wife's art work sculptures. I like Keanu Reeves and his movies. I took this out thinking this would be another gem. Wrong. Am only doing this review to let people know what they are getting into. Once the real motives of the girls are revealed I hit the FF button often. I did not like seeing what was presented on the screen. I stayed with it FF button and all as I wanted to know how this ended, how Evan would triumph and the girls defeated. This is really hard to watch even with the FF button doing its job. The ending shows no resolution and when the family comes back from the beach, the little boy exclaims as the wife opens the door, "Daddy had a party." Fade to black. Now it seems I need to read a review of Keanu Reeves' movies to see what I am getting into. This was highly disappointing. (1/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes. Nudity: Yes. Language: Yes, a lot of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say that they acting was atrocious. I am actually a huge fan of Keanu but from the very beginning it was cringe worthy. The two girls were OK as insane but pretty much everyone else was just baffling horrid.The film itself had a great thriller concept that intrigued me. I was expecting a movie resembling that of Hard Candy. I think if it had taken that approach it would have been a great movie.** Spoilers Below ** But instead it decided to have the main character be a fairly good guy and undeserving of what was thrown at him.If they had made his character try at first to be a loyal husband but crumble at temptation then I could have fully stood behind his punishment and lesson needing to be taught. But I do not feel that is what happened at all. Was he really deserving of any punishment? if you are going to make some moral lesson movie and punish someone for their wrong doings, at the very least make them do the crime.In the end I was left annoyed. Go watch Hard Candy if a movie like this interests you it will be so much more worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With his family away for the weekend, a man falls prey to the seductive yet treacherous means of two women who construct a deadly game of cat and mouse.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're Eli Roth, you know a thing or two about pushing boundaries, or buttons, depending on how fragile your moral tolerance is. When Roth exploded onto the scene with Cabin Fever (2002), a skin peeling romp through the backwoods that called to mind the likes of Tobe Hooper, fans of the genre immediately cast a keen eye on the director. It wasn't until Hostel (2005) that the filmmaker began developing a particular flair and vitality, turning towards a style many love to hate. Casting an overtly misogynistic and sophomoric tone over his films, Roth has worked to separate himself from the masses, as well as critical favoritism with a rigid focus on torture, mutilation, and sadism. It's an approach to this subject matter that I have defended countless times, firmly believing that there's more behind sliced tendons, frayed nerves and severed limbs than grotesquery and abuse for the sake of being able to show it. In the latest entry into the home-invasion thriller genre, Eli Roth has managed to set his buckets of blood and intestines on the back burner for a slower burn that manages a spark or two before fizzling into mediocrity. Shifting focus one too many times, Knock Knock manages thoughtless provocation with its blind view on sobering acts that should turn thought-provoking corners like a skilled home- invader. What it does instead is cut itself time and time again on its many plot devices, bleeding out before it's able to successfully build on its taut story.Quickly introducing us to Evan (Keanu Reeves), an architect who would appear to have it all; a loving wife, two adoring kids and a puppy named Monkey in a house he designed. Yet it's apparent that Evan and his wife Karen (Ignacia Allamand) don't get the intimate time they crave given her busy schedule as an artist and two children abruptly pouncing them before they can even get dressed. For a couple that's fourteen years into a marriage, it all seems like a dream come true for anyone who grew up with parents that didn't separate, and yet we're placed with a predicament. Left alone for the long weekend to work while his family departs for the beach, Evan is quickly sidetracked by knocks at his door from two innocuous women, Genesis (Lorenzo Izzo) and Bel (Ana de Armas) that are lost in search of a party in the suburban sprawl of Los Angeles. Soon he finds himself quickly battling more than worker's block as a night of unfaithfulness leads to a treacherous game of cat and mouse with his new house guests.Quickly ratcheting up suspense, Knock Knock paces itself methodically due in part to Eli Roth's slow hand camera, floating around the house like a prowler after the lights have been turned off. We become familiar with what Evan has designed, a piece of his mind laid out and the inevitable framework for which our cat and mouse maneuver through. Once the pacing of the film breaks away from its Hitchcockian roots, we realize how small our maze is, as our chase inevitably ends short lived, despite an excellent score by Manuel Riveiro backing every false step. It's a redundant exercise that plays out in front of us, where unnecessary footwork takes precedence over dialogue. It's a shame too, since childish antics and games take a front seat to a potential psychological death-match that would have amplified the terror and enhanced the dialogue tenfold.Eli Roth is a director that isn't afraid to show the most brutal of acts, often laying his pieces out in front for everyone to bear witness to. From diseased skin being shaved off to an Achilles heel being cut like a rubber band all the way to limbs being hacked off, Roth tends to revel in illuminating as much as possible, and with Knock Knock that's no different. Evans home is strewn with photos of his loving family, almost to the point of absurdity. His wife's sculptures stand in the backyard like sentries constructed to stand guard of the house (or keep watch on Evan). Everything that rests within Evan's design has a story, a history or personal memory that exists for us to discover. For fans of Roth's films, it's a motif that is cherished and embraced....Read more at www.reelbrew.tumblr.com</fullReview>

I was appalled at how awful Keanu's acting was especially towards the end when he was incapacitated and screaming at his captors. The movie's message of staying faithful and cheating on your spouse isn't worth the potential consequences is a great one because anyone who thinks of cheating after seeing this movie is an idiot and a glutton for punishment but even the message wasn't enough to give the movie a rating higher than a 5! Not box office worthy but an okay movie if nothing else is on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie promotes paedophilia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi guys. This is a pretty objective review - so read on if you wonder about the title. I want to mention that I have never left a review on IMDb, however, after watching this movie I felt compelled to warn everyone of the harms which watching this movie may cause.Once a week we have a 'surprise movie night' at my local cinema called 'Sneak' which I went to with my date (bad mistake). The first couple scenes still seemed like a typical Hollywood thriller or just another boring old love story. However, the moment these two ladies knocked on the door, it was clear to me that Keanu, whose acting was horrific, would cheat on his beloved wife and family and destroy his idyllic life. Alright story up to here...Now lets skip the aforementioned disaster acting, storyline and cringe-worthy conversations. There is a couple moments where I was actually wondering how this movie received a 'go' to be played in German cinemas. In my opinion it highly promotes paedophilia. (I don't mean to offend anyone by saying this).Spoilers. I want to explain this statement: two hot girls, looking like they are in their mid-twenties, seduce this 43 year old father and then pretend they are minors and want a huge punishment for this Keanu-dad's behavior... that already is sick. But the scene where Bel puts on his daughters school clothes and calls him daddy???? Let's not forget that she is wearing an 8 year old's (his daughters) undies. What the serious f... - what in the world - this is sick! Then she 'rapes' him (he easily could have slammed her off the bed) and continues to call him daddy. I mean what in the world is wrong with these people??? Who came up with this idea? To me this person belongs in prison. I am being serious. Turns out these girls aren't even minors and the whole movie made no point.To me this was the absolute worst movie I have EVER seen. My date felt the same. We both felt pretty awkward after watching this movie! No actually throughout this WHOLE movie.Also - what was the role of this dog, which to me was the only likable thing in this movie. Last note, I kinda hope whoever wrote the screenplay or came up with the idea will be punished. In whatever way. Child molesters are probably enjoying this movie.Let's just quickly forget we watched this and move on with our lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like Keanu Reeves don't watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains SPOILERS, but you should't watch it anyways so you might as well read it. The movie was shown as a "Sneak Preview" and that's pretty much all the reason why I watched it. From time to time it's interesting but the movie completely fails. Some scenes are dragged out to the point you find yourself asking if they tried to make a Terrentino-movie, yet those scenes become awkwardly boring. The only twist in this movie is how many times Keanu switches from "I will do anything" to "I will f**ing kill you". There is zero development, no clue of the intention the "kidnappers" have, and there is zero suspense. You keep asking yourself what turn of events this movie will eventually have but it just ends. Keanu Reeves is a terrible cast for the movie because you expect him to knock those two 80lbs girls out at all times, which makes this movie seem so unrealistic it beggars believe. At no time are you scared of those two party chicks. As a horror movie it get's a solid 0. The 3 points are merely for production value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Knock, KnockWhen young women appear on your doorstep it usually means your online luring has worked.Oddly, the family man in this thriller hasn't been to any online chat rooms lately.Happily married Evan (Keanu Reeves) stays home to nurse his injured shoulder while his wife (Ignacia Allamand) and children go to the beach for the weekend.His recuperation, however, is interrupted by a knock at the door that later finds him playing host to soaking wet airline stewardesses, Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bel (Ana de Armas), who got lost on their way to a party.Evan is easily seduced. He wakes the next morning to find the girls have taken him hostage, and are vandalizing his home.Featuring Keanu's worst performance ever, this erotic cautionary tale fails to be the feminist think piece it hopes. Instead it's a far-fetched and laughable remake.Besides, morning-after breakfast gets really expensive with threesomes. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Home alone for the weekend, a devoted husband and father gets an unexpected visit from two beautiful young girls needing help. But what seems like a harmless encounter quickly spirals out of control once he finds himself seduced into their twisted violent games.Inspired by the infamous 1977 exploitation flick Death Game, Eli Roth returns to the scene as co-writer and director, taking a modernized stab at the classic home invasion subgenre. But was his 8-year directing hiatus worth the wait? Well? I'd like to think so! Knock Knock may not feature Roth's signature gore, but most audiences are sure to be disgusted all the same from his strange erotic approach to the psychological thriller. I was actually pleasantly surprised to see such a mature and sophisticated direction coming from this controversial horror director. Some of his die-hard fans will probably feel differently about this change of style, but you have to respect his willingness to try something new. Gore just for the sake of gore, or as they say to create "shock value," has never really impressed me, and this is why I have never been too keen on most of his earlier films. But Knock Knock succeeds in ways his directorial debut Cabin Fever or the god-awful Hostel: Part II didn't by delivering genuine suspense through convincing characters. This is the same clever style he once carried through the original Hostel, minus the excessive bloodshed, of course.As Ana De Armas previously stated in an interview, it's really interesting to see a story that involves characters that all think they're the victims, regardless of their actions. Knock Knock definitely cuts against the grain in this way by challenging us to question the morality of who's truly innocent. This quickly skews any certainties one may have towards the characters, which eventually leads to an intriguing ethical dilemma. Obviously the actors themselves played a big part in the fierce tension brought to the screen through their exceptional performances. Hilariously enough, one reviewer stated that Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas' acting made them want to knit their eyelids shut. All right buddy? Let's maybe take a chill pill and turn it down a notch. I've watched my share of dull movies and Knock Knock is far from one of them. Sure, the film might fall victim to a few minor plot holes, but none came close to distracting from the genuine suspense these characters create. The two lead femme fatales, far from conventional, offered some truly convincing over-the top performances through their psychotic actions and dark campy undertones. Keanu Reeves also delivers what may just be the best performance of his career as the easy-going family man who's forced to deal with a very destructive situation. Providing an impressive range of emotional depth that perfectly contrasts with the sociopathic personalities of the two young sexual vixens.More importantly, the film manages to shed some interesting light on social media and its disturbingly adverse potential. Most people wouldn't think twice about putting themselves online, but are completely oblivious to the lack of privacy of sites like Facebook. It's so easy to get sucked into socializing digitally in today's age, and I think we've gotten so used to it that most have forgotten how easily its power could be abused. Like it or not, we now live in a time where our personal business can be exposed to the entire world in a matter of seconds. In the wrong hands, this could easily become our worst nightmare. Roth resourcefully uses this nightmare to the film's advantage, creating a disturbingly brilliant form of social commentary that underlines this slick seductive thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feminist garbage that does not deserve your time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never like Eli Roth as a director; he is a hack that has only made one decent film. I also do not really like Keanu Reeves, since I believe he is a one note "actor" who can only play one role. Against my better judgment I decided to give this film a chance, and I wanted to punch every involved in this travesty. This movie is so freaking ludicrous, as to make any socially conscious man angry. Why is it that men are always portrayed as villains? Is it our fault that we take the initiative to get s#!t done? We are the inventors, the explorers, the ones who risk our lives to save the lives of others.Yet we have a movie like this one that spits on everything men have done to simply slight them, and why? This movie made me angry because it caters to the simple minded feminist mentality; instead of trying to place blame on any one specific group, these people need to look introspectively and deconstruct everything they have been taught to believe by those around them. It doesn't even work as witty social commentary. It is Tyler Perry's "Man Hating Film #8 directed by Eli Roth". Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasted Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a lot of potential to be quite good but didn't capitalize on it. The way it was shot made it look like it was a big budget Hollywood movie and though it takes place in one main setting, you never really notice because of all the crazy things going on. Unfortunately, that's where the good points about this movie end. There were a few points in the movie (the beginning, the middle, and the end) where little hints were dropped to explain the plot of the movie, but all were so brief it was easy to miss them, and if you did catch them they didn't tie in together well enough to explain what was going on and why it was happening. Moving right along to the acting -- more disappointment. Keanu Reeve's takes the blame here! His acting was so awkwardly bad it completely overshadowed everyone else's like a huge dark cloud and took away from the intensity of the movie. Imagine watching an emotionally intense scene that would normally make you cringe, but instead you can't help but laugh because of his terrible acting. This movie is definitely not for movie buffs who enjoy movies with well written plots and great acting, they'll want to skip this one; but if you want a good laugh on a Saturday night you'll want to watch this with a group of friends. Sorry Keanu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow and dull movie from Eli Roth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knock Knock is a movie directed by Eli Roth and Starring Keanu Reeves. The movie is about a husband who is alone at home on weekend when two women came in for help. Whats starts of as a normal night until Evan Webber played by Keanu Reeves has an affair, the two girls then reveals their horrifying plans they have for Keanu reeves. I have to say Eli Roth did a bad choice in choosing Keanu Reeves as the main character of the movie, it didn't feel right for Keanu reeves to play the role of a father in this movie, it had an unnatural feeling to it which makes the first 20 minutes of the movie kind of boring since you feel like the acting is kind of fake. He also didn't seem to fit the role of this movie, he should defiantly go back to doing another epic action movie like John Wick. The two girls played by Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas In the movie actually did a good job, they actually made me feel uncomfortable, I could also see that Keanu Reeves' character was uncomfortable, you can see that whenever the girls sit next to him he moves away and he is constantly checking his phone for the cab to arrive, hoping to get rid of them but at the same time we can see him struggling since we can feel that his character wants to have the affair. In this one scene when he enters the toilet instead of closing his eyes he uses his hands to cover it, which gives me a feeling that he kinds of want to have the affair. You know he is going to cheat on his wife but the way Eli Roth showed the character uncomfortableness and the acting by the two girls makes you root for him, since you know something bad is going to happen and you don't really want it to happen on Keanu Reeves. It makes you want him to stop and just get rid of them. The only problem with the beginning scene is the dialogue which got boring pretty fast since the girls spend the first 20 minutes apologizing for everything they did which gets kind of annoying, then all of sudden they start talking about sex and affairs which doesn't seem to fit the characters. I was kind of bored during those 40 minute with the boring dialogue nothing really develops. I was hoping the movie would pick up after that and it did kind of. Although the movie itself had some intense moments, the movie is still pretty slow and nothing really happens, all we see is Keanu Reeves being tortured mentally for the last half of the movie. I expected more tension in the movie but the movie lacked it. There were one or two scenes where I was actually holding my breath, but other then that, most of the time the movie was dull and slow. I get Eli Roth's dark message but because the movie was boring it just didn't really stick on to me, unlike the movie Hostel. Overall this movie wasn't that interesting, the movie felt kind of flat, there wasn't much tension in the movie and the dialogue weren't that good. If you are an Eli Roth fan, I think you might find this enjoyable. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend seeing it in theatre. Wait for it to be on Netflix or TV. I am going to give this movie a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad acting, bad directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that struck me negatively in this movie was the bad acting. Before I noticed that, the story failed here &amp; there but one never knows if it's for later plot-twist or maybe just my mood. However one shouldn't put so much blame for bad acting on the actors as ultimately, the responsible of a movie is the director; I don't care if his casting failed and by the time he realized the actors were not he expected the movie already started or worse, he neglected to direct them, the responsibility remains.The story wasn't the best in this setting but with afterthought, with a few modifications to it, but serious direction changes, the movie could have been respectable IMHO.Keanu Reeves is known for his intense roles, which he stay faithful to. I don't know why he chose to play in this mediocre movie and the mediocre one about samurais. If he spits on elitism to cater to one's career at the detriment of one's craft, I'm all for it (not doing something one love just to increase one market value must suck). If he's desperate and the vast majority of the movie he's going to appear in is mediocre, I better catch on and start avoiding what he's in.</fullReview>

They prey on married men seductively and hope they say yes to their advances to then ruin the mens lives. Keanue Reeves performed disappointingly as the type of acting on all parts reminded me of several B rated thriller/dramas with a low budget.Overall it has a very weak storyline and it just wasn't an enjoyable watch, it didn't have me enticed at any point nor did it make me want to watch more.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not bad, but is far from being good. keanu reeves has a nice performance in opposition to all the rest of the cast. The girls and family are just too flat. You can see and enjoy the movie if you disregard the bad acting. The girls characters are underdeveloped, maybe they needed more guidance. It seems the actresses were left alone and they were not able to develop their characters on their own. The storyline is pretty decent, being a spin off of Michael Haneke "Funny Games". If already seen this movie you know what to expect. The main difference is that you what that erotic twist which is a nice approach. Eli Roth should know better that the girls are fundamental to the success of the movie. Due to the lack of attention to acting the result is a dull character development.</fullReview>

At least Ed Wood and Uwe Boll try and make Movies that are watchable if inept Entertainments.Roth is just not intellectually fit to make Movies with meaning. He is a cocky, no talent Artist that thinks He is making things that are clever and provocative. There comes a certain amount of "Blind Allegiance" to support the rather unfettered, uninhibited, ultra-unsatisfying stuff He puts out.In this one Keanu Reeves strains His lack of ability and goes to a place where anyone with a SAG Card fears to tread. Some of His speeches here are Cringe-Inducing to say the least. Smacking, rather clobbering of ad-lib, it is just embarrassing.The One-Note Plot involves the familiar, heavy duty, and deep lesson about Marital infidelity and its ramifications. One of the things Roth thinks is clever in this dismal failure may be the lack of Gore, or any physical violence for that matter, in an against type take to show His vast ability to handle things of a more psychological nature. Yea Right. In Eli Roth's World Art does not exist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eli Roth specializes in weird and twisted films, and this one is no exception. It is hard to understand what Roth was trying to accomplish with it, though. Is it a commentary on ultra-feminism, or a morality tale about how men can never say no to you-know-what?It reminds me of the film Hard Candy, which I didn't much care for either, but at least that one made more sense in terms of the characters. In that film the man was a paedophile, and the girl was kind-of nuts, but slightly more justified in her actions.In this story, the guy (Keanu Reeves), is a perfectly good man, happily married, and a loving father. Yet the crazy bitches (I'm allowed to say that, it was in the movie) who invade his home, and seduce him, are the real predators.There's moments of black humour throughout it that really worked. The last line made me laugh out loud.I think that a lot of people will hate this movie. Indeed it is very frustrating to watch, as Keanu gets tortured by these psychos. But I believe that is what Eli Roth was going for, so I have to give him props for that.As I said earlier, the film gives a lot of mixed messages. There's lines of dialogue that seem to relate to the concept that all men are sexual deviants, but I do not believe that this is the actual point of the movie. (Roth's wife is nearly 20 years his junior, after all, so he's in no position to talk about paedophilia).I'm more inclined to think that this is a reaction to many of the so-called feminists and man haters out there.Or maybe it's just meant to be trashy entertainment.Who knows.</fullReview>

Then, the drama begin, would you sleep with 2 beautiful women that never stop to tease you without thinking seriously about the consequences... Eli Roth think about this. Not just the aftermath, but what theses womens can do to your life and control your life in a way that you will want to cut your ''in-between'' for what will happen next.In ''Knock Knock'' many answers will be respond. It is not the best film ever but it is a breath of fresh air. The acting is good, i'm digging Eli's wife, Lorenza Izzo, she is more talented that ''B'' flick usual chick and that other actress is terrific as well. A film with barely 3 actors for 100 minutes and being a film entertaining and not as predictable as you will think, is fine with me !

		<shortDescription>Knock Knock doesn't get the reaction it intends.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eli Roth is a master of suspenseful horrors. Unfortunately Knock Knock doesn't follow the likes of Hostel and Cabin Fever. Keanu Reeves is Evan, a devoted husband and father left at home to work whilst his family are away for the weekend. He's an innocent, good natured soul who answers the door to two young women who need help. A seductive game of cat and mouse commences as soon as he lays eyes on them. Things take a turn for the worst when Evan caves in to their sexual advances. Knock Knock's most interesting aspect comes from its very different gender roles. Reeves is the 'damsel in distress', sympathy untoward from his moment of passion. The young women, Genesis (Roth's wife Lorenza Izzo) and Bel (Ana de Armas) are in control, yet ironically out of control. This Strangers style film struggles to get the reaction it deserves. Serious moments are funny when they shouldn't be. The plus side for director Eli Roth is the women reach the maximum level of annoyance whilst Evan conjures up low amounts of courage, throwing our emotions in to disarray. Knock Knock is a hard one to judge. It'll make you feel dirty and awkward, even if there's nothing to hide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really plot-hole filled and strange</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reliance on a publicly posted rape video (where evan, the main character was retrained, and clearly distressed) for some form of blackmail didn't make any sense, and only incriminated the girls.Basically, the girls, in this film, are invited in, out of the rain, to make a phone call/get dry and then they proceed to have sex with the family man, the main character. It's not a clever film. It's campy. So we have these campy, kind of annoying, obviously untrustworthy villanesses - who are so annoying and seemingly shifty, I am not sure any older man, unless expressly niave would be attracted to them - and the victim, who is hopelessly hopeless - couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag, or reason his way through a crossword. The only evidence they leave, is that they tortured the perp, DNA all of the apartment, and a video of them raping the main character - which is supposed to be blackmail, but is just court admissable evidence against them. The family, finding all that, would just feel bad for the raped, and burgled husband, and presumably he'd get therapy.But maybe I am just missing this low brow, campiness, and it's supposed value, but the movie isn't sexy, scary or funny. If it was more serious, and painted the psychopath girls as more evil, or the main character as more scared or traumatised - perhaps, but as it is, the movie took a serious topic, and a moral question, and answered all of that with campy frivilousity. It strikes as a movie that could have been about the legal lattitude of women to be criminals - like gone girl, or the twistedness of a vengeful mind. But as a campy, sort of "scream" like comedic tone, it really doesn't work for the subject matter. Plus, the plot is unbelievable, in a number of areas</fullReview>

If I know anything about acting, I can say that Keanu Reeve's is not a great drama actor and has never been, he's just not that kind of actor. And that's probably why he never does that kind of movies. Neither does Arnold Schwarzeneger, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. However, he is a successful actor because he is great for a different type of movies, for portraying people of certain type - real life people of certain type. Therefore he is a legitimately good actor. It's hard for me to describe that, but if you have watched other movies that Keanu was in, you know what I mean. What I am trying to say here is, his acting is not any worse in this movie than in others, like The Matrix, Street Kings and John Wick. What makes this movie terrible, though, is directing. And that's Eli Roth's fault. This movie is just pointless. It's for the kind of people who like movies that are disturbing just for the sake of being disturbing. And it probably is good in that genre. But with Keanu Reeves being in it, I guess people expected it to be a different kind of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a bad movie! it doesn't have a plot, story, dialogue...nothing at all and the whole acting, specially of the two girls is pretty bad!!!! I cannot believe that Keanu Reeves had read the story and said "oh wow! its a great story, lets do it!" it must be a lot of money to offer him otherwise I cannot understand why he made such a crappy movie! However, they did pretty well in the product placements, "UBER" "Facebook" "Instagram" but so obvious! It looks like a movie of a bunch of kids with money that decided to invest in a production with a super star. But they didn't make the homework or try to do a good job. My question is how the studios or the distribute companies see in these movie in order to invest on them??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't tend to think of myself as much of a movie critic, but I had to create this account and write this review just to comment on this movie and say my piece.((no spoilers in this bit))I found the first few scenes with the family kind of unbearable. Bit overacted and kind of cringey.However, after the family leave the tone completely changes. A chilling plot with a great build up.I can say I've seen a fair few movies over the last couple of years (I do lyk muh movies) and very few have had me on the edge of my seat like this one.((there are spoilers below this bit)) ========((there are spoilers in this bit))I'm a little curious about the other reviews left on this film... I'm sceptical as to what their real reason is for disliking this film so much.I hope it's not to do with the fact that two women rape, restrain, murder/manslaughter their way through this man's home? And how that might not fit their narrative? It may well not be, but women can be sociopaths too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It wasn't THAT bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Been reading a lot of reviews on here and a lot of them are saying it's the worst movie they have ever seen... and to that I say, really?Perhaps people were expecting the typical Eli Roth gore fare extravaganza, and although there are scenes of violence it never does take it to the extreme like Roth's previous works has and that let them down...Or perhaps they've only seen like 100 movies...Not saying it's a "great" movie by any means but it kept me fairly entertained throughout the watch, even if it was occasionally for the "wrong reasons" when scenes are so over the top you can't help but to laugh or smirk...But as far as erotic thrillers goes, which is what I would classify this as more than as a horror it's not all that bad, it does have a bundle of plot holes and the motives remain quite unclear even after the credits stopped rolling, but most erotic thrillers suffers from that dilemma... And it does have a welcoming dose of dark comedic moments as wellActing-wise it's... okay, Keanu Reeves tries to do something different with his acting this time, I think that was Eli Roth's idea, he's far more energetic and over the top than we are used to seeing him as, I'm not sure it was the best way to play the role but can't hate on him for trying something different... And considering some of the dialogue he was given, it would be a struggle for even the best of actors to make that sound believable...But overall all despite it flaws it kept me fairly entertained so I'll slip it a 6/10, even though the ending wasn't all that satisfying</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful acting from Reeves and a terrible script. 2/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I really didn't enjoy this film! Keanu Reeves acting was awful and his constant whining got on my nerves. The girls were also nuts and they seemed to go a bit overboard at times, (understatement). Anyway, Reeves plays Evan Webber, whose a happy family man with 2 kids, a beautiful wife and a impressive house. While his wife takes there kids for a short break, Evan decides to stay at home because he has to catch up with his work. Whilst designing on his computer at home alone, 2 girls turn up on his doorstep, in the pouring rain and they ask him if they can use his Internet to find the address for a party in the area. The somewhat puzzled Evan, invites them in and he makes them feel comfortable by giving them dry clothes while he dries there wet ones. From there I would have thought something suspect was happening! Anyway, after loads of flirting from the girls, they finally get down to business (wink wink) and when he wakes up in the morning he realises that the girls have taken over his house. Like most men, he regrets the sexual acts that he performed with the girls the night before, so he quickly drops them home and he cleans up the mess that they let behind. The crazy girls then go back to his house and completely destroy everything whilst tying him up. They tell him that they were underage so he's unable to call the police and they threaten to tell his wife about what he's done. Now, if these girls have done this type of thing before, how the hell have they got away with it? I must admit, Reeves should have used his head by physically putting them in the cab but he was thinking with the wrong head. The thing that made me cringe the most, had to be his acting. Right from the beginning when he was playing a family man, it just didn't seem natural and his weird outbursts made it even worse. Also, when he was given the chance to hide, why didn't he pick up the phone and call the cops outside? Anyway, I won't carry on slating the script because it's holier than a vicar. The two girls played there part well and I really didn't know what they were going to do next but the overall movie was pretty bad. Disappointing!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Eli Roth who teamed up with Quentin Tarantino to make Inglorious Basterds, Cabin Fever, Hostel I &amp; II, Grindhouse and the Green Inferno. He's also had a successful acting career in movies like Jurassic Park: The Lost World, Hostel, Southland Tales, Death Proof, Rock of Ages and the disappointing Man with the Iron Fists so he had enough experience to correct the awful script in this movie. It's not very often that a Keanu Reeves movie makes such a low amount of money at the box office but after watching it, I can completely understand why. He should just stick to action movies because he made a right mess of Bram Stokers: Dracula, with that weird accent and annoying puzzled look on his face throughout the movie.&nbsp;Budget: $3million Worldwide Gross: $2.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/mystery/thrillers starring Keanu Reeves, Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas. 2/10</fullReview>

I don't want to spoil anything for those who intend to watch it (but save your time, that's my advice). Not scary, not funny, not anything! And Mr. Reeves' acting is so poor (guess he's ashamed of being there), that he can't be recognized.There are more than a few bloopers too, but those can easily be spotted by the watcher.STUPID (stoopid)!</fullReview>

I only watched it because of Keanu Reeves and although he's not the best actor in the world as demonstrated by his lackluster performance in Man of Tai Chi, he's not the worst either and I've usually enjoyed the movies he's been in... the question is, what did Eli Roth have on Keanu that was that bad he would allow himself be blackmailed into appearing in this movie... this movie is pitiful in almost every respect... if you value your time, give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stretches Believability Just a Tad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Knock Knock", starring Keanu Reeves-John Wick, The Matrix movies; Lorenza Izzo-The Green Inferno, Aftershock; Ana de Armas-Faraday, Blind Alley and Ignacia Allamand-The Green Inferno, Aftershock.This movie is directed by Eli Roth-The Green Inferno, Hostel 1&amp;2, Cabin Fever-and based on a 1977 movie called 'Death Game'. Keanu plays an architect married to Ignacia, an artist, and they have two lovely children. Ignacia and the kids are going away to the beach for the weekend, leaving Keanu alone at home to work. That night, it starts raining pretty heavily and Keanu hears a knock at his door. When he opens the door, he sees Lorenza and Ana, dripping wet. They tell him that they were going to a party but got the wrong address, lucky Keanu, and ask to use his phone; theirs are wet or have dead batteries-does it really matter? Anyway, after Keanu calls for a cab, which will take 45 minutes in this downpour, the blonde and brunette soaked girls ask if they could dry their cloths in Keanu's dryer-they don't want to go to their party all wet, now, do they? While sitting in the robes that Keanu furnished them, they start talking about jobs-they say they are stewardess-and sex-they enjoy it with no strings attached. Next thing you know, the girls start coming on to Keanu and of course, he tells them that he is a happily married man but eventually, he gives in. He has sex with both of them-he is only human. The next morning, they are still there. He offers to take them home and after some coaxing, they let him and he thinks it's all over. But, it's not. They come back, knock him unconscious and tie him up. Then, the fun begins. They threaten to tell his wife about what he did-they claim they are under aged-and they tear up the house and then threaten to even kill him. I guess the lesson to be learned here is to not mess around on your spouse, no matter how tempting it might appear to be. I can see why this movie is in limited release; some of the situations were stretching believability a little. I mean, come on, Keanu was in the Matrix! He knows how to fight. He could have taken these two girls, easily. But of course, then you wouldn't have a movie. It's rated "R" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 39 minutes. I don't know if I would pay money for this one but it would be a good rental.</fullReview>

We almost predicted everything that was going to happen till the end as well as stupid ending.We both agreed that it was a huge waste of time watching this movie, it was neither horrifying nor sexy, all we felt the entire time was disgust, maybe that's what the director wanted.Wish I could give it a rating of 0, would not ever recommend this movie to anyone, would rather endure a whole day watching sharknado with my kids.

		<fullReview>Not the best plot, dialogs, acting in that film. It was not even close to realism.Reeves here is playing a wealthy married guy that is being seduced by two young sexy girlz and then is getting beaten by them (lol)But I enjoyed how naive that character of Reeves was, as also I enjoyed that those two ladies were something like the ISIS members of feminism. It is a messy film that does not focus so much in being realistic but mostly in overreacting and in reversals of the action. For example the death of Louis cannot happen in real life but it was stupidly funny and fits to the rest of the film.It was also strange that film tried to exonerate the two torturers of the victim, and to reverse who is likable and who unlikeable.Most important I always enjoy films with girl on girl action and that was also a big plus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very bad plot, and the ending just adds more disappointment to the movie. Too far fetched and a pointless story-line. Do not recommend this film, unless you are really bored and have nothing better to watch!! Starts off seemingly well, but goes over the top with two girls forcing themselves upon a decent father/husband who is home alone. Things go over board when the two fairly mature young ladies become the total opposite the next morning, acting like juveniles, very unrealistically from the way they behaved the night before when seducing the man. Then they just set out to torture the poor man with no apparent reason given for their crazy insane behavior. So non- believable, as they don't explain their actions or reasons for wanted to harm and cause him such torture. And they just totally trash the house, like a bunch of teenage vandals with nothing better to do. Sorry to say but such a waste of a movie and a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning the movie looks OK, but from the "morning after" scene and on, we couldn't stop laughing. The pseudo-drama turns into ridiculous scenes, one after another, completely unbelievable during the torture moments and absolutely hilarious at the end. The two girls won't stop overacting, and their only presence is irritating from the second minute. The plot is a good one, but was very badly solved and wasted any possibility of coming out right as the story went on. Dear Keanu, we all know you will never get an Oscar, but you needn't prove it so hard. Were you really starving, or were you high on something before signing for this movie? Or maybe you were hungry for some young flesh... oops!</fullReview>

You aren't actually given much insight into Keanus family. Just a brief glimpse to make us believe he is the loving husband and devoted father. He runs around after his kids. They beg him to go away with them. I was kind of disappointed at the fact that it portrays men to be so easy to be seduced and women to be such manipulative, sex craved vixens. I can't say I can give a full sypnosis of this film as I fast forwarded Almost all of the film. But in a few words Keanus character was portrayed as a dumb ass man who gets seduced by a couple of girls who don't like men who cheat on their wives. How they find these men in the first place is a mystery, why they had to wreck his house and destroy his kids stuff, I don't know. In the end I felt like I'd been left with a bad taste in my Mouth.

		<fullReview>'KNOCK KNOCK': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new 'home invasion' torture porn flick, from director Eli Roth. It tells the story of a happily married architect; who's left home alone for the weekend, while his family is on vacation, and is visited by two seductive young women. He later learns that they want sex, as well as a lot more. The movie is a remake, of the 1977 B- movie thriller 'DEATH GAME' (written by Anthony Overman and Michael Ronald Ross); this updated screenplay was written by Roth, Guillermo Amoedo and Nicolás López (the same team that also wrote the recent slasher flicks 'AFTER SHOCK' and 'THE GREEN INFERNO'). The film stars Keanu Reeves, Lorenza Izzo (Roth's wife) and Ana de Armas. It's well made, but not nearly as memorable as Roth's other (more grisly) horror flicks!Evan Webber (Reeves) is home alone for Father's Day weekend. His wife Karen (Ignacia Allamand), and children, went to the beach; for a planned family vacation. Evan stayed home to nurse an injured shoulder, and catch-up on work. While working, and smoking a little weed, he gets an unexpected visit; from two much younger women, named Genesis (Izzo) and Bel (Armas). The girls have been out in the rain, for apparently quite a while, looking for a party. Evan lets them come in and dry off; as he also calls them a cab. When the two women attempt to seduce Evan, he has a very hard time resisting; and things only get worse from there.I've never seen 'DEATH GAME'; the two lead actresses from it (Colleen Camp and Sandra Locke), both served as producers on this remake (Camp also plays a small part in this film). I don't know how 'KNOCK KNOCK' compares to it; but I can say, I don't like this film as much as Roth's others. It's nice to see him doing something slightly different though; this is an erotic thriller, with very little violence (Roth's other movies are packed with excessive gore). It also doesn't seem nearly as intentionally humorous, as Roth's other (more gory) features. The femdom aspect of it, is intriguing though; and it's nice to see two psycho female villains (rather then a male one). The acting is decent enough, the story is interesting and Roth's directing is good; the film just isn't that funny, or overly disturbing (compared to Roth's other movies).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/rHh87mlE5WQ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laugh out loud funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is simple and kinda intriguing. Two hot girl in the middle of the night knock on the door of a family man who is home alone. They seduce him in a way no 'devoted husband' could resist and then blackmail him and basically terrorize his home and ruin his life. It promises a psychological thriller with some erotic scenes and vielleicht some gore. A nerve wrecking but unusual situation that could only be made believable by the outstanding performance of actors. But none of this came to be. Keanu Reeves has instantly dethroned Johnny Depp for being the most two dimensional actor in Hollywood, delivers poorly written lines in badly directed scenes to an extent that it is laugh out loud funny. Almost every aspect of this film is not just below mediocre but simply of-putting bad quality. Some dialogue seems to be written by a twelve year old. There is a scene where Keanu is tortured with a headphone on full volume. He is afraid to loose his hearing and shouts something in the line of "Help, I'm becoming deaf! ...My ears! ..I can't hear!". The total lack of motivation of the two terrorizing girls is to my believe the least of problem with this film. But I must say, I enjoyed watching this very much! Just like I enjoyed watching Troll 2. Later I learned this was a remake from the 1977 film Death Game, which in my perspective is slightly better acted and is more grounded in reality, but not as easy on the eyes as knock knock. Colleen Camp who is starring in the original film is one of the producers and also has a small cameo in Knock Knock.</fullReview>

To me its those obvious horror/thriller loopholes that end up bringing the genre down a bit in terms of rating but at the end of the day are a bit of inevitability when it comes to these flicks and as a viewer you can either choose to look past them or not, and depending on your approach it will likely dictate what you think of the movie. In the end it got me pretty infuriated but i actually appreciated that aspect of it, the plot needed far more work in terms of fluidity but wasn't completely let down by the acting, with some scenes having some real shine to them, It also deals with some edgy scenes in a very anger invoking and arousing way (kudos to Ana de Armas) that was very reminiscent of domination and taboo. ultimately worth watching.

		<shortDescription>Thanks, John Wick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks to John Wick, which I completely enjoyed, and Keanu Reeve's once in a lifetime performance, we're now stuck with the guy for probably another ten years.If you read the reviews, or the 'Knock Knock' forum here at IMDb, you'll see people asking 'was Keanu acting bad on purpose?' Why are people oblivious to the fact that Keanu Reeves has been acting terrible since the mid eighties? How does Nic Cage get so much heat for being worthless on screen, yet Mr. Reeves seems to slip by without anyone noticing? It's baffling, really. When I saw the trio of Eli Roth, Keanu Reeves, and Lorenza Izzo (who is the equivalent of Sheri Moon Zombie in every single Rob Zombie film,) I knew Evan Webber wasn't the only person in for a night of pure torture.We're lead to believe that 'Knock Knock' wants to be a slapstick home invasion thriller, but in order for that to be the case, wouldn't these actors have to be capable of being something other than awful? Some of you out there want to believe that the acting, the writing, the casting was done for the purpose of humor - I'm not buying it. If that's the case, I'm sure 'Green Inferno' will be one of the best comedies of the year, since we're to believe that Eli Roth's sole purpose of making films, is to make them terrible. Eli Roth is just Uwe Boll with a larger bank account - I remember the same being said about Uwe, but if you ask the man, he'll tell you straight, that he tries making the best films he can. He's just not talented enough to accomplish it. That's also Eli Roth's issue. No one wants to be bad at what they do.Random Ramblings of a Madman: Keanu Reeves has been known for his questionable work ethic, and his lack of professionalism for a while. 'John Wick,' as good as it is, does not erase the complete and utter trash that this guy creates on screen, nor does it make 'Knock Knock' a campy fun flick. It's actually one of the worst films of 2015. And I won't take part in crediting these people for ''trying'' to be worthless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well i want to start by saying that i went watching this movie without any expectation at all. I loved the fact that the action started quite fast(15 minutes into the movie or somewhere around that). Really entertaining movie and also it was one of the best horror movie i have seen in a long time. I did find the 2 girls annoying at first but the action is not at all hard to follow...The action is quite simple and it's a home invasion type of movie. It takes place in a lovely house that belongs to an architect(Keanu). He is visited by 2 girls in the middle of the night while his family is out of town. The action revolves around the fact that the cheaters must pay for what they've done.Also i really enjoyed the ending and i found it to be really suitable, the fact that he didn't manage to delete the video from Facebook and like it instead, made it a much more realistic movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm reading a lot of reviews stating they didn't like the movie for ______ reason, but I think that a lot of people are missing the point. I think the film shows (in the form of theatre), the devastation that infidelity does to a person's life/family. How a devoted husband and loving father can have everything "destroyed" over a brief encounter of sexual extramarital affairs.I think this movie was a pretty interesting perspective on the cause &amp; effect of adultery (cheating). At any moment in life an opportunity may present itself and seemingly innocuous the subsequent consequences can be devastating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor work Eli Roth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new movie from 'Hostel' director is totally boring and disappointing. The movie was as boring as 'Death Game' of which the latter is remake. The cast include experienced Keanu Reeves, even he couldn't provide the support to the movie from stumbling. The film was neither horror nor gore, instead it was a comedy which spoiled the movie. From Director Eli roth who was known for his special horror scenes, it was totally disappointing. It was just like I was waiting for the movie to get finished ASAP. Like other films, Eli was unable to display the horror in this new flick which resulted in negative reviews from critics too. I don't judge movies by what critics say, but after watching 'Knock Knock' I sure believe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a complete waste of time!!! I would not recommend this movie to anyone, you wouldn't even recommend it to your worst enemy. We only watched the movie thinking that Keanu would never act in a bad movie OR co produce something that was not a good watch, oh were we surprised. The plot sucks!!! Two teenage girls manage to seduce a 43 year old. The girls obviously have issues, but seriously, this could have been scripted better. Keanu plays a absolute wimp and there are so many times he can sort out his situation, but doesn't and cant fight two stupid teenage girls. Is Keanu desperate for movies or some 'action', why else would you act in and produce such garbage!! The movie get's a 1 from me, purely because of Monkey, otherwise I would have rated it a 0.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrific in a good way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The quality of this movie may not be top notch. although I certainly disagree with many others on here that say it was poor. The acting was good and I thought Keanu was very good as well.(possible Spoilers) The movie starts with a lovely tone, seeing the happy family and a pretty great Keanu as a a loving father. He is alone for a few days working on a project. Then he gets a visit from two girls, they need help and he is a nice guy so he helps them, they then completely abuse his giving nature and ultimately trap him and end up doing all kinds of horrible things to him and the house.What truly makes this movie horrific is the fact it seems rather real and it seems like it actually could happen. As a guy this movie terrified me. I even paused it because I was so frustrated at one point. This movie works with the real horror of powerlessness and injustice. There is no supernatural monster out to kill you, there is no zombie Apocalypse. I was not happy watching the movie, but i do think it is good. Especially considering it is truly a horrific premise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The family man Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) is a forty-three year-old architect married with children with the artist Karen Alvarado (Ignacia Allamand). When Karen travels with their children to a house by the beach, Evan stays at home since he is very busy in his work. During the stormy night, two young women knock on his door asking for help since they are lost. Evan invites Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bel (Ana de Armas) to come in his comfortable house and asks for a taxi to them. They start a conversation and soon they seduce Evan that has sex with them. On the next morning, Evan finds the girls in the kitchen and realizes that they are deranged punks and they want to punish him for cheating his wife. "Knock Knock" is a film with a moralist and feminist violent story. The plot recalls Michael Haneke's "Funny Games" (1997), with the girls trashing Evan's house and torturing him. The story forgets Louis and the conclusion is funny when the boy says that daddy gave a party when he sees the house totally destroyed. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Bata Antes de Entrar" ("Knock Before Coming in")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"How the mighty have fallen" would be the perfect phrase to describe Keanu Reeves' movie roles these days. From the ultimate height of his glory starring in the ground-breaking Matrix movies to the present lacklustre range, that makes one really wonder if this is the same actor who was so highly sought after in the early 90's. I was not a fan of "John Wick". In fact, I thought it was a pile of ..... So I was not too surprised at how bad "Knock Knock" was. The worst part of the movie was Reeves' outburst. If there was ever a lowest moment in his career, this was it. It is very sad to see such a popular actor descend into such roles as this. It really makes me wonder if he is doing it for the money, or whether his Manager is stringing him up. Don't waste your time on this pile of .... life is too short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was a dubious idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until hearing of this movie recently, I *never* would have thought anyone would remake the obscure 1977 exploitation movie "Death Game". Even if I had, I wouldn't have expected the remake to be given in some aspects a high class treatment. I will say that this remake does LOOK a lot better than the original movie, from the photography to the sets. And in several aspects it's also more explicit, though I won't spoil things by revealing just how this remake manages to do so. Apart from those two ways, however, this remake isn't quite as fun as the original movie. Now, I will admit that "Death Game" was entertaining in a so-bad-it's-good way. And certainly, this remake has some unintended laughs. For example, Keanu Reeves, as expected, gives out his trademark bad acting style, sometimes being so bad (like a memorable lengthy monologue he has while being tied up) that his "acting" provokes giggles. But for the most part, the enterprise feels somewhat forced. Because there is often a contrived feeling, it's hard to find unintentional amusement or any kind of entertainment with what happens. The movie also takes quite a while to get down to business, and once it does, it sometimes feels stretched out. (Though it could have been worse - there are tell-tale signs that the movie ran a lot longer before the final edit.)Hard to believe that Keanu Reeves apparently felt so strongly about this project, that he not only starred in it, but was one of the producers. On second thought, given his other recent movie project choices, it isn't that surprising at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eli Roth, he can confuse me big times sometimes. Then he delivers ultra gore, The Green Inferno (2015), and on the other hand he delivers...Knock Knock. I didn't watch any trailers so I didn't know what to expect. Also it was well promoted and even now stills are popping up on our telee on daily base. The fact that Keanu Reeves was in the lead did me finally pick this up after seen John Wick (2014) which I found great in his performance and story. You can see it coming, I should never had opened that door to go see Knock Knock. It's over 90 minutes of the same again and again. It do build up rather good but once the girls enter the house it's downhill. Using explicit words doesn't make a movie. Even as not that much was explained it's easy to understand that the two girls are doing it for fun. Did ring a bell, A Clockwork Orange (1971) also did a home invasion like so many other flicks like The Strangers (2008) which did gave me the goosebumps. This here wasn't intend to give you the creeps but for an Eli Roth flick I found it rather a weak flick. You can see it coming from miles that the threesome is on the way and it does, maybe for many that will be the moment of the flick itself because it's juggtime. Could have so many potential but I found it too much of the same again and again. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 1/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film ever made! NOT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave it a ten because it deserves to be seen by every human on earth. WHY? Because every human on earth should see this as the epitome of modern American film culture and finally realize that the Hollywood model has become a total and dismal failure. It still makes millions of bucks for all the greedy little whores in Hollywood but that is all it does. This film was so absolutely moronic and so totally pathetic that one can only wonder at the motive behind any sane person for making it. I think it has a lot to do with the MANSON mentality only now its young totally idiotic women behaving, well, BADLY just like the acting. As some other guy said in a review "we just want a revenge flick" Hahaha. These girls certainly deserve some retribution but what could one possibly do to a pair like that which would actually hit home? I doubt they are actually saveable and are not dissimilar to the morons from the ISIS jihadist suicide morons. There seems to be a desire to outdo each other in depravity but this flick just failed at that as well. As I said - every body should see this flick and never ever allow themselves to watch anything that has anything to do with this film production mob and these actors. Lets hope Keanu just fades away and these 2 cute assed girls get a very short life in the lime light. But, they will most probably get lots of parts because that is what Hollywood is and that is what the millions of idiotic film watchers want. Sad society indeed. Go watch it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed concept, but let's just daydream?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the story's basic concept is very much flawed even from the very start. The thing is, even in developing countries like here in Indonesia the rich's housing complexes always have security enclosures that don't allow anyone to enter without checking in to them and stating who to meet with inside. Then there's the thing with, Evan getting to be so stupid as to let those girls just waltz inside in the middle of heavy rain. And there are more things of how this movie is really stupid concept-wise. But if we let ourselves, and our already disappointed perceptions about this movie, to loosen up and continue on with the movie, we can see that the movie don't really categorize as a horror. It's more of a psychological thriller actually. Only the music is gearing the movie to be a horror, but that's about it. The acting overall is quite a contrast. Keanu Reeves did quite a weird performance here. He succeeded in breaking apart his own cool image as last year's John Wick; one scene even did this literally as Keanu is dressed in a Wick-ish wardrobe. His acting seems weird because he really nails the anger part of Evan's frustration but he really lacks on the fear side, also all thanks to his action personal image. Lornza Izzo did better than the other Eli Roth movie, the stupid Green Inferno. She really nailed the crazy psychotic girl part here. On the other hand Ana de Armas didn't really shine as her performance is very much shadowed by Izzo's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably only if you like Keanu or Eli Roth, would you ever watch this film. Either way, you know what you are going to get. Bad acting, confusing plot, with a few interesting scenes and scenarios.Well, unfortunately, you only get 1/2 your expectations.The premise is ridiculous, a father of the year candidate is 'accosted' by 2 unbelievably good looking woman (or are they only girls, sorry to ruin the hugely irreverent plot twist) who want to have sex with him and make super fun parties. The one true shining star of this movie is the charisma of its 2 lead actresses, Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas. Both take a terrible script and baffling directing choices and were the only reason I did not turn the movie off immediately.Reeves who is a perennial Razzy contender might finally snag one with his 'performance' in this film.An Eli Roth movie will have gruesome violence, mixed in with a sense of humour and push boundaries. This movie is lazy, and neither promises or delivers anything.We enter this movie with questions such as, "What is going to happen?" We end with the question, "What the hell just happened?" The acting of the leading ladies raises this movie from a 3 to a 4. Watch on fast forward!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contrary to several other reviews, I found the movie absolutely riveting, fun, and unpredictable. There was even a plot twist at the end. What guy isn't going to invite indoors two beautiful young women (who were blatantly not teenagers) who were caught in the pouring rain?Keanu Reeves made all kinds of silly mistakes, but he was in a panic and when one is panicking, common sense often flies out the window. He had several chances to pull a fast one over them, but didn't. It was poetic justice, too, because while he was initially reluctant to play their game, he soon joined in with abandon, despite allegedly being happily married.Or one could blame the wife for not giving him enough in the hide the sausage department, thus making him the ideal candidate for staking out, which obviously the girls had done. They knew about the monsters; they probably knew his life backwards and inside out.I couldn't see the point of the movie, either, but it was still fascinating to watch. And don't worry, folks! Those two will get their comeuppance with the next chap who professes to love his wife, or the one after that.Brilliant movie.</fullReview>

Did it pay off? well, watch the movie and see what you think.I don't think a lot of the 'dreadful' reviews on Keanu Reeves' performance are fair. He doesn't really have that much to do.(when you watch it you will understand)The first act bubbles nicely, then BAM! the craziness ensues. What I enjoyed most about Knock Knock is that it didn't play it safe - you never 100% knew what was going to happen next, which was very refreshing for these home invasion type movies.The antagonists Genesis and Bel do their jobs as the sexy vixens that make Keanu's life hell - Lorenzo Izzo really shines in her maniacal Heath Ledger Joker-esc performance. A very good villain. This could be her break-out role.You never really understand their motives for doing what they are doing or why they're targeting Evan (Keanu Reeves) and the ending leaves a lot to be desired, but it still makes for a fun watch, and a lesson to all dudes out there... if 2 hot chicks turn up at your door while your wife and kids are away - just send them on their merry way. :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An innocent family man plus a couple of conniving bitches equals a lustful night of corruption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From contracting a flesh-eating virus to satisfying the thrill of torturous pleasure, it's evident that director Eli Roth is constantly evolving his perceptions between heinous horror and righteous realism. Roth's latest ultra-sensual specimen, "Knock Knock", is a prime example of manifesting his malevolent evolution. Stuck home working on Father's Day while his wife and kids head to the beach for a weekend getaway, devoted family man Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) is about to face more than a tedious night of paper pushing and black coffee. After receiving a surprise visit from two provocative strays, stranded in the downfall of Mother Nature's tears, drenched in the shimmering, lustful glow of deceit, Evan can only exhibit the helpful, gentleman-like persona that he is, and invite these devilish dwellers into his home. What started out as an innocent gesture only took a turn for the absolute worst (well, depending on how you evaluate the overall situation), as our scruffy, stringy-haired protagonist gets thrusted into what would only be another man's (or woman's) voyeuristic fantasy. From a thrilling threesome to tantalizing taunts, Roth's unorthodox direction of a seemingly soft-core porn with a blend of sheer suspense shows his versatility, and possibly delving further into what his fiendish fetishes just might entail. Reeves, who just seems out of his element for this role, feels like he's forcing the emotions of his character most of the time. As for our diabolical duo running amuck on this innocent bastard, Lorenza Izzo hits the high notes perfectly for taking the lead bitch role as Genesis, as her sidekick Bel (Ana de Armas) follows suit well enough to concoct a recipe for disaster credible enough to fool just about anyone in good old Evan's sinful situation. The comic relief peppered throughout is necessary to balance the heartbreaking reality of a family broken by temptation. There's no doubt that "Knock Knock" is bound to resurrect the PTSD of infidelity for some, whereas others will become enthralled in the unlikelihood of a similar situation ever presenting itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film like Knock Knock defensively positions itself as a comedy to cushion against any criticisms. If someone is offended or disgusted by the subject matter, the film's fans can simply claim that it is in on the joke of it all, and that that's "the point."Some "meta-bad" films earn this cushion. Last year's The Guest, starring Dan Stevens, would have been quite poor if sold earnestly, but it had a devilish sense of humour about itself, and paid homage to '80s films with a wink and a nod without just becoming a giant piece of garbage.Knock Knock is a giant piece of garbage. A giant piece of garbage made by a man who has little to no evidence of talent. I've always felt that Eli Roth looked extremely creepy, something Tarantino capitalized upon by casting him as a sociopath in Inglourious Basterds. It's not fair to judge someone's personality or self-merit based upon their looks. However, it's fairer to judge someone based upon their art, and Roth's -- consumed with body-horror, torture porn (remember he helped jumpstart the craze with Hostel), and grimy sexual antics -- seems to paint a disturbing portrait indeed. The fact that he cast his considerably younger wife in the lead role of this film, and then put her name above the title next to Keanu Reeves, is Hollywood nepotism at its finest. As a critic, I try to remain objective, and there are truly few actors or filmmakers I just downright dislike; there are some whose personal lives may disappoint me (e.g. Polanski), but I separate the art from the artist. But Roth's art is vile, and goes hand-in-hand with my perspective of him as someone who gets off on all this filth. I don't think there's ever been any kind of true social or political commentary to his work -- which the best gross-out horror films tend to have, including the film he attempts to shamelessly rip off here, Funny Games.No, Roth gets his kicks from getting his wife naked on camera, having Keanu Reeves -- who looks regretful in every scene, and not because he's in character -- bullied, bloodied, raped and tortured. The dialogue is terrible, the cinematography is shoddy (it basically went straight to video, which is what you'd gather from the way it's shot), the story is stupid which would be OK if the film had something clever to say, but instead Roth presents this all in a transparent attempt to shock and outrage while being too lazy to have any commitment to the material, instead hiding behind the "irony" angle and playing it out as a borderline farce.Reeves, who gained so much goodwill with last year's John Wick, gives one of his worst performances here; Roth's wife, whose name I do not recall and don't care to, is a coarse screen presence; and Ana de Armas just seems like she's being exploited here.I only gave this a chance because of Reeves, but I should have known better when I saw Roth's name attached. It is a great mystery as to why this man continues to have a film career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bad reviews expect too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely give reviews on here but felt i have to give this great film one to try to counteract the bad reviews it has somehow gained from people who always expect a blockbuster and will settle for nothing less, you guys have got it so wrong and need to re-watch it, it's almost like you were watching a different film.It had me gripped from the start because in my opinion the acting (mainly Keanu) was amazing and convincing, the ending i thought was good even if it wasn't what i thought it would be, but that's what i want from films...unpredictability.I just want to also add that not all men are the same, i love my partner and have done for 38 years i guarantee no amount of flirting etc would tempt me to cheat, we both look but don't touch and that suits me fine, yes the girls were pretty but to me, my partner is 10 times as pretty and i'm sure there's a lot of men out there who feel the same.</fullReview>

But what do I have to say about the movie and why did I give it a ten? well I have never seen a movie in my life that made me so angry! In almost every seen I become outraged wanting to do something and my mind could not accept what that my eyes are seeing I wanted to change the story make it better and in the end I was excited and happy that for me this nightmare was over.. excellent acting and I hope not to see a movie like that in the near future nor in real life:)...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining, yet somewhat comical thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a dream roughly 100% of men have had. And yet it turns into one mans worst nightmare. Evan's (Keanu Reeves) ridiculously cliché happy family have left him alone for the weekend, presumably to buy more 'Worlds Best Dad' mugs. That's when two young ladies lost in rainstorm find themselves at his door.The film from here on can be split into two major parts. The first, Evan's seduction. Which was generally well done and convincingly acted by both Keanu and the two girls. It was easy to empathize with Evan as he battled with his worries, his guilt and his desire to give in to the temptresses.The second half of the film is where things get a little shaky. The girls return to Evan, to punish him for his infidelity. And while they are both believably crazy. the scenes very rarely have moments of tension. In fact the set pieces bring more humor than anything else. It has all the standard thriller tropes, a very weak 'torture' scene, a shocking revelation and even a scene where Evan snaps. They were all met by laughter from the audience.The only danger is from Evan's fear of what will happen when his wife finds out. And even that is dispelled by the end in a scene which very clearly leaves him looking like a victim. Overall it was somewhat enjoyable, but not for the reasons Eli Roth would of hoped I imagine. And I can't help but wonder. What came first, The protagonist being named Evan or that horrible knock,knock joke/pun at the end that relied on the protagonist's name being Evan?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth your time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, we thought that this movie was actually quite good. Of course because of Reeves playing in it, you expect a great production and cast. It is a SMALL budget production. Very small budget, used the director's house for the filming, which is a large portion of the movie takes place, has only 8 actors/actress + 1 dog in it; 3 main roles, 3 secondary and 2 "one scene and out" kind of thing. So you can't be expecting anything grandiose. Now, that being said, and if you are willing to give it a go, you will not be disappointed. The suspense is intense in a jaw dropping way, and Roth DID do a good job in keeping the viewers guessing all the way. Reeves was amazing as always. He took this very challenging role because he never had a go at anything like it and you are not gonna believe he took this role but he did, and there he is, and it is awesome. He definitely was out of his comfort zone and am glad he took a chance because of course; he rocked it. You will see some acting skills of his that you never thought you'd ever see, or thought he had. So if you are a fan of films with intense suspense as well as outside the box kind of stories, this one is for you..... and of course a plus if you're a Keanu Reeves fan !! Enjoy !!</fullReview>

He gets mad but remains powerless.Two under age girls beat him in fights, he trips when he tries to escape, in a fight he gets stabbed with a fork and passes out.There is a hand gun, but he never thinks to get it until the girls find it first.An accidental death, the hallmark of bad movies everywhere. Yes another man loses to these girls...Unless you get turned on by underage sex, or getting beat up, and tortured, I'd pass and watch just about any other movie.</fullReview>

And in the end, the guy loses from these 2 skinny girls after a series of getting away from them(sorry spoiler alert). Watching this you will loose all your emotions and questions in mind. You will not react at all and overeat and watch aquarium channel instead.

		<fullReview>So... I took the time to watch Knock Knock (2015) and I must say I didn't expect much giving the trailer. This film plays on a story- line that has been used in many movies in so many different ways, yet it's a story that seems to always work fairly well. In this film it sort of went well but honestly it was a very slow start up while expecting to see something to happen; the wait is long. The character build up with Knock Knock was so drawn out and long it was honestly hard to keep my eyes open in some cases. If I were in High School maybe the movie would've been more interesting as the focal point was basically center on the Two girls and one guy mindset. Im not sure I'd say this is a great movie, and I'm not saying it is a bad movie; it just isn't one of those films that you'd watch over and over.As the story picks up it does come with some fairly put together twists and turns though they were expected, so no surprises. Everything in the film just kind of pulled the movements of "we came, we saw, it happen, the end."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why, Keanu Reeves?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like myself and many others you would've watched this with the anticipation of seeing Keanu Reeves in a new film. Unfortunately, even Mr Reeves couldn't save this bloody awful movie. To call it a horror/thriller/mystery is completely misleading. It is simply an hour-and-a-half long piece of predictable, cringe-worthy garbage which irked me to my core. I found myself screaming internally and sighing heavily through the first part of this movie. (Not including the introduction to his family, which was sickeningly cute but bearable). Instead of enduring the length of this movie though I decided to turn it off. But curiosity got the better of me, so I put it back on and skipped through the last part of it. If I had known how much of a waste of time this movie was going to be, I would've skipped to the end at the start. The entire movie is right there in the last 5 minutes. You don't even need to watch the movie, except for those 5 minutes, and you would've seen the entire thing. Well, you probably don't actually need to watch it, period.So, if you're thinking right now this movie can't be THAT bad and there must be SOMETHING in it that's watchable, trust me and these other reviewers, there isn't. Skip to the last 5 minutes and save yourself the headache.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just finished Eli Roth's Knock Knock&#x200b; and i have to say that it is a solid film i would see again, but only as a throw back to the old stalker films like "Cape Fear" or "The Step Father". Its not like the kind of thriller that you would think it would be, its the kind of movie that shows how deranged people can be and how a mans life and come to an end. It works as a cringe comp rather then a Thriller or Horror it advertises it to be. Keanu Reeves did an OK job il say, but i think the Props go to Lorenza Izzo as "Genesis". Ana De Armas did good too but i feel like this isn't the roll she was meant to play (i've seen some of her past work). Overall, this is the good movie to watch when its on On Demand and your friends are looking for a good film to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was not too bad and enjoyed most of it but really is not a horror. The problem with the film is that it had no ending, you are just left completely in the dark, maybe they want to make a second one to carry on where this just ended, this film could have been at least 20 minutes longer, I wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this. I do hate films with no endings. I cant spoil the ending as there is not one. If you don't like films with no ending, don't watch this. There seems to be a lot of films these days that don't have endings, this was not the case back in the 70s when you would see the outcome and was not left in the dark. Make a note of the file makers etc so you don't get caught again as it always appears to be from the same director. I just don't know why they waste their time making films like this, I will never watch it again and will make others aware that it does not have a ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think dad had a party........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Evan seems like the perfect guy. He's an architect, lives in a beautiful California home, has two kids and a lovely talented wife. One afternoon, the wife and kids go to the beach but Evan has to stay home and work. It's raining, he's alone, listening to music, and there's a knock at the door. Two beautiful young girls, are standing in the cold. They're drenched, lost and just want to come in to dry off and use the phone.......He then makes a choice that will bring his idyllic life crashing down....A remake of the little known film Death Game (which starred Colleen Camp, hence the weird cameo from her) which wasn't very good to begin with, Knock Knock should have been a taut, tense thriller, with Roth hopefully bringing back that nasty humour he had in Cabin Fever.But after a quite good first act, setting up Reeves paranoia, the film just goes way over the top with the girls antics, trashing of the house, and narratively speaking, it's as messy as the house ends up toward the end.Which is one hell of a shame, as the film had so much potential, the house is beautiful, and as one of the characters says to Reeves toward the middle of the second act, his performance was pretty good.Then the girls return.It's well known that Reeves is a star, a bona fide movie star, but it's also well known that he isn't the best actor in the world, and when he is in terrorised mode in this, it's some of the worst acting the mans ever done, it's almost as if the films trying to parody itself, but the girls are just too bonkers for the film to be self referential.And I'm sorry if I have offended any fans of Reeves, I like the films he's in, he made films like Speed, The Matrix, John Wick, and even Johnny Mnemonic as iconic as they are today (the last one for different reasons). But he's not a thespian of Branagh standards.So it starts off really well, but instead of focusing on the threats of prison, and Evans fear of being known as an offender of sorts, Roth goes for the girls in skimpy clothing acting mad for the last twenty minutes, which ruins the impressive build up.Great references to Fight Club though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rather amazingly the film has been lambasted in reviews. It is not much, but then again it was never going to be that in this vicinity, so the question is, does it hold together? I would say it does, without needing to muster real excitement or deprecation for the twists and turns of plot. A happily married man has the house to himself for the weekend, it's a spacious house in the suburbs. Except life conspires to bring two beautiful young girls on his doorstep that night, lost on their way to a party and he takes them in while they wait for a cab. Things ensue, and you can see it ratcheting up tension of a rather ordinary kind. Something wrong with these girls. Suburban normalcy shattered and something exposed in the pieces; how manipulable a life is. In more competent hands, we'd be asked to entertain that the two girls might have been a hint in the man's mind, the world conspiring to give him what he perhaps thinks about some days. That would require an unreliable narrator.They settled for vindictive madness, turning the girls into unreliable narrators. Was the blonde one even abused ever? And they could have gone in varied directions, they chose the simplest that can make you wince. He's tied down to a chair. This is the same maker who gave us Hostel years back, except someone being held captive this time is milked primarily for mental torture, the glee of butchering someone's social life while leaving the body intact.Viewers decrying a lack of "plot development" are as usually barking up the wrong tree, saying words out of habit. We do not need "plot developed" in this or other films, it is enough to undergo an experience. The drawback here is that we do not experience either with vigor that will shatter our reality (as we do in Texas Chainsaw) or in a particularly interesting way. It's okay.If you took gleeful pleasure in The Stepfather, you might want to take a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is no 'typical' Eli Roth fare. It builds slow (we're even warned about that in the beginning; both Roth and Evan like building up the anticipation). There's a lot said with images, not dialogue. Like any good film should do. Lots of subtext there - for those who can read it. It's contained. Minimalist. Almost restrained, for Roth. Twisted, dark comedy and underneath that, brilliant, biting satire. Roth and Lopez don't spare anything or anyone. And because of that, reading the audience's reaction in reviews and tweets is about as entertaining as the movie itself. It seems to have hit a few sore spots ;) Also, this movie features what is probably Keanu Reeves' best performance so far. He finally lets loose. So unrestrained, it's beautiful to watch.</fullReview>

One stormy night on fathers day, 2 young bimbos show up at Evan's door shivering cold &amp; supposingly lost. They then seduce him, sleep with him &amp; then turn on film. Simple. Though that wasn't a bad thing.They then turn on Evan &amp; "play a game" by destroying his house, torturing him &amp; basically ruining his life. The film was mediocre. I mean I liked the fact it was messed up &amp; was horrible. But it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The ending I felt was just designed to p!$$ the audience off! As it was a lose ending ending as it were. It just left me with loads of questions. Why were they spying on him? How did they spy on him? How did they know who he was? Why ruin his life? And the list goes on &amp; on.The film was dark &amp; twisted as I said &amp; didn't fail in that department. Like when Louis got his head hit on the sculpture &amp; how the girls vandalized the entire house. Though it was predictable &amp; had some really annoying parts, but aside from that it was watchable to a point.The ending was bad &amp; just utter crap! There's no way you can post a sex video on Facebook. Furthermore they knew what they were doing from the start &amp; they ruined Evans life because they enjoyed it. Also I would've loved to have seen Evan get back at the girls &amp; kill them or pin something on them etc. But it was just an empty ending that just didn't cut if for me! Evan didn't get them back &amp; they got away with it, so the ending led on to believe! Hated it!! Anyway they'd get caught somehow, their faces were all over the net at the end of the film!

Like Ruggero Deodato's LAST HOUSE ON DEAD END STREET, after his cannibal themed films, Knock Knock is a smaller feature, but with a potential to turn up a future classic of cable TV. It's a B movie funny as hell, has a nice build up of sexual tension at the first part and an hilarious ending. Forget if the acting is not great, because the acting wasn't the purpose of the director, neither it was important in the 80's thrillers that KNOCK KNOCK pays tribute to. The important here is the dangerous ride, the good looking girls, Keanu Reeves facial expressions, the music and the jokes. Just drink a beer and enjoy the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>boring and disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cinematic excellence of Ex Machina, It follows, and 50 Shades Of Grey at the turn of the year now seem like a distant memory. If you go to the cinema now you get dross like this, when will they ever learn how to make money? In recent years most cinemas didn't bother with the potentially bankable Maniac, No One Lives, and Human Centipede. As a matter of fact this starts off like Human Centipede does, which is the biggest insult possible to the brilliant HC. Actresses who think slippers, wedges and woolly socks are sexy, camera staff who don't know where to point the camera, questionable sex which is so fast and distorted it is somewhere between boring and unwatchable, very little gore, and a shower scene which is a bad boring joke, that's what you get here. Any adult ratings must have been self-certified, and it is difficult to believe this is the Eli Roth who Directed Cabin Fever and Hostel. He badly needs a course in Camera and calling himself Eli is an insult to Let The Right One In. I can't think of a bigger turnoff than being physically abused by two unsexy actresses, or having to watch them from a theatre circle for that matter. Lovers of pure sexy horror give this one a wide berth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who's There? The most messed up movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eli Roth just came out with a movie earlier this years called the Green Inferno, which featured some of the same actors from that movie. Think I like Knock Knock better, however.Not as surprising as it sounds, Keanu Reeves stars in this movie. He plays a husband and a father who has to stay home and work on father's day when two hot young chicks come to his door and persuaded him to commit the ultimate male fantasy, that of course turns into his worse nightmare.The movie goes very extreme in the consequences of being accountable for your actions and leaves you with this incredible "WTF" taste in your mouth that truly messes with your head.Elit Roth's tendency to be very over the top and campy with writing and directing seems to work best when he's being less gory and just destructive with his form of Torture. The movie beats you over the head with it's dumb dialog which adds to the camp and only makes it more amusing, which I'm sure was the point.Plus, Neo himself was most excellent in this flick. I don't think I've ever seen Reeves act so lively in a film in a long time. He's usually so dry, but he really got into the spirit of the movie. Most Non heinous.This movie was worth seeing just for the sheer ludicrousness of the whole set-up. You won't be able not to enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well it was at least amusing to a degree, despite it's stupidity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the main reason why I wanted to check this movie out was because it has Keanu Reeves in it. One of the most liked bad actor in the business. Despite the premise not being all that original, I wanted to see how Keanu would play the role of the guy getting tormented. Watching this movie was like watching "The Human Centipede (First Sequence)". Except instead of the 2 girl that knock on the door of a stranger getting tortured, it's the other way around where the roles are reversed. And reminded me of the movie "Hard Candy" except nowhere near as engraving. This is another exploitation by Eli Roth, that is more about the amusement factor over intense suspense factor. For a Eli Roth movie, surprisingly it's not as brutal or gruesome as I thought it would be. As a matter of fact there really isn't much blood in this movie. Sure, there is elements of human nature that did get slightly interesting, but it contradicts itself quite a bit. This movie is mostly a amusing silly parody. Especially Keanu Reeves who actually looked like he was trying to parody himself in a movie he is in. This is a pretty bad movie, not awful but a ridiculously bad movie. And I think that was the intention of Eli Roth, to make a bad movie that could become a cult flick. I give this movie a 5/10.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Never Ceases to Surprise Me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And by he I mean Keanu Reeves. Very interesting movie choice for him to make. I will freely cop to enjoying the early exposition parts more than the later torture of Evan. The implied sex is very hot. Clearly a first class production in every way. One scene with Evan asleep with a girl on either side of him takes full advantage of the physical beauty of the three of them.Evan's "free pizza" speech is golden. The director, Eli Roth has admitted that Keanu riffed on the script in rehearsal and they used every word he said for the final cut that was done in one take. Lorenza and Ana are so lovely I almost wished they were not total psychopaths in this movie. Overall it is psychological thriller that builds and put me in mind of Play Misty for Me. And the moral of the story is that any happily married man will succumb to the free pizza when his authentic needs/appetite are not being met, even when he tries hard to fight off the temptations...Hello? There is no free pizza.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>made me think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The humor surprises if you can take a distance from it and don't take it every scene too serious.During and especially after the movie it make me think. Apart from what made these girls so disturbed (because it doesn't add anything extra plus would have kept up the tempo) |I think the girls are right. The sort of prove that every almost every man had his own life-agenda besides taking care for his wife and children.I do think that men are not clever enough to use their brain at the right moment(excitement makes you stop thinking sober when necessary). Men are more then they would like a victim of their instincts and how older we get how better we understand an hate the fact that we will be less attractive to (healthy) younger woman. That makes us disappointed and fixating too much on girls which are way too young.Our brains know this, and our instinct denies this..Rob</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall a good phyco thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great to see 2 absolutely stunning looking teenage freaks tore apart a stud like Keanu Reeves..It's his best scar ass performance so far and also the two young ladies justified the role by freak show acting. Overall a good freak show-thriller.A unknown stranger barge into the house of a family man in the absence of his wife and kids and forced him to have sex with them and leave him and then return again and did sexual assault to the man by stabbing, shocking and brutally tore his house apart by destroying this house as if it is funny and the man started to take various step stop them and then eventually they tried to buried him in the ground alive.</fullReview>
