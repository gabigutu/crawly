		<shortDescription>"Inside Job" is a stunning analysis of the greed that caused the Wall Street crash.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles Ferguson's "Inside Job" is strong, fair, and rational. The director tries mightily to untangle the complex architecture of the financial meltdown that has cost millions their jobs, their homes, and their savings. If you consider skipping it because it sounds boring, please think again. My blood is still boiling.Why does this documentary leave us sunk in despair? Because it confirms the certainty that there is no one left we can trust. The fact that much of what brought the economy to its knees was legal, not criminal, signals a financial sector run by ethical nihilists who will pursue every legal loophole to enrich themselves. Human nature, you say? Then bring back the stringent regulation that gave the industry forty years of reasonable corporate success before Reagan era deregulation. The schoolyard bullies need supervision.America's bubble of private gain and public loss was pierced by the collapse of Lehman Bros. and AIG. Banks merged into "too big to fail" behemoths; safeguards were overturned; regulation of derivatives was banned; This vacuum quickly filled with money laundering, defrauding of customers, cooking the books, and stuffing of the pockets of top officers with money. Larry Summers took 20 million as adviser to a hedge fund. Lehman's CEO took 485 million, the CEO of the failing AIG 315 million. Fired by Merrill, CEO Stan O'Neal departed with a severance bonus of 161 million.When Mortgages were bundled and sold to the bloated investment banks, lenders no longer cared if they were repaid. Goldman, Lehman, and Merrill were all players. Summers, Bernanke, and Geithner all stood against corrective measures and would play pivotal roles in the Obama administration.Absent limits on the impulsive risk takers, Wall Street plunged into personal pleasure. There was never enough: penthouses on Park, private jets (six for Lehman alone), vacation homes, art collections, drivers, private elevators, drugs, alcohol, strip bars, and prostitution - one private supplier within spitting distance of the stock exchange counted 10,000 men among her customers..Three ratings agencies made fortunes bestowing unwarranted ratings right up to two days before Lehman failed, later testifying before congress that these were merely "opinions", not guides for investors. The crowning disgrace is the corruption of the universities. Business school professors consult with companies. Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia Business School, takes $250,000 as a board member of Met Life. Larry Summers, back at Harvard, continues to rake in consulting and lecture fees.The presidents of Harvard and Columbia refused comment. You will appreciate the honesty of Raghuram Rajan who wrote strong warnings and French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, who spoke with disgust of the debacle.It used to be that respected academics could be counted on to be the conscience of democracy. Now they are reduced to being interchangeable components in the conflict of interest chain that links business/government/university. Credit Charles Ferguson with a superb investigation and give thanks that we still have a free investigative press to wake the sleeping citizenry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Crash Course on the Crash of 2008</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About 30 people at the 7PM show in the Music Box theater in Chicago last nite, and I was one of them.I am always looking for two things on this economic disaster: 1) A better understanding, and 2) a means of explaining it better to others. This film delivers in both counts.For me the key sequence came when the graphics, under solid narration, illustrated how 3rd tier investors were placing bets on bets. I.e., that's what derivatives are. I always knew this was happening, but the film made it very clear. That was the break point (in my analysis of the problem).The film was nearly void of political leanings, which made it an important contribution. The only part that bothered me is that Congressman Barney Frank was framed as an expert looking back with wisdom on the ill-conceived passage of the "Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000", and, behold! Barney Frank *voted* for it. It would be better to interview all 4 Congressmen who voted against it: Ron Paul, Nick Smith, Gene Taylor and Peter DeFazio. [2 from each Party! How's that for Bipartism opposition? It took me 10 minutes to confirm these names, and I'm not even making a movie.] It is significant that a continuum of hoodlums are seen on the podium with a continuum of Prsidents: Regan through Obama. The infestation of their ilk into the Political World is there for all to see.Please see this film any way you can, and lock it in!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best documentary I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inside Job is an enthralling documentary about how the reckless actions of Wall Street lead to the near collapse of the financial sector and subsequently the deepest recession since the 1930s. This is the second film by director Charles Ferguson, the first being No End in Sight an equally engaging indictment of the Bush Administration's handling of the occupation of Iraq. Ferguson focuses on the Wall Street culture and the blatant arrogance of a half dozen men as the main causes of the financial turmoil. Inside Job begins in Iceland where the deregulation of the financial system in the 1990s lead to three banks accumulating assets almost ten times the small country's gross domestic product.It becomes clear by the midpoint of the film that Iceland is a micro example of what has become a global problem. Runaway banks have been accumulating assets through toxic loans and other manoeuvres while paying themselves lavish bonuses. Inside Job is easily one of the most frustrating documentaries ever made. And that is undoubtedly Ferguson's intention. The film is critical of Wall Street executives, credit agencies and especially regulatory agencies for the crisis.Inside Job includes interviews from IMF head Dominique Strauss-Khan, congressmen Barney Frank, former New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer and many others. Ferguson traces the evolution of the banks from a small, largely local service to an out of control industry. He does not hold back criticizing every administration since Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.Ferguson argues that despite what most people think, there were many people warning of an impending crisis in global financial markets. Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan and Timothy Geithner ignored various signs of impending doom. Not to mention former treasury secretary and incidentally former Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson.Inside Job makes the argument that the federal regulators are as responsible for the breakdown of the system as are the executives of Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. More frustrating still is the revolving door between Wall Street and government agencies.As the banks became more deregulated, the more speculation became a problem. Derivatives, and credit default swaps, complicated trading schemes that most people do not understand is what caused the collapse of Lehman Brothers sending shockwaves through financial centres all over the world.Credit agencies like Moody's and Standard and Poor gave firms like Bear Stearns, Lehman brothers, and Morgan Stanley A grade credit ratings within weeks before they nearly collapsed. And also having one of their executives standing up in front of a congressional committee and telling congressmen that their ratings are just merely 'opinion'.It becomes clear that this is not a problem that emerged from the housing boom early in president George W. Bush's second term. Rather this was a systematic breakdown driven by a neoliberal ideology supported by Ivey league economic schools across the United States.Inside Job is simply a story of bankers more interested in collecting bonuses and making more money than providing what should be an essential service. What makes it even more frustrating is that many of the key figures behind the crisis are currently on Barak Obama's staff. The film leaves us with a bitter pill to swallow.As Ferguson notes, Wall Street has returned to normal with no federal prosecutions against any of the guilty. And one of the most poignant scenes in the film comes from Robert Gnaizda, the former head of the Greenlining Institute, a consumer lobbyist group who laughingly dismisses recent legislation to regulate banks with a simple 'Hah'.Inside Job helps explain many of the complex terms such as derivatives and insurance backed securities that confuse those not immersed in the banking community. It is essential viewing for any citizen concerned about our broken system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Economics explained beautifully</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film portrayed a horrific set of circumstances in a measured and brilliantly illustrated manner. The economic issues were explained by clear, understandable graphs. Many major players appeared on camera to their detriment. The few that didn't appear were shown through press clips.The most awful scene to me was the footage of the tent city with unemployed, lost and bewildered American workers, their jobs lost directly because of the antics of the Wall Street monsters. It could easily happen here in Godzone.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I work. I have worked since I was 16. I worked when going to college. I worked between college. I worked after college. I worked while raising a family. I worked, sometimes 3 or 4 jobs at a time. I'm still working. And after retirement, I don't think I would be able to quit doing something, even if it meant being a greeter at Wells Fargo. I put in my overtime. I put in my dues. I will not really have enough money to live on when I retire, but that is all relative to my lifestyle at that time. I certainly will not be able to afford the house, but I will have some foreseeable comforts. I may not have worked as hard as others, but I have worked dependably and consistently. My conscience is fairly clean.I have never been in a position to make vast amounts of money. Most of my life I have lived from paycheck to paycheck. I am not a financial planner. I can be an impulsive buyer at times but when I get that craving I make sure that whatever I get will last me. I'm probably the perfect Joe Schmoe.I watched this film. I don't know why. Maybe I was curious about it winning an Oscar. Maybe I'm just into masochistic tendencies, but I did watch it all the way through. I sat their like the wedding guests in the Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner as he spun his story wondering how all this stuff could have happened over such a long period of time and realizing how gullible and uninformed I am. When it comes to Government, I am like an ostrich with its head in the ground: Just let me do my job, I don't want to worry about you doing yours.I don't think I am the only one with this sentiment. However, when one of us Joe Schmoes handed over billions of dollars to the people that engineered the collapse of so many financial institutions; to realize this has already happened; to realize there is nothing to be done just increases resentment.The documentary was skillfully done. The preface to this movie followed the decline of Iceland during their deregulation period. Within 5 short years they went from picture perfect to poverty, the only success stories probably laughed about over drinks and cigars. The movie then proceeds to tactfully follow the events from the Regan era deregulation to the panic of the collapse of insurance, banks and brokerage houses. It then moves on to the signing of the bailout then to the wake of their carnage in the world financial structure. The appalling fact of this is no one went to jail. To the contrary, they all walked off with billions.Matt Daemon does an excellent job of narrating the facts in a flat unsympathetic tone. The directors are quick to point out those individuals that did not let an interview happen, casting a higher level of doubt to their credibility. All in all, much was exposed and even if 30% of it is true, it is disappointing it ever got to this point.Unlike Moore, seeing this was a serious piece I appreciated the fact the production wasn't degraded by any comic relief. There was much to love and hate about this film. The production of it was crisp, clean and too the point following a well thought out introduction and ending, but you sure do end up hating capitalism by the time the ending credits start to roll.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was the last thing I wanted to see as the holiday Season sets off: A documentary explaining the World wide economic depression. But it was probably something I should have put before, say, "Burlesque." This is a serious film that has no particular political axe to grind in terms of "Republican" vs. "Democrat" since each successive administration beginning with Ronald Reagan is thrashed for bowing down to Wall Street rather than protecting American citizens from the most immoral graft and greed, that I can remember in my 60 years as a U.S. Citizen. While it's true that "deregulation" is the hue and cry of one particular political party, what occurs with investment and banking firms is so entwined with our national representatives, that it does no good whatsoever to point fingers at one party.The film opens with the simplest explanation of the impact of investment banking firms in the tiny country of Iceland. When investors move in and create a financial "bubble" for the sole purpose of letting it burst while taking off with enormous profits for themselves, the opening credits then start and introduce us to the players who would come to power with Reagan (Volker and Greenspan) and remove restrictions that had been put in place?we should all remember for good reason; regulations were set up because people had abused an open market?we see the rise and fall of the U.S. economy which became based on nothing but investment since all our "production" had been poorly managed and sent abroad, i.e. steel, automobiles, etc. What was left was goods and services and a tiny, though prosperous, "information technology." When Reagan gutted regulation and regulatory agencies, a system of credit developed where finance agencies sold risky loans to entities, and at the same time "bet" on those loans to fail, setting up a situation that the more risky the loan, the bigger the profit for lender. Various "talking heads" and bar graphs come across the screen, and they're all helpful in explaining what happened. But it's the deeply amoral points of view that get stated by people who were or are still in control of the financial banks and markets of this country that really appall.And we're left with a sense of outrage and not more than a little sense of futility because there's nowhere to go for either compensation or redress. At the end of the film "Fair Game" about another kind of government takeover, we're given a civic's speech about how the country belongs to the people and it's up to us to make it work. Here, in "Inside Job" there's nothing anyone can do. We elected a president who was sent to prevent the problem from happening again, but instead he appoints many of the same people who set up the situation and profited from the first round.I didn't find the small section of the film describing the "type A" personality of the players involved who use prostitutes and drugs to be either relevant or convincing. We see a former call girl allude to many in the financial world, but so what? There's a small dig at Elliot Spitzer, but he offers it himself. As well, we're given a psychiatrist who "can't reveal names" but can say for certain many in the financial industry are addicted to drugs and prostitutes, but so are many outside that world. It came across as a cheap shot in a film that brings forward many significant players (and names many who refused to appear in the film) and exposes them for what they are. They need no further tarnishing.I did see one area that could be addressed as a beginning of reform. Various economic professors who are brought from institutions of higher learning to "advise" the government and then return to their teaching jobs aren't?for baffling reasons?prohibited from making profit off the policies they recommend. That needs to be stopped. In most disciplines, university professors can't use their research and publications for personal gain. Those in the field of economics need the same kinds of restrictions. And students should demand it.We should all demand a lot more than we're getting from our government, but I guess we hope we're going to be one of the few to reap those enormous profits (which is a real sucker's bet). It's baffling and infuriating to watch this film and walk out into the light of day where the practices on display are still going on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Documentary makes its points without dramatizing them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Daman narrates this Wall Street/Washington-bashing documentary on the economic meltdown and why it happened, with excellent fact-based analysis and easily understood graphics to illustrate same. The case was well made and indisputable by anyone of even modest intelligence, even Tea Party members. On second thought, maybe not them.Even though it didn't get the interview cooperation(duh)of many of the filthy rich top tier culprits who greatly helped cause the meltdown, it had enough interviews with second tier players making fools of themselves to effectively show how incredibly sold out some people can get when the chance for big dollars shows up, even high ranked educators and deans in some of our most prestigious colleges who willingly compromised their own schools' reputations for money. The film showed that they too are no better than mere puppets of filthy rich power mongers when shown the color of big money.The indirect but overriding point made most well in this film is that filthy rich business people and crooked politicians are turning America into a society where greedy money power rules over anything and everyone no matter that terrible society-busting crimes are committed to do it, and that greedy riches are fast becoming the end-all and be-all for a growing number of unspeakably dishonest people, and that these sleazebags are uncaring about any fairness, decency, honesty, compassion, duty and honor that built this country into what it once was but no longer is. And, that Washington is a willing partner in all of it and that American citizens no longer have any legal protection or relief from their predatory ways that are leading this country into the abyss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I expected more from a full-length feature documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a good basic primer about the financial crisis of 2008 for those who haven't really been following this story and have little or no financial knowledge. The official description promises that if you get angry when you think about the crisis, you're going to get even angrier after you watch the movie. It delivers on that promise. Several of the interview scenes also deliver a few good laughs. The movie's main strength is the way it explores academia's contribution to the collapse. It exposes the conflict of interest of academics who are supposed to be independent, expert voices in the field but who derive the bulk of their very lucrative incomes from paid consulting engagements on behalf of the financial services industry. This is an angle I hadn't seen covered before.It also illustrates how little has changed in the American financial world, despite Obama's rhetoric. Rather than being held accountable for their role in the collapse, many of its architects remain in key positions of powerOn the downside, the movie oversimplifies the causes of the crisis. It focuses primarily on deregulation and Wall Street's incentive structure and culture of reckless risk-taking and lax morals and ethics. It also briefly mentions poor risk assessments by credit rating agencies and predatory lending, without really explaining what it was or getting into any depth on the matter.Sub-prime lending was mentioned only in a very cursory manner. There was no mention of the Clinton Administration's push for sub-prime lending to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate income people.There was no mention of the Federal Reserve's contribution to the housing bubble as a result of it's policy to ease credit conditions in the early 2000s to soften the impact of the collapse of the dot com bubble and the 9/11 terrorist attacks.There was no mention of the shadow banking system; how it contributed to the crisis and how it greatly amplified the losses.There was no mention of David X. Li's Gaussian copula formula and how it was used by credit rating agencies to justify AAA ratings for collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that consisted of baskets of higher risk debt instruments.I expected more from a full-length feature documentary. I've seen TV shows that delved into greater depth on this issue. This movie pushes the right emotional buttons but ultimately, it's light fare for those on a low-intellect diet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferguson has used the ambush interview popularized by CBS' 60 Minutes to grill both the guilty and the extremely guilty in a way that commercial television will never do for fear of offending its sponsors. The Keiser Report on Russia Today is the only exception.The film starts with the collapse of the Icelandic banks, although the banking crisis began with Public Service Announcements on talk radio pushing loans for minorities. The banks -- many of them local -- feared congressional investigation coupled with potential charges of dreaded racism, so they arranged loan packages that enabled the marginally qualified to purchase houses. The local banks unloaded the mortgages as has become the norm in the industry. You can forget about such quaint notions as the Bailey Building and Loan anymore. This bubble began in 2006, but the Iceland saga was later in 2008.YouTube has been showing a satire on the subprime crisis by John Bird and John Fortune that has aired since January 2008 which summarizes this film in 8 minutes. But, this film gets to the root of the problem by mercilessly grilling the shysters. Elliot Spitzer got air time, but even he caught the stinging end of the lash from the producer. Apparently, the vanity of of the players left most of them unprepared. The only drawback to Inside Job is the extensive face-time given to the smarmy George Soros -- the mastermind behind global financial speculation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wake-up call of macroeconomic proportions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inside Job belongs to a genre of new documentaries, like The Cove, Dear Zachary and Bowling For Columbine, that are not only made to document the background of a phenomenon but also to encourage people to do something about it. Dividing itself into five sections of a 'report', the film looks at the background and effect of the recession and its effect on politics, the world, society, the economy, public welfare, education, the present and the near and distant future.Inside Job is undeniably motivational and does well to extract the hypocrisies and selfishness of the main perpetrators and other persons linked with the crisis. Indside Job depicts the global financial from only one perspective and does not give due weighting to the alternate point of view. Of course, it does not help that the main protagonists involved in the entire affair are obviously missing from this documentary, a fact that is rubbed on to the audience time and again.On the flip side, economics, being a head scratcher for several budding commerce students by nature, the spoken narrative of figures and key personnel could perhaps have been better explained with a clearer use of graphics. However since the film makers are not lecturers it would be too much to expect them to be aware of the concepts of pedagogy.Well crafted and edited, Inside Job is a good introduction to the cause and effect of the financial crisis, it falls just short of being the definitive version. It is a good watch nevertheless and provides sufficient food for thought and plenty of opportunity for future cocktail party discussion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MUST SEE for Various Reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Inside Job at the Toronto International Film Festival opening night at Ryerson Theatre to a packed house of 1,000 or so people with director, producer, and Financial Times journalist present, and fielding questions after this eye-opening and thought-provoking movie narrated by Matt Damon who was paid at 'substantially below his commercial rate'. This is a very important movie to watch. I think it's important that we all see how and why this could have happened if we want to prevent it from happening again.Before I get to the good parts, I want to call out what I thought was missing from this documentary: a strong objective on what me, the viewer should do. What's the call to action? Should I be enraged and (were I American) call my house of representative to vent my frustration about the lack of and need for change? Perhaps. But I didn't feel that. That strong emotional reaction was missing. If that's important to you, maybe it won't be a satisfying movie, but regardless, I still say this is on a VERY important topic, and it's done VERY well, that people should see this.What was good about it? 1) It explains the events and potential complex Financial concepts in a concise, easy-to-understand manner. The director has a PHD from MIT, and it shows. The writing is intelligent, the story tells with an economy of language and is well structured.2) It is logical, comes across as factual, paints various people in often uncompromising light, to reveal a picture of Financial greed, excess, and lack of honesty in the US financial system. It shows why this picture is believable, and makes a convincing argument that this greed, excess, and lack of honesty in the system will NOT change.3) Is it horrifying? No. Some people might paint a picture of the movie like that, but for me, it was reasonable in its claims. Sure, it was hard on people and things. And it feels like a very complete and real world view to me, pulling together all the tidbits I've read/heard of into one conclusive thesis....which I LOVED.4) It did make me think, what if I became employed in the industry in the early 2000s...would that have been a good thing or a bad thing? Interestingly, it showed how doing so would and could have been very good for someone to do so (become exceedingly and perhaps unfairly wealthy), with very little accountability if things failed. Yes -- we should ALL have done so if we could. Because so many people got away with it. Greed. Excess. The immoral crap doesn't exist. The system is flawed. So take advantage until the government does something. BUt they do not. Or did not, and may not. The ugliness may not clean itself up. That's part of the message. And if you 5) So -- what to do now? Take money out of the markets. Don't support these US institutions (Investment banks/large US financial institutions). That was the subtle message for me.AND --&gt; tell everyone about this movie. To watch it. To be warned that all is not well. And perhaps someone will do something, say something, or perhaps act a little more honestly to try to right the wrongs of this world.This movie was courageous. It gets my support.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a few small flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still believe the best movie on the crisis is 'The Other Guys'. But this is a close second.There are a few minor flaws though.The most glaring is the softpedal of Barney Frank, who had pushed Fannie and Freddie to go into subprime, and was mysteriously un-inquisitive of Countrywide during the crisis. An other issue is the scenes with hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. He has great insight in the film, but his major contribution during the crisis was his outspoken criticism against MBIA, an insurance company that he was also shorting. IE when MBIA faltered (due to CDOs it 'insured'), Ackman made lots of money. This is told by Christine S Richard in the book Confidence Game. As in 'The Big Short' by Michael Lewis, even the 'whistleblowers' themselves had conflicts of interest. None of this is anywhere in the film. Another problem is that the film never distinguishes between Synthetic CDOs and 'Cash' CDOs. The Synthetics were basically a form of gambling, as they were not made of any real asset, just credit default swaps. It's sort of a weird subject, but it is kind of important, because without the Synthetics, the market (thus the problem) would have been much much smaller.The laudatory tone towards Europe is a little difficult to understand, since Europe was up to it's ears in CDOs. And one 'wall street' firm up to its armpits in subprime, Deutsche Bank, is not even American. Europe had housing bubbles and banking bailouts and other problems as well coming to roost in 2010.The positive view of the Chinese banks is also odd, since China was in CDOs and had a bank that almost merged with Bear Stearns. China's financial industry is about as pure and well regulated as their milk or toy paint industry. Also I laughed at the section about how in the US 'high tech sector' jobs were 'easy' to come by. Considering the place where I work uses software owned by a company in India and the number of underemployed computer people I know. But the film also has a lot of stuff I haven't seen in the books on the crisis, most importantly the massive conflict of interest and corruption between academia, government, and business. Especially effective was how the interviewees on this subject didn't seem to 'get it'. The book EConned by Yves Smith describes the problems with the modern study of economics, but Mr Ferguson draws us some extremely specific lines between men who worked high in government, the conclusions found in their 'academic' writing, and the industry that pays them for their 'outside consulting'. This is the most devastating part of the film, to me.And the film does fantastically with the short time it's given. I would give my eye's teeth to see the full interviews. Gillian Tett gets under a minute of screen time but she has written an entire book about how Credit Default Swaps were invented by a handful of traders at JP Morgan and how the idea was 'perverted'. (it's not really mentioned in her interview). The same could be said of many other authors interviewed.A nice Hollywood ending might have been discussing how the Swedes dealt with their banks, but... its Charles Ferguson, don't expect a Hollywood ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The financial crisis made crystal clear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A free market, some argue, has always been the key to the success of the United States. So believed Greenspan and all the main financial chiefs of the last decades. A free market will just regulate itself and allow the economy to flourish in the right directions. This theory never made much sense to me, but I am an engineer, not an economist, so I had to suspend my judgment.After watching this excellent movie, it is now crystal clear to me why the whole system collapsed. It is precisely because the derivatives market was highly unregulated: no feedback mechanism between the credit institutions, rating agencies and the investors who bought all the junk securities; even worse, banks themselves where borrowing ridiculous amounts of money relative to their assets. To make a down to earth comparison, it's like if you were driving on the freeway with your eyes closed, at full speed, and little fuel in the tank. You will crash at some point. Unless someone throws you a giant parachute. (Which is what happened with the bailouts.) The movie also touches on the disturbing role that the academic world played into this. A generation of future leaders was (and probably still is) taught to believe in the unstable financial structure, that has been progressively created since the seventies. This, without full disclosure of the financial conflicts that several faculty members have, being on the board of big financial giants, or their direct consultants.I wish most Americans watched this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is deficient in the following respects: 1. On September 11, 2008, there was a $550 billion electronic run on the banks. It took place between the hours of 9 and 11 am. The Federal Reserve noticed a tremendous draw down of money market accounts in the USA to the tune of $550 Billion dollars. The money was being removed electronically. The Treasury opened their window and pumped in $150 Billion but quickly realized they could not stem the tide. They decided to close the operation, close down the money accounts and announce a guarantee of $250,000 per account, so there wouldn't be further panic.The electronic run resulted in the first bailout legislation,. It was reported on the House floor that Congressmen were warned by the Bush Administration that Marshall Law would be declared if the bailout was not passed by Congress. Where was the source of the electronic run?2. The credit default swaps were a violation of existing federal law.3. The rating firms are financially tied to the investment bankers who defrauded investors, and those rating firms develop, sell, and rate financial products all at the same time.4. The US federal government failed then and now to prosecute this fraud. Why not interview the Justice Department and ask them why they gave these criminals a pass?I don't care what the CEOs of the investment bankers earned, and while I agree that the compensation most likely promotes and produces fraud, this film should have focused on the failure of the U.S. Federal and State governments to police and prosecute criminals. If you want to prevent crime, you need a police force. Why didn't they act, then and now?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If a bank forecloses on you, don't move and demand they produce a copy of your mortgage. In many cases, they can't." Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio)In the course of the angry and benignly biased documentary, Inside Job, Marcy Kaptur predicts what is happening right now: Banks are being forced to halt foreclosures because of faulty paperwork. But such mistakes are only a symptom Charles Ferguson reveals of the 2008 world-wide financial crisis, which involves high-ranking government officials like Larry Summers and Timothy Geithner increasing their power while the policies they make cause certain harm to the people like us who have trusted them.Like Fergusin's No End in Sight about the Iraq War, but more interesting and dramatic, Inside Job lays out logically the participation also of George Bush and Barack Obama in the global meltdown. Dispiriting are the derivative dispersal and shameful sub-prime lending that directly led to the breakdown of middle-class wealth while the purveyors of this massacre walked away with billions and no indictments. The Ponzi schemes of Kenneth Lay, Bernie Madoff, and their ilk are but small components of the charade that drew millions of hard-working, well-meaning citizens into debt and financial ruin as the value of their most cherished retirement vehicle, home value, dissipated right in front of their eyes.Ferguson's documentary style is to remain behind the camera while letting the notables indict themselves. Unlike Michael Moore, he cares not to intrude or make a character of himself, something like Citizen Kane's reporter Thompson. Except when in a moment of profound pique he challenges the disaffection of Frederic Mishkin, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors: "I'm sorry, I'm sure that your textbook is important and widely read, but didn't you think that more important things were going on in the world?"Unlike the recent screed of Davis Guggenheim against organized education in Waiting for Superman, in which teachers' unions could do no right and charter schools no wrong, Ferguson seems more honest in presenting only the facts. As I demanded of him to present the other side of the financial crisis, I couldn't think of what he could say to counter the welter of facts indicting those in front of his camera.One of the most telling moments is that of Bush's Chief Economic Adviser, Glenn Hubbard: "You have three more minutes. Give it your best shot!" That arrogance informs the documentary and our grim lives for the foreseeable future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very well photographed tour of the places and people that the 2008 financial collapse touched. Which is pretty much everyone and everywhere.What the documentary does well is explain the legal, business and regulatory triangle that was seen to be broken by anybody who actually looked. The road to disaster is well examined.Getting interviews with people you are going to slag off is not easy; most of the guilty interviewees are either still in denial, not used to being questioned or consider the whole thing academic. Mostly they hang themselves.Some of the angles are less fruitful. That the bankers snorted cocaine and used prostitutes does not imply they were loose on financial regulation.One aspect that marks this as the real deal is that it does not push the idea that bankers were naturally bad, rather that they were happy to manipulate a system full of people who did not understand Credit Default Swaps.An added extra looks at the role of academics; many of whom put their name to a system that eventually collapsed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The producers and writers did an excellent job in their research for this documentary and the interviewer was fantastic. The interviewer asked many of the same questions that we all would ask, if we were sitting in front of these white collard crooks.My conclusion is that there is almost nothing the average citizen can do to correct any of this chaos. People from all around the world have been effected by these greedy and soul selling executives who would sell their first born child if it meant they could live in riches. The same people who are responsible for this mess are now put into political power and given government jobs to help create the mess that they caused. How does this make any sense? Why would the government hire people who worked for these billion dollar companies who helped put them under and now think they can fix it? How would this be any different than allow a criminal to be his or her own judge in the court room?There once was a time when respect, dignity, professionalism and taking responsibility for ones own actions meant something. Today it is all about the mighty dollar and self destruction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar Winner, thanks to its subject more than its skills.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When reviewing a documentary like this I think it's fair to make a distinction between the subject matter of the documentary and the actual merits of the film-making itself. On the subject matter front, "Inside Job" surely deserves all the awards it is receiving (it recently won the Oscar for best documentary too). The film sets to explain the reasons (or arguably, some of the reasons) behind the financial crisis that's hit the whole world. How did we end up where we are and whose to blame? It could be a fairly dry and dull subject , and a rather complicated one too, but Inside Job, for most of it, manages to keep it simple and gripping at the same time without dumbing it down too much. Inevitably it ends up focusing more one one side of the argument (the bankers) as opposed to following the more controversial route (going against the politicians. Though they do get mentioned, the film prefers not to be so hard on them as it is on those corporate people, obviously a much easier target). And since we are all on the same boat in this never-ending financial crisis and we are so angry at the way the whole thing has been carried out and handled, we are perfectly happy to see it all laid out the way it is and eventually everyone will come out it feeling even more angry and frustrated than they were before. On that respect the film obviously really works. As a piece of film, "Inside Job" is less interesting. Its pace is very uneven: sometimes a bit too fast when it should be slow and a bit slow when you just want it to get on with it, for example there are way too many beginnings (one of them is probably there just because it plants the seeds for one of the best jokes of film later on about the instability of Iceland). Not everything hits home as it probably should and not everything is as clear as it should be. After a while one million begins to sound a lot like 10 millions or 100 millions or even a billion? it's just a whole lot of money which we'll never see anyway? It gets slightly repetitive. In most sequences the documentary unravels like a series lectures of economy: it is mainly voice over driven (read by Matt Damon who seems to be everywhere these days), visualised by unimaginative graphics and straight forward unremarkable archive footage. The real skill here seems to be more in the writing than the actual film-making. That's by no means a criticism. This isn't a film by Micheal Moore and, for most of its length, it doesn't even try to be one: there are no stunts, and, on the surface, no tricks either. And yet, everyone who has seen this film will most likely remember the last third, which is probably the closest thing to something that Michael Moore would do, and to me, the most interesting part. It is the moment the film-makers turn against their contributors: economists, journalists and professors, who are just as guilty as everyone else. Watching them sweat in their seats having to defend themselves when they thought they were just there to give us a history lesson is the most pleasurable part of the film. And because we all want to point fingers and blame everyone for their greedy needs, we probably fail to notice the slightly biased use of the editing: I'm thinking of all those moments when questions are asked off-camera just so that we can catch the surprised faces of the people who are being interviews, and then the films cuts away to the next sequence, without giving them really the chance to answer. We really don't mind though: we hate those people anyway and as long as they look stupid and guilty we are happy with it. In the end, it's great to see a documentary like this, on a subject like the big economic crisis, getting all the awards it's getting and though that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a masterpiece, I hope it does mean we are ready to chance the way people regulate our economy? 7/10 wp.me/p19wJ2-hJ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good introduction, but one-sided</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good -- a very good -- introduction to the mechanics of the 2008 financial crisis. Through the use of clear narration and uncluttered visuals, it illustrates the concepts involved and makes them understandable to most people, though by their very nature these concepts take some effort to understand.So, as a summary of the mechanics -- why did we have problems in the financial system in 2008? -- it is excellent.Where it falls a bit flat is in the characters it is able to interview. Many of the most important figures apparently refused to be interviewed, which diminishes the overall effort a bit. The ones that do agree to be interviewed and who are not critical of the system often appear flustered or confused, which is interesting and valuable in itself, but it doesn't help to further our understanding of what was going through these peoples' minds when they were making these huge bets.Maybe it is as simple as greed and deception, as we are led to believe. But there's no conclusive proof. We are left thinking that it must be so because there's no proof to the contrary.The analysis is fair from a political point of view. The facts are stated with no real agenda to blame one party or another. The financial system is painted as being above politics -- as if politicians are powerless to stop it and are just playing along.Although this title is nowhere near as problematic as Michael Moore's "Capitalism", it does leave an important part of the problem out of the discussion. That problem has to do with citizens' expectations about the type of life they want or "deserve", whether or not they can afford it. While bankers should receive most of the blame, we also have to ask why people were so willing to take on loans that they knew they could not afford or would not be able to pay back. What is it about our culture that makes this OK? This issue was not really even touched, yet it is a key issue even today, as governments take on huge amounts of debt to fund perceived entitlements. The problem from either side has not been solved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Especially right now, in light of the unfolding crisis in the mortgage industry, where as much as 60% of the mortgages in the U.S. could be found defective, this is an important movie.I found the movie very well put together with emphasis on the important lessons that should be learned. Almost at the end, where one of the interviewees says, "Wall St. controls the government now", this is what the American people NEED to know. Mr. Ferguson also makes it very clear that this is not a partisan issue, as Obama gets just as much blame as Bush and Clinton, etc.What the movie fails to show is how this criminal misconduct on behalf of the banking industry is not a disease but a symptom. The very structure of the U.S, and global, financial system will ALWAYS drag the people from one crisis to the next. Regulations cannot solve it because the system is built upon it. I am not talking about greed and avarice, I am talking about a single industry, the banking industry, enjoying a marked advantage and power over all other forms of industry.These Wall St. oligarchs have presided over the economic destiny of the world since the middle of the last century. J.P. Morgan Chase, and Citi, are banks that have existed since the days of the civil war. The mighty and powerful families at the core of the elites that have guided the development of the western world have been the same for time immemorial. Which isn't to say that certain people should be held accountable, but rather, the system fosters this elitism, change the names and faces and new names and faces will emerge to replace them.What MUST be changed is the system. Take the "money power" back from private corporations and return to the people. Power and wealth will always concentrate into fewer and fewer hands as long as the power to create money is bestowed upon a select few "experts" in high finance and Ivey League academia.Sorry for the diatribe, but I couldn't resist. And let me be clear, I am not disappointed that this movie didn't dive deeper into the esoteric information at the center of the crisis, on the contrary, it dove just deep enough.Please pay close attention to the ongoing crisis in the banking/mortgage industry which will certainly find more headlines in the coming weeks and months. Frame your mindset and understanding of it in light of the information provided by "Inside Job".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a fact of life that most documentaries you see on television have a runtime in the region of 45 to 60 minutes . One can't help thinking there's a very good reason that most why most sitcom episodes last from 25 to 30 minutes . One can't help thinking this is the perfect length to graft a series of jokes around a single premise . Think for example how often you watch a feature length movie that features a very entertaining and funny first half only to be let down by a lacklustre second half . I do think there's a very good reason why documentaries are rarely made feature length I was reminded of this whilst watching INSIDE JOB . It won this year's Oscar for best documentary and even just seeing the reviews on this page compelled me to track it down . After seeing it I did feel rather disappointed . Yeah sure it's a well made documentary featuring cinematography that should been nominated in its own right and thankfully it doesn't feature a smug Michael Moore like figure revolving around the lowest emotional denominator but there's something missing Not just something missing but too much added . When I say added what I mean is the fundamental problem that brought on the crisis is the lack of regulation in both the world banking system and the derivatives market . Once you know this things start making sense . Unfortunately this lack of regulation is continually brought up featuring an endless stream of names and players you might eventually end up confused as to who's who and what they had to do with the world economic crisis . American politicians from Reagen to Dubya ( And thankfully Clinton is portrayed as being bad as anyone else if not worse ) allowed more and more carte blanche economic neo-liberals with a cocaine habit to use what's effectively guess work and gambling to run the world economy which led to the present crisis we're in ? It's all down to a lack of regulation ? Okay can we move please because I think the point was made ten minutes ago . Oh we'll be getting the same point made slightly differently in another ten minutes ? Oh dear There's also a lack of human drama involved but I do respect director Charles Ferguson for not going down the obvious and manipulative road of editing victims of the present economic crash being cross cut with the justification of the economists and bankers saying the bonuses and salaries they receive as being deserved in anyway . This might be another filing however . Here in Britain the outcome of the slump is that all the major banks have effectively been nationalised and it's taxpayers money that has kept them afloat for the last couple of years . Wht I'm dying to know is why do I work long hours , have 25% of my earnings taken off me by the state , some of which is given to the banks whilst the head of the banks still award themselves massive big bonuses of millions of pounds ? One hope's to see a rather more cogent documentary on the subject in the near future</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great overview of causes of financial crisis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles Ferguson also directed the very good "No End In Sight" about the failures of the Bush administration with regard to Iraq and on how poorly thought-through their ideas were on that topic. His focus in this movie is also on the failure of power to prepare for what many could see was a nightmare in the making. Ferguson in this film traces the failure, and in many cases, the unwillingness of government, academic, and financial elites to make policy which ensures financial health for all. Ferguson made a lot of money as an Internet entrepreneur and can now make the film the way he wants, and it's caught on by word of mouth, by virtue of a little man named Oscar, and probably by the zeitgeist.Ferguson tracks some of the key decisions which greased the rails for the meltdown-from the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which destroyed the division between investment and savings banks, to the destruction of the reputation of Brooksley Born who had desired to put derivatives under the regulation of the CFTC of which she was the head, to the laissez-faire attitude of Alan Greenspan during his tenure as Fed chief. He interviews academics whose imprimatur and intellectual reputation were made available at a price. Ferguson also notes the popularity of cocaine and prostitutes on Wall Street at the time of this boom.Ferguson interviews some of the key movers and shakers. If they're unwilling to be interviewed for the film, a message saying that that person declined to be interviewed appears on the screen. This is nearly more damning than if they do participate as it suggests they have something to hide. Ferguson doesn't suffer fools lightly and if he feels that an interviewee is not being straight with him, he is not shy about noting this. This is to our benefit as viewers and ensures that we see who is responsible for what. The movie is paced well, Ferguson is an intelligent, detail-oriented director and Matt Damon narrates the film quite ably.If you don't know what derivatives are, this is a good film to fill you in, in a substantive and adequate way, on all the key points you need to know in order to understand the crisis. If you have followed the economics news closely, this is an excellent summary of the crisis. This really should be required viewing for all in the US.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no possible way that all of the contributors to the financial meltdown can get adequate attention in a two-hour documentary. There were many factors involved, and some get short shrift in the film to focus on what would be easily comprehensible by most viewers, and, one can safely assume, to fit the biases of the producers, director, writers, etc. It's their movie, after all, and no documentary can avoid the bias trap. None that I have seen anyway.Think of the film as a departure point. If one is really interested, they will dig deeper into the question through other documentaries and books on the subject. There will be plenty in the years ahead. More evidence will come to light, and more questions will be answered.Let it be said that this film will make you angry. It will also make you a more informed individual and a better citizen.It is not easy to get through two hours of discussion on why the financial meltdown occurred, but this film is probably the most painless way to do it. and it did it very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Global Financial Crisis, Made Simple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only knew about this movie because it won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature over the presumed favorite, "Exit Through the Gift Shop." "Inside Job" is definitely longer, more methodical and less melodramatic than "Exit." It dealt with a more serious and internationally significant subject matter, the global financial crisis. Yes, this film was really better than "Exit," and fully deserves its Oscar. (Although "Exit" undoubtedly did have more sense of humor.)The film starts from how the crisis began in the Reagan years, to the building up and eventual bursting of the financial "bubble" of the late 2000s. This was because of governmental deregulation of financial institutions that involved banks, ratings companies and insurance corporations. This led to the executives of these companies greatly enriching themselves to the tragic detriment of the little people who had entrusted them with their hard-earned money. We see how academics from no less than Harvard and Columbia are hired by these same companies as consultants. And we also see that despite the promises of change by Pres. Barack Obama, the same people who rode on the bubble are the same people heading the vital finance positions in the current government.Before I watched this film, I did not really know anything about the global financial crisis other than cursory information about the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and AIG. I was not really sure what kind of financial companies they were. This film presents the details in easy to understand graphics and narration (surprisingly by Matt Damon!) I never thought I could grasp these complex economic concepts, but this film succeeds to make me understand how that huge financial meltdown occurred. It is also a call for justice on behalf of the victims, as the perpetrators, instead of being convicted, are still very much in the game. This is a very informative and very important film. The people of the USA and the world need to know this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For documentary film making, 2010 has been a banner year. But frankly, I didn't know that that year could only get better.Charles Ferguson's Inside Job is a searing expos on the corrupt clockworks of huge, multi-billion dollar banks. It touches on how greedy Wall Street executives, and businessmen rigged the money systems through labyrinthine mortgaging investments, selling faulty collateralized debt obligations (CDO's), and by destabilizing the derivative markets. All of these actions are what would eventually lead to the Wall Street crash of 2008, where stocks plummeted to an all time low.The film is divided into five ordered and thorough chapters of analysis, making it easy enough to follow for those unfamiliar with the complex workings of the system (Yours truly, included), but never gets to the point where it's insulting the intelligence of the audience, or sacrificing the severity of the facts. The film is compelling, and even maddening, and I mean that in the best way, showing the greedy lengths of these people. The film is also smartly edited by Chad Beck and Adam Bolt. The movie just flies by, never feels repetitious, or preachy.I will hand it to a lot of the people Ferguson points fingers at, they are smart, smart enough to decline being interviewed for the film. He's a rigorous interviewer who has his topics and questions nailed right on the head, and has his interviewees shaking in their boots long before they know what him them. He places a subtle emphasis on awkward silences, nervous stutters, and fairly hostile verbal responses, as they know he's asked them a question they can neither answer directly, or with a straight face (A question that exposes their guilt).This is a remarkable movie, but don't be surprised if it Pisses. You. Off.I give Inside Job ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accessible, very well structured, very well presented ? but of course also rather depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few days after it won the Oscar I got to see this film and I can see why it won. Not only is it of its time but it goes after the villains of the day and does so in a way that is accessible without being dumbed down and is indignant without ever becoming the sort of "bang the drum" anger of Michael Moore. There were a couple of quotes that hit home with me: "what can we believe in? There is nothing we can trust anymore" said one commentator on the feeling of the public when the collapses started and, in regards the aftermath of it all another said simply "the poorest, as always, pay the most". These two quotes stayed with me because this film is the type of one that will make you angry ? angry at injustice, angry at how it could have been allowed to happen and angry that rules that apply to you and I somehow don't apply to those with money and power.However I didn't feel angry and the reason I didn't is because the film is much better put together than that. Anger comes from emotion and I don't always like it when a documentary starts pulling emotional strings on me. Mostly Inside Job lets the facts speak for themselves and, in doing so it left me quite incredulous, so quite amazed at the scale of things that I couldn't get worked up ? it was more a matter of "shock". The saying is safety in numbers and Inside Job very quickly lets us in on why that title was chosen ? because there appears to be nobody here who is guilt free. While many of the players understandably refused to be interviewed for this film, Ferguson does make the most of the access he does get and uses these interviews to illustrate key things as the narrator (Matt Damon) unfolds events along the timelines.So we of course get interviews that fill in the details but more tellingly we get people who unwittingly demonstrate the sort of apathy and self-interest that contributed towards the global crisis. Politics is in the target of course because the names just all seem to change seats every few years and, although one would love to believe that someone coming into politics can cut these conflict of interests, the film shows literally millions of reasons why this is not a realistic thing to expect. The film also adds a new target to the mix by looking at the relationship between the banks and funds and academia. Knowledgeable professors and the like are put on the spot and it is hard not to enjoy it while they squirm, get shifty, shirty or just plain look uncomfortable. I'm not sure if my favourite is the guy paid by Iceland to right a study on their economy (conclusion? It's awesome!) when it is pointed out that the title (Financial Stability in Iceland) is retrospectively titled "Instability" when it comes to his CV listing, or the guy who denies any conflict of interest with people being paid by the organisations they are writing independent studies or when he is asked a hypothetical about medical research &amp; pharmaceutical companies and has to wrestle himself to avoid the phrase "conflict of interest" in his answer.The footage behind and around the contributions (themselves well shot) is engaging as well and the film does look good. The editing down and use of all the footage is impressive ? it makes its point, keeps things punchy without feeling like people are being cut off and only once or twice did I feel that the answers or statements were being perhaps a little unfairly edited. Despite this though all of it is engaging, enthralling and rather sickening. Those hoping for a happy ending should be praised for their naivety but warned of watching this, because this is an inside job ? the poor will lose what little they have and the middle majority will continue to look up to those in charge telling us about change and reform while acquiring a greater and greater percentage of the world's wealth.A very well put together documentary that engaged me to the point that I almost forgot how incredibly depressing it all is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Narrated by Matt Damon "Inside Job" is, I can attest, an excellent documentary. I took Bill Moyer's advice and ran today to view it. It gives a peripheral glimpse at the etiology of the 2008 economic tsunami. It is well worth viewing. Yes, take your blood pressure meds beforehand if you feel as I do, angered, saddened and frustrated at the pure evil and greed that was unleashed by the few upon the unknowing and innocent global many. The heroes and the villains are clear as the makers of the documentary use their vocal weapon of choice to indict EVEN the most prestigious economics professors at the most renown colleges and universities. Yes, they are in on the scam too and even advocate for its principles so that the bomb keeps ticking. The titans of Wall Street have captured many Congresses and presidents in a system of pay-to-play politics heretofore unknown in the western world. It stuns even the most seasoned skeptic of the American political process which sanctions the top 2% in wealth reaping UNJUST rewards with the American taxpayer funding their yachts, homes, Lamborghinis and BMW's. There was and is, indeed, NO trickle down to us but a trickle UP to the rich to get richer without making a single product.I believe a reckoning day is approaching at least I HOPE it is. I will not be happy until the likes of Blankfein and his Goldman Sachs cronies, along with Richard Fuld of Lehman, Jamie Dimon of J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, Morgan Stanley Chairman John Mack and many others at the top are indicted for their alleged monstrous offenses. Curiously, it is the ones at the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum who may be spilling the beans. This could be poetic justice at its best as the songbirds could be as base as the prostitutes and cocaine dealers who may add to the chorus of pin the blame on the elephants in the room who simply loved the game of risk even bedding down call girls and paying off cocaine dealers to add to their slimy ways. It was damn the torpedoes full steam ahead no matter whom one may crush in order to reap the ill-gotten gains. The little people never matter BUT they may matter now.I will believe justice when I see it though. One should see this documentary before the fur begins to fly so one can sit back and enjoy the squirm. Naturally, these titans of greed will be lawyered-up so I am a BIT pessimistic. Still, there is a lot to tell and I think even if they get off with a trivial fine it will be worthwhile to see them sweat as MILLIONS in this country face unemployment, foreclosures and medical catastrophes with a Congress that remains deaf to their suffering. This may be the only justice the victims of a HUGE Ponzi scheme receive. In any event, sit back, watch the film and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inside Job: exposing everything &amp; everyone the 'economy' hid away from the public</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am pressed hard for words to describe the brilliance of this documentary, but I'll try. How about: A thunderous jolt of truth through the spine &amp; putting the nails in the coffin? and it only gets better...the recurring theme throughout the documentary is the feedback mechanism between the idea of De-regulation and Greed, shown through intense interviews and resonating facts by the narrator: Matt Damon.As an economist and mathematician, exposing people who I learned to view as today's 'elite' and the movers and shapers of our world struck cord with me. I read their publications, books, and studied their theories and applied it inside of the classroom...and out. Those movers and shakers are the 'Economists' or the 'Financial Engineers'.The documentary shows the viewers and convincingly argues that the 'yuppies' and the wall street's guerillas are just the tip of the iceberg, because there's a of 'well educated' and 'knowledgable' stealth army marching behind them under the camouflage title of: Phd. The viewer concludes that: Everyone has a price - even those that 'mentor' and 'teach' todays youth to be good model citizens of tomorrow. The narrator concludes that the status quo still holds well after the meltdown has passed: No significant policy change by the Obama administration on Regulating financial markets, and therefore No cure for the Greed driven mechanism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inside Job is a fascinating and enjoyable film. I have lived through various financial crises dating back to Long Term Capital Management's collapse in the mid-1990s. With each succeeding market meltdown the culprits seem to get progressively greedier and the regulators look increasingly stupid. What is worrying is that business ethics seem to be a thing of the past. Dating back to the 1920s it seems that given complete freedom to speculate, investors will act irresponsibly. Roosevelt concluded that tighter regulation was necessary to stop a repeat of the 1929 crash and he was probably right. Greenspan and his followers seem to have believed that people are smarter today and government intervention was no longer necessary. The film shows that markets can't be trusted to regulate themselves.In a recent PBS documentary there was a report Brooksley Born's attempt to regulate derivatives in the 1990s. Born was the chairperson of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and was stopped by a cabal consisting of Greenspan, Summers and Rubin. Born received no support from Bill Clinton who appointed her. Her resignation is also mentioned in Inside Job. Before the crash Greenspan was considered by the press to be almost a wise Yoda-like genius. His views carried the day but eventually his luck ran out. Things may have turned out differently had Born been listened to. Many of the academics interviewed in the film now look ridiculous for their support of big finance. In my experience academics don't really understand how markets work. They have very simplistic theories based around the idea that markets are rational and efficient. I just interviewed two recent MBA graduates from good schools and its amazing they are still being taught stuff I learned 30 years ago, which I now know is seriously flawed. Various crashes have taught me that most academic theories in finance don't really survive in the real world. It's a case of the blind leading the blind. Greenspan admitted to Congress that his understanding of the way markets work may have been wrong. However,as the film reveals, academics have often provided intellectual cover for the bankers and speculators. They are supposedly independent but they have become articulate and convincing cheerleaders for free markets. Unfortunately they have also become useful idiots. People tend to blame the Republican's for being too easy on big business, but George Bush's initiated the Enron trials and Jeff Skilling their former CEO was sent to prison for 24 years. Bush also introduced the Sarbannes-Oxley legislation. The shocking thing about Inside Job is that under Obama nobody on Wall Street was punished and the legislation he introduced has really changed nothing. He is clearly no Roosevelt. You got the impression from the film that both Obama and Clinton employed advisers that were too close to Wall Street. Hopefully after the next meltdown, serious change will happen, however don't bet on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Written and directed by Charles Ferguson, and narrated by Matt Damon, 'Inside Job' is an absorbing documentary about the global financial melt-down of 2008. It is structured in three parts - before, during, and after. The story it tells is astonishing, and will leave you angry ( as indeed it should ). We learn how bankers influenced the U.S. Government to remove the controls on deregulation, and an orgy of lending ensued, with devastating consequences. As bank after bank collapsed, a depression akin to the '30's swept across the world. It should be compulsive viewing for all those newspaper editors currently waging war on so-called 'benefit cheats'. The millions the bankers walked off with makes the sums handed out to the dole claimants look minuscule. Equally depressing is the fact that these same people not only eluded jail but were later reappointed by President Obama. Do yourself a favour and see this film. Interestingly, Gordon Brown is not mentioned once, making nonsense of the Tory/Lib Dem accusation he was responsible for the crisis!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The lessons from Iceland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a way to illustrate the debacle of the American economic system, Charles Ferguson, the director of "Inside Job", takes us to review what happened in Iceland, a country that up to recently was one of the best run places on earth. It appears that when banks were allowed to begin unorthodox practices that only served to enrich the higher executives of those institutions, the money entrusted by the plain folks saw their deposits at risk because the greed of the higher ups who decided to put the money on all sorts of illegal schemes, thus bringing a crisis of gigantic proportions.The culprit in America's case came from a financial system that allowed banks to bet against their clients' interests. While people kept losing money, firms like Goldman Sachs, were getting richer and richer by going in the opposite direction they were telling their customers to act. The selling of worthless mortgages ultimately brought down a lot of prestigious companies that had been in business for quite a long time, leaving their employees out of work, as well as the whole country on the brink of the worst chaos in its history. Charles Ferguson points his finger at a lot of figures in the government, past and present, without hesitation. Alan Greenspan, Robert Rubin, Henry Paulson, Larry Summers, Timothy Geithner, have to share a lot of the blame for the almost collapse of the American economy. Yet, most of the people responsible for the melt down are still around in key positions today. What is worse, the people responsible for causing it, were able to keep the millions they made while ruining the nation.The documentary is an eye opener, even for those of us with limited notions of how things worked in those high spheres of finance. Matt Damon narrates.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess at this point in time, most everyone has figured out that these crooks in suits, those disgusting thieves working for the big banks/investment banks/rating agencies/loan corporations/hedge funds etc. basically took everybody's money and gambled it every which way without any regard as to the results and the devastation they would cause to the common investor. Why did they do that? Because they knew that no matter how things turned out, they would make tens or hundreds of millions, and nobody would touch them. The morally corrupt mentality of the Wall Street is shown in this film in vivid colors, from the undeserved, huge bonuses that these criminals give themselves and their buddies for essentially giving the whole world the finger, to the parties, drugs and prostitutes that these "pillars of society" enjoy with our money. What this film does is, it presents the various methods that were used to line the pockets of these guys, which eventually caused the worst recession in history. No one is spared, from the bankers, loan corporations and rating agencies, to the ivy-league economics professors who get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by corporations to come up with "studies" that validate the economic practices of these same corporations that pay them. Talk about conflict of interest. For anyone who was affected by this financial meltdown, whether you lost your job, home, money in the stock market or 401K, this is a must-see movie. Just remember to have a few pills of your blood pressure medication handy...</fullReview>

But the finger is not pointed at Andrew Cuomo et al who pushed for the sub-prime loan explosion in order to allow people - people who did not have the financial resources or stability to own a home - to pursue the American Dream. And, importantly, the finger is not pointed at American consumers who speculated on home purchases - whether for themselves or in order to "flip' properties - in hopes of making a quick buck.

		<fullReview>Inside Job is an experience of documentaries because it explores the most devastating American tragedy of the 21st Century. The filmmakers document this with the swag of Michael Moore. The interviews get pretty intense, but the filmmakers do not shy away from their overall goal. This shows their persistence and refusal to settle for artificial interviews and conversations in making the film. That says a lot about their intentions. The economic crisis is destructive and the film documents both this and the scientific aspect of the crisis in the same breath without feeling uneven or bloated. That is what makes it so compelling to watch and not a piece of sentimentality or science.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting documentary, but I found it a bit tiring in some moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that the few beneficiaries of the recession from the year 2008 are the multiple experts and analysts who have been illustrating us by press, radio, television and YouTube about the causes, consequences and future perspectives from the economical crisis, which might be the strongest one in the History of humanity so far. Even like that, there may be people who want a deeper and more detailed examination of that financial catastrophe, and they will be the ones who will most enjoy the documentary Inside Job, whose investigative zeal and anecdotal density make it the definite document about "the Great Recession". In fact, it is so "definite" that it might tire the casual spectator a bit due to the overwhelming quantity of figures, names and eternal parades of "talking heads" who explain the fails from the financial system or justify its existence.In Inside Job, director Charles Ferguson interviewed bankers, professors and politicians who offer their very diverse (and occasionally contradictory) opinions about the crisis, its origin and the identity from the guilty ones. And when it is the turn of the guilty ones to appear, they explain us why they did not do anything wrong. This film's first half is focused on the Wall Street scene, but it eventually follows "the road of destruction" until leading to the common citizens who suffered the worst consequences from the crisis, while the genuine offenders of the collapse were quietly retiring with compensations of hundreds of millions of dollars...which were many times funded by the huge packages of "economical rescue" the government of the United States awarded using the money from its contributors. Yes, the same ones who lost their homes, savings and jobs.But what takes Inside Job to horror levels is that in the end, it shows us how the situation has not changed, and how it is even getting worse with financial companies merging themselves into increasingly big organizations, with a bigger influence on the international politics, and in a constant fight against the regularization from markets which already proved their ineptitude to control the finances from the whole world. So, even though I found Inside Job to be a cold, repetitive and a bit tiring documentary (despite Matt Damon's pleasant and modulated voice), I also think that it is a valuable and interesting History and economy lesson which leaves us with a clearer idea about the precarious situation from modern civilization.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you care about the future of this country, you better understand what this film is saying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmmaker Charles Ferguson takes a long, hard skillful look at the individuals and their actions which brought about the global economic meltdown of 2008. It is hard to come away from this Oscar nominated documentary without feeling some combination of anger and depression. Anger, because you see self-serving greed and even corruption among the financial leaders of this country. Depression, because you see that many of people in charge of our financial institutions today including many in the highest positions in government are still not inclined to make changes to prevent another financial crisis. If you can take a dispassionate view of this story, it feels as if you are watching a film showing you something about how the rise and fall of the Roman Empire came about in some distant time. In this case however we are dealing with contemporary times. We learn how an economic boom led to a desire among those in the financial and banking industries to make even more money as they transitioned from carefully investing their own money to going public and now risking other peoples' money for tremendous payouts for themselves. The complicated concepts of derivatives is actually made sickeningly clear as we see how investments were really bets with essentially no clear downside for the bankers but devastating results for the middle class. No place was this more relevant than in the home mortgage market where the financial guys would make their money on the volume of the mortgages sold and not on quality or the ability of people who bought them to pay them off. Matt Damon is the narrator of the film although Ferguson does much of interviews. The film is interspersed with film clips of the leading players of this giant debacle from the officers of the big financial institutions to the well known faces in government including Paulson, Greenspan, Geithner and others with major government responsibility for regulation and policy. We see the story of the march of deregulation from the Reagan, through the Bush years even including some during the Clinton White House. There is also the apparent failure of the Obama administration , despite their bailout successes , to have regulated and overseen what should be regulated and overseen. The lack of prosecution of some of the glaring criminal activities is highlighted and the obscene executive compensations ( sometimes more than a hundred million dollars ) for people who participated in very questionable actions is spelled out.It is also quite disturbing to see the failure of he academic community to acknowledge the payments they receive from interested parties for their speeches and writings which supported the unstable financial situations that occurred. (These days the medical community is usually obligated to make disclosures of potential conflicts of interest when speaking or writing ) Granted, the filmmaker is trying to make a point about the inside job, which was pulled off on the American people. There may be some other points of view, which he didn't show but interviews made with top people, and the facts presented make it pretty easy to vote for conviction if we were the jury (even without cross examination from another viewpoint). Ferguson did have a great deal of access to top people some of whom asked him to turn off the camera once they were shown their inconsistencies. The movie is well edited to one hour and 48 minutes. Most of the film is sharp and well framed. When archival footage is used and it makes a point, you don't mind if it isn't top-drawer quality. Although a year old, it is still right on the mark for today. If you have a stake in this economy and the future of our country, you better understand what this film is saying. (2011)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inside job is about the devil's in suits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout history there have been many forms of evil . Whether it be dictators who have systematically tried to destroy entire races or armies of men who have raped and pillaged entire countries . Today there is a particularly nasty brand of evil that has destroyed far more lives than most of the infamous historic figures and that evil parades around in a suit and calls itself a banker. Inside Job is the type of film that makes you really angry and i'm sure that's the emotion director Charles Ferguson wants from it's audience. This is a documentary on how people running the biggest banks in the US have managed to unashamedly fill their own pockets with billions of Dollars while shafting 99% of the rest of the population. We see how deep their slimy tentacles reach as they seem to be running the White House ,even now , after what happened to some of the financial institutions they ran into the ground. They have managed to change laws to make their vile practises legal and i despise these men more than any other.I admire Matt Damon for narrating this documentary , as these people are not men that you want to fall out with. At times the film gets a little complicated when describing how these men managed to manipulate money from me and you but not too bad as to lose the viewer.Although this film concentrates on the men running these companies i believe that the immoral practises go a lot further down the line than these so called men. I think you can even point the finger at local business and personal bankers in many countries because they know they are inflicting misery on the people they say they are helping. I don't know how they sleep at night.Everyone should see Inside Job , even if this subject does not interest you. You must see the kind of men that are currently running the world because if you think Adolf Hitler was a bad man you ain't seen nothing yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>$20 Trillion (And Climbing?!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The financial collapse that occurred throughout the world in the fall of 2008 was an event some three decades in the making. The deregulating of financial institutions in America, which allowed for rampant speculation, ridiculous home mortgages that people couldn't possibly pay back in a hundred years, and all the various financial ponzi schemes, eventually turned out to be a total disaster. When the first domino started to fall in Iceland, a tiny country with a population totaling just 12% of the city of Los Angeles, the rest followed in quick succession around the world. This entire debacle, the worst thing to happen to the world, wars and all, since the Great Depression, is what is looked into in INSIDE JOB, an extremely powerful documentary from director Charles Ferguson, whose 2007 debut documentary NO END IN SIGHT, squarely delineated our faults in Iraq.Treading a lot of the same ground as Michael Moore's 2009 broadside CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY, but without the populist rhetoric that went along with it, INSIDE JOB takes a long, hard look at the hundreds of individuals and dozens of financial institutions around the world who, thanks to deregulation, caused the financial collapse that eventually led to the national debt of the United States to double, for thirty million people all over the world to lose their jobs, and all of this at a cost estimated to be at least $20 trillion, if not more. Between the end of the Great Depression and the beginning of the Reagan era, the American economy, while it did rack up enormous debt, was still humming along?the envy of the world as it were. Once Ronald Reagan and his Wall Street honchos took over the American economy, however, the confluence of money and political influence drove to the near-total elimination of all financial regulations and the brainwashing of the American people that limitless wealth was there for the taking. But from the start, there were signs that America would have to pay at some point. Wall Street, thanks to risky stock investors and speculators, became the world's biggest casino, with real estate and Internet stocks leading the way, and eventually leading America to the precipice of a financial Armageddon. Any attempt on the part of any lawmaker in Congress to revive regulatory rules was stopped by these financial heavyweights, whose influence extended all the way to the White House via the Federal Reserve.The plummeting stock market collapse of September 15, 2008 should have provided the chance to reform the system. But as documented by Ferguson, through interviews with former New York attorney general and governor Eliot Spitzer, former Federal Reserve chief Volcker, author Charles Morris, French finance minister Christine LaGarde, and others, little to nothing was being done to ensure that this would never happen again. And while Reagan, Bush Sr., and Bush the Younger get a lot of the blame, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama don't exactly come out of this unscathed by any means. Many of the same people who caused the crisis are still in place; and unless they're removed, or put on trial and sent to jail, nothing will get done to prevent another financial meltdown in the future.While Ferguson, an academic from MIT, is by no means a product of either the working class or the Far Left like Moore is, he nevertheless delivers as searing an indictment as Moore did in CAPITALISM, though he doesn't advocate the tearing down of the entire capitalist structure. He lays out all the facts in a very levelheaded examination that is, however, quite dismaying at the very least, and downright infuriating at its worst. The loss of protections and rules have cost so many millions of Americans their jobs, their homes, and their life savings; and yet there are those who insist, even unto this very day, that financial deregulation worked. Evidence clearly shows that just the opposite was the case. And it wasn't just America that suffered from its own deregulation morass; the entire world has suffered, and continues to keep suffering.The same kind of independent thinking that drove NO END IN SIGHT clearly drives INSIDE JOB, and a more low-key but still populist rage is there too. We need to remove banks and predatory lenders from the political process and put them on a long but tight leash. More importantly, we need to permanently debunk the myth of financial deregulation being beneficial to the world, a myth still being perpetrated by our big financial institutions and those in the GOP, the Tea Party, and the Far Right media, if the world is to avoid going over the edge into a financial black hole from which, the next time, there may be no way out of whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Indictment of Economic Crisis: Best Documentary of 2010</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure to garner recognition come film award season, "Inside Job" is probably the most important documentary released in 2010. In plain English, filmmaker Charles Ferguson (also known for "No End in Sight" about the Iraq war) masterfully exposes the truth behind the very complex financial crisis which has resulted in the U.S. Treasury Department being forced to bail out giant financial institutions such as A.I.G., Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and others - not to mention the millions of citizens who've lost their jobs in unrelated industries.Other films have taken on the task of discussing the financial crisis, such as Leslie and Andrew Cockburn's "American Casino" and Michael MooreMichael Moore's "Capitalism: A Love Story." Many extensive books have also been written, such as Roger Lowenstein's "The End of Wall Street," John Cassidy's "How Markets Fail," Michael LewisMichael Lewis's "The Big Short," Andrew Ross Sorkin's "Too Big to Fail," U.K. citizen Gordon BrownGordon Brown's "Beyond the Crash" and the most recent and excellent, "All the Devils Are Here: The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis" by Bethany McLean (known for her work on the Enron scandal and former editor at large and columnist for Fortune magazine) and Joe Nocera (business columnist for The New York TimesThe New York Times, commentator for NPR's Weekend Edition and Fortune Magazine contributor and editorial director)."Inside Job" describes just how US wealth inequality is so much higher than in any other industrialized country, while explaining how the continually struggling middle class has been made to work exceedingly harder and borrow more just to get by, while productivity gains continue to be monopolized by the narrow margin of the elite. It is indeed a fact, that for the first time in this nation's history, the average American is less educated and financially secure than their parents were. This, Ferguson demonstrates, is largely due to a financial sector whose only purpose has been enriching itself as much as possible, mostly at the expense of the public at large.Ferguson begins with an explanation about how unbalanced the Wall Street pay scale is - as one consumer advocate reveals that for top bankers, no given compensation level was ever enough. This makes sense, given that the Wall Street Journal continues to report that financiers refer to $100 million as a "unit," $1 million a "stick," and $1 billion, a "yard." There is no denying the financial sector's lobbying clout, which explains how the excesses that led up to the financial crisis came to be and will continue, unless our government learns how to deal with Wall Street properly. The unbroken line of complicity is drawn from Reagan to Clinton to BushBush - all the way to the current Obama administration.By the time Ferguson has completely linked the reckless growth of the finance sector to its consequences for the state of the economy, it seems almost inconsequential and natural that in the US, "financial engineers" are regularly paid four to a hundred times as much as real engineers.Finally, as if the facts presented weren't enough, the unabashed way that certain educators have aligned themselves with Wall Street as "academics for hire" is truly one of the more chilling and terrifying aspects exposed by this film. The academic environment's rampant conflicts of interests, both directly and indirectly - by respected and revered institutions such as Harvard and Columbia Business School is beyond astounding. The fact that educational luminaries fail to disclose their board of director and consulting service affiliations while garnering payments for their nonfactual reports is equally astonishing and reprehensible.What hope can the public at large possibly have as long as economists and professors continue to submit reports and papers designed more as sales tools than factual information, from which financial decisions are being made by both the private sector and government officials? Quite simply, "Inside Job" is probably the most comprehensive narrative which relates most succinctly the causes of the financial crisis. The outrageous private gain in the US financial sector which led to massive public loss on a scale never seen before, is something that every citizen owes themselves to be conversant about. It is also clear that unless and until the U.S., along with the rest of the world, handles its addiction to greed and puts a stop to the betting and speculation that has become the norm in the financial industry - we can expect more of the same. Like any other addiction, it is first necessary that the dependency be confronted and then those involved must engage in behavioral change before there is any hope of recovery.</fullReview>

Collateralized Debt Obligations and and how these were used to sell sub-prime mortgage debt to investors. 2. Credit Default Swaps and how they encouraged the failure of investments including the Collateralized Debt Obligations. 3. How some journalists and economists bluntly warned a crash was coming, and were ignored. 4. How debt rating companies (Moody's, Standard and Poor's) took money from banks and then gave the banks' CDO and other investments AA ratings, despite the fact these investments were actually subprime or "junk" debt. 5. How Ivy League economics professors get hundreds of thousands of dollars from banks and then trumpet deregulation as an ideology in supposedly "scholarly" papers and books. 6. How deregulation started under Reagan, continued under Bush I, accelerated under Clinton, and continued under GW Bush. 7. How the post-Great Depression Glass-Steagall act prevented the type of disaster we saw in 2008, and how it was dismantled by Congress. 8. How the bankers who caused the entire debacle got away scot-free, getting to keep their millions and avoiding jail time. 9. How many millions of people suffered all over the world, losing jobs, homes and incomes, with some cast into dire poverty. 10. How Barack Obama appointed one of the guilty to be his Treasury Secretary, kept one of the guilty on as Chair of the Federal Reserve, and appointed numerous other guilty parties to key posts. 11. How significant regulation is still lacking and given the close ties of both the Republicans and Democrats to international banks, it is likely we will see more crashes and increasing income inequality in the future, and how already, this generation is less well-off than their parents. What I can't understand is why we haven't had a revolution yet.</fullReview>

This is not an in-depth thesis put together by a Harvard economist ... though as we learn, there may not be as much value in that as we once assumed! The emotions ranged from sadness to anger to disgust. There are even moments of laughter as these blatantly arrogant types weakly attempt to defend themselves - at least those courageous enough to submit to an interview.The point the filmmakers clearly set out to prove is that the mess was a collaboration of politicians (including Presidents), Ratings Agencies, Investment Managers, leaders of Banking giants, the Federal Reserve, the Boards of Directors from Financial Services conglomerates and the once sacred Academic leaders. The film asks the question: "Who can we trust?". The answer is, unfortunately, NO ONE. What we can do is learn, demand changes and hold accountable those responsible.The film give a brief outline of derivatives, CDO's, the mortgage mess, and how the Ratings agencies' "opinions" led to the demise of many jobs, nest eggs, and long-standing companies. The other thing it clearly shows is how these Financial giants profited GREATLY from the collapse of many individual investors. In fact, they purposefully withheld information and misled the general public into making investment decisions that knowingly stood no chance at success for anyone but the Investment firms.Since distrust of politicians and corporate types has been rampant for years, I believe one of the most disappointing revelations was the pulling back of the curtain on the Academic world. Those thought to be unbiased analysts and commentators have been exposed to be highly paid consultants for the very people manipulating the markets. Ouch.It is important to note that no President goes untouched here - from Reagan forward. If you believe Obama to be above this mess, you would be mistaken. Much of his official financial advisory group is composed of the very same players responsible for the deceit these past few years. Think it's going to change? Those in charge clearly bring truth to the words "Greed is good". They have no sense of right and wrong. They give no consideration to making the world a better place. What matters is how much better can they make their own life. The segment on Lehman executive Richard Fuld summed it up best. His day was planned so that he only had 3 to 4 seconds exposure to real people ... his daily steps from his limo to a programmed elevator whisking him away to his private world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greed is what killed the economy...according to Charles Ferguson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trying to find a theater for this movie was nearly impossible, but with the help of a relative who badly wanted to see this, I managed to get a viewing. For starters, this movie opens as a real teaser?with beautiful landscape shots of Iceland and a compelling score, I thought my relative and I had stumbled into the wrong movie. Shortly following this PBS nature-loving filmmaking approach, the film jumps into the meat and potatoes of this documentary, the 2008 global economic crisis.If you are looking for the reasons for what caused the 2008 global economic crisis, this movie is for you. If you are looking for someone to blame for the crisis, this movie is definitely for you. "Inside Job" takes both an insightful and an extremely biased take on this terrifying, historical event. Without giving much away, the filmmakers explore the events (going back as far as the 1940s) that lead up to the rise and fall of the world's economy. At the same time, they paint the corporation CEOs and companies as the ultimate culprits. Yes, like millions of people, I'm angry at the multi-million dollar bonuses the crooked CEOs who caused this worldwide debt receive. Worse, no criminal charges are applied to their illegal actions (some as far as drugs and prostitution). However, they're not the only ones at fault.Director Charles Ferguson seemed to overlook the fact that the government also contributed to this economic downside. Another significant contributor was the American public who continued to buy things they couldn't afford and then wouldn't pay up, which resulted into further trillions of dollars in debt. Now this is not a bad movie. In fact, it's very well-made with some great editing, beautiful landscape shots, brilliantly captured interviews (in which at times I found myself chuckling at the interviewees responses), Matt Damon's wonderful narration and not to mention the movie's thorough explanation of the events that led to the crisis. Yet once again, this documentary film falls into a typical, propaganda, agenda-driven message. I don't despise the message; in fact, I enjoyed how the filmmakers smeared the CEOs of AIG, Lehman Brothers, Goldman and Sachs, and others. These individuals are certainly to blame, but I wish, the documentary explored the other aspects I mentioned up above. My rating: 3.5/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not your usual documentary. And it's far, far away from any Michael Moore film.It would have been easy to show the effects of the financial crisis by using tear-jerk stories and interviews of distraught homeowners. Instead, the makers chose not to do a single interview with someone affected by the decisions of those on Wall Street; instead the people involved and experts are interviewed. That - and the compelling narration and structure - makes this a clever movie that never devolves into chaos.Step by step, the main reasons for the financial crisis are uncovered, explained (in simple terms, but comprehensively enough), and the people behind the scenes exposed.That the movie is able to evoke quite an emotional response despite seeming cold, almost clinical, is a pretty good achievement. That it educates as well makes it brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not an expert of any type on how banking, Wall Street, global markets, or regulations work, so what the documentary gives me, I have to except as the truth. I have no political affiliations that I follow, so it was helpful to see that all presidents from Reagan to Obama were following no more than a trail of money as leaders of banking organizations lead us down future roads of ruin. 'Inside Job' points at the male problem of being a type-A personality who isn't satisfied until they have it all, and these bankers (at Lehman Brothers, for example) were the perfect case study.The documentary is great at providing visuals of statistics throughout the entire film of just how bad things have gotten, and the graphics also explained what exactly these Wall Street types were doing with investors' money. It was very insightful in that respect. The interviews were standard fare: mostly professors, journalists, and ex- employees of various banks. Most of the big dogs of the stories were, again, absent from any critical questionnaires, and only a few really got "puffed up" and defensive as they staffers to search for the correct wording to the questions.I recommend it highly, especially if you're interested in Wall Street, becoming an investor or home-owner, and generally to anyone who falls somewhere in the tens of millions of people affected by the actions of the greedy. Buy it today. Your children will thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You would have to be completely blind in your party loyalty to call this movie liberal propaganda. I became a liberal, because of the things that this movie is talking about. So, slowly but surely, people who control our money, our loans and retirement, hence our lives and futures, managed to corrupt our whole political system. They bought our senators and representatives, the Supreme Court heavily tilts to their side, the press and the media are of no help. What I found to be the most discouraging is that the lobbyists and the bank industry in the end destroyed and corrupted the Academia, the top schools in the country. It was disgusting seeing the elite professors of economy and business uncomfortable discussing their immoral connections with big business and bankers. These professors were the biggest disappointment. I didn't expect much from politicians and money lenders ( we now what Jesus thought of them), but I had more faith in the intelligentsia. How silly of me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a fascinating watch, with many interesting sound-bytes from big names in the financial sector. This is an important film and engaging...and it held my attention throughout.To say this is a balanced film would be an over-statement. It over-simplifies (in a pedantic manner) what is an extremely complex story. Using Damon as confident narrator reveals more clearly the bias.Ferguson simplistically argues that deregulation is evil...and government regulation is good. The truth lies somewhere in between. Much of the blame of the housing bust, unemployment, etc., also lies with home buyers who knew they should never have taken out mortgages, but I didn't hear much of this in the film.Enjoy and learn from this film, but bring a critical eye along with the popcorn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Narrated by Matt Damon this Oscar winning documentary attempts to explain what/who caused the massive financial meltdown that occurred over the last few years. It's a complicated matter with banks and finance/mortgage companies taking control of assets they shouldn't, governments and CEO's blaming one another and nearly all cases the public are the ones that suffer as companies fail, jobs and house are lost and lives ruined.Whilst for most a greater understanding of the financial world and how it runs is something lacking, the film acknowledges this by trying to present this in a step by step process that highlights many of the causes and factors with easy to understand graphics and charts. Talking heads help explain a more personal aspect to events and come from an array of sources from within the industry, many of whom face a barrage of questions and statements that they clearly has them squirming.The film presents a shocking inside look into an industry that most have little understanding of but it's done well enough to make anyone angry enough about the denials by the financial institutions, but also the constant recycling of people (mostly men) with the industry and government departments that brings about a never changing cycle of behaviour. More shocking is the fact that some of these CEO's and other bigwigs not only got away with financial murder but they were and many still are paid handsomely with bonus's being handed out that were at times mind boggling - $54 million here, $34 million there, with one man receiving $161 million dollars, which leaves you more gob smacked than you can really be and is enough for you want to rip your hair out in horror.This is an intelligently present, informative film that strives to make sense of a situation that effected millions and still does to this day, it perhaps would have been better had the human impact been explored more than it was.More of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to burst your bubble but the Oscar-winning documentary "Inside Job" will not make you feel good. In fact, it will make you feel bad, very very bad; and angry I must say at some hypocrites with monkey suits who literally invested in the financial crisis of 2008 that almost caused global dinero Armageddon. Director Charles Ferguson, who also helmed the critically-acclaimed doc "No End in Sight", puts on some impressive inside moves by presenting the film's focus in a chronological manner, and by clearly articulating how the massive fraud of these financial executives caused the horrific financial fiasco which we are still paying for. Ferguson interviews several financial insiders, politicians, journalists, and scholars. Even though the film's financial jargon could be a bit too "WTFsh" for those who did not go pass Finance 1101 (present company included), Ferguson with screenwriters Chad Beck and Adam Bolt still did a fancy job in explaining the origin &amp; development of the financial crisis with modest precision; even though I did have my buddy Business Roget Thesaurus right by my side throughout the "Inside Job" viewing. I did not mind all the graphic scenes in the movie; I am referring to the graphs that Ferguson displays to ease the cerebral burden in comprehending how these self-centered, GordonGekko-loving financial nitwits destroyed the lives of so many! I also enjoyed the steady narration of Matt Damon; I guess Matt has adjusted well to also being a film narrator. 'Inside Job" is not an entertaining-euphoric documentary, but it is a movie that everyone who has bank account should see. And you can take that to the bank! So check it out. **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'INSIDE JOB': Four Stars (Out of Five) An in-depth look at the events of the past thirty years that lead to the economic collapse of 2008 and the greatest recession since the Great Depression. The film goes into great detail showing the viewer it's expansive research and key interviews with politicians, financial insiders, journalists and others (those that didn't refuse to be interviewed). It's written by Adam Bolt and Chad Beck and directed by Charles Ferguson (who also directed the 2007 documentary on the Bush administration's management of the Iraq war 'NO END IN SIGHT'). The film is narrated by Matt Damon.The film examines how corrupt Wall Street criminals deliberately sold mortgages to people that could not afford them, traded on bad mortgages to various other businesses and bet against them (making a profit on their failure). Instead of setting money aside they paid out huge bonuses to CEOs and eventually bankrupted their own company as well as others and all of their customers. Instead of firing and criminally prosecuting these business men our government allowed them to retire with hundreds of millions! Several tried to warn officials of these activities and their huge risks and were silenced and ignored. The film traces the roots of the problem back to Reagan's deregulation of the financial industry in 1981 which was carried on through Presidents Bush Sr., Clinton, Bush Jr. and Obama. The movie surprisingly holds Obama's administration just as much at fault for the continued problem, which it calls a Wall Street government. Obama has kept the same people in office that let the recession happen and hasn't followed through on his promise of more regulation of business at all (the film says).I didn't completely understand all the details of the film and subject matter but for the most part it was presented in a pretty understandable manner. The film is slow at times and done in a basic old fashioned documentary format (as opposed to the more humorous and entertaining style current documentary filmmakers have chosen to present their subject matter in). It's still not a bore due to the important, and therefor interesting, subject matter. The film is depressing, disturbing and frustrating (as it should be) and it doesn't really offer the viewer any solution or advice on what they can do to help (as it informs us that it doesn't really matter who we vote for). It's still an important and informative film though and a must see for everyone.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is certainly a much better film than Michael Moore's "Capitalism", it has an actual aura of intelligence and the makers seem to have a basic understanding of what's going on. Unfortunately, like Moore, they never bothered to look up capitalism in the dictionary or understand what the problem is. This is another bashing of deregulation while ignoring the fact that the banks during the 2008 crisis were completely backed and supported by the government and its regulations. What they did would not have been possible in a system of capitalism and without the support of the federal reserve.This might be a good movie to watch to understand what happened, but it is not a good film to understand the why. Simply pointing to one act and blaming the Republican party for being backed by bankers (the Democratic party is backed by Marxists) is just petty party politics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corporate Finance Greed Becomes Washington Policy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One interviewee references the crazy investments and deals engaged in by Wall Street which created the 2008 Financial Credit Crisis as "weapons of mass destruction." If there is one underlying point I think being made by "Inside Job", it is that Washington has become beholden to Wall Street executives who write much United States legislation that benefits their own goals, and Wall Street may need to have much less of a voice in legislative decision-making, but that is probably not going to happen any time soon. The argument made since Ronald Reagan has been that easing and in some cases eradicating certain checks and balances in the financial market, i.e. regulation, would cause heightened prosperity for all, and regulation stifles prosperity. But in fact, except for those in the top 1% income bracket and other elites at the top of the heap, wages for average Americans have been generally stagnant for the last 30 years, while earnings at the top have increased exponentially. Top financial executives who used to make a few hundred thousand a year, which still seems like a lot of money, receive pension packages and stock options now worth in the hundreds of millions, while many other Americans barely scrape by and lose their jobs and their homes.In 1981, Ronald Reagan, in his inaugural address, stated that "Government is the problem." Reagan was blaming the economic woes of the 1970's on government regulation. In the 1970's, the U.S. experienced one of the worst recessions since the 1930's. However, the reason behind the recession really had nothing to do with over-regulation. Because Europe had been devastated by World War II, the US had a short-lived monopoly on exports, particularly because its manufacturing infrastructure was possibly the best-functioning in the world while Europe was rebuilding. America fueled a reputation of having the best products and the best services in a global market from about 1945 to 1970. But by the 1960's, Europe's manufacturing infrastructure had rebuilt itself and no longer had to rely exclusively on American products, and Japan was also entering into a global market. At the same, American companies began to cut corners in terms of quality products, and the combination of new manufacturing competition from Europe and Japan caused a reduction in consumer demand for American products which plunged the United States into a recession.Ronald Reagan did not blame corporate America for its short-sightedness and its unwillingness to innovate, which is what a lot of economists now feel was partially responsible for the recession. Instead, Reagan and the Republicans blamed the US Government for the recession, and his economic advisers advocated a reduction of government agencies and a significant loosening of regulation in business. The mantra became "regulation stifles business" which therefore "stifles economic growth", even though there was almost no historical evidence to this effect. This anti-regulation rhetoric finally caught up to the financial sector in the late 1990's under Bill Clinton, and significant deregulation of much of the legislation passed during the Depression was enacted.According to the documentary, the deregulation allowed financial companies to engage in a buffet of risky enterprises which 20 years ago would have been illegal. For example, investments banks, which primarily engage in helping companies find capital for projects, could now buy and sell individual loans in the same way Wall Street bought and sold stock. The industry convinced itself that these loans were the next big investment haven, and these loans would be packaged to investors like stock. Investment banks convinced investors that these loans were low-risk high-yield investments, and therefore demand for these loans, particularly housing mortgages, began to skyrocket. Smaller mortgage companies began giving loans to anyone who would sign their names on the contracts, despite whether or not they could pay the money back, and these were sold to the investment banks who would turn around and sell them to investors.The inevitable outcome was that when many of these risky mortgage-holders started defaulting on their loans, the housing bubble ceased and prices began to drop. When prices dropped, investors stopped buying these loans and investments. And companies like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were holding billions of dollars of "toxic mortgages" that they had planned to sell to investors but now couldn't, which caused a ripple affect in the industry and plunged the US into a recession. Essentially, these loans being sold to investors were much riskier than the investment banks characterized them to investors. Many of these investors, including retirement and pension funds, lost billions of dollars.The moral of the story is that there has to be much more governmental oversight into the operations of these financial companies. Governmental oversight does not mean these companies can't do business, but they have to be held accountable and should have to pay penalties if they engage in fraud. Some have argued the investment banks were defrauding investors, and fraud is a felonious crime which can result in jail time. But the sobering reality is that most of the people who advise our law-makers are not the people who predicted the crash, but Wall Street insiders who are ultimately interested in their own corporate objectives rather than the economic well-being of the nation as a whole. Still, corporate finance, despite having nearly destroyed their own industry is still fighting tooth and nail to prevent the very regulation that has helped the US prevent these recessions. It is interesting that some of the largest advocates for financial deregulation declined to tell their side of the story for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Charles Ferguson really scores a touchdown here with this revealing and truth telling doc that will make you as a viewer angry when you see the behind the scenes story of what contributed to the economic meltdown of 2008. Narrated by actor Matt Damon this doc is well researched with interviews from economic insiders, politicians, and media people. It tells step by step of the meltdown of global economics of 2008, with a cost of over 20 trillion causing an impact in which many lose not only their jobs, but homes also.Most telling is the business of seeing how the government has no regulations over financial companies and how that many firms merge together to form an unstoppable force in which they can cheat and defraud millions. And interesting is seeing the conflict of interest as many professors, and politicians will not investigate and fight companies as many serve on boards of the economic companies.It's all to common from insider trades, to selling false stock and lying with false info and paying the top man to much the middle and little people continue to suffer. And "Inside Job" reveals this all it educates and make you angry to see how the dirty and complex world of business has destroyed the American Dream, as it's clear today's kids live with less than their parents and the chance of hope and a good life is almost gone. So thumbs up to Charles Ferguson for his truth telling doc, even though it makes you angry and it hurts, it's time we Americans hear the real truth about our dirty business and political people and even higher learning is now a conflicted fraud as all three are compartments of corruption and greed tied up together. The truth now might just be our only hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK I will first admit I am biased in favour of the makers of this documentary. Many of us wanted to be one of the few that 'told' this story to society in an easy-to-understand format. Sure there are details missing.. but what's there to say, we all got greedy, the system facilitated it, and we've now created a tax burden which could last for at least 20 years or so. That's assuming of course, that we don't get another shot at financial Armageddon now that Government debt levels have shot up due to the nationalisation of the 2008 losses.Michael Moore's version failed largely to his self-imposed ego. This production is far more polished.I sincerely hope there's something positive that comes out of this - we need change and this movie highlights where and why? But as we all know, change has to start from within.good luck to the filmmakers and thanks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well constructed explanation of financial meltdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film opens with a story about Iceland and their idyllic country before the three largest banks in Iceland got caught up in taking on 100 billion dollars worth of risk in a small country whose annual gross domestic product is 13 billion. Then the movie starts and focuses in on Manhattan and on Wall Street itself. Over the course of 2 hours we learn how starting in the 1980's with the election of Ronald Reagan, the financial services industry became more and more deregulated and took bigger and bigger risks, resulting in the S&amp;L meltdown, the Internet bubble, and finally the biggest financial meltdown since the 1930's. Prior to 1980, financial services were heavily regulated and their were no financial panics. The movie does a powerful job in capturing how all of this unfolds, much better than any of the books written on this subject and I have read half a dozen of them. The film medium has a powerful ability to explain complex subjects in a short period of time through interviews, graphic displays, and simple process charts that give you a birds-eye view of how it started, why it could not be stopped, what the consequences were, and where we are now, and who was held accountable. I can't recommend this documentary highly enough for anyone who wants to understand how such a terrible calamity could take place. All of the major players in the meltdown are covered from Reagan to both Bushes, Clinton and even Obama, as well as various Congressmen, Treasury Secretaries, business leaders, academics, financial consultants, financial leaders in other countries, and all of the major Wall Street players. This documentary will truly make you angry at how our major institutions let all of us down. The movie also captures the impact on other countries which most of the books written on this subject don't. You can skip most of the books on this subject if you want and just go see this movie. Too bad it will have such a limited audience because this subject matter affected most of the people living on our planet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While the film has a good point to make, it also suffers from tunnel vision and only addresses a part of the problem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It was caused by an out of control industry" "Inside Job" is a documentary that recently won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. It's narrated by Matt Damon and his interviews are often very confrontational and effective. It is very slickly made and produced and features film from around the globe and interviews with TONS of insiders. Its focus is the financial meltdown in 2008 and how mega-banks are responsible for this.I am glad that a film like "Inside Job" was made, as we desperately need to learn from our recent financial meltdown. Times have become hard and people SHOULD be asking questions and looking to stop this from happening again (which, unfortunately, is inevitable). However, while "Inside Job" has many good points about banking, derivatives and greed and is very slickly made, it suffers from a sort of tunnel vision, as it only focuses on a part of the problem and gives the viewer a false sense of the seriousness of the problem. The film seems to blame ALL the recent financial problems on greedy investment bankers and some government insiders. While this is a part of the problem, it also tries to boil a complex problem down to a single cause. However, the government** (such as Congress and the President) is also a huge and probably larger part of the problem. Politicians who were in charge of regulating the banks and financial system now talk about 'those evil banks'--even though THEY oversaw these banks* and wrote the rules for the banks! Plus, no mention is made about government overspending across the globe--creating unfundable pension plans as well as defense and social spending that are GREATER than the gross national product in many cases! Another part of the equation is the public--a public who votes for these thieves and want TONS of government-supplied perks that cannot be paid for except by printing more money and more deficit spending. I am sure the equation is even larger--these are just a few of the problems apart from just investment banks. But to blame it all on just bankers is disingenuous and overly simplistic.*The most frustrating of all the interviews in this film were with Barney Frank who talked about the evil banks. He was the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee for years and took $42,350 from groups like Fannie Mae. Where is his shame? How is it also not his fault?! In fact MANY politicians were heavily involved in causing the problem yet get a free pass in "Inside Job". Additionally, the sub-prime loans were all blamed on banks, but in many cases US government laws made it almost impossible NOT to make these sort of loans to folks who could not afford to repay them. Again, a case where BOTH government and banks share blame. Until a documentary looks at the whole picture, then we aren't getting serious about the financial system.**While government was mostly given a pass in this film, it did take a few jabs at the recent administrations. However, not enough emphasis was placed on prior administrators and no mention of government spending was mentioned--just a need for more regulation. Again, this is addressing a part of the problem but only part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bankers, Regulators, Academics -They were all in on it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose we are all aware of what bankers have done to the economies of the Western world. Anyone who has read a newspaper over the last few years will have an opinion on this maligned profession.So isn't making a documentary about how the banking industry caused the housing and financial market collapses and how overpaid banking executives were like shooting fish in a barrel? I suppose it is but Charles Ferguson makes a very good job of it by setting out in a fairly simple way how the collapses occurred and also how the roots of it go back to Wall Street's stealthy takeover of the top positions in the policy making arms of the US government such as the Treasury and the Fed.Nearly all the people with power in these departments had backgrounds in Wall Street and once they were in position to make government decisions they didn't hesitate to favour the organisations that, presumably they had received handsome payoffs from, when they left to do the state some service. They were Inside Men, ostensibly acting on behalf of the state but the results of their actions leaves the viewer to the almost inevitable conclusion that their main concern seemed to be how the regulations governing the industry could be framed to allow these corporations as much freedom as possible to make as much money as possible.Enough about bankers though. A twist(can a documentary have a twist?) in this documentary was what we see when Ferguson turns over a few rocks in the world of the big US colleges. He makes it clear that high ranking academics in a lot of the most prestigious colleges in the US were on the payroll and sometime the boards of companies like AIG, the biggest insurance company in the US before it went bust. At the same time the writings of these academics was being used to justify some of the light touch regulation requested by the same companies and put in place, in many cases, by former employees of these companies.Some academics did not look happy to be answering questions on their links to Wall Street.A superb documentary that will probably make your blood boil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Look at Wall Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inside Job (2010)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Oscar-winning documentary from director Charles Ferguson tells the story of the economic meltdown in 2008, which could have been avoided but it seems there was just one bit of corruption after another that allowed many to make billions while others lost everything. We're given interviews with financial researchers, journalists and some of the people involved and it's clear that this meltdown could have been prevented decades earlier but it seems everyone who could have put an end to it had their hands out and were just looking the other way while so many people were damaged from what was going on. Even if you don't understand Wall Street, investment trading or understand how loans work, INSIDE JOB actually does a very good job of not only explaining it but talking about it in such great detail while never becoming confused. I think most people just don't understand how this stuff works and I'm certainly very unfamiliar with the stuff talked about here but the film thankfully made everything very clear. The documentary does a terrific job at showing the rise of these companies, how they continued to make money by making bad loans and then of course there's the meltdown, which hit the poorest people the most while those guilty walked away with bonuses and other good stuff. The documentary paints such a picture of so many dirty things that it really is amazing that it took so long for this collapse to happen. INSIDE JOB asks a lot of questions on stuff that happened but like a lot of current documentaries it really doesn't offer any answers as to what can be done. We're showed all the bad but we're really not given much hope on anything changing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film takes a adversarial position towards the perpetrators of the market crash of 2008 and its consequences. The film is narrated by celebrity Matt Damon and there is a rock and roll soundtrack, demonstrating that it is going for a wide audience demographic. Often showing candid moments during the talking heads interviews, we are shown the interviewees drinking from water bottles, sweating and stuttering on questions. The interviewer is often heard asking questions from off-screen, though we never see him, thus becoming a main character himself in the movie. At times the interviews become visibly hostile, and more like interrogations. There is no doubt about the viewpoint expressed in the film. Worth watching, and entertaining at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The American Soul has been sold to Wall Street. Every American adult needs to see this movie so they can understand what really happened and what continues to happen. I'm serious considering buying 100 copies and giving it to people as my contribution to humanity. The intellectual dishonesty that Americans are exposed to day-in-and-day-out is criminal. The factual information and the interviews were telling. I was stunned to find out that academia is also selling their souls to the financial services industry. What frauds. This is a deeply disturbing documentary. The producer is truly a server to humanity to expose this factual information. The outcome of good is inevitable. Karma rules! No one can get away with it.

		<fullReview>I must admit that I had been putting off watching "Inside Job," Charles Ferguson's Oscar-winning documentary about the recent financial collapse, for quite some time. I just wasn't sure I had the intestinal fortitude and emotional stamina necessary to get me through what I knew would be a maddening and infuriating experience (audiences who initially saw it in theaters were reportedly ready to tear down the buildings when the movie was over). But I finally broke down and took the plunge - and I haven't regretted it for a moment. For if it is indeed true that knowledge is power and that to be forewarned is to be forearmed, then understanding what caused this global financial failure is the first step in preventing it from happening again. And that's where "Inside Job" comes in.If any film has ever merited that overused phrase "a must-see movie," surely it is this one. Indeed, it should be seen by all persons, regardless of socioeconomic status or political persuasion, who care anything about the powers-that-be who control our lives. Ferguson lays it all out for us in terms we can all comprehend and cope with, no matter how literate or illiterate in the ways of economics we may be. That's no small feat, believe me.Narrated by Matt Damon, the film puts the events leading up to the crash in chronological order. The first part of the film is entitled "How We Got Here," which chronicles how the financial regulations put in place during the Great Depression - and which provided us with nearly forty years of prosperity and financial stability thereafter - were systematically dismantled, beginning with the Reagan administration and continuing on through those of the two Bushes and Clinton. Ferguson attacks the infamous de-regulation of the savings-and-loan industry that occurred in the 1980s; the dismantling of the Glass-Steagall Act that used to keep commercial and investment banks separate, thereby protecting the general public's money from being used for high-risk investment schemes; the increasing influence of corporate lobbyists on members of Congress; the continuous merger of lending institutions into ever expanding "too big to fail" financial behemoths; and, perhaps most tellingly of all, the failure on the part of the regulatory Securities and Exchange Commission to do anything to rein in the excesses. Ferguson then goes on to explain how derivatives and credit default swaps allowed banks to bundle risky mortgages until the whole financial market was nothing more than a "global ponzi scheme," destined as all ponzi schemes are, to crash of its own weight, allowing a select handful of people at the top to make off with fortunes while leaving the rest of us holding the bag.In the second section, entitled "The Bubble," the movie explores the psychology of many of the folk on Wall Street, who crave ever more piles of money and ever more lavish lifestyles while not caring who it is they hurt on their way to the top. And, of course, with this lifestyle come rampant drug use, prostitution, gambling and all manners of licentious living, often on the company dime.Part Three, "The Crisis," features some of the many Cassandras of the time ? those voices crying in the wilderness who saw what was happening and even predicted the dire outcome but who couldn't get anyone to listen to them. This section also traces the cause-and-effect relationship that began with mortgage fraud which then led to home foreclosures and investment banks being stuck with loans they couldn't sell.Then came the fall of Bear Stearns in March 2008, the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the downfalls of Lehman Brothers and AIG in September of that year. The result was a government bailout to the tune of $700 billion, worldwide recession, massive unemployment, a housing market collapse, and six million home foreclosures in the United States alone. Ferguson even visits a tent city modeled on the Hoovervilles of the 1930s where many of the newly jobless now reside.Most of the outrage, however, is reserved for Part Four, ironically entitled "Accountability." Here Ferguson shows how the very people most responsible for the collapse managed to walk away with their fortunes intact, leaving the rest of us to suffer the consequences of their actions. And to make matters worse, not a single person in the financial sector was charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one. In fact, any attempts at reforming the system appear to have gone in the absolutely wrong direction, with the major banks even larger than they were before, thanks, in large part, to the three thousand-plus financial sector lobbyists who descended on Washington in the years following the crash.Ferguson wraps up the film with "Where We Are Now," which looks at how, over the past thirty years, the income gap separating the rich from everyone else has grown into a yawning chasm, how the nation's power in the world has decreased accordingly, how jobs have been shipped overseas and the manufacturing base decimated, how college educations have become virtually out-of-reach for many youngsters, and how the middle class has been buried under a mountain of personal debt.And if you think things have improved with the election of Obama, Ferguson is quick to point out that the Wall Street "reforms" his administration has put in place are incredibly weak and that most of his senior economic advisers ? Ben Bernanke, Timothy Geithner, et. al. ? are the very same people who helped create the problem in the first place.So there you have it, a dense, fast-moving, beautifully shot look at the most important story of recent times. It says a great deal that the individuals most at fault for the crisis refused to be interviewed for the film.You may prefer to ignore the uncomfortable truths unearthed by this phenomenal film, but you do so at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a country we desperately want to respect, love, and see prosper, I would consider the situation of bankrupting society to be of utmost importance. Any marketed communications regarding perspective and solution to problems which one is to produce ought to be of superior utility for empowerment to my fellow countrymen in order for me to conscionably implore them to watch it. This is true for Inside Job's on a select group of otherwise monetarily educated people only.A few prominent characters who are involved in the ravenous and often bloodthirsty circle of slavedrivers shaping policy and betraying billions are interviewed, and it's refreshing to have their interviews remind us that the figureheads of the IMF include non-traitors. But the interviewees in this film who were cretins are largely small fishes. I do congratulate the film producer for tactfully securing and performing interviews with some of these people. They are useful indeed for breadth of perspective about the scum who are *less* powerful.However there's a largely private institution which keeps these so called "big banks" on a leash, and owns the note on every dollar, which is a receipt of debt, you think you own. Secretly, as JFK was realizing before he was ended (and began to execute Order No. 11110), this institution has all but mastered deceiving to control us through means only imaginable to those with a passion for deceit. This group is in effect a private company owned by unknown foreign and perhaps domestic investors in a cooperative called the Federal Reserve. This loaning agency, which lends every US dollar in circulation at interest (yes, nearly the entire amount of currency allowed for congress to distribute is like the funds issued to you for a mortgage on your home) has a long history which desperately needs to be understood in order to understand the private bank's currency retraction and expansion policy and how it affects business and political power redistribution, and actually our nation's progress and potential greatness as a whole.This film also doesn't touch on the absurd modification of the indices used to calculate inflation. The disparity between actual inflation and stated inflation is about as raped and flesh mangled as the disparity between the reliability of CDO's and the ratings they received from the agencies... these are warning signs modified in order to keep people naive and cause greater shifts in prices.This film might be seen as shocking or amazingly important to the naive, but this film fails to introduce the audience to evidence for the basic reasonable suspicions and skepticism that every responsible citizen must develop if we are going to see meaningful progress, beat privately owned fiat money, and make clearer the language in our constitution to disallow the disempowering con game that has been the mission of debt-based currency giants in europe for centuries.Get angrier indeed, but people still need direction. Consider watching The Money Masters for an introduction to corrupt finance. It's free online. Betrayal, dishonesty, and the necessity of the emotions required to defend democracy. Whether rage is appropriate, I'll figure out later. But it's in me, and it feels great.This film, on the other hand, ignores the deepest problems completely. Suitable for academy award, of course (cynical), because democracy is never glitzy.The dream of the founders is still within grasp, but few have been exposed to financial history.Avoid public school for children if you can help it. Were you ready to be as good for your child as you'd hoped?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Inside Job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The financial crisis of 2008 hit everyone hard of that there is no doubt and Inside Job seeks to understand the causes of this from how the crisis came about to who was responsible and what is being done to try and bring those people to justice. The overawing feeling whilst watching this movie is one of disgust, frustration and anger at the people who instigated the downfall of so many companies and who led to the destruction of so many lives both in America (and outside its boarders).During multiple interviews the offenders are at a loss of what to say and even though they do not say what they believe, it is obvious that they are merely recalling fixed statements of denial or are actually stumped at ways in which to answer the questions without incriminating themselves. It also shows the conflict of interests of the 'expert academics' who are supposed to be independent and yet gain the majority of their income from the financial sector.The director Charles Ferguson must be credited with making the seemingly complex world of cooperate finance easy to understand by introducing simple clear diagrams and visuals to help break down the barriers that could lead to confusion.The film does skimp a bit on a point that I would have been most interested in. Why did the governments fail so spectacularly to enforce these fraud claims and why still is nothing being done? This if anything adds to the emotion that you feel when it becomes obvious that the players have not only escaped charges but are better off for it and still have extremely high power positions.Overall this documentary got me reeling at the world of Wall Street with the most disturbing thing being that what they did was and still is considered legal and not criminal. Would you do the same thing though if the shoe was on your foot instead? You would like to think not but in this greed led world, it seems anything is possible.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible display of frustrated sophistication</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying that I do not understand economics very well at all. I haven't had any sort of explicit teaching about finance and a lot of the concepts are above my head. But despite that fact, Inside Job is still a very accessible film for me and I still enjoyed it and understood it well enough. It is the winner of the Best Documentary Feature Academy Award in 2010 and it is a film that takes a closer look at what caused the financial meltdown back in 2008. It is told via narration from none other than Matt Damon, as well as many different interviews with various economic and political figures, some who are honest and some who, well, aren't. The amount of corruption uncovered in this documentary is staggering and it is all told very clearly and very well spoken, albeit frustrated and agitated with the corrupt people it chronicles.I said that this film can be difficult to follow because of all of the economic jargon that goes on, but if you pay attention it isn't terribly difficult to keep up and figure things out. Everything is explained clearly, eloquently, and with plenty of key visuals that paint a clear picture of what this documentary is trying to get across. The most gut wrenching thing about this documentary is just how factual all the evidence here is. Every aspect of this film is fact based and the copious amount of research is evident everywhere. And once everything is laid out so plainly in front of you, it is shocking to see how blatantly duped the American public was by major corporations and all the banks that schemed together in order to rob America.This film has a very strong voice with a lot of anger and frustration behind it, but also a lot of education. It isn't even left wing or right wing. It is easy to assume that the director, Charles Ferguson, is a liberal based on his comments and his previous film, No End in Sight, which talks about the Iraq war and the Bush administration's handling of it, but Inside Job lays out facts and it clearly illustrates the strange and twisted series of events that led up to the 2008 economic collapse.What makes this film so strong is that it has such a clear purpose and motive, and it takes no effort to decipher the goal of this film. It wants to get the sickening facts out in the open and it wants to explain to the general American citizen just what caused the economic meltdown that has affected all of us. Also, the film ends with a mighty call to action where it really displays its motives and what it wants to accomplish in the long run. It brings something very important to our attention. And that is the fact that not a single Wall Street executive has been persecuted for their crimes and that they continue to go free for their trillion dollar crimes. The film ends by stating how this cannot continue and these criminals have to be brought to justice at the mercy of the American people who lost jobs, homes, and life savings because of this catastrophe. And it is a clear call to action like this that allows the viewer to really connect with this film, and it gives Inside Job a much greater sense of importance and significance. I can see this film as something that needs to be archived and studied so that in the future something like this never happens again.Inside Job so perfectly lays out all the facts about the 2008 economic meltdown and it makes such a clear statement on where the economy is headed and what has to be done in order to prevent something like this from repeating itself. It is a film that needs to be watched and needs to be remembered. It isn't fabricating its story and it isn't exaggerating its own significance or blowing anything out of proportion. Iinside Job chronicles something incredibly important and it tells this story with keen sophistication and eloquence in order to display its own significance. This is an incredibly engrossing film that needs to be watched by everybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inside job-How banker's mystique seduced all including the President.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This brilliant, hard hitting and courageous film revealed how the banking industry, once bastions of trustworthiness in the civilized world, caused the most catastrophic global recession in financial history. It does not simply uncover corruption and the 'legalistic' misappropriation of the public's money (bank robbery in reverse), it exposes our baser human traits of selfishness and greed, that we still espouse the maxim 'the ends justifies the means' and that those with great wealth, power and influence choose to perpetuate the self serving Keynesian statement that "for at least another 100 years time we must pretend to ourselves and to everyone that fair is foul and foul is fair; for foul is useful and fair is not. Avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little while longer still." The film delved into the high tech world developed by technicians redundant since the end of the cold war. They brought about an explosion of new products-derivatives- the new 'Weapons of Mass Destruction'. With America awash with cash funded by their new bankers, China, Collateralised Debt Obligations (C.D.O.s) and Credit Default Swaps were born. Institutions hedged against possible losses by taking out insurance cover should the insurance companies themselves plunged into insolvency weighed down by heavy defaults. The film revealed how the bubble rapidly expanded into a vast balloon of such terrifying dimensions that when it did inevitably explode in 2008 it affected all who inhabit the industrialised world, except for China and Asia. The magnitude of catastrophe was so incredibly huge it beggars belief how the culprits are still in positions of power and influence. It was implied in the film that those responsible either did not fully comprehend the consequences of their actions or worse that they simply did not give a damn. The unregulated bankers were let loose in the financial markets devoid of controls by the Securities and Exchange Commission and supported by Greenspan, Summers and others up to the President. The film overlooked what caused the initial change in the way the banking industry was perceived. In 1993 two mathematical geniuses came to Greenwich, Connecticut with a big idea. Myron Scholes of Stamford University and Robert Merton of Harvard devised an elaborate equation that nobody understood which could put a price on an Option Contract: to buy stock for $100 thinking it will go up to $200 in years time. If it does increase in value you make the profit, if not you can walk away losing only the cost of the 'Option' itself. How much to charge for the Option could be 'calculated' using Scholes and Merton's formulae-the 'Black Box'. These men were the original'Quants'. Scholes and Merton were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Economics in October 1997. They were responsible for creating the aura of mystique surrounding the wheeler dealers in Investment Banking, akin to that associated with nuclear physics. Politicians were in awe of this new breed of banker seducing George W. Bush into deregulating the industry even further. In 2006 he appointed Poulson, CEO of Goldman Sachs and one of the chief protagonists leading to the crash, as Secretary of the Treasury. We have the answer to this dilemma. It was bequeathed to the world by Dr. E.F. Schumacher (web site-'practicalaction.org') within the pages of his masterly book 'Small is Beautiful-A study of Economics as if People Mattered'. Although it was first published in 1973 the economic, environmental and sociological problems we faced then are virtually the same now but a thousand times more acute. His book advocates: the use of 'Wisdom',which immediately implies that we have used our intelligence for the benefit of all; that we need to change our attitude to one that is geared to a state of permanence; that we need to embrace 'Smallness' and include 'qualitative' factors which take into account environmental issues and promotes the humanisation of work. The present Dickensian system of economics is dependent upon our lower traits and is proved no longer a viable option. To quote R. Buckminster Fuller: "You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete." The world is crying out for change. Dr.Schumacher's ideas could form the foundation stones upon which to build this new model for the generations to come.At the conclusion of the film Matt Damon, whose punchy narrative was delivered with eloquence and passion, said: "It won't be easy but some things are worth fighting for." Dr. Schumacher stated in his book: "It will require effort of imagination and abandonment of Fear". There are great rewards for those who are willing to relinquish responsibility. As individuals we all have a responsibility here. Kennedy said: Divided, there is little we can do. Together there is little we cannot do." If we cannot rise to the challenge to build a fairer and more just world for all to live in, to eradicate poverty in all its forms (the Nelson Mandela legacy) and organise businesses that create wealth that is shared by all (refer to the Scott Bader Commonwealth in Schumacher's book) then as a species we could be doomed. Materialism has no limit. It's similar to an addiction that fails to tell you when to stop. It demands ever more growth of wealth. There is nothing to stop it. But the environment is finite-resources will run out eventually. "You must be the change you wish to see in the world". Mahatma Ghandi</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Inside Job is a documentary film about the financial crisis in the mid- 2000's.It consist of five parts wherein it explores the how changes in the policy environment and banking practices helped create created it.Also,it looks at the deep-rooted corruption that has left millions of middle-class Americans jobless and homeless as the major corporations get bailed out while paying millions in bonuses. Charles Ferguson speaks at length with journalists, politicians, and financial insiders in order to offer a clearer picture of the economic meltdown. Matt Damon acts as narrator.It begins in Iceland, where the economy was growing at a solid pace then its economy began to collapse after the government pushed for deregulation and privatization on a large scale. Then,its focus shifts to the United States. It explains why the housing crisis occurred and why so many sectors of the economy were affected by that crisis. The interviews with economic experts and government officials lay out the facts in a clear and concise manner. One may be overwhelmed by all of the complex transactions that are detailed but it's difficult not to learn anything in it.The officials in the Bush administration and former Democratic politicians as well as financial analysts talk about what went wrong in our nation's economy and why. This is one great documentary especially when it takes its attention on Wall Street.One will definitely realize that the dangers of unchecked greed and brazen lack of accountability will definitely hurt the nation in the long run.And despite of the liberal bias,it is good to know that they did show that President Obama has not distanced himself from Wall Street.In summary,this is definitely an intelligent and informative documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Money Crisis Imagine for one second that you have been working so hard for your entire life to make money and provide necessary needs for yourself or family. While you were making money you decided to set aside this money by going putting this money in the bank. This money that you put aside was for your child's future education goals or for yourself to live on into retirement. One day while you're watching the news on your television and the breaking news is that your bank is going into bankruptcy. You have just lost all of your life saving and everything you have worked for your entire life for. This is was actually happened in the late 2000's financial crisis. In the Inside Job Documentary, directed by Charles Ferguson, he looks at the whole picture of pre, post, and the time frame of actual crisis and gives great details in each category. There are many questions that are unanswered but the documentary has a strong primary focus, main argument, and a basis for this argument.First the Inside Jobs focus was not to exploit the criminals that took part in this crisis. I felt that the primary focus of this documentary was to educate the public on this particular crisis. A financial crisis that not only bankrupt some huge corporations, but made a massive amount of people lose all their money. The reason that film need to be produced was without an explanation of the events that took place, the people would not trust the government or any banking system for a long time following the crisis. The video accomplished the goal of telling the people, look the government and people involved in regulating these corporations made a huge mistake. The video stated their mistake with supported details to regain the trust of the public. By this documentary being made the government is stating the problem, and also stating the corrective actions that are being planned and executed to make sure that this crisis never takes place again.Second the Inside Job had many key arguments to state in the documentary. First argument is how not only one corporation could get away with faking logs in financial books. Many of these corruptions such as Fannie Mae forged numbers on how much they annually made each year. The problem was that this company was stating that made a higher amount of money, which would result in their stocks rising. The people that were interested in buying stock would be buying stock at higher prices that was over exaggerated, that Fannie May would quick profit the extra money and give it away as bonus to the top dogs of its corporation. Another argument that took place was in the area of banking. The dollar amount for loans for houses was higher than the dollar amount the bank actually had. What was taking place behind closed doors was that you would have someone buy a house, the loan would go to the bank. Once at the bank the banks would sell these loans to corporations where they would become CDOs. CDO's then would be sold to corporations to create CDS. Finally these CDS's would be sold you investors who could invest your money in anything they desired without your consent. While this was happening insurance companies would be coming in to evaluate how safe the transaction would be for the prior holder, and every time these loans would get triple A rating when in fact they were guaranteed for success.Third the research the basis of the argument was not just gathered from one source. Once the government realized what was taking place, they started to investigate each little thing started back to the people giving out triple A rating, mortgages, and also the presidents of corporations presidents that were making millions of dollars, but yet their corporation was going down in bankruptcy. The research for this film was very organized and was not just a bunch of random facts stating how this was bad. It was in chronological order and evidence came through interviews. Also the film made charts that showed the process of where your money would go, this added visual support to actual how far your money was from your local bank. It makes you question the whole system itself while watching this documentary.The importance of this argument on a need to know scale. This argument opens up viewer's eyes to see this actually happened and we are the one who are paying the ultimate price. This also informs the viewer to question the government and do research before just putting your money into something that might sound great by a banker. Banks are in the business market so they are looking to make profit. All bankers might not have your best interest in mind, so be careful and think out what you're actually investing in. The quality of the data is awesome, this can be proved just by looking at the after math of the crisis. Looking at the economy that was in recession not just in the United States, but globally. I thought the Director Did a great job in grabbing the viewers' attention and maintaining it throughout the entire presentation. He did just bore you with numerous facts and a video of a person on stage presentation a PowerPoint. But he got on your level and made it relate to the viewer's life and how their life was directly impacted by this financial crisis. I think the documentary hit a home run in presenting that parts of the argument to the viewer. They didn't miss any time frame in the documentary, and it was very organized and scaled down to basic terms so a mass of people could benefit from watching it. Therefore concluding this documentary added great understanding to the subject of the financial crisis, and also leads you craving to know more about this topic after viewing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely the best documentary I have ever seen about the economic crisis. This is very professionally done: Very good interviews. Very good filming. Very well narrated. Straight to the point but it does go into details. The good point is that it is very well explained so that a non economic person like me could understand.I knew what had happened but there were many many many important details I just didn't know and that made it even more interesting.It makes you want to do something about it and I will definitely create or sign a petition on the White House online website so that the government can really take action.Another good point is that it does NOT take any sides at all politically. You can be Republican or Democrat (or from any other side) and this movie will not make any difference, not treat one or the other parties differently and that is why you must watch this documentary until the end. This is the same for countries: it is mainly based on the US but other countries are involved too.I recommend it to everyone who pay taxes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary and Cynical. Will change the way you look at your bank. Financial Crisis is explained superbly and it could reach curriculum of any educational institute. Explanation through graphics is simple and excellent. Liked the part with Fredrik Miskin and Glen Habard. Was surprised to see Glen angry with the questions. Kahn is impressive. Paulson's role was meticulously explained. It will upset you as they have established a link between educational institutes and these so called investment engineers. Will scare you in the end when you see the same guys taking over new posts in current system. Will see your banks differently after watching this. PS epiphany.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I shamefully regret not seeing this in the theater due to time, personal constraints that I will not get into here on this site. But I will get into how utterly infuriating and heartbroken at how vile and disgusting those in the positions of economic power can weave such a putrid and disgusting course of action to rob the American people of their personal wealth and future prosperity at the cost of greed, smoke and mirrors, and corruption."Inside Job" doesn't present either side of the spectrum in a positive light; frankly both parties are guilty of allowing these insidious business practices to continue under the noses of suspecting and somewhat, unsuspecting politicians, financial analysts, and the general American public, but instead focuses on the cold hard facts that caused the financial meltdown in 2008(I believe the collapse started WAY earlier than 2008, starting from the dot-com bubble that began late 1999). The film shows not how inept and incompetent these people are, but also arrogant and cold-hearted and their indictments are enough to make even the skeptics to rail in an uproar. I personally didn't know how to feel and make of all this. Watching this film for the first time has made me more interested to look into this web of economic corruption that has belittled and drove the world into the despair that we know see ourselves in.In the end, I felt nothing more than anger. I never thought that so much trust from the public to these so-called "authority figures" can be so heartbreakingly misguided. This vicious cycle will continue until the American public has had enough and will take action; though I don't know how and hope it will not escalate into full-blown rebellion, but if something isn't done about this, then I don't fail to see how this could NOT happen. An important piece of documentary filmmaking that should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inside Job - 5 Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In September of 2008, we witnessed the collapse of companies, the loss of jobs, and the downfall of the worldwide economy. What we didn't witness, however, is how a few businessmen earned hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of it. We were told that this economic crisis was an unpleasant accident, but no. Turns out, we are at a time where the idea of bankrupting countless of families to the point of homelessness is a feasible option as long as it generates a profit."Inside Job" is a hard-hitting, eye-opening, rage-inducing documentary that meticulously informs us how the entire world was screwed over by the giants of Wall Street. The movie points its fingers to the, excuse me? thieves? responsible for the recent economic crisis. Most of us were affected. Many of us are still recovering. Who knows? Maybe a few of us hit rock bottom and stayed there.And for what cost? A short montage in the movie shows the vast kingdom these businessmen enjoy. They have bought more than enough mansions to make Oprah scratch her head. To spot them not wearing an expensive suit is just about as shocking as seeing me wear one. After being made aware of how rich these bastards really are, we stop looking for reasonable explanations behind their criminal actions. I think one of them just wanted an 8th private jet.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/inside-job-movie-review/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, let me tell you that i am still doing my MBA and i always thought that the global financial crisis was more of a system failure. However, after watching this documentary i found that though the system was flawed, the main culprits always knew what was coming. The movie is informative as well as entertaining. Its a good fusion of knowledge and fun. Let me tell you, this is one of the few documentary movies which in which i also enjoyed the way interviewees were grilled on questions. Matt Damon has done a fine job in Narrating the entire story. Facts and conclusions pointed out in this movie shows how corrupt the financial system is and how financial crime goes unpunished because the financial players are the regulators of the economy. A splendid masterpiece and a must watch for for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bret Easton Ellis nailed it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are all familiar with the basic reasons that created the global financial crisis that became publicly evident towards the end of 2008. We are all well versed in the entities that were responsible for this recession that we are, arguably, still embroiled in. What Inside Job does, is to fill in the gaps; the details, and the people involved, and the endemic greed within these multi-national financial institutions. Through news coverage, we are aware of some of the companies involved: Goldman Sacs, Lehman Brothers, et al.This documentary outlines the rise of financial greed that began forty years after the great depression of the 1930's (as stated in the film, it was illegal for financial institutes to merge companies, and the industry was regulated). After an illegal deal in the 1980's, a merger created Citigroup (still 'in business' today), that paved the way for financial greed and the banning of regulation. As this greed increased through the '90's and 2000's, investment became thoroughly ruthless. In what are called predatory lenders, institutions could 'lend' people the money for mortgages with incredibly high interest with seemingly no risk to their companies or the share holders. Many institutions operated illegally, and benefited from criminal activity: from fraud, tax evasion for the very rich, to the funneling of drug money from South America.The film compresses some incredibly complex financial information, but does so in a relatively easily consumable manner. The film is (perhaps ironically) very good looking; very expensive in it's visual "gloss". This probably helped by the use of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio, and the inclusion of a narration by top Hollywood actor, Matt Damon. Many of the interviewees become visibly uncomfortable, some even aggressive when confronted with questions that they don't really want to hear (i.e. the truth). The film highlights the bed-fellows of the financial industry with Washington politics. Whilst the people that were most effected by the crisis - the proletariat - are left with debt, joblessness and in extreme cases homelessness, the "villains", the people responsible for the situation, are paid off billions in bonuses and pay-offs so that they may leave the companies, are placed into high-paid jobs, many in government positions.It's an interesting film. however, if you are familiar with the ins and outs of the financial institutions and their roles in the crisis, this will not enlighten you with any revelatory information. But it is at times entertaining. What it does highlight, is the fact the Bret Easton Ellis got those investment banker characters spot-on in his satirical novel American Psycho. The gung-ho attitude of the (w)ankers, and their frivolous spending of corporate money on drugs and prostitutes, shows that the Yuppie image of 1980's greed has really not changed.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always difficult for anyone to evaluate a film that has such a settled agenda. Propaganda is propaganda. It's especially difficult for people like me. I have no talent for high finance, one of the reasons that, when I glance at my bank account, I'm reminded of lines like, "I should have been a pair of ragged claws, scuttling across the floors of silent seas". It's narrated by Matt Damon, often considered a Hollywood leftist elitist because he's involved himself with such radical causes as providing pure water to remote African villages. However, take my word for it that this particular film, while propaganda, is not partisan. Yet propaganda isn't always "bad." Sometimes a people can be so awash in propaganda presenting only one side of a complex issue that some sort of counter-propaganda is almost required if we're to retain our collective common sense. Imagine -- it's 1936 in Germany and a flood of propaganda movies and newsreels are show with title like, "The Aryan Race Is Not Biologically Superior," or, "The Many Contributions of Jews to German Culture." That's kind of the status that this film occupies. There was plenty of warning of a global collapse of the economy in 2007. So what the hell happened? There were a lot of hasty explanations while the crisis was at its peak, but I couldn't follow it. I didn't know what a "structured derivative instrument" is. In a word association test, confronted with "instrument," I'd probably respond "oboe." But this is about the clearest explanation of the melt down that I've seen. I think the clarity comes chiefly from the historical perspective that provides the framework of the film. It's narrated by Matt Damon but in all the cases it seems to be the writer and director, Charles Ferguson, who is responsible. He does the interviews with the numerous talking heads, he's responsible for the developmental structure, and for the graphics that make the rot on Wall Street so apparent.You ought to hear these talking heads. There are a lot of them, giving different perspectives on the collapse. And there's a good deal of archival footage. The interview I enjoyed most -- I didn't learn much but I enjoyed it -- was with a lobbyist who represents the Big Banks but whose name I forget. According to him, nobody on Wall Street ever stepped wrong. There is no collusion between politicians and financiers, and no revolving door between Washington and Wall Street. This guy is unflappable. No matter what Ferguson asks him, he has a smooth and easy reply. He gives a remarkably lifelike performance.And it's not just Washington and Wall Street. It's Academia too. Another interviewee, R. Glenn Hubbard, now Dean of the Graduate School of Business at Columbia and a Visiting Scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, was a leading advocate of supply side economics when he served as Chairman of Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. Economics Professors who are that high up on the status ziggurat, don't depend on their puny academic salaries for a living. Hubbard also serves on the boards of Automatic Data Processing, BlackRock Fin., Duke Realty, KKR Fin. Corp., Ripplewood Holdings, and MetLife. Like some of the other profs, he's raking in uncountable shekels but when asked about it, he gets politely huffy and informs Ferguson, "You've got five minutes left." I should point out that, judging from what we see in the film, Ferguson is no trickster but a serious journalist. There's none of the bravado of Michael Moore about him. He doesn't argue. He doesn't become uncivil. His questions aren't phrased as insults. He pulls no stunts on camera. We don't even see him. I guess that's why he's not as popular in as many circles as Michael Moore.It's a disturbing film in the end. I can't possibly describe Ferguson's entire outline but it includes William Jefferson Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama as well as you-know-who. Obama has surrounded himself with the same people responsible for the melt down in the first place. Nobody cared. The rules were stripped away. The SEC staff was gutted, its budget slashed. The Federal Reserve was on cruise control. And when the inevitable happened, an awful lot of people suffered and are still suffering, while those involved in the scheme waltzed off with incredible bonuses -- millions upon millions of somebody else's money. One of the tactics was selling bundles of bonds that you knew would fail, and then betting that they would fail. And, since the deregulation that began in the 1980s, it was all legal. One can hardly blame the hucksters who sold sub-prime mortgage packages and became millionaires overnight. After all, the three major bond rating agencies -- Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch -- were routinely giving them the same ratings as U. S. Treasury Bonds. And the hucksters couldn't lose because they knew they'd be bailed out. Look, if you own a grocery store and is suddenly becomes legal for you to sell an ounce of goods while telling the customer the package contains a pound, wouldn't you do it? As Mister Bernstein says in "Citizen Kane," "It's easy to make a lot of money -- if all you want to do is make a lot of money." And what's changed? What instruments have been deployed to prevent the whole thing from happening again? None. Anyone who doubts it should force himself to watch Elizabeth Warren's speech about Citicorp. And anyone who believe that government intrusion into business is somehow tainted, ought to consider that we have police on the streets to control blue-collar crime, then ask if we shouldn't have someone keeping an eye on white-collar crime too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understanding the economic crisis of 2008, an introduction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who have tried to follow the causes and effects of the global economic crisis of 2008, you will likely learn some things from this film. For those who know little about it, this offers a crash course. There is so much information presented that it is hard to digest it all in a single viewing. Although there are lots of charts and graphs set forth, the presentation makes this more of a movie than a dry lecture. For example, in the introductory segment on Iceland (which cleverly covers many of the themes that will be taken up in more detail later) we are treated to some beautiful shots of the country. This technique is carried through the entire film. There are some great aerial shots of New York City that accompany happenings in that city. When certain topics come up, there are often associated visuals such as the U.S. Treasury building or vacated Chinese factories. The work on the images brings them alive--the colors are vivid and the camera work is creative. You don't expect such high quality production values in a documentary.It is clear that director Ferguson has done a lot of research for this film and has spent much effort to organize and present it in a manner that engages the audience. The music plays a significant role. The obligatory ominous music is kept under control and the proceedings are brightened by such songs as Peter Gabriel's "Big Time" and Randy Bachman's "Takin' Care of Business."The crisis did not come out of nowhere but resulted from a complex of causes such as: greed, corruption, deregulation, moral hazard, naivet, insular thinking, over-leveraged banks, "creative" financial products, predatory lending, and company boards that are chosen by CEOs as rubber stamps. Also emphasized are the incestuous relationships that exist between government, financial institutions, economists, and the ratings agencies: high-level employees in financial institutions move in and out of powerful government positions; employees of the ratings agencies are funded by the institutions that depend on their ratings; economists (both academic and otherwise), often funded by financial institutions or government grants, write articles that influence policy as well as consult at high levels for big bucks. The title of the movie is apt since there seems to be a cadre of insiders who are calling the shots.Both Democratic and Republican administrations come under scrutiny and are found wanting. The Reagan Administration's deregulation laws precipitated the S&amp;L crisis of the 1980s, costing the taxpayers $150 billion in bailouts. The Clinton Administration is seen to be a major contributor to the problem by repealing the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 that prohibited depository banks from acting like Wall Street investment banks. It was during the George W. Bush Administration that the crisis peaked, resulting in a 750 billion dollar federal bailout. The Obama Administration comes under criticism for retaining most of the top level people who were in charge during the development of the crisis, and for having done precious little to correct the underlying causes. If the financial institutions were too big to fail when the crisis went critical with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in mid-September of 2008, they are even bigger now.Ferguson was able to interview a variety of people, from government officials, a person who was in one of the rating agencies, economists, journalists, and financial experts. It is telling that many of the major players (Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan, Henry Paulson, Ben Bernanke, Larry Summers, Tim Geithner) declined to be interviewed for the film. In fact I am surprised by the people who did consent to be interviewed, since Ferguson put a lot of them on the spot by asking some penetrating questions. Maybe those who were interviewed underestimated Ferguson's knowledge of the subject. It is laughable to hear Scott Talbott, the chief lobbyist of the Financial Services Round-table, say that those who got mega-bonuses and multi-million dollar buyouts earned them. And hear Richard Fuld, CEO of Lehman Brothers say, "The system worked." Or hear Angelo Mozilo of Countrywide Financial say, "It doesn't make any sense for us to make a loan that's going to fail" while running his company into the ground and making off with $470 million.Added to this sad story is documentation of a substantial culture of drugs and prostitution that existed on Wall Street. Taken all together this scandal is an example of men behaving badly, and it was pretty much exclusively men.Contained on the DVD are many interviews that did not make it into the final cut. Among them is an extended interview with Harvey Miller, Lehman's bankruptcy lawyer. Miller gives a fascinating blow-by-blow description of the final events that led to Lehman's demise. Miller is a good story teller, I think he could have been a good novelist.This film has been criticized for leaving things out, usually some pet peeve of the critic. It is unreasonable to expect that a two hour documentary is going to provide a definitive analysis of a crisis that vaporized tens of trillions of dollars, doubled the U.S. national debt, and cost fifteen million jobs. This crisis will be discussed, analyzed, and written about for decades and this film hits a lot of the high points and provides background for further reading and study.The final scene remarks that some things are worth fighting for, but the main effect the movie had on me was to induce a feeling of helplessness. Maybe write your congressmen and say that you want some of these scoundrels brought to justice and that you favor stricter regulations? It is ironic that the U.S. government is so hot on shutting down on-line poker while the big poker game is still being allowed to play on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that is heart-wrenching, anger-inducing and provides more shock value than a horror film. It might not be all new material, but it certainly does an excellent job of providing an understandable narrative and explaining the collapse step-by-step.I loved that this movie made it simple to understand the financial machinations that like to hide behind the "very complex" moniker. It's not so hard to understand at all... which means it's quite clear those running the scams are desperate to keep up the illusion of major complexity to avoid detection.Most unfair of all is the lack of punishment for those who gained enormous wealth to the detriment of millions! They're still in power, still in businesses which they ran into the ground and they're still writing their own rules in the political system.Yes, we need to make the point that declining to be interviewed for a film is not proof of somebody's guilt. It seemed too often the "declined to be interviewed" message was overly emphasized with ominous overtones. The facts speak loudly enough... no need to ruin it.Also, I do wish there was a stronger call to action to finish the documentary. This material points out a system so corrupt, run by the most powerful and rich... so what can we as individuals do about it? With the exposure of an Academy Award for best documentary... let's just hope it prompts action for the change we so desperately need.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the Global Economic Crisis of 2008 Came to Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The global economic crisis of 2008 cost tens of millions of people their savings, their jobs, and their homes. This is how it happened. Inside Job is a very insightful documentary about the global financial crisis of 2008 that produced the worst recession since the Great Depression. Millions of people lost their jobs and savings in middle of the crisis and according to this documentary it could all have been prevented. Charles Ferguson produced, directed, and wrote this Oscar nominated documentary. It is really well developed, beautifully shot, and will surely leave your blood boiling by the end of the two hour film. Ferguson (who also directed the Oscar nominated documentary No End in Sight, about America's involvement in Iraq) successfully manages to take a complicated and dull subject matter and make it easy to understand and entertaining at the same time. One of the reasons the film works so well apart from all the research, interviews, and great shots is that Matt Damon got on board to narrate the movie. His renowned voice gave even more credibility to the film. The film was also really well edited by Ferguson's usual collaborators: Chad Beck and Adam Bolt, who also co-wrote the script with him. Inside Job is the critic's favorite pick to take home this year's Oscar for Best Documentary, although I enjoyed Exit Through the Gift Shop a lot more. Inside Job is still mandatory viewing if we want to avoid another catastrophe like the one that happened less than three years ago; the movie is much more informative than any other documentary that came out, although I wouldn't say it's the most entertaining one.The film opens with a prologue about the financial collapse in Iceland back in 2000, which should have served as a warning for what was going to happen in the future at a much larger scale. Ferguson claims that the crisis wasn't an accident and that it was caused by an out of control and unregulated financial industry. Thanks to Ferguson's exhaustive research and Matt Damon's narration we are informed of how reckless risk-taking, poor risk assessments by the credit rating agencies, and predatory lending all led to the financial downfall. Inside Job is divided in five parts: Part I How We Got Here (Beginning from the Reagan era up to the Bush presidency), Part II the Bubble (2000-2007), Part III The Crisis (2008), Part IV Accountability (the men responsible for the crisis were left unpunished and wealthy; they continue to teach economics at prestigious schools shaping economics to their convenience), and Part V Where Are We Now (things have stayed pretty much the same since the same advisors in today's government are the same people who built the economic structure that led to the downfall). Ferguson gives us a great amount of important facts along with interviews with key financial academics, politicians, and journalists. Many of the men responsible for the crisis declined to be interviewed for obvious reasons, but others like David McCormick, Glenn Hubbard, and Frederic Mishkin foolishly did so, and answered exactly like guilty people would do so. The interviews with them were one of the highlights of the film. They were left speechless.Before watching Inside Job I personally had very little insight about the causes of the financial crisis due to my lack of financial knowledge, but Ferguson does a great job of explaining the situation and making it accessible and easy to understand. Some people may argue that the film oversimplifies the causes of the crisis, but I can't really comment on that. What I can say is that Ferguson really did a lot of exhaustive research on the subject and that can be seen clearly in his interviews where he leaves his interviewees speechless or mumbling empty and unreasonable words most of the time. McCormick (the Secretary of the Treasury during the Bush Administration) never knew how to answer his questions and simply had to state financial markets today are incredibly complicated. Others like Henry Paulson declined to be interviewed (which makes me think they are guilty if they aren't able to defend themselves). Others like Glenn Hubbard (Dean of Columbia Business School) got upset for not admitting that corrupted Academic economists have been major advocates of deregulation and he didn't think there was a conflict of interests there (big mistake). But the true clown of the film is Frederic Mishkin, an economist who supported financial deregulation in Iceland and wrote a paper called Financial Stability in Iceland (another big mistake). After Iceland went through such a financial disaster which Mishkin foolishly never foresaw, he decided to change the title of his paper in his CV to Financial Instability in Iceland trying to look smart and making people think he had predicted the disaster beforehand (an even bigger mistake). When Ferguson pointed out this lie to Mishkin he simply attributed it to a typo (a rather convenient one I would think). The film really has a strong ending and claims nothing really has changed since we still live under a Wall Street Government.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What Al Gore was leading to in his book Assault On Reason, written before the financial debacle, becomes a reality and is graphically outlined in this documentary. What Joel Bakan's book 'The Corporation,The Pathological Pursuit Of Profit And Power' explains is a consequence of a century and a half of evolution, cancerous growth if you ask me, of the legal systems, namely the conveying of ever more powers and protection to corporations and the reverse to civilians, is made transparent in this documentary; that consequence is that the few who captain the corporations, the financial institutions and banks in particular, have been able to use those powers and that protection for themselves, raking obscene financial rewards and thwarting even a thought of prosecution as their cozy symbiotic relations with politicians have assured them immunity, except of course the minute penalty of temporary embarrassment if they can relate at all to such a thing at this point. What Michael Lewis' book The Big Short pointed out, from a perspective of the winning side in my understanding, is simply that for every dollar lost there's a dollar gained. This documentary and Lewis' book sure showed how much was gained and lost and who made the gains and took the losses. What Jordan Belfort's book The Wolf of Wall Street sounded aloud, this documentary retells in a nutshell, namely that cocaine and numbing oodles of cash satisfies the hubristic in oh so much the same way. Didn't think I see it in this documentary but there it was. What Ian Bremmer's book The End Of The Free Market makes us wonder about, the corporate state is staring at us with evil delight, the documentary shows this as well to be a global effect. These books and so many others have come to make us capitulate to the anti parable "Crime Pays", or it hasn't yet; not so if it spawns the cyclical relief of such misery, a revolution. Very good work Mr.Ferguson; the Iceland preface was an excellent choice given their unique and sole sober solution. Was it not the only country to say F--- Y-- to the bail out fiasco. Matt Damon must have relished the whole project and it almost sounded as if he was proud to be the voice. To those who were critical of the movie and who's point of views were not without merit, I ask: What was the best documentary on the subject, really?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thorough documentary on the excessive influence that money, and Wall Street in particular, have on our government and the resulting financial crisis of 2008 that required a nearly trillion dollar bailout. The scary part involves the continued influence they have.It could be called a sequel to Capitalism - A Love Story. Unlike Michael Moore's more wide ranging approach, this film drills down further and highlights Wall Street and specific people and organizations with enormous conflicts of interest. It shows they also have an extremely disproportionate say in our government and economy.Among the many exceptional aspects of the documentary are great explanations of financial derivatives, insurance, and mortgage debt securities (aka, all that home loan stuff). Michael Moore's documentary highlighted even Wall Street's ignorance (and this film confirms that ignorance) of what these things really are, but never, or too briefly and academically, explained it. This film makes sure even George W. Bush could walk away understanding them. Maybe even Wall Street will after watching this. The visuals alone are worth more than any investment seminar you'll ever attend.It's tough not to go on. The film definitely informs you and, despite the talk of it being depressing, energizes you by helping you know where to direct and focus the anger and disgust caused by the 2008 bailouts. Maybe not as fun as picketing banks, but being able to write an informed letter/email to the President and agencies like the Department of Justice and Consumer Protection Financial Board to file complaints certainly makes up for that.The things that prevent me from giving it a 10 of 10 are relatively minor technical and artistic issues that don't interfere with the film's accuracy. As a documentary, the only real thing wrong is that you wish it had been remade 6-9 months later and provided even more details. Hopefully the film's Website will remedy that.</fullReview>

(1) There were legitimate business reasons why derivatives existed - for companies to hedge their exposures to commodities, currency fluctuations and a host of other things. (2) Glass-Steagall was an antiquated depression-era law that outstayed its welcome as financial markets became more global (also banks were engaging in these activities before the repeal via loopholes so that they could compete w global banks)(3) the movie conspicuously omitted the impact of Fannie Mae &amp; Freddie Mac and the (mostly Democrat) politicians who supported these institutions by voting to allow them to purchase junky mortgages supposedly to support the housing market. Oh and their executives were indicted (4) the government charged the banks hefty interest for the bailout money and made billions. (5) enough with blaming Goldman Sachs for everything! What about the other banks that contributed, like Citi? Who had to pay billions in fines for fraudulent mortgages. Besides you want a Treasury Secretary who understands markets and the people at Goldman happen to be pretty good at that.

		<shortDescription>It never was enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eye popping as well as depressing documentary of how unquenchable greed on Wall Street as well as the world money markets lead to the financial meltdown of 2007-09 that almost destroyed the world economies. The enormous amount of some 20 trillion-that's with a capital T-dollars worth of wealth and the tens if not hundreds of millions of jobs pension funds as well as real-estate holdings that went down the drain with it is still with us almost ten years later. And worst of all those responsible for all this in the world of finance and politics never paid for the crimes that they committed.We did have financial turn-downs back in 1987 as well as 1997 &amp; 1998 with + 500 point drops in the market as well as the tech crash of 2000-03 but this is what is known to all those involved as the "Big One" in economic crashes ever bigger then the one in 1929 that brought on the "Great Depression". And despite the markets recoveries it still with us lying in wait and ready to resurface if we don't curb the irresponsible and greedy dealings of the what internet commentator Michael Rivero calls "Money Junkies" who never not only seem to learn their lessons but are permitted to get away with and be rewarded with what they do! By handing out multi-million dollar payoffs to politician's and those who are supposed to regulate them.Even the government regulatory agency SEC had a hand in this disaster by looking the other way and letting things spin out of control until, by the summer of 2008, it was too late. This lead to a combination stock and real estate bubble bursting like a puss blister on September 15, 2008 with the sudden collapse of Leaman Brothers that ended some seven months later on March 9, 2009 with the DJIA-Dow Jones Industrials-average dropping some 54% from its high ion October 2007 to 6547! The worst thing about all this is those responsible the major banks brokerage houses and rating agencies, as well as paid off regulators &amp; politicians, not only got away with their crimes Scot- free but were rewarded with million dollar bonuses as well as promotion's for what they did! Not so for the millions of people who trusted them in giving them their hard earned money and life savings that they both stole and swindled.It was the deregulation of the banks as well as the introduction of derivatives into the markets in the 1980's that really started the ball rolling downhill for the US as well as world economies. That together with hatchet job like treaties like NAFTA &amp; GATT that destroyed tens of millions of well paying jobs in the US. That those pushing those treaties in the world of business &amp; politics made tens of billions for themselves and the expense of their employees and those that they represented. That's a lesson that should be well learned by the public whenever someone running for or in office promises them the world but only ends up giving them the business!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how can this so called documentary score so high</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This "documentary" is a joke, the makers pretend they are professors in economics while they fail to give a good understanding of any of the topics, instead just gloss over something complicated, and then remind the viewer who the bad guys are.The interviews are so bad, its just dumb how they try to make a point out of the fact that people decline to be interviewed. If you are going to paint people as the bad guy, obviously they are not going to play into the makers hand. some of them even answer the questions very respectfully, only for the interviewer to make a snarky remark and cut to the next shot.this extreme bias makes it so boring to watch, instead of going deep into the fundamental problems and giving new perspective, it just goes for the emotional side and entertaining the viewer, this is not an objective film that could have any historical valuei can understand that it has a high rating because it is entertaining, but for anyone who sees through that it becomes a boring piece only showing the same thing over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charles Ferguson's Oscar-winning look at what caused the global financial meltdown is enough to chill anyone's bones. Narrated by Matt Damon, "Inside Job" shows how deregulation, the rise of derivatives, and the housing bubble coalesced to bring down the world economy. Sure enough, banks thought to be too big to fail did just that (too big to fail means too big to exist). Meanwhile, the executives spent millions on cocaine, prostitutes, and multiple houses. Worse still, large portions of academia endorsed the money-above-all mindset.Basically, the departments that were supposed to regulate Wall Street allowed it to run amok. As expected, Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and anyone else behind the crash declined to get interviewed for the documentary. I guess that if the documentary was missing anything, it could have noted that the unfunded wars in Afghanistan and Iraq caused the US national debt to skyrocket. Otherwise it's very well done. When Ferguson accepted his Oscar, he noted that not a single person behind the economic meltdown had faced prosecution. Five years later it's the same.Everyone should see this documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mind-blowing truth about what happens in high finance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2 days ago I've watched an HBO movie called "Too big to fail" about what happened during the 2008 financial crisis. I thought the bankers/traders and those CEOs were naturally selfish but still okay. Now after watching this documentary, it seems to portray that they're all real a**shole. The film is very well-made and carefully walks through important anecdotes of the recent financial crisis. It essentially says that the crisis were the faults of a few big players in financial sectors, namely big investment banks and their CEOs, rating agencies, politicians/officers, as well as prominent academics in Economics and Finance field. Though there are a few comments that I'd like to point out about this film.Firstly, the film portrays negative picture on everyone who were involved or ever made an inaccurate judgement about the financial situation. As one might have known that it is very difficult to predict what's going to happen with the economy in the future. I believe that some of blames were quite unjust. Those people could also be wrong with their predictions and analysis. It's quite unfair to make them look like bad guys there.Secondly, regarding conflict of interests for academics and CEOs, this documentary seems to assume that everybody can be brought. Thus, once they have any past relationship or get paid to study something, they would to be biased. Does it mean that if they happen to once work for private sector, they should never make a switch and work for government. Then the government officers will only have people without experience in private sector to do the job at all. Also for the academics, as I understand, it is quite a normal practice for academic to study something with the fund provided by private sector. But what they should do is that they need to make it clear who funds the study and they should still be impartial on their academic work..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Inside Job" is the story of the big bank bailout and all of the criminals behind what happened and how it happened. By criminals, I'm talking about the heads of security firms, and people in the administration, those people.I already knew this, but it bears mentioning again.This is just one nugget. When Bush appointed Henry Paulson to be Secretary of the Treasury, Paulson by law had to sell his $425 million of AIG stock. Thanks to a law pushed through by the other Bush, he didn't have to pay one dime of taxes on it. Not a cent. Meanwhile, the IRS is harassing me to file my taxes (which I am not required to do because I don't owe money) and says if I don't, they're taking away money I receive to help pay for my medications.As the documentary said, the rich have gotten richer, none of these criminals who put through the subprime loans and gave anybody off the street a mortgage has faced charges, or had to return any money.If you aren't aware of what a Fascist government is, here it is, from FDR's speech before Congress in 1938: ownership of Government by an individual, by a group, or by any other controlling private power. As one gentleman stated in this documentary, we are a Wall Street controlled government. President Obama promised all kinds of regulations. We didn't get any. Why? The billions paid to lobbyists by Wall Street. In any other venue, this would be considered bribery. In government, it's business as usual. The tax reforms made by Bush helped the wealthiest people who make up 1% in the country. Not you, not me.This is a very depressing look at how the securities firms fought regulation of their scams (which were being given triple A ratings), how the administration, Bernake, the SEC, how everybody looked the other way, how anyone who said anything about regulation was told to keep his or her mouth shut and not pursue it. The same people are still in power. They're paid consultants, they work in the government, they are presidents of universities. They ran their companies into the ground and walked away with millions and millions and millions of dollars. And they plan on doing it again.Watch this, but have a barf bag nearby.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a documentary about the 2008 financial collapse. It starts with an examination of the Icelandic banking deregulation in 2000. Then it takes a casual walk through the banking sector from the post WWII. It digs into the people involved in the 2008 meltdown. Then it tries to lay out the aftermath.This is a well researched, coherent and relatively easy to understand. The most damning is laying out the army of people who are tied to the investment industry that are in government. The interconnection and the conflicts of interest are truly eye-opening. It is definitely coming at the meltdown with a view point and sometimes, it tries to connect too much. On a minor note, the Matt Damon is pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made documentary, utterly disturbing and appalling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with another Charles Ferguson documentary (No End in Sight: Iraq's Descent into Chaos), the people being interviewed in this film seem to fit clearly into two types:1) The informed and decent people that saw the corruption and evil occurring. They anticipated the impending disaster and tried to prevent it or alert people to it but were completely ignored and minimalised. They are still shocked and frustrated about it to this day.2) The people who were a part of the problem and profited greatly. When questioned, they can barely string a sentence of words together or look the interviewer in the eye because of their obvious guilt and confusion. The filmmakers are well-researched and direct and leave the interviewees scrambling for explanations.Inside Job is sickening. I feel like I now understand roughly what caused the global financial crisis. How can those people sleep at night? I'm reminded of the holocaust and the problem of deciding who was responsible for the killing of so many innocent people. "It wasn't me, I was told they were just having showers!" "I just created the poison gas, I didn't know what they were going to use it for!" "I was following orders!" "I managed some of the logistics, sure, but I never came within miles of any of it!" "Everyone was doing it, I didn't have a choice!" Everyone distances themselves from what's really happening. There are too many layers and it becomes vague who was responsible for what.The banks seem to have done something similar. The system fell apart in so many places. It had so many layers adding their little bit to the corruption and lies. And maybe most problematic of all - none of it was properly regulated. Nobody felt a need to carefully scrutinise things when they were making so much money selling lies. Monetary incentives created all kinds of conflicts of interest.And then when it all falls down, they point their fingers at the other parts of the system. They claim they were just giving opinions or that they couldn't have known an investment was bad. But really they didn't care at all because they knew it was only innocent people external to the system that would be the losers. They believed they'd get away with it and it seems they did. They get their huge bonuses and many retain powerful, high-earning positions today.I'm both interested in economics and convinced that its almost completely meaningless. As one man said in the movie, why are these financial engineers making 4 to 100 times more than actual, real engineers? Does economics have anything to do with reality? He analogised that they sell dreams. But who holds them accountable when those dreams turn out to be nightmares?Obama promised changes but it sounds like they ended up being few and very watered down. What power do we have against these millionaires and billionaires? They can lobby, buy or persuade anything or anyone. It seems they control the U.S. government. What are we meant to think? Perhaps the worst feeling is similar to when JFK was assassinated. Who did this and why? We just want to know. Cowardly, invisible crimes are the worst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inside Job is an eye-opening documentary that hits many key points.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people know the basics of the 2008 economic crisis, so a lot of the information here will be (semi-)familiar to you, but it's still enlightening to have it reinforced and detailed. I loved (in the "black humor" sense) bits like Alan Greenspan being a financial gun-for-hire for outright criminals just shortly before he was appointed to lead the Federal Reserve.Inside Job, as I see it, centers on the following themes. Their importance, - and, therefore, need for reiteration, - cannot be overstated: 1. There are plenty of ways to steal completely legally.2. Whoever you are, you should be aware of the fundamentals of politics and economics. If you are on the side of the potential victims, you will know not to trust your money to people who are liable to steal it. You will also know the ways that you can become the victimizer instead of the victim, if you so choose.3. When you approach broader-scale levels like Inside Job talks about, the situation is that the mechanisms strongly encourage lying and stealing. You can close your eyes to the dog-eat-dog realities of the world, but object permanence tells us that those realities will continue to exist even if your eyes are closed.And this is not new. Power seems to be based on the ability to successfully but secretly objectify large groups of people. You can't focus all your attention on the chessboard if you are thinking about the paint that has peeled off a pawn of yours.Of course, from the moral perspective, the system should not work like this. Is power without cruelty, or without someone getting hurt as a side effect, even possible? With all my cynicism, I still say: "yes". If we can conceive of it - it's possible.But the entire social system and each individual psyche have to be, and will be, re-molded over decades, and probably millennia, for that to happen. Mankind has thrived thanks to deception and competition. You don't just throw out your main tools and expect things to be OK.I think that we should condemn, but also try to understand. Both street criminals and financial criminals are products of the system, but that doesn't excuse their actions, because blaming "the system" can be a way to remove responsibility. Then again - "blaming" isn't as useful as constructive action towards change.Also, the system could not operate like this if it wasn't supported by millions of people who, for example, take out mortgages for homes when they know that future is uncertain. They are portrayed as utter victims, but that's hardly the case. (That's actually what I took a point off for - that the documentary is a tad one-sided. It presents a clear-cut image of the enemy, - the bigwigs currently in power, - but we all know that that kind of rhetoric is used for riling up crowds, but isn't always completely objective. What about human greed? Maybe we should focus on that, instead of specific faces.)You can ponder this from different perspectives endlessly, but ultimately the point is that Inside Job is a great, informative, important documentary that everyone should see. It is going to be clear even to people who aren't well-versed in economics and finance.Until change comes, - and don't expect that to happen any time soon, - keep in mind that you are constantly being conditioned by BS coming from people who want to exploit you - 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It starts when you can't even walk, and continues indefinitely. So maybe the first step to stopping being a sucker is to shut your ears to it. The only thing you'll miss is BS. But if you're like the majority - you're too scared of being alone with yourself for even 30 minutes.Self-improve or suffer the consequences.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Context for the 2008 Financial collapse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As of January in 2014 There is now a 3 hour feature length film, "The Wolf of Wall Street." Directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo Dicaprio, and based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government. Without the history and description of "Inside Job" one might simply get the impression that the greed an excess portrayed simply happened in a vacuum. It did not. From the reform of the 1930s of the Glass-Steagall Act and clear separation of investment banker activities from that of the savings and trust banks,until the 1980s the financial system was stable. Investment bankers funded enterprise very carefully with their own money, and nobody was willing to "bet the farm" on shaky investments. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act drove the final nail in the coffin of financial services regulation and the roulette party began which ended on September 15, 2008. It would be interesting if the "Wolf..." drama reflects any of the "Inside Job" narrative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you only watch one political documentary, ever, watch this one. Inside Job details how the major Wall Street banks (in conjunction with the Federal Reserve and Government officials), caused the American economic collapse that inflicted suffering on millions of people, while making millions of dollars, and getting off completely free. If the idea of a full-length documentary on economics sounds dry and boring, don't be scared! Charles Ferguson does an excellent job of making the difficult topics explored in the film entertaining and understandable. Regardless of your political persuasion, you'll find this film poignant and infuriating. Whether a member of the Tea Party or Occupy Wall Street, or anywhere in between, this film will make you question whether the current economic and political system is really designed to benefit the American people, or just a small portion of extremely wealthy (and extremely greedy) individuals and institutions.</fullReview>

It is very accurate in the financial details on the numbers relative to the CBO's, the working structure of derivatives and what happened to create the bubble that collapsed most of the world's economy. There was major securities and financial fraud committed by many but these people were never prosecuted (despite the amount of evidence). I happen to hold an MBA and have a good business background. I did a year of major investigative research on THE FED and these people (like Geithner)for my degree.

		<shortDescription>A nightmare on Wall St</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A chance channel surfing expedition on a Sunday morning got me hooked to this documentary on HBO today. Something that drew me towards it initially were the attributes that goes into making a world class documentary from its first shot. But eventually ended up being a piece of history that should do well in drawing a perspective of the what's and why's of the 2008 economic debacle, for anyone who has a knack for "money". Which I'd like to think is all of us. Narrated beautifully by Matt Damon, "Inside Job" tells a story for what its worth without resorting to dramatics or kneeling on fabrications. The fact that its entire runtime lacked a single hint to a government propaganda, should serve it in good stead for a long time to come. If not as a guide on how to terminate a civilization; at least as a reference on how to avert the possibility of one. Having said that, what really stayed with me long after I'd finished watching it though, was a reality check on how ill-represented the knowledgeable of the world's strongest democracy is. I'd not be delineating from the truth if I assume the one's we trust with our money &amp; future are as susceptible to personal greed and are as misinformed as were the cavemen from once upon a time. The authorities we elect to represent us, to secure and protect us from the evils of the very society we live in, are the ones who are nonchalantly eating into our future, spewing out the remnants of what was rightfully ours. And then you include the prestigious institutes that shapes the great minds that will lead us tomorrow like Columbia University &amp; Harvard into the mix and what you have is "fear" instilled in your minds, almost bordering on depression. While the economic downturn of the late last decade, was a bastard child of some "designer suit clad" but "shot sighted" go getters of the far west, the global economy of today ensured that its impact was far and wide spread. Anyone who buys and sells to another nation irrespective of bi-lateral trade policies is fated to be a part of it's collateral damage. As such everyone I know or work with, had borne some degree of brunt from this downturn. Point in case is me. I work in a developing nation in the South East of Asia for a company that headquarters in California and is the world's biggest IT company. Go figure The feature starts with a panoramic shot of Iceland and its lush green covered undulating landscape that suddenly cuts into a few shots of it's man made concrete infrastructure which I think was intended to represent progress and development of an urban society. It's a short retrospection at what transpired in this Nordic European island nation in the North Atlantic ocean that is strategically placed between North American and the rest of Europe around the same time. It involves the collapsing of all three of their major commercial banks and their inability to refinance their short term debts. They eventually were dependent of the run ins from Netherlands &amp; the UK. Relative to the size of its economy, Iceland's banking collapse is the largest suffered by any country in economic history. In the documentary, this piece works as a preamble to the main chapters that follows right after. A large group of men from Wall Street across its food chain, twisted and turned the laws of finance to yield immediate and exponentially high results that were mutually exclusive and with almost no regard to morality or limitations. It gave way to a world of illusion, which under the garb of rapid financial progress was in reality infested with lies, deceit and cover ups for the common men which sadly was to be only found out after much destruction to the system itself. So much so that, even the most revered thinker of the trade cannot put a timeline to its complete recovery. My bet is, no one can even tell its true meaning anymore. The then Bush government's initial buying into the same school of thought as those greased mouth scavengers is as much revelation as realizing that the one in power i.e. Obama has not been able to to extract much result from all the promises of his presidential campaign that got him elected. I mean what else do you expect when the apples of discord who deserved to be trialed for treason are appointed heads of initiatives that are formed to eradicate the very evils they inculcated in the first place. That in gist is what "Inside Job" is all about. It is told through interviews of the who's who from the various factions within the financial world that calls the shots, sometimes at the expense of our tomorrow.Some pundits would make us believe that although the tax paying men suffered a great deal, the final storm was averted and that we should thank a handful of them for their disaster recovery plans. A movie named "Too Big To Fail" that followed right after in HBO, tends to elaborate on that notion. But for both reasons technical and factual, "Inside Job" is a documentary heads and limbs above any that I have seen in the past few years, including HBO's above original feature. For a piece of history that is both compelling in its taut execution and for its relevance to our future and that of our children, watch "Inside Job".

		<fullReview>This is my first review on IMDb ever, but I thought this documentary deserved it. The cinematography of this documentary is amazing, even the images of pollution of the environment that humans have caused look remarkably appealing to the eye. But this documentary is much more than a stream of beautiful images from across the world.The message that the documentary contains is a strong one: unlike our nations, our ecosystem doesn't have any borders. As humans organized in nation states, we spend 12 times as much on weapons to defend ourselves from each other than we spend on aid for the poorest. The effects of the exploitation of our shared ecosystem will affect us all and will hit those who already face the toughest circumstances the hardest. The problems that our world faces, cannot be solved by America alone. Too long have we focused on what separates us as citizens of specific countries, without realizing that we are all bound together as human beings. Without a rapidly growing global awareness of the situation we are facing, we will leave a much harsher environment for our children, in which natural resources on which we all depend will become increasingly scarce.I am a student in my twenties; the state the world is in today, is how my generation will inherit it, before we will have had the chance to have any effect on this trend. Can this really be the inheritance of a generation that dedicated itself to peace, love and happiness? Maybe. Or maybe it's not too late just yet. You might still be a skeptic about the message the documentary tries to convey after reading my comments, but I promise you this: it will be much harder to be skeptic about that message after having watched Inside Job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The lessons learned after the Great Depression have steadily eroded over time and escalated to the madness this documentary effortlessly reveals.Leaders, academics, economists, consultants and the most lauded financial gurus of the era betray masking their guilt - unable to face a version of reality unpalatable to themselves ? only in realization on screen being interviewed.This documentary delivers a spectrum of how legislated regulations, systems, protections were over-ridden. In substitute an economic boom supported by mania and sustained with debt created a fantasy and a peculiar form of reality now left in the aftermath.I shudder, thinking about my own investment into share trading and toying with the thought of entering the CDO markets. I felt somewhat inadequate unable to grasp the complexity and the working of those instruments.Too chilling now to realize that people far too clever were actually using the system and everyone else in it.Yet custodians of institutions who presided over the demise of their own corporations were rewarded handsomely. Failure, error and fraud were sins paid by everyone else globally.Governments and our faith in them are the casualty among the masses of millions suffering.The viewer can't help speculate that no lessons have been learned and we are still in the midst of a model continuing to unravel for however long it will take.Inside Job masterfully spells out the inter-relationships and the working of funding and arrangements that even now appear unbelievable except for the repercussions and the consequences.Whatever we still face globally we have a spotlight and a mirror to know and to see ourselves reflecting a contorted image. At least now it is more real than we thought it was.The protagonists now plea they should have been saved from themselves. If only they saw their own flaws before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not have a much knowledge of financial market and never knew the reason why the global recession happened, but after watching this comprehensive film which is beautifully portrayed, I can say I have learned 'A' of a financial market. The master minds who are all behind this scenario must be punished and should not be given a room to repeat the same major offense in future. I found some part of this film kept in suspense and should have been much more realistic to the public. I hope who ever saw this film would have learned that in future no smart business person will invest their capital blindly into the companies highlighted, rather how to &amp; where to invest?

		<shortDescription>A brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has done a great job at explaining the issues, how we have arrived at this place. Great story telling ? simply a brilliant film. Well worth watching!The film establishes the economic crisis by starting with the economic microcosm of Iceland, and then progresses to include the western economies. Charles Ferguson does a great job at explaining complex financial products and their harmful effect on the economy. I agree with Eliot Spitzer (for the first time in my life) that the instigators of this crisis should be looking at criminal prosecution. Inside Job is balanced, and a story well told. Inside Job is the film Michael Moore should have made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So you think you can trust me?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Charles Ferguson's Inside Job, I got lost in its concepts, its economic jargon, and its lengthy, drawn-out explanation of the 2007-08 financial crisis North America, and pretty much the world, was impacted by. After a semester of AP (advanced placement) Macroeconomics under my belt, I return with the idea that I think I know anything and everything about macroeconomics, the economy, and approach Inside Job with more of a knowledge about its terms. This is the kind of film that is reminiscent of one of those social clubs downtown where, if you try to jump in with no background knowledge as to what some of the basics of the club are, you're going to be lost in the shuffle.The film attempts to explain to the average person - who bears some understanding of the American macroeconomic system - why the last few years have been painful, why the recovery has been lengthy and ostensibly nonexistent, and why the financial crash occurred in the first place. I won't begin to try to summarize it here for several reasons: it could spawn a plethora of confusion, the explanation, even in a simple sense, deserves its own separate blog post, and that's what the film is for in the first place.I will say that the film's main point of why we entered such a crippling recession in the first place was because of banks marketing heavy loans to people they knew couldn't afford them. The loans were called "subprime loans," and even the issuers of the loans were betting against the casual American investor who bought into the scheme. Millions defaulted on their mortgage payments and their loans, and as a result, the housing market crashed and we were left with millions in a dire financial turmoil.The field of economics is, in my opinion, alienating beyond belief, because, much like science, it seems every single sentence in an article bears three or four words you don't understand. When trying to find definitions on those words, you are lost and wayward in trying to find the meaning of other words that were given in the definitions of the words you initially didn't understand. To top it all off, even on the news, you hear about murder, drugs, suicide, war, terror, the weather, and so on - everything that seems much more active and interesting than hearing that "the DOW dropped 'x' amount of points today." Inside Job attempts to cut through that alienation and, in turn, makes complex ideas accessible to the general public. Furthermore, the film details how during the time of the massive economic downturn, the field of economics lost a great deal of credibility because economists decided to write false reports and deliver false ideas on the economy's progress and current state for others, all working to swindle the common American investor and work for only ones personal gang. It's a cruel and unusual truth that, as a result, put a damper on an unbelievably valuable field that teaches one how to conserve and utilize current resources.The only concern of my was the way the film was edited, which seemed to be geared towards giving some people less opportunity to speak. Some interviews are cut off right after a question is asked, which usually happens after one of the talking head economists says something stupid. One thing I'm beginning to notice about documentaries is how editing plays a big part in the message they convey, and I couldn't help but feel that editors Chad Beck and Adam Bolt cut out crucial additional material that would've further shed light on certain circumstances, rather than stopping at one of the economist's poorly-worded answers.If anything, the film goes on to illustrate the idea that there is no one you can't trust but yourself in today's world. The Wall Street brokers and investors couldn't care less about you, as they spend a hefty part of their salaries and your investments on high-end hookers, drugs, and Girls Gone Wild tapes, the economists want to work in lockstep with those giving them the biggest kickbacks, and even the wealthy CEOs of banks we've all heard of can orchestrate large schemes but still can barely answer a simple question without fumbling the words. It's a frightening world we live in nowadays, one that, despite more awareness to many social issues and one that tries to emphasize safety, is still extremely reckless in many respects.Inside Job, in a documentary's sense, is one big, angry, well-stated argument that makes an attempt to clarify all the information one needs to know about the financial crisis and even attempts to place blame on the individuals that apparently caused such a crisis. It's a hefty goal for itself, and the film really shouldn't succeed as well as it does. However, through clarity, a brisk-pace, and the ability to give us a clear indication on why this film impacts each and every one of us deserves praise that should simply not be shortchanged. It's an important picture; arguably the most important you'll see in a specific year.Narrated by: Matt Damon. Directed by: Charles Ferguson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Armageddon will be coming from the bankers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plain and simple when you watch this movie about how corruption of the system is orchestrated by the banking industry.Director Charles Ferguson, and producer Audrey Marrs (any connection to Jim Marrs ?) shows in a concise way how banking industry pulled the string on financial crisis of 2008. But the implication goes much higher in that top government officials were in on it too, and cabinet members of Obama administration are heavily populated by the very people who caused the financial crisis.If you see this film, and still don't get the connection, you're thick as mud, because the inference is so clear.Government officials are not elected, they are selected to serve the money moguls of this world. They don't think twice about gaining while stealing from the innocent people.They've ruined the economy of just about every country of this world, and they have no end in sight. Their goal of course is total control of the world.One of these days it's going to be Armageddon when enough people gets clued in on insider information.It's a great world that people like these are making movies like this.Thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder who next Charles Ferguan will dissect. As usual he takes a complex subject and distills into an eloquent, analytical and objective documentary. Having worked in financial services for more than 15 years (still do) I believe his take is spot on but to a large extent expected - when you take extremely competitive, intelligent people with lots of ambition and pay them lots of money in an industry focused on profit the outcome is certain. There is no other reason to work in any of the large banks over the last twenty years other than to make money. This is the reason I did and countless others do it and try to remain in it. The incentives and money in finance are so pervasive that politicions and academics succumb so easily.If you want a concise and accurate description then this movie is the best I have seen. It is indeed somewhat amusing that so many key players declined to be part of the movie and dismaying to still see such a powerful lobby for the financial industry. Darwin's theory is apparent in the professional world as it is in animal world. Money makes the world go round and always will - give the masses the illussion that they have power and destiny over their own lives and they will believe it, especially with such distractions such as facebook, football and magazines! This movie is not biased - just the way things are - thank god I work for a bank!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion it pulls the lid off of the lies behind the causes that led to the near collapse of the world's economy. As the preivous reviewer would have you believe the collapse of the world economy began with the loans made to minorities. The actual cause of the collapse was unregulated GREED! The United States got out of the business of manufactoring and into the business of debt. At the bottom of the conspiracy we had loan brokers lending sub-prime loans to people that really could have qualified for other vehicles. The brokers took their commission and moved on to the next victim. The reason the film starts of with Iceland is to illustrate on a smaller scale what happened. Iceland did not start off with lending to minorities, the problem was leveraging the debt without regulation. The movie is so infomative it really takes two viewings to fully grasp the dept of the deceit and greed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the whining public outcry mixed with interesting facts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This by far is one of the best documentary about the general housing crisis, however it is like all the other documentaries. It is not a crime to profit at the expense of society, matter fact most of society thinks that is ideal. People got loans off houses they could never afford to repay to get money. Bank CEOs were paid huge amounts of money for giving them money in exchange for promises to repay that money plus interest which they knew they could never repay. Talk about a win win. Everyone gets money. The only reason people whine about it now is that they spent the money, and think it so unfair rich people did not spend it. Beyond that people desire riches just like them and are simply envious that a bunch of people made really simple choices to profit at the expense of everyone else. I am so sorry I thought that was capitalism, perhaps I am mistaken, but really the banks are but a manifestation of the nature of its people. The people do not care if they actual benefit society, as long as they obtain more than everyone else they are happy. the CEO's in banks have the same philosophy as you do, so stop whining about it, and realize you deserved to be screwed by them as you would do the same thing if you were in their shoes. The economic crisis is a failure of everyone, not just some escape goats. The CEO's ethical standards are about the same as the average individual, if it were not the case, then so would the CEO's ethical standards be higher, ethics is a collective cultural nature. Its going to be the same as high or low as you go. I call it justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but complicated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon narrates this documentary which examines the financial collapse of 2008. After the Great Depression, many laws were put in place to avoid another melt down of the economy. Unfortunately, many of the laws were weakened over time by big companies such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, Citigroup, AIG, and many other now familiar names who wrote the regulations through lobbyists in Washington, DC. The problem with the film is that the system is so complicated, with derivatives, credit default swaps, sub prime mortgages and the like that by the end of the almost two hours of analysis, my head was spinning from information overload. We all know that the top one percent are in control and screwing the rest of us and for a better and more interesting movie, check out Michael Moore's Capitalism instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The world is full of mean people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentary filmmaker Charles Ferguson (No End in Sight) takes aim at the economic crisis with his latest feature, Inside Job, a recollection of the events that transpired leading up to our economy's collapse. Narrated by Matt Damon, Ferguson shows us a very academic approach to the reason why we are in this mess, showing various charts, acronyms, and complex explanations for the tactics and policies put in place.The film opens with a brief examination of the economic troubles that consumed the small nation of Iceland. This segment serves as a small-scale model for what happened in the US and is mentioned later on in the film. We are then thrust into New York City, through a montage of fly by shots and panoramic views of Manhattan, evoking the style of Oliver Stone's Wall Street, accompanied by similar music that film used. It's almost out of place given the tone that follows the rest of the film. Alex Heffes' score fits nicely in the background, creating an ominous atmosphere that lingers.Though Ferguson's research is in depth and explains how certain institutions like AIG, Goldman Sachs, and Merryl Lynch "screwed" over the majority of Americans, it comes off as cold and informal. Damon's voice over sounds like it belongs on an educational DVD. His voice takes away from the gravity of the film. It would be suited better for something like Planet Earth.It's this informal, often cold approach that kept me distant, unable to really jump into the film. Michael Moore, the lightning rod of the documentary world, released one of the first docs about this subject with Capitalism: A Love Story, a film in true Michael Moore fashion showing us who was to blame and how much we should hate them in a satirically, funny way. His approach was a lot more engaging, bombarding us with archival footage that was pieced together to fit his model perfectly. I'm not saying this approach is the best and only way to talk about this topic, but there is something to be said for showmanship.While Capitalism was engaging and entertaining, it was too cavalier about the subject. Inside Job doesn't fool around, even when it has a chance to. There is an interview with the owner/operator of a Manhattan brothel for the Wall Street elite. Her interview is conducted in a serious manner (as it should be), but I was amazed at how nonchalant Ferguson was with this segment. This woman, whose looks belong on the E! Channel, discusses briefly how she has catered to the Wall Street big wigs providing services the general public wouldn't like to know comes out of the company's budget. Moore would have had a field day with this one, but Ferguson approaches with a sort of grace that is refreshing.Inside Job has excellent photography accompanied by a large quantity of facts and diagrams, but there was nothing behind it. It seems forced and flat. . Even when Ferguson, whose voice can be heard during select interviews, is in disbelief at how some people can't seem to blame key figures like Henry Paulson, all we here are one or two lines from Ferguson disagreeing. There are also, it seems, more slides telling us who refused to be interviewed for this film than there are participants. We assume that individuals being made out as bad guys will decline an offer to appear in a movie like this. There is a real disconnect from the material due to the wordiness of the diagrams and figuresI left the film feeling sort of mellow. It wasn't as devastating as I thought it would be. Perhaps I had already heard a lot of these figures and accusations before in other films and on the news. The main reason for this feeling though was the films conclusion. There was no message of hope. A documentary like this usually presents a potential solution, like in Davis Guggenheim's An Inconvenient Truth. Yes, our present situation is bleak, but it's not the end of the world. Instead we are presented with an image of the Statue of Liberty, telling us that we need to fight for freedom. But how? It's left wide open. After all of the complicated diagrams and complex schemes, it's hard to find a place to start fixing. Who can help us? Where do we start? Is there hope? I guess we'll have to wait for another documentary to tell us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, with everyone else on the planet, I suffer because the economy broke. And I was curious about a documentary supposedly Oscar-worthy. This is very good storytelling, and economical filmmaking. But it is pretty damning to say of anything that Oliver Stone's simplification was richer.The problem any documentarian faces is the balance between telling an engaging story and exploring the thing of interest honestly. These folks decided to take the low road and tell a story that is true and upsetting: greedy men dangerously abuse power and win while everyone else pays. We watch and get upset. We easily can blame "the other" for our predicament.These sorts of documentaries do more harm than good because they propagate the fiction that things really are as simple as bad guys doing bad things. The simpler we believe the world to be, the more surprised we will be when it behaves as it wants.So it is not enough to be true, to make sense and to separate and absolve the viewer. We need to understand this with enough depth to be informed voters. Our responsibility goes beyond finding someone to punish, right?I've become aware of two other parallel versions, both also true but more thought provoking.One is that this depression is only the first tremor because collectively we take more and live better than we deserve. Most of us do things that just aren't very valuable. There is a structural imbalance in our ability to pull more out of the world than we put back in. Call it greed if you want, and examine the fact that we bend the system for short term gain every bit as much as the villains here.But there is a more interesting story. We just don't know what we are doing with economics. It is not a well-founded science. Even the august academic experts are guessing. Putting them in front of cameras and accusing them of negligence is negligent journalism. It is akin to blaming greedy doctors for our health crisis or "bad teachers" for the collapse in education. The truth is that no one knows. Yes, we have people whose predictions proved true. But if you do a study, you will find that there are always prophets of doom. Most turn out wrong and some turn out right but there is no connection between the quality of the insight and their gut feel. They are accidents, just like many high tech millionaires are and whose analyses we similarly trust.What actually happened is that as many people were gaming the system as could, and everyone relied on the same analytical tools, tools that said things would be all right. We know where it broke: the Black?Scholes model which everyone on the planet used as if it were Newton's law of finance.In due time, some intelligent filmmaker will do a documentary on the fallacy of logic in societal dynamics. She will explore why numbers should have never been the way to model value. And let's hope that she wins an Oscar for actually making us smarter.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I am economist (even though with no consultancy post at financial institutions) by training, so caution is in place. But in one word this movie is stupid. Well, at least for a documentary. For a normal movie, well, I would say its a 80s style: there are bad guys, who do only bad things, even though sometimes they do two opposite things. These bad guys do these things because they are evil and they are paid for it. Then there are good guys, who as always are rather on the margin of society, but in the end they are vilified. And of course they are these innocent bystanders, who are unfairly hurt by the actions of the bad guys.However, this in no 80s and this is no movie. It claims to be a documentary. As such, it fails to go deep into the causes of the crisis. It is very demagogue in use of the dialog material. In sum, if you understand or are trying to understand financial crisis, don't watch this movie - either you will get angry or you will get a wrong idea about it.</fullReview>

From Wall Street and the Bush Administration to Barrack Obama, Inside Job digs deep into the American "Crisis" and offers many, if way too many, facts and numbers. Financial executives make too much money off of the poor. They turned their back on society, caused the employment, and corrupted the system. Charles Ferguson was just trying to get that point across, but he done it in a fashionable time and elegance.But perhaps Inside Job offers too many financial smarts that most viewers don't care for. A documentary has got to inform and give facts, and the film does that well. But I would like this to be an entertaining ride as well. Unfortunately, Inside Job failed to actually hook the general audience, set aside the interested.OscarBuzz: Best Documentary.

		<fullReview>"Inside Job" (2010) documentary explains nothing clearly, identifies no clear villains, and isn't good "Scapegoat Theatre" ore plain old good show biz done well! ------------I got INSIDE JOB (2010) in the mail yesterday (ordered a cheap used DVD from good old reliable Amazon.Com), screened it last night.Ugh!The movie didn't provide clear information, targets, villains to remember......nothing. Wasn't good "Scapegoat Theatre" in the honored tradition of "All The President's Men" (1975) starring Robert Redford (which implied the Republican Party tried to murder Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, and got away with it!), or "The China Syndrome" (1979) starring Jane Fonda and Jack Lemon (which claimed power industry people sent hit men after employees willing to be "whistleblowers", and got away with it!).When the "Michael Moore Memorial Scapegoat Movie Awards" for "Best Scapegoat Movies In History" are set up (definitely an unmet need in today's world), two movies which don't deserve top honors as "good scapegoat movies" are certainly "Inside Joh" (2010) and it's brother movie about the 2008 finance industry "meltdown" "Too Big To Fail" 2012 starring William Hurt as the anguished USA Secretary Of The Treasury.I spent two wasted hours watching "Inside Job" (2010) and I wasn't a happy camper when the movie was over.Just 2 hours of tormented, uncomfortable, intense guys wearing dark suits and ties talking about, complaining about, apologizing for who knows what?The movie didn't explain anything clearly, didn't identify or highlight a single understandable issue."We got trouble right here in River City" all seemed to agree.....OK....so what?The best part, such that any best part occurred at all, was when the insincere and bureaucratically skilled Dean Of The Columbia University (NYC) Business School sort of lost it toward the end of the movie, and told the guy interviewing him he (the Dean) was sorry he agreed to be interviewed, and the interview would end in 3 more minutes and.....that's ALL!Tough dude!That part of the movie was supposed to show how academics in famous business schools were big supporters of the Wall St. players they (the academics) helped make rich and gave profitable advice to (what at Business Schools for, anyway?) the bad guys who made big money and walked away with it during the "meltdown" crisis of 2001-2007.People go to business schools to learn how to get rich.That's what the schools teach, the best they (the schools) can.The movie producers tried to vilify the school teachers at the business schools for doing their job.Well......OK.At least it would have provided at least one clear villain and one clear target, one clear issue......bad guys at business schools.George W. Bush was (is) a Harvard Biz School grad....has a Master's from that school.That's a start. Go after Biz School grads, esp. famous ones who go on to get power and big money! Great show biz!The "Business School grads and teachers conspiracy" would have made GREAT "scapegoat theater" and INSIDE JOB (also TOO BIG TO FAIL) would have been much more entertaining and watchable (this has nothing to do with logical and morally worthy).Anyway, the closest INSIDE JOB came to being good show biz was the scene when the agitated Columbia U. Dean told his interviewer off....sort of, and politely!Great!</fullReview>

I don't count celebrities as they are more occidental.

Yes, this doc can upset you.Now the bad.There is a segment which I thought was thrown in like a tear-jerky but ineffective. That is a sequence showing a Mexican immigrant family's case in a default mortgage loan. This part didn't fit the entire doc's feel.And they had to throw in a few 'targets' to lighten up the doc. There are 2 to 3 subjects that may or may not knew what kind of interviews they were getting into. Or maybe, more sadly, they are just trying to keep their job.And it could have been deeper, trace a bit back to the 'Acent of Money', and surely, this is ONLY an issue caused by Americans ?

		<shortDescription>Informative, but biased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched Inside Job on Starz and was very disappointed. Like most films about a controversial topic, it is highly slanted and painted with a biased brush. While much of the information is factually accurate, it is also washed, dried, folded, and arranged to make it look only a certain way. The good: the film did a decent job explaining the tough things that confuse the public, such as defining things like a CDS, CDO, MBS, and derivatives. I thought this part of the film did an OK job for setup. The bad: this film was obviously done with heavy liberal bias against the rich or 1% as they affectionately call it nowadays. The CEOs, executives, and workers at all of the major banks, and their teammates, were all painted as just greedy people wanting as much money as possible due to their own addictions to hookers, drugs, vacation homes, and power. Like many liberal hit pieces, it is done to make the rich look like their only goal in life is to step on poor people. What this film will not acknowledge though is that everybody loves money, and the goal of Wall Street investment institutions, like investment banks, is to make money for their clients. Those clients include pension funds, money market accounts, other retirement savings, all of which are owned by ordinary people. The ugly: the analysis of this film attempts to steer us in the direction that the result was the rich got richer, the poor got poorer, and nobody was to blame for this mess, aside from rich bankers and Republican political appointees. There is never any mention made that the subprime borrowers, who are painted as victims, are really ultimately responsible due to the fact that they took out loans that they could never afford, merely because they thought that home values could never go down, and even defaulting would result in making money. This was enabled by the Community Redevelopment Act, and players like Barney Frank, who was a commentator for this film, and made to look like he was the Congressional angel who tried to stop it, but was given no power to. In reality, the special interests that he represented were the poor and handout crowd that wanted big homes and big credit, but when large banks that were demonized in this film wouldn't extend them credit, people like Barney Frank told these banks they had to, by law. Did the banks profit on the backs of their clientele? Yes. Did they do anything illegal? No. Is it their responsibility to stop their clients from making poor investment choices? Absolutely not. The investment banks were merely the middlemen who knew how to profit off of the merry- go-round of cash and credit. Unfortunately, most people will see this movie which centers on demonizing the rich (nominated by rich guy Matt Damon), and take it as the entire truth, when it is really only a small slice of it.Another ugly thing about this film was the creative editing done to the interviews. It stinks of a Michael Moore type film. You could hear the filmmaker asking his interviewees questions, and then see the editing snips done to it. Its obvious that we don't get full, streaming interviews, but merely pieces that support the filmmaker's viewpoint, or make the interviewee look bad. Also, the filmmaker has a mocking and derogatory tone to the political appointees and financial professionals that don't support his viewpoint, that did agree to be interviewed for this film. This isn't the worst film in the world to become more educated, but far more research needs to be done by the individual to be truly informed of the entire picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>100% biased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again we hear the line that the economic debacle was solely caused by deregulation and unbridled capitalism. Not one time were the activities of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mentioned (mentioned in passing as innocent victims), pushing and backing subprime mortgages, or the Community Reinvestment Act that forced banks to lend to poor or minorities. Or the criminally low interest rates. One ends up with the impression that it could have all been prevented had we listened to Barney Frank! I feel sorry for the many people for whom this "documentary" will the only view they have on what happened.It makes this a "predatory documentary".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inside Job Hack Job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very close to the truth. The greed was definitely there. I saw it first hand being involved in the new home industry at the meltdown. What was omitted was the fact that A.C.O.R.N and other left leaning groups would picket banks, call them racist bigots if they didn't make the "NINJA" loans; (No Income, No Job, No Assets.) That, in my opinion, prompted banks to cover their assets by covering their bottom line with derivatives. Like I said...just an opinion. But...Barney Frank and Chris Dodd were up to their necks in this swindle of the American taxpayer. Why was this omitted? And, why did they allow a defender of these lawmakers, a fellow Liberal, Matt Damon, to narrate the film? Instead they allowed Frank to give his opinion that was obviously slanted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best part were the many beautiful city flyovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I learned a few useful things and enjoyed some of the interviews but mostly found it to be too long, rambling, and unsatisfying. The movie seemed to be hunting for the place to lay blame so by chasing the trail of responsibility I expected some sort of conclusion. Even a conclusion that we're all to blame would have been fine but it didn't do that either. Without any sort of conclusion it felt incomplete and therefore disappointing after a two hour set-up. Maybe it would have been better as a 1 or 2 part PBS special. I honestly did love the many beautiful cityscape flyovers which is the only reason that I scored it as having a slightly positive net value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Talking Heads, Could Use More Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie does some things well. Script is excellent. Interesting talking heads, including some heavy hitters. And it's less than two hours. But Inside Job relies too heavily on narration.Compare it to the banned Saturday Night Live skit of October 2008. (It's back. Google "SNL banned skit" to see it.) In under eight minutes, SNL tells the same story but in a more memorable way.SNL had George Soros saying he's shorting the dollar, which prompts this: Bush: Oh, really. That's not good. Soros: You're not to speak. I don't like you. In response, President Bush shrugs and moves to the background.Is that a good summary of the relationship between the financial industry and the government, or what?SNL dramatized using fiction. Inside Job could have dramatized using facts. How about interviewing a mortgage broker in Las Vegas, where 85% of single-family residences are now under water? How about interviewing a 56 year-old with retirement money gone and an unemployed daughter &amp; family in the spare bedroom? There is natural arc to this story. Deregulation under President Reagan. Slow easing of lending standards. Weak warnings. Accelerated easing of lending standards. Stronger warnings. Crash! Bam! Lehman Brothers! Paulson down on one knee. Armageddon avoided. Country holds breath for next two years.This dramatic arc should have been played more heavily.Five stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The quality of this film's perspective can be determined by reading an abundance of reviews on IMDb that prove none of its viewers actually understand the subprime fiasco.The real joke is, the heads of these firms were more ignorant of what happened than anyone else involved. Their emails hardly prove complicity in anything but speculation, which is what one does in the financial markets -- financial speculation. The comments at the Oscars were inappropriate and further prove making the movie did nothing to increase either the filmmakers' or the audience's understanding of what happened.We all know that there are ruthless "characters" on Wall St. as in every profession (even more in Entertainment!). The joke is, the biggest fraud turned out to be Spitzer, on whom the filmmakers rely for commentary! So, come to this film for a profile of said characters, but do not expect to find it a source of great illumination on the situation, and for heaven's sakes, do not believe for a minute that you are being told the whole story!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie has the Crises Backwards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Inside Job" whitewashes the role of government-sponsored Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the financial debacle. The federal chartered mortgage giants underwrote almost half the bad loans in the sub-prime crisis. This film gives the government a pass except as Gene Epstein said, "...as stooges or agents of the capitalists.""The financial system corrupted our political system," actor Matt Damon narrates at the end of the film, "and plunged the world economy into crisis." "In fact, the movie has it exactly backwards."Reviews have neglected to mention the filmmaker's political activism. Ferguson, who in fact is not a journalist and contributed more than $220,000 to the Democratic Party and Democrat candidates. This film is political propaganda masquerading as a serious documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... that are true, so are a lot of false or completely lacks research.I agree with "slythinker" on all parts. The heavily government involvement is fairly mentioned. Mostly only the private banks. For an example. In part about Iceland so did they make it sound like if the banks, or the government, wouldn't have economic problem if they were run by the state. But how do they know? They never mentioned why, and never mentioned the state involvement with the banks. The conclusion totally lacks any kind of research behind it. (I know that the government were heavily involved) Why I'm also saying this is because the greatest housing bubble were not created in the US, it's created in China and which have not burst yet. All through state controlled banks.And all of sudden when they speak about Iceland so do they bring up an American company who built an factory their and they describe it something evil only to spoil the nature. But not mentioning how, why and completely leaving out several important factors like economy and jobs for the Icelandic people. But why did they even bring it up? I would imagine that many Icelandic people are happy for someone to invest in their country in these hard times."Overdose" is far better of if you actually wan't to learn something about the economic system. "Insider job" left me full with questions, like if the producers have been bribed to make this film or if the people behind it just made something to gain some popularity, or that they just actually lacked the enthusiasm to make something that actually could be something great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just what exactly is meant about "Inside", eh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an ugly little film, I watched it because I wanted to see a balanced account of the state of world power and the insanity of the mutual self-destruction doctrine, what I got was a piece of propaganda that Goebbels himself would have been proud of. I watched open mouthed as the political bias of the makers was laid bare for all to see, they must really think we are moronic. If as I suspect this is just a 'psy-op' to make the world believe that is 'woz the Arabs, wot dun it' when a nuclear device is exploded on US soil, then you will see the truth in what I'm saying soon, I pray to God and feverishly hope to the pit of my soul that I am wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't bother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dreadfully presented and extremely tedious superficial study of the Global Financial Crisis. It provides no insight into the cause other than that which is general knowledge. A very one-dimensional procession of talking heads. True, they are greedy and amoral human beings but didn't we know that? My biggest beef with this film is that it has robbed me of 110 min of my life I will never see again.The film never attempted to explain why the leading financial minds in America became so obsessed with their own wealth and devoid of any morality. Although it did attempt to explain how all regulations were dismantled it did not consider why this was allowed to occur. It was never suggested that there even was a reason why the mechanisms t o prevent this sort of corrupt behaviour were dismantled all around the world at the same time. That might have been interesting and could have broken some new ground.Very disappointing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst financial movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a huge disappointment. The movie is extremely biased, it targets people with no financial knowledge and presents one-sided opinion. What can you say about the quality of a documentary in which people are not given a chance to finish their thoughts, the words are cut out of the context, key people decline even to speak with movie makers. Academic persons regret they agreed to participate in the interviews at the first place, as questions are not structured, irrelevant and very general. Those who disagree with me, just think how a 2-hour movie, in which you have to explain the very basic concepts of finance, like CDO, can cover the most complex situation in the century, which could not be predicted and explained by political leaders, corporate leaders, and leading social scientists. People should be educated in finance, to make better decisions themselves (like not to take loans they can't repay), while this movie in a disgraceful manner, just one more time blames those who make our world exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie presents 10% of a complicated picture and makes one to believe it is 100%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, the movie has a bright side and a dark side. I enjoyed to see known people talk about the economical crisis and giving their side of the story. I enjoyed to see witnesses given in Washington by bankers accused of their shameful practices. I think the movie put my attention on the deep problem of lobbying, which results in inefficient regulation and creates a threat for the whole system. The big problem with the movie, however, is black and white approach it takes. It presents 10% of a complicated picture and makes one to believe that it is 100%. For example, deregulation is widely accepted as one of reasons for the economical crisis. In the movie, it is represented in such a way that it looks ridiculous how a law on deregulation could pass - corrupted officials is a hint. In the book "Turbulent Age" Alan Greenspan talks about regulation. It is a problem with two ends: regulation decays economic growth and results in inefficient use of a capital. Just think about Soviet Union as the extreme case of regulation. It's not a simple answer where the balance should be, unlike the impression one can get from the movie. Too much populism and short vision.</fullReview>
