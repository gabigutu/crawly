		<shortDescription>A Stunning Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. If there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. The film's unlikely hero is Quill (Chris Pratt), an eccentric gunfighter in the Han Solo mould who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil warlord Ronan. When he dispatches his top assassin, the green- skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), to recover the artifact, the pair find themselves locked up, along with the galaxy's most unlikely bounty hunters ? a gun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick (Vin Diesel) who just happens to be a walking tree. All the actors do a great job at portraying there characters, they feel real beings. You get to know about them and their struggles and you become attached to them. Every character in the movie got their time to shine, especially Rocket Raccoon who is voiced perfectly by Bradley Cooper. Everyone is pitch perfect in their roles even Batista! For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well. What really can't be stressed enough is just how insanely fun and entertaining Guardians of the Galaxy is for literally its entire two-hour-plus run-time. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this. all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely done, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it. Go see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I entitle my review A New Hope as I walk out of the cinema feeling like I have just watched the Star Wars of our generation!As a huge Marvel fan (both comics and film) I was delighted to hear this film was getting made with the perfect choice of Guardians and what a perfect cast to play them. The biggest surprise for me was Dave Bautista who I thought was only cast for his size but his delivery was spot on for Drax. Chris Pratt was hilarious whilst still excellent at delivering some of the films most emotional scenes.CGI in this film was super, there's nothing I hate more than too much CGI in a film but it was so good in Guardians that I was completely lost in it. Never have a seen space look so good, the battles were incredible and Groot and Rocket never looked out of place (aside from being a tree and raccoon).Gunn is the perfect director for this, his tone, his balance of comedy, action and emotion blended perfectly and directing GOTG would have been no easy job. DC are still trying hard to get Justice League going, Marvel just made a film with a talking tree and Raccoon and it was AWESOME!!!Not a bad performance all round and comic fans will be happy with certain nods and winks scattered throughout. Probably my top Marvel film yet, it has the fresh new feeling the first Iron Man had with all the action and humour of The Avengers. 10 stars from me, even if your not a comic book or sci-fi fan, this movie has something for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sprawling space opera full of humor and action.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember sitting in Hall H at Comic-Con two years ago, when Marvel first announced Guardians of the Galaxy. This came on the heels of the title reveals for Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Thor: The Dark World, and my initial reaction was one of utter confusion. What the hell was Guardians of the Galaxy? I was completely unfamiliar with the source material, and upon learning that the team featured a gun-wielding raccoon and a fighting tree creature whose could only speak a single phrase, I was even more puzzled.Fast forward to Comic-Con 2013, when James Gunn appeared onstage in Hall H to showcase the first trailer for the film. It was so unlike anything Marvel had ever done before, so far outside the box that I immediately fell in love with it and couldn't wait to see more. Although that first trailer was well-received by the Comic-Con audience, the general public seemed to be scratching their heads in much the same way that I had when the film was first announced. Marvel fans would love this, no doubt, but could this bizarre little sci-fi romp with a cast of unknown characters actually work?The answer is a resounding "yes," as Guardians of the Galaxy is not only an exceptionally well-made comic-book film, but an exceptionally well- made film, period. It's a sprawling space opera with a host of memorable characters, a joyous sci-fi romp through beautifully realized worlds, wildly inventive action sequences, and an almost nonstop barrage of humor and fun. The protagonists are a bizarre assembly of losers and misfits, with the CG-created Rocket and Groot providing some of the most emotional and human moments of the film, and it's all brilliant. Marvel should be applauded for allowing Gunn the opportunity to realize his vision, because rest assured, this film wouldn't have been nearly as good with someone else at the helm.Guardians of the Galaxy has a distinct personality that sets it apart from other Marvel offerings, yet there are enough recognizable elements to remind audiences that it exists in the same world. Clocking in at just under two hours, the film maintains an impressively well-balanced pace, avoiding the problem of over-inflation that many superhero films fall victim to. I can't think of a single moment when I wasn't completely enthralled with everything that happens on screen, and as soon as the credits began to roll I was ready to watch it all over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Expectations: surpassed - and they were pretty damn high to begin with.Excitement: met - after watching the teasers, the clips, and after Captain America the Winter soldier I was crossing my fingers Marvel were on a roll.Face: still trying to recover - you know when you go to the cinema to see a comedy ( a film designed to make you laugh ) and you feel like an idiot for paying for the ticket as you were forcing most of the laughter in the company of your friends? This is a film that it's genuinely easy to laugh about: The humour is so subtle because the characters are so subtle - they're not too animated, they're not too stereotypical and they are NOT what we've come to expect from traditional superheroes and THAT'S WHY THIS FILM WORKS SO WELL! Regardless if you're a Marvel fan or simply a fan of movies in general this is an experience you will welcome as it's new and refreshing to a sci-fi genre which really needed something new and refreshing and with great performances, stunning visuals and a barrel of laughs mixed with the right amount of action this was a real treat to watch.Thank you Marvel Studios.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great expectations before the film, definitely, and they really paid off. Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the best Marvel films to date, and a really good sci-fi at that too. The film is strong on so many levels, outstanding characters, great worlds, is emotional and humorous.Peter Quill, or Star Lord as he likes to call himself, is a quick-witted man of Earth thrown into the far reaches of galaxy, who has stolen an artifact that everyone seems to want. By accident he stumbles upon four other characters, Gamora the assassin, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket the enhanced raccoon and Groot the humanoid tree, and the five of them form an unlikely team. The characters are really well presented, their emotional core is strong and back stories engaging. In short, they're interesting and easy to like. All of them have great moments and keep us wanting for more and more. Rocket, in particular, steals the show with his anger management problems and bright one-liners. It was great to see a group of people each with their own agenda come together, this dynamic worked really well. Star-Lord carried a lot of this weight, and was very sympathetic.The film doesn't take itself very seriously, which was refreshing to see after also great yet darker themes of Thor and Captain America 2's. Guardians has a lot of laughs, witty dialogue, characters rub off on each other (and the audience), writing is perfect. The film is so entertaining, non-stop adventure but also knows when to balance with more dramatic themes. Scenery and worlds are spectacular, visual effects top notch. As a reader of the Guardians comics it was great to see some smaller motifs thrown in that may not be necessarily caught by regular viewers, but which the comic book readers will definitely be thankful for too.All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy was an awesome watch. Amazing characters, vivid cinematography, great dialogue, lots of humor, soundtrack was nice, story exciting. This wonderful adventure and its captivating characters will be in mind for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best superhero movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know, I know. This will incontrovertibly attract a lot of hate from die-hard Dark Knight fans, but guess what? I'm one of those who thinks Nolan is the epitome of how to make a perfect superhero spectacle. Or at least, I was until tonight. This film will blow your mind. Quite literally, it is jam-packed with edge-of-your-seat action thrills and pure comedic gold. Don't be expecting a moody companion piece like that of Nolan's trilogy, or Man of Steel. It keeps more in touch with Avengers, although it's a lot funnier and really builds upon the upcoming Infinity Gauntlet arc. The actors are incredible, matching the character developments, the dialogue and action sequences are spectacular and the visual effects should surely earn a nod come Oscar time, as I'd personally put them on par with those seen in the recent Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The run length compliments the well-scripted pacing of the movie itself, whilst plenty of interesting secondary characters litter Guardians with an ensemble cast that has exceeded anything yet seen in the Marvel/DC movie worlds. I don't pertain to the DC versus Marvel argument, but this masterpiece alone has certainly put Marvel on the front foot in terms of cinema outings, far surpassing the very enjoyable Man of Steel and, I believe, edging out Nolan's trilogy and then some. I thoroughly recommend this for any with a borderline sci-fi/superhero love, and advise you to remain for the tantalising post-credits scene, although many of the non-comic fans might not get the references. Easily a perfect ten out of ten for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most unique and delightful film Marvel has created to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Rating: 12A, 121 mins) Written by Zen Terrelonge Starring ? Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Dave Bautista, Vin DieselIf you've seen the trailers for Guardians of the Galaxy, you'd be within your rights to think Marvel Studio execs have been hitting the bottle hard or taking LSD.The film revolves around a group of dysfunctional but goodhearted criminals ? think Robin Hood's Merry Men of the future ? comprising human thief Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Pratt), green assassin Gamora (Saldana), talking raccoon Rocket (Cooper), knife-wielding Drax the Destroyer (Bautista), and walking tree Groot (Diesel).Like the Avengers, the Guardians get off to a false start but soon unite over a common cause, namely, the galaxy being obliterated by genocidal maniac, Ronan ? not Keating ? the Accuser.Ah yes, the old, let's-exterminate-everyone-for-the-mistakes-of-their-forefathers ploy.But unlike Avengers Assemble, Guardians of the Galaxy oozes offbeat originality and frankly, it's the most unique and delightful film Marvel has created to date.It's a hell of an achievement given the extensive movie library the company is building up and when you consider the characters aren't household names like 'big three' Iron Man, Thor and Captain America, but Marvel seems well aware of that fact with the final production risky to say the least.The film opens in 1988, which is when Quill is abducted from Earth, and 26 years later we see he's become a crooked intergalactic outlaw with a taste for all things shiny, valuable and not his.Given the distinct decade in which he was taken, his cassette player and mixtape of 70s and 80s tracks are laced throughout the film, which creates a quirky yet grounded quality in the midst of all of the dazzling interstellar warfare that takes place along the way.In addition to the soundtrack, jokes and comedy have never been more of a feature in a Marvel film ? perhaps Iron Man 3 was the closest ? as gags are thrown into the unlikeliest of scenarios to lessen the tension, and I would imagine, to really differentiate itself from Avengers Assemble, Star Wars and Star Trek, which by comparison are left looking very sombre.That said, if you were going to compare Pratt's Quill to someone, the character is quite reminiscent of Chris Pine's Captain James Kirk ? smart, womanising, reckless leaders, who eventually find their feet.The editing is supreme and makes each bit of dialogue super-sharp and tight, so when the infamous five are bickering or talking generally, the repartee all feels really clean and natural without being awkward or forced.Thor can be stubborn, Iron Man can be arrogant and Captain America is considered too stiff, but all of the Guardians bring even more wildly different qualities to the table and offer some diversity that doesn't ever grate or bore, which wouldn't have been possible without such excellent casting.Meanwhile, the film is very much in the here and now, with Quill's backstory the only one that truly gets a look-in, which creates a sense of intrigue about his colleagues who only have their pasts hinted at, meaning sequel fodder.There's just no way of knowing where you're going and tonally the movie delivers a piece of everything and it's done big and without hesitation.Guardians may have been a gamble, but I'm Grooting for it to Rocket to the top.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is just another pretentious, mediocre film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is just another mediocre film. Under the pretence of future, it sneaked in embraces of the past. Perhaps it tried to be both, but it was neither a serious film nor a comedy. It failed to trigger any deeper emotion inside me. Its humour was out of context. There were too many characters, most of which were not properly developed. The purposes of existence of those figures were very confusing. I'll comment in detail on the triggering of deeper emotions and the humour in the following 2 paragraphs.Someone commented that the films like the Dark knights series set a standard that superhero films must be deep and thoughtful. That person further commented that this film, Guardians of the Galaxy challenged this standard. I generally don't like dogmas. But here it's not at all about dogmas. It is just the fact that those "deep" ones could trigger deeper emotions, or provoke thoughts, or inspire the audiences, or help the audiences learn something, or help the audiences learn themselves better. By these, the audiences like, think about, involuntarily recall, remember and give high scores for those "deep" films. Of course different people have different opinions on deepness. So, I don't comment on the deepness of Guardians of the Galaxy. Just commenting on triggering deeper emotions, or provoking thoughts, or inspiring me, or helping me learn something or learn myself better, unfortunately, Guardians of the Galaxy did none of these to me. So, it just didn't make me feel that way, that it was one of those all-time great films.Someone commented that Guardians of the Galaxy was not a serious film, but rather, it was a great, light-hearted comedy. Even for this, I don't think I could agree. Great humour exists in context. In the right context, something plain could be hilarious. Out of context, brilliant jokes were just nothing. In Guardians of the Galaxy, too much humour ran out of context. For example, the raccoon said later, that he asked for one prisoner's prosthetic leg was just a joke. What did this convey? It was clever to play such heartless jokes on your partners when it was time to be serious? No. How about it tried to portray a figure, the raccoon, who was unfazed in front of great danger? But then you had to make the situation look dangerous. Even in The Wizard of Oz (1939), the scenes felt more creepy than here in the prison. The prison here felt just like a noisy second-hand market. So, I didn't find the joke funny and didn't know why it was in the film otherwise either. There were many such lines. I knew they were intended to be something to make people laugh, but I just didn't feel that entertained at those improper moments.All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy has no place on the all-time great list. Perhaps it was the last joke it could play, on itself, being put into the Top 250 list. Among those great films, its mediocrity would just manifest itself. Just within the first month of its release, it dropped 20 places on the Top 250 list from the 34th to the 54th. As time goes on, this film will likely drop further when the enthusiasm fades after its initial surge. There are great films, like In the Name of the Father (1993), A Beautiful Mind (2001) etc. They were not on the Top 250 list before, but gradually rose up and emerged into the all-time great list. Just on the contrary, Guardians of the Galaxy will gradually drop out of the Top 250 list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visually Stunning Galaxy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With each new film they release, Marvel outdo themselves time after time, from 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' to 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' and now to this amazing and irreverent superhero space opera packed full of humour and action in a visually stunning galaxy. Admittedly, I have slowly become more and more bored with superhero films since the high point of DC's 'The Dark Knight' and Marvel's 'Avengers', however 'Guardians' was something that was truly different, something that truly blew me away and has, as a result, become what is arguably my favourite Marvel film. Previous Marvel films have tried too hard to place humour in situations that didn't require it, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' however employs it frequently and due to the constant stream of jokes it works perfectly. Chris Pratt is by far one of Marvel's best casting choices since Robert Downey Jr. as 'Iron Man', even beyond this the other acting bodies were cast perfectly. The visual effects are utterly stunning and the battle scenes are epic, 'Guardians' is a truly amazing and thrilling superhero flick full of visual splendour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Money for Old Rope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of Marvel movies I was excited to see Guardians of the Galaxy. However, this movie failed on several levels.It is supposed to a comedy but the jokes are not funny. I genuinely laughed once. Furthermore, one 'joke' was weirdly inappropriate.The story is completely generic. It seems like they just needed some story, any story, as a vehicle for the characters to get together and try to be funny.I wanted to write a review without spoilers but the big set-piece ending of a spaceship crashing into the ground has to be called out. This was done in the Avengers and Star Trek: Into Darkness. To me, it's like directors have to have this '9/11' shot in every movie (big thing crashes into buildings) and it has to stop. It's boring now.The only positive about this movie was the special effects and space backgrounds.It seems that Marvel have figured out punters will pay cash money for any old junk if its wrapped up in special effects and a decent soundtrack. I will approach the next Marvel with extreme caution, and I will not see Guardians of the Galaxy 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You might expect a movie studio at the top of its game to play it safe rather than strike out in new, bizarre directions. Certainly, it's hard to imagine any other studio giving the greenlight to Guardians Of The Galaxy - a huge blockbuster movie based on a title unfamiliar to anyone who isn't a comics aficionado, starring a relatively unknown actor playing a character most people have never heard of. And yet, Marvel scores once again with its willingness to head off the beaten track. GUARDIANS is a fun, fizzy delight, even as it mines some surprising depths of emotion from its ragtag group of anti-heroes.Peter Quill (Pratt) - a human abducted from Earth as a child - has grown up into an intergalactic thief who has no idea what he's getting into when he takes possession of a mysterious Orb. Little does he know that Ronan (Pace) - a genocidal Kree radical - will do just about anything to get his hands on said Orb, including sending alien assassin Gamora (Saldana) after it. Gamora, as it turns out, has an agenda of her own. Trapped in an intergalactic prison (long story), Peter and Gamora are forced into an uneasy alliance with three other misfits: a brainy, sarcastic raccoon-like creature named Rocket (voiced by Cooper), a giant tree by the name of Groot (Diesel), and the vengeance-minded Drax The Destroyer (Bautista).The truth is that there's almost too much going on in GUARDIANS. Not only do we meet a host of characters we've never met before, on a raft of new planets teeming with brightly coloured life and detail, we're also introduced to several plot lines all stuffed somewhat awkwardly into the film. We have Ronan's planet-destroying aspirations, which are somehow bound up with the evil plans of Thanos - that creepy purple- skinned dude who popped up at the end of The Avengers. Peter's kidnappers turned surrogate 'family' are also on the trail of the Orb, turning up at moments both enormously convenient and inconvenient to the plot. It all makes sense in the end, but until it all clicks into place, it can make for a rushed, unsettling experience.But, despite its occasionally unwieldy script, GUARDIANS triumphs because of the gang of scruffy losers (a term that will take on a different, more heartfelt meaning during the film) at its heart. Director James Gunn, who co-wrote the script, clearly feels a strong affinity for each one of these outcasts, all of whom are easily outlaws in some (if not all) parts of the solar system, each one battling - at least initially - to save his or her own skin rather than to save the world. It's fascinating to watch the five members of this unlikely group slowly banter, bicker and batter their way into becoming a team.Most joyfully of all, Gunn never loses sight of the prickly, selfish side of his characters. He gives them plenty of rich, emotional moments - whether it's Peter and Gamora bonding over the loss of their parents, or Rocket's ability to read a whole range of meaning into Groot's extremely limited vocabulary ('I am Groot') - but never allows the film to descend into dangerously sentimental territory.In fact, Gunn pumps up proceedings with a healthy, hearty dose of humour. Films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) have always been more tongue-in-cheek than the likes of the considerably more dour Dark Knight franchise, but GUARDIANS is a heady trip of a different order. It practically delights in bursts of odd, subversive comedy, and actually dares to punctuate its most epic face-off with a sly homage to, of all things, Footloose.Pratt - so winning in TV's Parks And Recreation - holds the emotional core of the film together. He exudes an easy, rakish charm that makes Peter both dashingly arrogant and achingly vulnerable. He's matched very well by Saldana, who is clearly delighting in the opportunity to play the world-weary, no-nonsense Gamora - bred into a killer, born a fighter. The rest of the cast does justice, too, to the film's cheerful swing from drama to comedy and back again: Bautista brings unexpected pathos to Drax's occasionally comical determination to avenge his family against Ronan, while Cooper sounds completely unlike himself - in a very good way - as a creature who hides a world of hurt beneath his mouthy exterior. Even Diesel manages to find a great deal of depth in a CGI character who only communicates via the same languid burst of three words.If anything, GUARDIANS is let down by a trio of not particularly threatening villains. Pace snarls and spits in heavy make-up, but can't quite rustle up much in the way of nuance or genuine menace. Ronan is a one-note madman, with so little in the way of backstory that he automatically becomes less interesting. Thanos, too, now voiced and performed in motion-capture by Brolin, doesn't get much to do beyond lounge on his space throne. Only Gillan's cyborg Nebula manages a smidgen of complexity; even then, she struggles to be half as fascinating as her conflicted "sister", Gamora.Before the film was even released in cinemas, Marvel announced that a sequel would be coming in 2017. It's a no-brainer as to why. The film is smart, funny and quite wonderful on its own merits. But, even more crucially, GUARDIANS is a gamble that pays off handsomely for Marvel. It opens up the MCU in, quite literally, all directions. Don't be surprised if you see our more earth-bound heroes heading into space sooner rather than later. The film also adds a new cast of lovable rogues to the MCU's roster of characters: a gang who, one might say, are actually all the more heroic for being people who would ordinarily be running in the opposite direction from any galaxy-guarding duties. Frankly, we can't wait to see what they get up to next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it would only be fair giving this 1 star, even though it's maybe - at BEST - a 4, because this is definitely not worth 8. GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY was a shot I chose to try in god knows how long since I've been to the cinema. This is just another load of Hollywood trash. I had the impression it was innovative, considering the Guardians being pulled out from the bottom of the pile and the whole outlaw thing... but I was wrong...IN THE BEGINNING, what's-his-name is on Earth and it is APPARENTLY '88. The kid's mother dies. OK. Is this meant to be emotional despite the fact I have no attachment to any of these characters yet? OH WOW IT'S THE FUTURE NOW!! I'm sorry; his mother dies, he goes outside and then he gets abducted? What is this supposed to signify? Not to mention it's (obviously) unbelievably and strangely timed, but this is probably an attempt at giving some depth to the main character, but really doesn't do ANYTHING for the major plot of the entire film.The rest of the film was just a bunch of underdogs coming together because they end up in the same space prison (because what happens when you're arrested together is you share a block, not to mention gender is no issue here). Then they fall into this orb situation. What is it? It.. it is this orb.. and it is powerful.. a bit like the cube or something. There was little development in the story at all really, a few changes in direction but no real twists or anything surprising. I don't even know, I was almost asleep half the time. I was constantly checking my watch to see when it was over.So we have hideous CGI here. Ridiculously unprofessional, but I guess I'm not in with the CGI in blockbusters. They have this obnoxious claim to fame with technology it seems; having the ability to do these things doesn't make it cool, it just looks like a video game. Another thing, visually, was the designs. It was just so typical of the action/sci-fi genre in the technology and whatnot, and the characters... very much in the same boat but more-so thrown together effortlessly.Then after that its all EXPLOSIONS - SPEEDING - ADVERTISING - HITTING! In between there's a conceited amount of one liners that made me cringe. The best kind. And in the end we have some false suspense because we know everything is going to be okay.OVERALL: &gt;The comedy was... horrid... &gt;The story was simple. &gt;The characters were lacking in... everything really. -The cinematography didn't even involve cameras. &gt;The soundtrack was a bunch of pop classics chucked together. So what was good about it? The ACTION!!!1111 Wait, no... &gt;The action was too much, unnecessary and clearly there to fill in time. Main reason I even saw this was I received an invitation from some mates. I think I'll try go back to sticking to films with a point. The only point of this was to brainwash and make big bucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's no surprise that when Marvel's latest movie was released many, many people (the non comics reading kind, mainly) said "Who?" The comic itself has never been what you call top tier, with various incarnations having been around for decades, although the film is based on the team created by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning in 2008, now being serviced by top writer Brian Bendis.Marvel certainly have made sure the Guardians have plenty of publicity, turning a bunch of also rans into a must see event and even having the confidence to proclaim "The Guardians Of The Galaxy Will Return" at the end of the movie. This is a company with the utmost confidence in their product, and after seeing it it's very easy to understand why.First and foremost, Guardians... is fun. After a truly heartbreaking beginning everything goes a bit daft, mixing swashbuckling sci fi action with larger than life characters, and whilst at first you may be a little puzzled, it all streamlines into a simple plot soon enough. Basically, Guardians leader Peter Quill (known mainly to only himself as Star Lord) has a plot device, and other people also want the plot device. He forms an alliance with a very disparate bunch of people who each have their own reason for helping him. To go into more detail really isn't that necessary, as all it will involve is laying out a roster of names and personal grievances, and you'll get all that when you watch the film, because if you're reading this review I will lay odds you're going to see it.The movie looks beautiful throughout, probably thanks to the thousand or so "Digital Artists" who take up a large part of the end credits. Ship design is fantastic, with many looking like they were pulled direct from a Chris Foss art book, and if you know Foss you'll know this is a high compliment. Yeah, the bad guys have dull, dark vessels with inadequate lighting (surely evil needs to see as well?) but the good guys have some sexy vessels indeed. Sound wise, it may seem odd that a 2014 state of the art sci fi movie will have a 1970's chart soundtrack, but the inclusion of The Runaways, Rupert Holmes and, of course, Blue Swede's "Hooked On A Feeling" is completely explained and rather poignant. It would be nice, too, if kids start downloading some of this awesome old stuff and finally start listening to real music (so speaks an old fart).So in a nutshell this is a very good movie. It's packed with fun and enjoyable characters, but also has it's fair share of down beats and dead beats. Top honours are fought out for between Chris Pratt, excellent and ridiculously likable as Peter Quill, and the brilliant Rocket Raccoon, a purely CGI character stuffed with attitude and some great one liners. The other main characters all do well, however, with even big bag Ronan (no, not the Boyzone one, mores the pity) being well served and very well played with menace aforethought by Lee Pace.One thing people want to know about Marvel films is what's the after credits scene like? Well, without being spoilery, I'll say two things: one, it's NOT a big reveal or anything like that, but two, it's really funny if you have a knowledge of a certain old Marvel character. Oh yeah, and you get to play everyone's favourite game in the movie - 'Spot Stan Lee'. It just wouldn't be the same without him mugging it up somewhere.In closing, "Guardians Of The Galaxy" is right up there with the rest of Marvel's cinematic output, making a clear mark by being totally different to anything else we've so far seen. It's Fun with a capital 'F', and engaging throughout. Some of the violence may be a bit much for smaller kids, and there's a bit of moderately fruity language (is 'dick' fruity still? I fall behind sometimes). That said, kids who don't mind a walking tree impaling people or a raccoon murderising people with a kick ass gun will have a blast. Big, beautiful and bad ass, "Guardians Of The Galaxy" is definitely the feel good fantasy of 2014, as evidenced by the grin still stuck to my face. All together now... "I'm hooked on a feeling..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was recommended to me by a friend who saw the reviews and somehow believed those. Huge mistake.To say the movie is childish would be an honor for this movie, I have seen plenty of animated movies which were a huge lot better.The story is dumb and entirely predictable. The characters are almost flat and have absolutely no credibility from either a serious point of view nor from a parody point of view. Acting was also poor.Visual effects were OK and being a 3D movie helped, but that is the only positive thing that I can say about the movie.The theater was half-full but during the entire movie there was not a single time when you could hear everybody laughing hard.The only way I can imagine that so many 9 and 10 star reviews were added for this movie is since all the brainwashed Marvel fan-boys and sock-puppets for the studios somehow managed to overwhelm normal reviewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another shallow money-grabber</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a mess of the worst kind: a never-ending cascade of contrivance after contrivance.The plot, if it could be called so, is kickstarted by the theft of a magical plot device that evil people want. This also happens in The Avengers and Man of Steel, and it's not getting any more creative. The evil people fight the good guys, there's explosions and snarky humor everywhere, and it never rises above the level of an excuse plot. Characters get beaten close to death so the movie can have a sad moment before they get revived - all the protagonists are invincible. There's one particularly shameful scene where a character gets cast out into space and another character risks death to save them. But surprise! Somehow, a fleet of spaceships somewhere managed to find their exact location and arrive to save both within a minute! See, friendship saves the day again!The dialog is just as useless as the plot: the characters either make juvenile jokes, exposit once again that they need to bring the magical plot device somewhere in order to prevent genocide by the evil guy (in case the audience forgot), have ham-fisted discussions about the value of friendship and overcoming adversity with all the subtlety of a bull in a china shop, or explain completely obvious things. The worst of this is when a character steps out into a visibly darkened corridor and comments on how dark it is.I saw this movie because it was compared to one of my favorites: The Fifth Element. This comparison is worthless because while The Fifth Element was a movie, The Guardians of the Galaxy is a product. Every bombastic special effect and every cardboard cutout character reek of a movie trying to sell itself and its tie-in action figures and comic books to 12-year old kids. The humor is juvenile, the plot and characters are shallow and facile, explosions and fighting are shoehorned in at every turn... there is no natural characterization, no genuine emotion, and no signs of intelligence. This movie is junk food cinema at its worst. We deserve better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot was predictable. The characters aren't original. I guess the younger crowd and die hard fans will probably like it but as an avid movie fan Guardians kind of disappointed me. Acting was kind of terrible too. Bautista played Drax as if Drax was TRYING to sound intelligent. He couldn't pull off the smart brute. Zoe tried too hard to be bad a$$ and it wasn't natural. The Collector... Don't get me started... What reason was there for The Collector to even open and show anybody the Infinity Stone? It's a super powerful object that he knew was very powerful, why show Thanos' daughter or the outlaw? The bad guys were the worst, so campy. Ronin reminded me of a pro wrestler during an interview. Like Ultimate Warrior on a rant. Only good acting came from Thanos and Rocket. Yep, the CGIs. The final battle was whack. The ships lined up to form a net to stop the super ship and the good guy ships were below shooting bad guy ships who we're dive bombing the city. The worst was when they tried to replicate that scene in Avengers when Hulk was slamming Loki around but instead it was Groot shooting his tendrils through a bunch of bad guys and skewering them then slamming them unnecessarily back and forth against walls. The ending was so cheesy when John C Reiley was all sappy about his wife and kid being saved who they showed in the end as a woman and her daughter who earlier was part of a scene where they were almost crushed. Booooring.... The movie wasn't terrible but after reading the super reviews on IMDb, I had to say something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another overrated movie from marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So , I was yesterday to see this "big" movie, which has a rating of 8.7, close to "The lord of the rings" movies, the same as "Matrix" or "Inception" and even better than "Seven" or "Usual suspects". It should be good right? Doesn't matter that Marvel made only crap movies, most of them anyway, with a few exceptions, some of the first Spiderman movies and some X-men movies, maybe they nailed it this time.So, the movie starts and after the first scenes, we see our hero on an abandoned planet, dancing as he goes to collect the item he came for. He is not thinking that while he is listening music at his headset, someone may be nearby. Anyway, he got what he came for, and the scene is very similar to the one in Indiana Jones. No surprise, this entire movie is a rip -off of other movies, you have you hero which is a smuggler and becomes one of the good guys (Star wars), you have a pair, a raccoon and a tree, only the raccoon understands the tree (Star wars), again, our hero out of the nowhere falls in love with the female(again.... Star wars), only in Star Wars, the process was more real and more fun. Also, like other Marvel movies, the characters do illogical actions in the most important moments. Gomora after she fights to the death with her sister trying to cut the power, tries to save her when her sister was holding on the edge of the ship, while Peter Quill and the others were waiting for Gomora to cut the damn power. Another stupid moment was when Ronan, at last he lands, but he doesn't destroy the planet, the thing he wanted the most to do, no, he looks at our hero dancing... speechless... And how did Drax survived when he and Ronan are hit by a ship at full speed, piloted by raccoon?So, Guardians of the galaxy is a movie full of meaningless special effects, explosions after explosions, characters that are poorly written, actors that don't act very well, a poor script and ideas borrowed from other movies.Conclusion, another boring movie by Marvel, highly over rated, I don't know how, I think Marvel fans are overzealous or the people are just getting dumber day by day.You wanna see a good sci-fi movie, watch any of the Star Wars movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: Disappointed fan girl venting below</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Marvel. Whether it be X-Men, Thor, The Avengers, Spider-man, Iron Man... most of the commonly known ones, of course, but I always loved them. But to put this as simply as I can -though that doesn't mean this will be short-, this film was filled with 1,000 of the most common clichés extracted from these great films and stories and crammed them into one mashed-up, jumpy, unreserved, ridiculous, abnormal, spiteful, detestable, idiotic, moronic, absurd, ludicrous, senseless, meaningless, pointless, terribly-written, unbelievably- unrealistic, super-super-super-hero-wannabe movie that very desperately AND obviously AND obnoxiously attempts to special-effect everything -and I mean everything- to simply gain some big bucks because, hey, it's Marvel, what could go wrong? It's sad to see how successful their attempts were; I fell for it... for me, it's all due to The Avengers because that was freaking amazing, even though it had a lot of commonplace stuff. And boy, do I regret wasting my two hours on this extremely disappointing collage. Basically, it's a film made of collages because everything just had to be colorful in outer space. No seriously. Of course everything is colorful there. It's not like the galaxy is filled with 96% dark matter that is called DARK for a reason. So yeah. Totally makes sense. And your skin also starts rotting in outer-space, too. Serious case of leprosy then? I liked Elektra more than this. I'd rather have watched that five times. Kind of feel like that says something. The only reasons I smiled or laughed was because the directors and script writers were decent at making corny jokes, puns, and lines funny enough that giggling is impossible prevent unless you are emotionless. They should have gone with comedy, rather than action-adventure, though, since I sincerely thought the rest of the moments were just junk. Call me a spoil-sport if you must, but I was literally whispering what would happen in the next minute to my friend beside me. Usually I'm not very good at predicting what happens in films -unless they are seriously full of clichés...which this film is-, but I said them anyway. I was right 8 times. Out of 9. I counted. Anyway... though the beautiful graphics did rival that of Avatar, the plot of "saving the people from the evil mastermind only this time it involves the whole galaxy instead of just one planet so it's not just Earth that's being targeted this time so ha we are different" never got THIS tiring. I was so close to sinking in my chair and dreaming up a nightmare because of how stupidly predictable this film was. Maybe that was intentional and Marvel fans just wanted to see some new, more unique heroes this time, and also to see the visuals, and maybe to see Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana's pretty butts...but whatever. I had half that mind prepared for a cliché-turned- awesome movie when I walked in the theater. I came out with my whole mind filling up and overloading with shame and displeasure.So, plot: Would have been old and good but it wasn't. Protagonists: I would have cared for them more if the filmmakers didn't blow up almost everyone's favorite guy and kept alive some people's least-liked guy(s). So, yeah. Villains: ... oh my gosh, no, seriously? What even happened to the evil robot woman? Did the filmmakers just completely forget her? Music: Louder than Inception's horn. And I loved that even though it had no tune. Couldn't stand this though. But still, be ready for some rocking 80s and 90s music that I would have downloaded if they didn't play those songs during totally inappropriate moments. Comedy relief my butt. The only relief I got out of the soundtrack that isn't even their soundtrack -hopefully they didn't violate any copy rights... I mean, if it's these filmmakers, I wouldn't be surprised- is that I'm glad Groot enjoyed himself. Visuals: Stunning. That wasn't sarcastic at all. At all. What else? Oh yeah, unless you pay me a million dollars, I would never watch the sequel. So sorry I can't contribute ten dollars for Marvel next time. Tough luck.Don't let this review stop you though. Most of my friends liked it. And of course, most people who reviewed this movie liked it, so I guess I'm just a jerk. I'm betting you readers agree, and that's totally understandable since I am totally venting. But hey, three out of four of my friends never watched a Marvel movie so... call me bluffing, but I sincerely experienced one of the deepest disappointments I have ever dealt with in regards to a movie franchise in my entire life.... I'm still going to watch X-men though. Dang you, Marvel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pop is eating itself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a previous review, one writer said that Marvel could have "played it safe, but went into a bold new direction".Well I don't know about you, but filling a movie with pop culture references to hook the money-spending adult-child demographic of 30 and 40 somethings, in what is quite literally "just another sci-fi adventure", is NOT taking a risk.From the very minute the film started I knew I was going to be manipulated in the most direct way, but even then sometimes you ask for it, like watching "Old Yeller" for example. But in the case of GOTG, it's pretty much shoveled in our mouths from the beginning, and with more than a spoonful of sugar.Some have compared this movie to Star Wars (which it's not), and even while that film was derivative of Saturday morning serials and classic science fiction films and TV, what made Star Wars unique is the creative ways it tips it's hat at the genre, and more specifically how hard everyone worked to make it their own. There was more depth to it, and it left you wondering, "didn't we see that in something else"? However GOTG embellishes with pop culture, very much like the roller-coaster ride operator who turns on the top 40 or R&amp;B station while he locks you in your seat. That's not creating something unique, it's hopping on the back of something that's previously established, and it takes no effort to do so, only money.But don't take my word for it, see for yourself. In going through the other reviews, on almost every page someone writes their summary as "Hooked on a Feeling". If that doesn't resemble Pavlov's Dog, I don't know what else could.I DID like Guardian's of the Galaxy for it's art design, effects, stunts, sound design, and the battered underscore by Tyler Bates which was brilliant. But with scenes in which we have Chris Pratt making Kevin Bacon sound like a universal liberator of man during a romantic scene with Zoe Saldana, (and who references his name later in the film like a punch line) this movie is the epitome of that age old prediction, "Pop Will Eat Itself".Speaking of Pratt, I felt he's probably the weakest leading man I've ever encountered in a blockbuster film. He felt like a composite of Indiana Jones, Norma Rae and Oliver Twist all mixed into one. I cared not a single moment for his well being, his past or even his future. So no, Marvel didn't play it safe. Not by a long shot. They knew what they were doing when they licensed these songs, filled the dialog with prime time nods and then threw a bunch of fireworks at us. Not having read the comic, if these same kinds of references are in there, I'm sure I will find out soon enough. But that just reinforces my argument anyway, and leaves one to ask if we should expect more depth of storytelling, character development and not-so-easy references to day to day life from big budget features (I do!), or is it safe to say that today's blockbuster films will sacrifice originality for commonality and we should just go with it?Either way, since this is obviously the first in a new franchise, I'm sure we will find out what Marvel's priorities are in the next installment. Let's hope it's not just "The next Empire Strikes Back".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this is what passes for blockbuster entertainment these days then, after 50 years of cinema-going, I'm opting out for good. Are the filmmakers of the 21st Century so devoid of originality that everything has to be a cut and paste from the past? So, a brief run through of the tedium that passes for plot from that most dreaded of all auteur's the writer-director. A dude from the past (1988) gets taken into space sub-Hitchhiker Galaxy-style and gets to spout sub-Star Wars dialogue in a sub-Spaceballs kinda plot. I was looking at my watch after the first half hour. There was no irony or intelligence in the story, the hero takes off his space helmet in the vacuum of space and hands it over to the sour-faced flat-chested Star Trek reboot and they both survive! The director could have at least looked at Total Recall if the physics were too tough for him. If they can censor the best part of Zulu for alleged raaacism then I truly hope this garbage gets shredded for stupidity and cynicism. A sequel is, naturally, in the works. God bless you Stanley Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Such an awful wreck! There I said it. These marvel films are becoming a huge bore and nevertheless have disappointed anyone even bothering to consider that maybe one day Hollywood will create a stellar film. But this?! This!? Garbage? Filled, to-the-lid with CGI! The typical stereotypes blown over proportions and yet people still go to these theaters and pay for this crap and still LIE to themselves and honestly say that it was a "fantastic" and "great" and "awesome" A film that would put a psychologist laughing maniacally in their leather armchair. The "Ten out of Ten" reviews are being given out like candy from these people. Were the characters bad? Yes. How many? Out of the guardians, it's obvious out of the five, there's Groot, the tree humanoid incapable of having a conversation, but don't worry it can understand what you're saying until of course, the record of the Idiot starts to play and Groot marches off and ruins your pitch perfect plan. He's the cgi character crutch. Crutch? How exactly? Simple when there's a break in the scene, here comes Groot and then we say..."okay Groot, perform your thing and then maybe even add a homage to the Hulk?" Rocket Raccoon, what a mess isn't he? Both as a character and the fact that most of the emotion in this film came from the animated Raccoon. How many scenes will star him seething at the audience? As if his problems are towards everyone? What's even worse is the fact everyone is laughing at him in real life, there's no respect for him outside the film. Oh, and where's his real accent? Though I would have to say he's not the character that ruined the movie, what a surprised. In the fight of Man versus CGI, cgi wins in having a character outperform it's humanoid actors. And what of Quill, Gamora, and Draxx? David Bautista as Draxx was actually the better of the three, in the overall performance (if any) Why? Well, you'll be sharing this characters maniacal laughter once you've realized you wasted valuable devotion for a franchise whose focus is better spent on a festival of explosions rather than a film focusing on Quality. Oh, but wait! Quill and his quirks and Gamora as the feminism object! Dun, Dun, Dun! The perfect trio nowadays are the idiots and the friendly brutes and the threatening but soft spot woman! Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana... WHAT COULD GO WRONG...oh I don't know... Let's start predicting before we start watching the film... Is there a sex scene? It's PG-13, so no, but is there a RomCom kiss scene? You BETCHA! Ah, what a romanticism of a film! Please let me just change my rating from 6 to ZEROIf you expect a disappointment, you're welcome. If you're an oblivious fanatic that just loves hearing and reading the same regurgitated lines, you're in for a whirlwind!Good Luck Marvel in your festival of delusion!

		<fullReview>I'm wondering, after seeing the reviews for this movie on IMDb, if this was the same movie I saw at the pictures a few weeks ago, because it absolutely boggles my mind how people can give this movie a 10/10 rating.Now, when I saw it I wasn't particularly disappointed, as I came in expecting a light-hearted childish story that passed the time, and that is exactly what it was, and I didn't feel ripped off for paying to go and see it. I really regarded it as a superhero B Movie with a big budget. It was fun but wasn't memorable at all, and there was nothing in the movie that made me really think or challenge my perspective on a particular topic, which is what I expect from a movie which is deemed by the public to be a classic.But this entirely wasn't the case. The plot line was simple, there was little to no character development or any notable acting performances, and the humour was completely childish and only really funny for someone aged 11 or under. There was no wit, satire, intelligence or anything really interesting in the movie and it was all set in your average Hollywood feel-good family fun movie template, which really doesn't appeal to mature tastes in cinema.Now, I have to say I'm not a big superhero movie fan and I'd never buy a DVD for a superhero movie, but even for a superhero movie this one wasn't even that good. In my book it was about the same quality as another superhero I recently saw, which was The Amazing Spiderman 2, which is rated about 6 or 7. Personally I can't tell how this movie is any better or worse than that movie, after all, both were cliché feel-good films with a very simple plot.I have to admit I wouldn't have even bothered writing a review for this movie had it not been for the ridiculously high rating it received on IMDb. Its 8.6 out of 10 at the minute. 8.6? That puts it ahead of absolute classics such as Django Unchained, Full Metal Jacket and Taxi Driver. How on earth this movie can be considered better than those movies is utterly unthinkable. They aren't even in the same league. This movie is several leagues below that.I hope that the rating has subsequently gone down to somewhere between 6 and 7 if you're reading this in the not-so distant future, because that's where this B Movie with a big budget really belongs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So - my son and I went to watch GotG. After reading mixed reviews we were skeptical but curious. The bad reviews unfortunately were right. The movie has no story line, stupid characters (like a talking raccoon) and more bad language than most rated R films I have seen. The producers were trying to cover the lack of plot with senseless action scenes that all seemed random and disconnected. Do yourself a favor and save the money you spend - you will get more pleasure from a big cup of ice cream. I can't believe Glenn Close and Vin Diesel took even small roles in this.My sons' quote: " I totally agree with my dad. There was no point in making this movie. The movie is overly dramatic for instance; in the beginning of the movie Starlords mom dies from cancer and she asked him to hold her hand while she dies, and he looks away and cries. Then after she dies he runs out of the hospital and gets kidnapped by aliens. The characters are really badly made, like the evil blue dude who has a half robot daughter that just stands around him like an eavesdropping servant or the madman who just tries to kill Ronan - so a lot of this movie is stupid. We left the theater half way through.</fullReview>

I left the cinema bored and irritated. This film was so derivative, frankly I'm surprised that anyone gave it more than 5 stars. Opening scene? Indiana Jones and the lost Ark. Badies? A leather clad Darth Vader with runny mascara. Emperor? Check. Secret about the father? Check.People have said that they felt the characters were fleshed out.. Are you out of your minds? "I lost my mother". "Really? I lost my wife and child" "That's nothing. I was cut up and put back together so many times AND I was bullied". "Well I used to be a shrub and was transplanted without permission". The special affects were massive and continuous and - in the end dulled the senses. There was the inevitable Ninja babe and cutesy furry character. No one meaningful died apart from Darth who got fried in blue fire.. why he didn't just grab on and share the magic I don't know. Lastly there was no sense of tension. We all knew that the goodies were going to survive. There's a sequel to make right? I could go on and on but I won't. I went to see this in hope. I won't be seeing the next one unless Joss Whedon is put in charge. Sigh another wasted two hours of my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seem to be the only one that found this movie to childish, i think that it was a real big shame that they tried to make the movie so that children were allowed to watch it. For example, not a single human dies during the movie, Starlord just uses his electric shock thing when he fires at humans. And the movie was to "un-serious", there were jokes every minute which made it impossible to watch the movie at the cinema because everyone just laughed like hell when there was a small joke that actually wasn't funny at all, well some jokes were a little funny but none of them made me laugh. I may sound like a horrible person for doing this but the only time i laughed was at the beginning of the movie when (SPOILER ALERT) starlord's mom was lying sick in the hospital, me and my friend started laughing uncontrollably and i don't even know why. I guess that we started laughing because we knew that you aren't supposed to laugh to those things. Everyone stared at us... Anyways the movie also had lots of predictibale moments and some parts of it was a little clich?, (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT) and the end battle that they made you look forward to was the most anti climax end to a movie i have ever seen, they killed the main villain so quick. Overall the effects and animated things in the movie were extremely good, the setting was good, the jokes were al little entertaining but there were way too many jokes in the movie and there was a lack of death and gore, the the movie was way too short and the characters didn't have time to develop, and the plot was way to predictable and cliché. You didn't see any blood or gore during the movie at all which made the movie way to comedic. I would prefer the movie to be more serious and "grown up". I would give it 6/10 but that is for people over 11 y.o, for a child this movie would be perfect, from the perspective of a child i would have given it 9.5/10. And if they had made it less childish i would switch the scores so that it was 9.5/10 for people over 11 and 6/10 for children. I hope that the sequel will be more grown up. (The sequel's plot is also very predictable, if you have seen the first one you will know exactly what will happen in the second one.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Here is an idea have some acting and depth to characterization. It slightly facilitates viewers caring about the action within the film. Like Man of Steel we are presented with all of our characters being trained kung fu masters. What distinguishes older better films like Star Wars the original trilogy is that hello let's develop our characters then branch out to the spectacles of outer space. The best of the trilogy episode 4 spent 30 minutes on Tattoine getting us to know and care about Luke.What Guardians does is give us a the usual sarcastic idiot who one cannot help but wish ill to happen to. At least Henry Cavill's superman while at times cardboard in his insouciance; Please the idiot dancing the villain into submission. How about the opening pre credit sequence with him kicking lifeforms in time with an awful redbone tune? How to get audiences to really care and identify with your lead character. Zoe seems to find screaming and kicking males her brand of feminism it is pure misandry. The fact that she appears to weigh 90 pounds and not have any muscle development go ahead try that out in the real world. Ugh what a dreadful badly acted piece of poo poo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All spectacle, no substance. Bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first sin this movie commits actually happens more often than you'd think. The Guardians meet at the beginning of the film and by the end they're all willing to die for each other. How did these perfect strangers form such a tight bond over the course of like 3 days? It would've been better to have them meet and then catch up with them 6 months or a year or two down the road. Having such strong feelings develop so quickly makes no sense. X-Men did this with Jean and Wolverine. "Hi, I'm Jean." "Hi, I'm Logan...and I love you." Forcing relationships to move the plot is lazy and actually makes the audience care less for the characters. And watching Pratt as Starlord is exactly like watching Ryan Reynolds as..well Ryand Reynolds. Plus there were a ton of plot holes that took me out of the film. Ronan was known to be working for Thanos; it was no secret? So if Thanos was more powerful than Ronan, why didn't he just go get the damn orb himself? Plus Xandar was in so much danger but what did the director do to make the audience care about that? Nothing.Yes the movie was funny at times. But that's all it was, was funny. Take out the comedy and you have no movie. A superhero film should have more going for it than chuckles. The comedy in Iron Man enhanced the movie. The movie didn't depend solely on laughs though. It was a good all around film. Guardians wasn't. Here's what irritated me the most though. At the end, Roanan reaches Xandar and all he has to do to achieve his goal is slam his staff on the ground or whatever. Quill starts dancing which distracts him long enough to be thwarted and makes the audience giggle again. OK, so Ronan has been hellbent on destroying this planet but some idiot twerking is enough for him to pause and ask "What are you doing?" He wouldn't have cared what Quill was doing! He was motivated and determined enough to have ignored Quill being a moron and carried on with destroying Xandar. Stupid end for a stupid film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is really bad, wake up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am struggling to understand why fans found this movie so good. Perhaps it's just recent yet and, in time, people will figure out their mistake.Let's face it, the plot is ridiculous, working around a music themed heroic saga through the galaxy, when the songs themselves are either plain bad or do not represent quite well the moment. Plot problems will also go by too many characters presented in a way that seems like we've seen them before but we don't really remember where from, well maybe another movie, like The Collector, Nova Prime or Korath. And many, many clichés.But the worse part for me was the cheesy dialogs and the absolutely ridiculous jokes. I couldn't laugh even once and I do tend to have a good sense of humor. The joke about slipping the finger on your neck - really?! And Rocket demanding a man's artificial leg for nothing, to say later that that was a joke - absolutely unnecessary. On top of its nonsense, the final scene: Ronan is about to finally get his revenge, has the power to do so, is about to do so, then, at the very last moment, he stops to watch Quill dancing (while others prepare to blast him). Oh, forget the fulfilling of my greatest desire, the one driving my whole life and existence, let's just stop and watch him dance... seriously? Was that supposed to be funny? Am I a ten-year-old boy watching Woodpecker? 2 min of thinking would have sufficed to come up with a not so childish way to do that scene. What a great plot indeed. Maybe I could be going too hard on a film supposed to just entertain, with lights and sound, but it bothers me how stupid they think we are when they treat us like children.One very good side though that saved this movie from total awfulness is the beautiful CGI images, not all, but many, specially those from space and star wars-like spaceship battles.Every single other Marvel movie was better than this - and not all were exactly good. If the sequence is going to be as good as the first one, please don't even start it, Marvel.And, not to forget, some one has to tell Nasa that, to prevent people from dying from a spacecraft falling down on earth, you just need to make a sphere shield made out of entangled branches and leaves... awesome!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to see this in the cinema after the good reviews from IMDb and my friends, some of whom went to see it twice. What a disappointment. It didn't appeal on any level. It was a complete pile of Groot! Humour was limited and shallow, plot gossamer thin and the action was not really worth the effort on the whole. It's not as if I took the film seriously either. I really enjoyed the ludicrous Lucy, despite its numerous flaws. Surely I can't be the only one who didn't like this film? If it had been directed by Uwe Boll it couldn't have been much worse. If I never see it again I will be OK. Glad I didn't waste more time and money watching it in an IMAX. A 12 inch portable black and white would suffice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An atrocious waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had more or less low expectations for this film, but after being semi-forced to watch the whole thing (social obligations), I was met with the unfortunate end of "Low".The film had some interesting and novel ideas to play around with (a bandit raccoon and a walking tree? Perfect!), but the word that constantly came to mind while making it through to the end was "Overdone". Too much action (yes, I said it), paper-thin characters, a plot that made absolutely no sense at all, and weak attempts at humor - the combination of all these left me checking the time every few minutes waiting for the all-too-predictable ending to be over.Oh, and a constant irritation (at least to me), was the "soundtrack" -- songs from the 70's which grated on my nerves. I guess they were trying to be "original", or something.Simplify the plot, develop the characters a bit more, work up some *good* actions (not just random explosions and bits moving about) and there might have been something here to hold my interest. Unfortunately I'm not a teenage boy who might think all this overkill is a-w-e-s-o-m-e, but I was bored within 30 minutes.Sorry - I wanted to like it, but it didn't happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mindless entertainment usually has some charm to it if nothing else, Guardians delivers none of that. Throughout the whole film it provided maybe two sincerely funny moments while the rest of it came across mostly as unintentional comedy thanks to a gibberish script. I've never laughed at someone dying of cancer before but the prologue of Guardians is just so hilariously god-awful it had me in stitches all through the opening credits.Oh Christ, what a forgettable, uninteresting and pitifully bland mess of a film this was. I suppose it appeals to easily impressionable simpletons but I struggle to see how, there's hardly any character development, the plot is nonsense from start to finish, the antagonist is some bland and boring caricature who seemingly only exists as a vehicle to introduce Thanos (who is a big deal I'm assuming?) and it's all just so damn predictable. Perhaps worst of all the ending is just another anticlimactic retread of the old and tired "power of love" trope.I may have given Guardians at least one point if it had decent effects and camera work put into it, but none of that is to be found here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Huge Waste of Time and Money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the movie started I was excited to see a character wearing a mask with glowing red eyes. I thought the opening scene was promising and then suddenly some non-serious music started to play, the main character started to dance and everything went downhill from there. After that there was special effect after special effect. I love special effects, but it did sound like this movie was made "only" to showcase special effects such as explosions, explosions, explosions and did I forget to say explosions? The special effects were indeed magnificent, but it doesn't take long for you to realize it is all eye candy. It is there to help conceal the fact that this is a movie made for ten year old kids to gaze at and go wow. For everyone else, and by everyone else I mean adults with thinking brains, this extremely shallow and childish piece of work would be little more than a showcasing of special effects and cinematic techniques. Surprise, surprise, special effects do not make up for a shallow, childish, and extremely disjointed plot with performances that range from mediocre to downright terrible and they do not make a movie worth a mature person's time. I loved the Ghost Rider, Thor, and the Amazing Spider-Man 2. Even The Avengers was tolerable, but this one was simply a mess. Designing lots of weird looking characters with unpleasant colors and hair styles is like desperately asking the audience to love the movie just because it has some of the most weird looking characters ever seen in a movie (Men in Black anyone?). One of my biggest complaints and what really annoyed me throughout the movie is that while the special effects were great, the combination of colors in most of the scenes was really unpleasant. Remember how Thor had great colors in each and every scene? The colors actually went with one another. You don't see that here. A combination of light blue, orange, brown, grey and a lot of colors that create a really awful combination was present in nearly every scene. It was a huge letdown. Next time they should get a better art director so that they do not annoy the people who understand colors and art. In summary, this movie is not for adults. Take your kids to see it though. They will definitely love it, but since spending so much money only to entertain kids is not really justifiable, They'd better stop wasting such huge amounts of money on movies like this and spend it where it's really needed. Fighting Ebola to save the human race would be a much better use of such a huge amount of money.</fullReview>

But even most of the people who remember the songs from the days they were hits, won't really like it, because the songs generally don't fit the scenes. It also shows that most of these songs are already completely forgotten.Yes, I know I will get a ton of reactions by people who claim they remember the songs.

		<shortDescription>Seriously, 10/10 from some reviewers?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are times in life where you have to wonder about humanity. This is one of those times. Guardians of the Galaxy, at one time was THE all time highest rated movie on IMDb. Yes, right up there and above The GodFather and Shawshank Redemption. There are reviewers who titled their reviews with "Amazing," or "Visually Stunning," and many "The best action movie of all time." Look, maybe to you it is the best "action" movie of all time, but that doesn't mean you give it a 10/10 and make it THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! Seriously?! Lets just start by saying that a large portion of today's audience must get bored quickly... Because Guardians is one battle/fight scene after another. The only time there is not a battle/fight scene is when Hollywood feels forced to try and make a love story, like they do far too often. Only this one is with a guy falling in love with a girl (alien girl, that is) that had tried to kill him several times in (you got it) a fight scene 10 minutes earlier. Ugh! There were many attempts at laughs in the movie, and the audience responded, mostly, but they were predictable and corny. There were times I was waiting to see Mel Brooks walk out and say it was a sequel to Space Balls.Oh, the fight scenes. Yes, they were non-stop, which a young audience will enjoy. But watch the movie a little closer and you'll see why I was so over the fighting. Nothing but low-light, non-stop camera angle changes and shaky. That's the way you make things look more action packed. Just shake the camera, change the angle every half second and turn down the light (Oh, a few fire balls or explosions in the background help). You watch the fighting and have no idea who is doing the hitting and who's getting hit. So frustrating and migraine triggering.I could go on and on, but fortunately some people have come on here and reviewed the movie properly, which moved it quickly down the list of best movies ever. I'm not saying it is a horrible movie, it's not. It's entertaining and has great special effects (but that's what all action movies are today, effects and no story). Young adults will love it and if you are a seasoned movie buff you'll like it but want more. Take it for what it is, a action movie with no real story and non-stop fighting with some comedy. 5/10!</fullReview>

Now, this film was not without charm, but I think people owe this a little more thought. I had no expectation other than to get baked and see some vapid 3D spectacle and, in that respect, this film definitely delivered. However, had it not been for the cushy recliners in the VIP theater and the fact that my friend drove, I may very well have left somewhere in the giant head part (and I sat through Anger Management). The comedy was so contrived, they might as well have thrown in a "don't go there" and a "talk to the hand." A motion picture treatment of Robert McKee's "Story" would've been less formulaic than this rubbish. The millenarian reactionary in me revels in society's departure from cultural excellence, recognizing this development as an unmistakable sign of our collapse, but the rest of me is scared and confused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatly disappointed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer, I didn't think this film would be anything special. A few weeks later, a friend of mine who shared the same opinion at first, told me it was "awesome" after watching it. Since then, I held my expectations high, but I was greatly disappointed. To be honest, I don't even know where to start. The film is a huge cliché overall and a ridiculous mess. Starting with the characters and the actors that give them life, we have great names in the industry, which of course, grants the film some status. Still, my only thought about this was "What the hell are you guys doing in this film!? Seriously!?". Renowned actors mixed with bad acting and pseudo-funny acting, which doesn't turn out to be funny, isn't exactly the perfect recipe. I don't dislike Zoe Saldana but the roles she takes are more or less the same and she doesn't even bother to work on different mannerisms or whatsoever to create an interesting performance, to provide her character some individuality. Most of the plot holes (if not all of them) are found in the main characters, whose ambitions change like the wind and without making any sense. One minute, Gamora was trying to kill Peter Quill, and five minutes later Quill was saving her... because he's that good. Just like they are best friends forever after that. The love interest feels so, so forced (because? plot!). Thankfully, we don't get to see them kissing or whatever, otherwise that would be a bigger face palm. The background stories are boring, with no consistence, and so cliché; there's nothing new about them. In Gamora's case, we step onto Mary- Sue's grounds; the usual wannabe badass, who's actually just a damaged girl who suffered a lot in the past. Not to speak about stupid lines which you wouldn't even see in films? Oh, and of course, talking about footloose and a lizard fight, to extend the length of the film.I couldn't feel any empathy or whatsoever for these characters, so that means they are doing it wrong? The sentimental scenes meant nothing and I couldn't care less if they died. Actually, scratch that; if they died, I could have left the cinema earlier.Everything is a huge cliché (frames, scenes, characters?). It almost feels like you're watching a collage and you know EXACTLY what's going to happen every SINGLE time. This film doesn't surprise you in any way. The soundtrack was terribly chosen. It gives the impression that they just chose a couple of songs they like and said "let's use it" even though it doesn't fit. Moreover, and if I'm right, it's not supposed to fit. It's supposed to contrast with the scenes, to make it funny. It wasn't. That's where it gets ridiculous...If this film is supposed to be a parody, it's not funny at all. If it's supposed to be taken seriously, it fails miserably. It did manage to make me and my friend laugh in the final scenes at the absurdity of it all.Not everything is that bad though. Truth be said, the film has excellent special effects and that is the only reason I'm giving it two stars. I'm pretty sure most people get stunned with the effects and think it's great. Rocket was somehow nice and Groot was the one I sympathized more with, even though he said the same line over and over.For me, a film has to tell a story, even if doesn't follow convention. At the very least, it has to express something like every kind of art. I'm tired of going to the cinema and watching the same plot over and over without any consistence, of watching films that are 90% explosions, cities being destroyed and so on, and 10% plot. I just felt dumber after watching this. It's called mass stupidification.</fullReview>

The design overall is very good, the effects also and unlike some I liked Chris Pratt and the Ronan actor. But the attempted humour in the dialog is supremely irritating and the racoon character's grating voice was enough on its own to make me hate the talking scenes.The film is so derivative it could have been assembled by cut and paste.

THIS MOVIE IS A COMPLETE RIP OFF of STAR WARS.Easy escape from detention area, check, incompetent prison guards, check, turning off power to escape, CHECK.I just wanted to puke, the action and dialogue belong in a children's book. Why does the bad guy hate people? Just cause? Why does the bad guy suicide his ships, instead of use them to shoot down the other planes?

I was expecting something more out of it and I wholeheartedly believe the rating misrepresents the movie. It is definitely overrated and over hyped. The narrative is too set up, I feel like the story was written around the purpose of having the 4 characters together. It is boring to watch as the audience already knows what is going to happen half way through. The love story is so cliché I just can't. I'm pretty sure this is a crappy review but I can't concentrate on one thought as I'm half way through the movie right now.

		<shortDescription>They call themselves the Guardians of the Galaxy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They should really call themselves the best film of 2014, because that is what it is! Anyway as you can probably tell, this is my review for the new Marvel movie Guardians of the Galaxy. They're like the B-Rate Avengers and on a different planet. Xandar to be exact. Anywho's, the plot. The Plot: A human adventurer teams up with a band of alien misfits to save the galaxy.Now, first I wanna say this. The soundtrack was freaking awesome. You have songs from Hooked on a Feeling by Blue Swede, I Want You Back by The Jackson 5, and many awesome songs like that, these songs were on Peter Quill's mix tape. Next, the opening scene. Wow. One of the most emotional opening scenes in Marvel film history. Not gonna spoil it, but all I'm saying is that it has one of the most epic transitions from scene to film studio logo ever seen. I mean, the music is swelling, and then the Marvel Studios logo theme (thats a bit different) begins, and after it finishes, it starts up the awesomeness that is Guardians of the Galaxy.Now, onto the actors. First, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill a.k.a. Starlord. A big badass who has one of the best mixtapes I've ever heard and who is one of the most badass characters in the Marvel films. We also have Zoe Saldana playing a green woman named Gamora. And knowing Zoe Saldana, she's awesome in almost every role. And this one is no exception. She absolutely kills it as Gamora. Her fighting skills are awesome as always. Now, the next actor has to be one of the most muscled badasses in this film. His name is Dave Bautista a.k.a. Drax the Destroyer. He was a freaking badass fighter in this one! I know I keep saying badass, but there aren't anymore words to describe these characters. The final two characters I have to mention are also badass. First we have Groot. Voiced and sometimes played by Vin Diesel. He was really good as Groot, even though the only thing he could ever say was I Am Groot. And last but not least, I have to mention the badass that is Bradley Cooper as Rocket Racoon. Oh... my... god he was freaking awesome!! He had some witty one liners after every action. He was a very cocky character I must say. I'm serious, everything he says, he always has a witty remark to everything that goes on!The bad guy. Ronan the Accuser played by Lee Pace. People say that he wasn't as good as they hoped. But I gotta say, he was a massive menacing awesome villain. The backstory of Ronan includes him having a bit of a feud with Drax, because as heard in the trailer, Ronan killed Drax's family, and thus the feud was born. Drax, while focusing on being a Guardian of the Galaxy, has a major score to settle with Ronan. And for a fellow IMDBian smnam, I'm gonna talk about a certain character that goes by the name of The Collector. Played by Benicio Del Toro, he may only have about 1 or 2 scenes, but he is quite good in this. After his minor role in the end credits of THOR: The Dark World, in GotG, you see more of him and why he's called The Collector. He has a ton of stuff in his collection, including cosmonaut dog, and another item that is seen at the very end of the credits, I'm not gonna tell you. It's a surprise.Right, enough about the film before I give too much away, let's get onto the final score.The film was badass, director James Gunn did a fantastic job on bringing the B-Rate Avengers to life, the actors who played the Guardians were awesome, so I am giving this my biggest rating yet. Bigger than the rating I gave Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Godzilla and How To Train Your Dragon 2 combined. I am giving the badass of awesomeness film, a 1000/10!!!Telling you now, this year has been a badass year of film. We've had awesome films like The LEGO Movie, Godzilla, Maleficent, X-Men: Days of Future Past, 22 Jump Street, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and now we have Guardians of the Galaxy. And it was awesome!!Hope you like my longest review I've ever written, I am Shane-O, and I approve this message.P.S. Stay for the end credits. You'll be in for the funniest and greatest end credit scenes in Marvel movie history. That's all I'm saying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Overrated Movie in Existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am only giving this film a one because I want the movie's score to be much much lower even if it takes an army to lower it. Where do I even begin with this? When I saw the trailer for this movie, it looked amazing! A guy from the 80's, A Green Alien, some weird alien looking for vengeance, a tree whose vocab is limited to three words and a raccoon, his best friend fight evil with an amazing soundtrack in the background? THAT SOUNDED AWESOME! So I rushed to the theater when I got a chance to when it got released. It sucked.OK. Well, It didn't suck, but it was not really good. This must be the most overrated movie in existence. I mean people talk about the such amazing chemistry these characters have. WHAT?! All They Do Is Argue And Cry for An Hour and a Half at each other! They don't get along until the very end when they stop the villain who himself isn't memorable. The only one I cared about out of any of these unlikable idiots was the raccoon, Rocket who had the persona of Al Capone Meets Jean Claude Van Damme. He had a few interesting lines but still didn't leave me wanting more of him.People talk about how funny this movie is, I don't think I laughed once. At all. If this is suppose to be a superhero comedy film, then it should be oh whats the word... FUNNY! I felt like I was watching a terrible parody. Also you know what people talk about? The Action. How amazing the action was. Excuse me, the last quarter was just non stop action and violence with no purpose but to be filler. If I cared about the characters which I don't then I don't care about the action! Even the story is bad, Star Lord or whatever his name is finds that his mom dies, runs away and gets abducted by aliens. Then out of nowhere years later, he just becomes a ravager. You are not going to show him being trained or bonding with these aliens? It would have been cool to show who these people were! But no, we just get a stupid dance scene that is not amusing during the opening credits. This movie is so predictable also. Before Star Lord's mom dies, he gets a present but doesn't open it till the end. Any smart person would know it's the Second Mixtape obviously. I am surprised no one knew this except me.But I'm not done yet. This is a perfect movie to show Style over Substance. I have never read the comic, but the whole execution was terrible. The whole thing is just action, arguing, things blowing up, more action, more arguing, more things blowing up and that is it. How is that good entertainment!? Action is important I know but you just can't have terribly executed action sequences with bad 'Character Development' and more crap blowing up! One more thing, The Soundtrack, People are like oh my god the soundtrack is amazing. It is good. But unfortunately, it is overshadowed by the rest of the movie's presence. If this was a Wes Anderson film, this soundtrack would have worked fine. But it's not. It's a Brainless Superhero Film. But I will admit, I will look for the soundtrack to this film on cassette so I can play it on my Walkman. This is the most overrated movie in the history of ever. I see people giving one star reviews to the Avengers saying it's overrated but they give perfect 10 star ratings to this? While the Avengers had so much loving care and effort put into it, this movie comes along and everyone is like this is better then the Avengers. The only really positive thing I can say is Chris Pratt is going to become the next big thing because his presence on screen is charming and fun. Overall, it is not a good film. Not terrible, but really not that good, with the exception of Howard the Duck at the end.51/100 C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start, Chris Pratt did an excellent job with this film: he is the only detail of this production that carried my attention (oops sorry I didn't know how this machine worked--middle finger joke). At a length of 2 hours, I found myself stretching, and uncomfortably shifting in my seat, because I did not feel captivated by the trash before my eyes. Too much flashy CGI, and not enough character, intelligent dialogue, or a story worth watching.The story adds another chapter to the Marvel universe, as it seems every Marvel film is all tied in to a greater over-arching story, dealing with infinity stones, and control over the universe. These films created by Marvel, and now especially this film, Guardians, are nothing more than over budgeted daytime drama, like Days of Our Lives, Bold And The Beautiful, etc. The scripts of these daytime serials seem to carry the same story for years straight, and so do the scripts for the Marvel serials. Guardians of the Galaxy could easily have an hour edited from its run-time and placed on Saturday Morning TV as a made for television movie for children. My 6.5 year old son loved this film. My wife (who enjoys Marvels Avengers) fell asleep in the theater, and I found myself enjoying watching my son laugh, only, hoping for this film to end.To Marvels credit, the Thor films are incredibly entertaining, but are almost ruined by the lead character Thor.So, the only reason to see Guardians of the Galaxy, is to watch children laugh, because this is the level of comedic and script writing talent that exists for this trash for cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of you might argue that this movie deserves better than one star. I'm perfectly aware that there are some movies infinitely worse than this. Jupiter Ascending, for one. Or any Mark Wahlberg film from the past ten years. However. Guardians of the Galaxy does not deserve an 8.1 rating either, no sir. The storyline is a poor man's Avengers at best; a kitsch full of clichés, a childish mess; though I have to add that the raccoon with the anger issues and the tree with the one-word vocabulary are probably the best friends possible for the movie's infantile protagonist, Starlord (with the mommy issues). My rating just wants to restore some measure of reason to this... galaxy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overproduced Fanfiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The First paragraph of this review consists of exposition. If a potential reader wishes to read about my opinion on the movie, skipping to the second paragraph is advisable. It's been about two years since I saw this movie at the cinema - something is compelled me to organize my thoughts and write this now. Why? I'm not entirely sure, I guess "Guardians Of The Galaxy" was always kind of an enigma to me. How could a movie so inept in everything it tries to do be so praised? It's not your typical Michael Bay-esque Hollywood cookie-cutter garbage, so It's success can't be attributed to following the same, overused, cliché-infested formulas. It could be that I am insane in my own specific way, but outside of production value I found no redeeming qualities here. I know the movie is an adaptation (of sorts) of a comic book series. My knowledge of comics is incredibly limited, so I'm judging this thing on it's own merits."Guardians Of The Galaxy" reminded me of one of those sci-fi stories I would come up with when I was 10-13 years old. It was a favorite pastime of mine, coming up with characters, who were blatant rip-offs of others from franchises I enjoyed at the time, putting them in nonsensical situations (of course, to 12 year old me it all made perfect sense) and just admiring my creation as any narcissistic child would. Of course, my stories didn't have movie adaptations with astronomical budgets.I compared "Guardians Of The Galaxy" to a child's sci-fi story because of it's complete lack of direction - too many plot lines (more akin to plot doodles) that are individually unrefined and irrelevant to the overall story, which somehow manages to be even more undefinable. It's like a space opera chopped up and stitched together in some horribly messed up jigsaw puzzle. Now, some movies thrive on a lack of continuity and direction (Tarantino practically mastered that form of film-making), but this specimen is different. Again, it's as if the script was written by a child and the whole thing was directed by some individual who somehow had the skill of a top-notch director, but again possessed the mindset of a 12 year old.What's even more surreal about the whole thing is that it feels incredibly solid - it's not "The Room" where every seen is irrelevant, because of the writer/director's sheer incompetence. Somehow, "Guardians..." holds itself together quite well, again everything else is top notch: Excellent CGI, detailed land/spacescapes (albeit of unoriginal, uninspired design) and pretty good acting with some minor exceptions. As I said before, this movie doesn't play out like a typical Hollywood schlockfest would - there are too many plot lines and too much time is devoted to character development - if this was typical garbage, we would have had a lot more action scenes and female characters in suggestive positions. All these attempts at complexity feel sincere, again, it's like a child trying to do his best, but they have no purpose. To illustrate: why should it matter that the green chick and the blue chick (sorry, too lazy to look up names) are sisters - it could matter, but the movie makes no attempt to give some importance to this statement, they share some scenes, the talk about about each other, they fight, but nothing really comes out of it. It's the same with every single plot point you can think of. The Villain? Well, he's pale blue and angry and he has this massive spaceship fortress and wants to rule/destroy (not sure) the universe, but wait it turns out he's not the main villain, there's another guy and he's even...yeah a 12 year old might buy into this being legit character development, but I've grown far too old and cynical.In the end, "Guardians Of The Galaxy" feels like it starts from nowhere, goes nowhere and accomplishes nothing. A very empty, yet confusing (albeit visually spectacular) experience. But all the glitter in the world can't make this shine. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the worst Marvel Crap ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GUARDIANS OF THE CRAPLAXY It's been a while since I gave a comment about movies. Usually when I do, it's because the movie was extremely awesome or annoyingly full of cow dung. I went into the theater without any idea what guardian of the galaxy had in store. Sometimes a movie is more enjoyable when u don't know any synopsis at all. So that is what I did. All I knew was that it had a good number of positive reviews and IMDb had given it at least an 8. Most of the time when IMDb reviewers give a movie an 8 u know the movie is gonna be awesome?.and nothing can or could go wrong. RIGHT???? ?? HOW WRONG, I MEAN HOW VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY WRONG I WAS. Please if u r someone with a functioning brain I implore you not to go watch this garbage. Allow me to be the messiah when it comes to this movie?. Take it that I have gone to sacrifice my cash and time for u to stay away and just download it if u can?.and even that make sure u download it from a place that is sharing free Wi-Fi. Why do u ax? Why am I blasting this movie with so much ammo you ax? It's simple. Nowhere, ie weather in reality or fiction can a bunch of people always save a complex situation without coming out unscathed. Also I don't even know if the movie is a comedy or a thriller or action. It tries woefully to emulate all 3 to no success. I AM GONNA END HERE? or I will go on and on. And I am trying hard not to give away spoilers. BUT LET NO ONE SAY I NEVER WARNED THEM. Ps: there are 2 sure fire ways to watch it without having any regrets. 1. Going to watch it with a lady friend that you wanna score, and 2. When you are high on weed. These 2 ways I guarantee will make you enjoy the movie so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie the other day, and I liked it...it was pretty fun, but as I walked out I said to myself, "why is this SO popular?" I don't think this would be even a quarter as popular as it is if it were not a Marvel movie. I think people see the Marvel logo and rush to see it. I have good friends that saw it that don't like science fiction at all. It was a good movie but it's wasn't that great...I personally thought Gamora was awful, while Drax was surprisingly really great!What do I base my opinion on that this is only big because it's Marvel? Serenity/Firefly....almost the same thing, yet Serenity didn't make hardly anything. I wish movies could be judged based on their stand alone quality, and not just people that live and die by Marvel. I did enjoy the darker side of the movie, it didn't feel like the typical Marvel movie which can get kind of tiring with all the puns, and kiddy humor. Did anyone else feel the same? Just ask themselves why this is doing AS well as it is? I am a DC girl, but I enjoy both. My favorite is Superman, and my second favorite is Captain America</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge loss of respect for humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this listed as the best reviewed summer movie from two years ago and can't stand it anymore. When I watched this I laughed at how bad it was. Being utterly sadistic, I went to RT and IMDb to share in the deserved shaming. Instead, I found 90% glowing, not positive, glowing reviews. Just to put it in perspective, I feel I'm pretty mainstream in my tastes, and can enjoy the utterly stupid if that's the point, e.g. Dumb/Dumber, Austin Powers, some Feig, and even Grandma's Boy or Broken Lizard is OK if I'm too tired to change the channel. I also like gratuitous violence just fine, and have willingly suspended my reality as needed since I left the Last Starfighter in tears about 30min in, and Transformers(animated) after the credits rolled. I reeeeally liked Burton's/Nolan's Batmans. That said, I simply don't quite get all the respect for modern super-hero movies, or more specifically, all the respect for certain such movies. Ironman was good, but certainly not that good, and the Avengers is really no better in plot/acting than GI Joe or Green (insert balance of mediocrity here), they just have better directors/budgets maybe. Of course, I've gotten old since Keaton, and I'm willing to admit I am guilty of inflating Nolan's work b/c I dig the stylings, and perhaps b/c I don't like that I got old. So, I give the Thors and Cpt. Americas of the world a pass because I figure they're intended for 8 year olds like my previous self. If arrested development provides a wider audience these days, that's not the movie's fault. Similarly, if you think Tony Stark is better than Jack's Joker, I also blame your parents. As for Guardians, I certainly can imagine an 8-12 year olds enjoying this (as I enjoyed TMNT in all its one liner glory), as well as 13-18 year olds who attend conventions (as I enjoyed the unsolvable mystery of who Adrian Paul would decapitate each week). I don't remember lines from them, and today's 8-18 year olds won't remember any from Guardians. E.g.: a)His race is without a sense of irony? (picturing writers high-fiving over ability to add in at least 4-5 one liners off this contrivance and not have to actually hire someone with any comedic talent to write a joke relating to the plot/action/previous line). b) I am groot means I am groot except if you're a racoon, then it predictably means everything (ala Chewie) from please and thank you to something super technical that it's just amazing/hilarious this character would know about. But hey, I didn't mind it in Star Wars. To be fair to me, Ford didn't wait for a laugh track after each line, and Chewey didn't magically transform three English words into a decipherable language instead of buying Han Rosetta Stone Wookie for Christmas one year; c) dance off. Oh, but what about using old/anachronistic/genre bending songs to create an atmosphere? Yes, awesome, and when Tarantino did it 20 years ago I thought it was just shy of Dre mixing rap and funk, so maybe we'll just add that to the homage bill. Love Pratt as a Lenny figure, but between this and Jurassic World, I really hope he saves any action movie paychecks just in case the Coen brothers don't come a calling by the time the next teddy bear/modern man's man next door shows up (sorry Krasinski, seats taken). Btw, didn't Pratt himself think this movie would bomb and end his career? That, and his great Top Chef appearance would make me go see said Coen bros. movie. So, even if it weren't for the impossibly favorable reviews, this movie is one of the worst movies I've seen,since Thor, and before that Fast/Furious and/or Eye of the Beholder. That for a time I felt like I had to hide my disgust lest I be outed as the only heterosexual male aged 10-40 who doesn't think Gunn is the next Spielberg, makes me write this, and makes me almost as sad for my country as the d/t sandwich the major parties inflicted upon us this year. If not me, my son deserves more 7 years from now. You are groot. I am happy for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start with, the film has excellent visual effects and the action sequences were very good. The production design kind of looked like the 60s, but that's not really a problem. I felt like there was nothing really new here, the same story-lines are repeated in these Marvel films, so it does not have a lot to make it unique or so different from other Sci-Fi films, and it is really strange to me how so many people loved it. Also, apart from Groot (who was just awesome), I did not find any of the other characters very likable, especially Chris Pratt. Zoe Saldana was the clichéd bad-ass action heroine who is more serious than the goofy male hero.However, the story was gripping a lot of the time, and I have to repeat how amazing the visual effects were; it was just visually dazzling. But I also had a problem with how bad the skin makeup looked on the colorful characters (Zoe Saldana, her sister, the villain and others). All in all, the film was fun to watch and has great visuals, but I found it overrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, I watched this in the first place because of the high ratings. I was expecting a lot more from it and was disappointed after I watched it. The graphics is great, the animation looks surreal but the movie itself couldn't keep me interested the whole time. I was actually just forcing myself to watch it during the middle part of the movie. It gets kind of interesting as it ends and that's the only part I enjoyed the most. I think it was dragged during the first part and middle part that's why I got bored watching it. I didn't find it humorous at all. Actually, I didn't feel any particular heavy emotion when I was watching the move, except from the part when groot died. So yeah, I'll give this movie a 6 just because of the amazing graphics and because of groot's death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, i know i gave this film 6/10 which is a passing grade, and not a bad score, but the reason being, is that i didn't mind some of the jokes and interaction of some of the characters. Overall this film was pretty bad. I really wanted to like this film. I was looking forward to watching it after reading the rave reviews and seeing the trailer.Now having seen it: what an awful movie ? although the film starts out promisingly enough except for the heartstrings-tugging opening in the hospital, it rapidly becomes the same old shoot 'em up that you have seen innumerable times.The good guy, is a bad guy only doing good to clear his name or there is something in it for him. The bad guy gets stupid henchman to go after him. the Fights are super boring and very badly edited, and the story falls apart on itself over and over again.When you pay people a very high salary for being script supervisor and not even to mention script writers, you would think the story would be some what interesting or relatively good. No, this film was very weak.The only plus side to the whole film was the nostalgic music that kept on playing through the movie. That's it. The bad guy was weak and never truly explained, the really bad guy didn't care that he was betrayed, the good guy never got his revenge, or really did anything of importance in the film. You don't feel anything for any of the characters in the whole film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, don't mistake me, yes, Guardians is a very fun movie to see, even funny at times, BUT, and for it's a big one, you can't really like it if you know too much about the comics involved (ie, GotG, of course, but also anything involving Ronan the Accuser and the Nova Corps).If you don't take the comics into account, this movie is everything a summer refreshing movie should be: fun, action-packed, funny characters, great show on all accounts. The characters are all likable, and don't go too close on the limit of the suspension of disbelief.Chris Pratt does an excellent job with Star-Lord, even though this incarnation mainly seems out of the Annihilation War comics period, rather than the latest incarnation of GotG the movie seems mainly based on.Similarly, Rocket Racoon is very good, and very close to the comics.The other characters, though, differ quite notably from the comics. Gamora poses as a traumatized victim of Thanos, who never wanted to kill all these people: not exactly the sadistic "Most dangerous woman in the universe". Drax the Destroyer is a muscular moron out for revenge against Ronan, there again, quite far from a mutated human designed solely for the purpose of killing Thanos. Groot is just a feeble-minded sidekick to Rocket, there again quite far from what he is in the comics.As for the villains, they're quite ridiculous too. Ronan is just a single-minded bully out for genocide, and the Collector is just a shadowy dealer in rare goods. Only Thanos is treated correctly, as a monster so powerful nobody in his right mind would dare provoke him.But the worst of all is still the Nova Corps... I mean, they're just a bunch of nobodies, without powers, and fancy little fighters... How are we to believe they're the cops of space, universally respected and feared? Overall, it's a good movie, fun for the summer, but quite out of place for a Marvel piece, as far as tone is concerned. As for the content, it points more and more towards an Avengers 3 movie with Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet or something close.And the fun allusion of the movie: the inclusion of Cosmo in the Collector's collection, and the surprise in the post-credits scene (not alluding to any further movie, for once).</fullReview>

A Stan Lee comedy.It starts out in 1988 and a young boy's mother is dying, then he is outside and a giant alien spacecraft abducts him. Then the movie switches forward to present time, 26 or so years later, and the boy has grown to a 30-something Chris Pratt as Peter Quill on some planet far off in the galaxy. He has turned into some sort of mercenary who can retrieve things at the request of others.Zoe Saldana, all in green skin makeup is his nemesis Gamora, who eventually warms up to Peter after he saves her from certain death in the vacuum of space.There are a number of strange and dangerous characters, such as Dave Bautista as Drax, Vin Diesel voicing the tall, woody plant form known as Groot, Bradley Cooper voicing the short, raccoon-like creature known as Rocket, and a host of others.The action goes from one strange planet to another, all the while playing up dialog for laughs when it could. I'm not quite sure what to think of it, but one thing is certain, it gave my subwoofer a great work-out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've got to admit that GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY caught me by surprise: it's rare that a movie turns out to be even WORSE than I imagined it might be. You try to sit through movies like this- like BATTLEFIELD: EARTH or BUCKAROO BANZAI or TOTAL RECALL (the Schwarzenegger version; I still haven't bothered with the "reimagined remake") or THE FIFTH ELEMENT or any one of a thousand others- and it becomes nothing more or less than self abuse. "My government knows no shame," proclaims Ronan in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY; nor, apparently does his Studio. You know your movie's in trouble when the one and only character worth watching for even a nanosecond is a cartoon raccoon- named Rocky ("Rocket"), who, incidentally, has the best line in the movie: "All of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid, to nothing at all. Pathetic." (That's called a nutshell review, by the way.) This is just plain sloppy storytelling, based on one of the least-interesting comic books ever to see print. And ANT-MAN is next??? What are these people thinking? There's no rhyme or reason to anything they're doing. Forget the "lack of continuity;" this is simply hyping cgi sequences that might as well be cut and pasted on a disc unto themselves, without the "human" element.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here comes the Marvel picture phase II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leaving the Avengers behind, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY heralds the 2nd phase in the Marvel's silver screen expedition as IRON MAN (2008, 8/10) kick-started the 1st phase. But who is James Gunn? whose director résumé only encompasses the gooey horror SLITHER (2006) and a superhero indie SUPER (2010). Watched it in 3D, the film is a hyper-diverting adventurer amalgamated with slick action set pieces, legit humor and emotion and spectacular visual impact, the chemistry among its quintet coterie is potently pleasing, the comic timing is on the nose, and the most euphonious trait is its 70s-retro soundtrack, which is a killing nostrum to identify itself among Marvel's other imposing juggernauts. It is hard not to compare this to the STAR WARS series, an inter-galactic combat assembling unlikely heroes (various species) to prevent an evil (and dark elfish) super-villain, Ronan the Accuser (Pace), whose intent is to acquire a mighty orb (the McGuffin) to rule (or destroy) the universe. As the first chapter, naturally, it turns out that Ronan is merely a minion, there is much more overpowering force behind.The team includes Peter Quill (Pratt), aka. Starlord, a 30 something human; Gamora (Saldana), a green-colored assassin trained by Thanos (an uncredited cameo by Josh Brolin); Rocket, a cybernetic raccoon (voiced by Bradley) and his best friend Groot, a creature with the appearance of a walking tree and limited vocabularies (the viral I'm Groot! voiced by Diesel), and Drax the Destroyer, a red-tattooed brawny muscle (Bautista). The film is at the top of its game when the 5 gather together, bickering and jesting, they never take this saving-the-universe deal too serious, unless things deteriorate into the moment when self-sacrifice is exigently needed, surprisingly Rocket and Groot are granted much more humanity than their human-shaped comrades. Even in the crucial showdown scenes, when Starlord and Ronan stand face to face, a playful stunt conveniently eases audience from the edge of the seat, if the characters themselves don't engage in the plot, why should we the rubbernecks? Bad-drafted villain is always a frailty in Marvel's kingdom, Ronan is so plainly written, the supposed career boost of Lee Pace is still unaccomplished, so is Hounsou's Korath, while Gamora's vicious sister Nebula (Gillan) is in no better condition, but at least her storyline will continue. Yondu Udonta (Rooker) is between friend or foe, whose sentient arrow is the wow factor one wishes it will keep shooting in the next installment. Benicio Del Toro as the Collector and Glenn Close as Nova Prime, both have meager screen time, no chance to run the show. Aimed to nostalgia and accompanies Starlord's Han Solo carefree flair, the mix-tape hits from 70s are unexpectedly well maneuvered, devoid of a present-day background, it is a smart move, and more poignantly, the obsolete Walkman emanates a strong connection between a guilty son and his deceased mother, no upbeat rhythm can beat that! No wonder its soundtrack is already a No.1 selling album in USA.In conclusion, the film is an above-average marvel production, great job for Gunn and his team, establishes a ragbag of lovable roles besides the Avengers assembly, and it has the prospects to be the STAR WARS of this generation, intriguingly, the rebooted Star Wars sequel is also heading towards us, soon we will find which one is the bona fide winner. But one must confess, Marvel does have an upper hand with the ultra-success of this picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a silly movie with a silly story. It's funny from time to time but overall not worth watching. Sometimes a really bad movie somehow gets a totally unjustified good rating. This is one of those. This review is over there is nothing more to review as you will forget the story instantly after you've watched the movie. Still IMDb forces me to write nonsense about a nonsensical movie which is rather strange. Okay, it's a story for an animation movie with lots of strange things happening but that's not the problem. The problem are the animation like characters totally one-dimensional and totally shallow. The only thing this movie has are hollow and teenie-like jokes. Maybe if you haven an IQ&lt;70 this is entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel phones it in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this with my wife and two of our teenagers - all of us had great expectations, we'd heard the hype and seen the previews, and it looked like fun. All of us were disappointed. Now that we've all watched the movie, the consensus is that we got burned by the Marvel brand name. At some level I believe that's why most people are watching this because let's face it: only Marvel comic fans are likely to know the story, so what better way to inspire movie-goer confidence than to stick that red and white logo all over it? It works at the grocery, and it works in Hollywood.The first 20 minutes are fairly ho-hum. And that's the problem; the ho-hum never really goes away, but at least after those first 20 minutes you have an idea as to what's going on. There are an awful lot of cool looking characters, an awful lot of story ideas, some spectacular special effects and... and... that's about it. The writers never bothered to tie these things together in a meaningful way, but you're already watching the film because of that brand name. You thought Marvel wouldn't do this to you, and they did. You can't stop watching the train wreck because it's fascinating, although you'll probably have a bit more trepidation before the next Marvel movie.If I had it to do over again this would be a miss, and I'll be sure to tell anyone that I hear is planning to watch it. If you're on the fence, there are better movies to watch. If special effects and explosions are what you want, then maybe this will get it for you. But have your phone handy, because Marvel phoned it in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may be too harsh giving Guardians of the Galaxy such a poor rating, but I have to be honest. This movie is garbage. I suspect that the people who give it such high praises are nothing but Marvel fanboys. GOTG is boring. Really, really boring. The movie tries to be funny, but falls flat with one bad joke after another. Rocket Raccoon (who is obviously supposed to be the funniest character, since he is the most sarcastic and has the most one-liners) is painfully unfunny. Anyway, I laughed a little bit at the beginning; the rest of the time I stared blankly at the screen, periodically glancing at my watch. The action sequences only contributed to the boringness of the movie. Why? There's no risk to the main characters. It is obvious that they won't be killed. The "danger" is never convincing enough to raise the pulse.Guardians of the Galaxy is a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun? Yes. But far from groundbreaking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did I enjoy Guardians of the Galaxy? Absolutely. It was fun and cute and definitely one for sci-fi fans because it was a near-perfect blend of Star Wars meets Avengers (both Disney properties now so that makes some sort of sense.) Yet in the same vein I would hesitate to say that the film sits anywhere near either of those films. As with many comedies and action films the bulk of the movie can be seen in the trailer. The gags in Guardians of The Galaxy felt nearly stale I had seen them so many times in the trailer, there was not much new outside of that. The story was decent as was the performances and they did a decent job of establishing this group of outcast misfits forced to work together and find something meaningful as a make-shift "family." The movie was a lot of fun, it just didn't really floor me that way I had hoped. I have a great deal of respect for Marvel in what they've created and I am glad to see them start a new franchise with some connection to the Avengers Universe but this one felt a little bland when all was said and done. There was a ton of action scenes, space battles and hand to hand fights but they were just okay. I can't pinpoint why this wasn't "amazing" for me, only that for me it just missed the boat a little.Chris Pratt is perfect for the role of Peter Quill aka: Starlord. His one liners and comedic timing works very well and he does a decent job of establishing some depth to his character. Its almost a little hard to take him seriously when the emotional scenes begin but he pulls it off. Zoe Saldana is also perfect for her role as vengeful assassin Gamora. Saldana and Pratt have good chemistry and some of the best action scenes are pulled off by her battling in hand to hand combat. Some comparisons could be made to her Avatar character but its a good performance nonetheless. I thought for a long while that Dave Bautista was a bad choice for this film. Wrestlers' moving into mainstream acting is becoming more common but in the beginning he seems cheesy and campy and then I began to understand that his character Drax is supposed to be exactly that. He doesn't understand sarcasm, takes everything literally and becomes ferociously protective of his new friends. He ended up being not so bad and he pulls it off. I still think he's a weaker member of the cast but he still impressed me. I don't even understand why Vin Diesel was cast in this film. I love the character of Groot...don't get me wrong...he was perfectly awesome but with one growly line in various tones, it could have been literally anyone behind the voice. You will never know its Diesel so in that regard I can't say he was good or bad. The star or person behind Groot is irrelevant. My favourite character and even performance was that of Bradley Cooper as Rocket Raccoon. He has a definitive edge and a big heart and his character was insanely fun and funny. I could have done a whole movie with him. Cooper was spot on in his voicing of the CGI character. You could hardly even recognize him. Lee Pace was an extraordinary villain as Ronan and distinctly comparable to a Sith Lord from Star Wars. Still, he was definitely a villain worthy of an epic action flick. Watch for great supporting performances from Michael Rooker (he always plays the same role but heck he's good at it), Djimon Hounsou, Karen Gillan, John C. Reilly and Benicio Del Toro.This is one of those films where it doesn't matter what I say about it because its clear its already a HUGE hit for Marvel. Did it do it for me? Not entirely. Will I see it again? Sure! And I will watch sequels because it was fun. I just didn't think it was truly epic. Marvel continually sets a bar for itself and I personally didn't feel this reached that bar. I would never tell anyone it was terrible because it is very well done. The CGI was decent, the 3D was unnecessary as usual, the action and comedy was good...everything about it was good. I actually think director James Gunn was a bizarre choice to helm a major tent-pole franchise because he hasn't done a lot (although he did direct a film early in his career that I LOVED called Slither) and I'm interested to see if he can learn something and really impress me next time. Until then, I liked it but didn't love it. See it for yourself and make your own call. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-Fi that oozes blandness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How could a film with a talking raccoon be bland you ask? Well, they did somehow manage it.This film was recommended to me by a colleague, whose word I trust. I watched it on an average HD TV screen and appreciate that this may have diminished the impact of the effects.I found this film nondescript - and I was more captivated by the dinner I was eating while watching it. In fairness, it was a cracking curry with succulent tender chicken that melted in my mouth. The accompanying sauce had a lovely buttery tang to it that complimented the meat beautifully. This film didn't really stand a chance.The start was good and I was rooting for the film after a nice opening where our protagonist lost his mum and got kidnapped by aliens straight after. It just never really takes off after that. The relentless wise cracking jokes come thick and fast but none of them are particularly funny. Think 10 jokes for the payoff of one slight titter.The story ambles along with a highly original plot about an evil scary person seeking out an object of unfathomable power (oh by the way if you're one of those people that don't "get" things, this is sarcasm. The plot isn't original. It's bloody tedious and the same plot as 95% of every other sci-fi films and fantasy adventures) - with the goodies trying to stop him. The action scenes came at us non-stop, just like the wise cracks, but it is all shoulder shruggingly typical of every other action film in existence.There are a whole variety of wafer thin "characters" that we meet along the way. There are also lots of clichés, a horribly unconvincing and contrived romance, and a ludicrous end.I'm honestly at the point where seeing films like this with a rating of higher than 8 leaves me utterly baffled. Does IMDb collectively have zero taste? This film is the "Masters of the Universe" of 2015. It's eye candy for the intellectually bankrupt adult, or the easily amused child. At least Masters of the Universe had Skeletor. That's a baddie I can really get behind.I convinced my sceptical girlfriend to watch this, and my credit in the film picking stakes took a huge hit. After it ended, I got that scolding "told you so" look, and what could I say? She was right. This is rubbish. Don't believe the hype.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another Marvel blockbuster, and yet another story of a plucky little band of inadequates chasing a object of unfathomable power which somehow falls into the hands of an ineffably evil bad guy who threatens to wield unspeakable destruction with it. I hope that isn't a spoiler!OK, so I don't inhabit the target demographic, but after 5 minutes of really quite moving opening scenes, I felt like I was strapped into an out-of-control roller coaster for 2 hours. Just once in a while, it would be nice if the explosions stopped and those characters could have a conversation with each other about, I don't know, life, the universe, and everything, but no, these are action characters and they develop though intense, crazy, death-defying action.That little quibble aside, the film was a lot of fun, with plenty of amusing snappy dialogue, interesting and quirky characters with trademark Marvel personality flaws. It also has a wonderful soundtrack for which I am the target audience; if you were around at any time in the seventies and had the radio on, you'll love it. It's nice to know that new generations are being introduced to that fabulous music for perhaps the first time. Somebody literally put some soul into the script.By the way, the most sympathetic character is a walking tree.</fullReview>

Worse than that - it wasted Karen Gillan who is one of the hottest sci-fi girls on the planet and can act a whole better than the dumb talentless Yanks she has the misfortune to share her pathetic amount of screen time with. Besides Karen (who is always fun) the only character in this piece of juvenile junk with any charisma is a wooden tree voiced by Vin Diesel.

		<fullReview>Just another piece of Hollywood trash. If you're under the age of 8, or you're an adult male who reads comic books, you'll probably like this. If you're a normal adult, you'll probably think it's the stupidest movie you've ever seen. It has all the depth and seriousness of "Kung Fu Panda". The "plot" is nothing more than a rickety vehicle for a bunch of adolescent, snarky jokes and inane dialogue. The plot climax, in which the main character challenges the villain to a "dance off" practically screams at the audience, "Ha ha ha! You stupid idiots, we already got your money!" Seriously, this movie doesn't even need Joel, Tom Servo, and Crow -- it mocks itself.This movie is really just beyond bad. If you've ever wondered what it would be like if: A) far-away civilizations looked like bad Nickelodeon shows, or B) a Hollywood producer let his 12-year-old son write a sci-fi screenplay, you'll find this intriguing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's Space Opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it was a surprise to no one that Marvel's next big movie would be a good and profitable film considering the amazing track record of the past 10 superhero movies produced by their studio. Even as the first trailers began to grace movie theaters, fans and casual moviegoers were eager to see this film about a group of characters that even die-hard Marvel fans themselves had little knowledge of. Unlike other characters such as Thor, Capt. America, and Ironman the cosmic superhero team known as the Guardians of the Galaxy have very little notoriety, which presented a huge gamble for Marvel to bring to life. In fact, when one of the first trailers appeared I remember my father turned to me and asked, "What's with the giant tree man, the raccoon, green lady, and the Han Solo knockoff?" Nevertheless, Marvel not only adapted this comic series into a great movie but perhaps the best movie in their entire roster and by far the best summer film this year at a time where a great summer blockbuster was desperately needed. It resemble the classic action comedy from the 80s and early 90s with likable characters, great comedic timing, and action sequences that are fun and extremely entertaining in a way that remind me of the Indiana Jones series.Our Cosmic adventure follows Peter Quill (a.k.a. Star-Lord), a thief and outlaw abducted from Earth as a child, who finds and steals a mysterious orb which he intends to sell. Unbeknownst to him this orb is also wanted by a radical madman called Ronan the Accuser, who seeks the powerful artifact hidden within the orb in order to eradicate an entire planet to which he has sworn to destroy. As Peter tries to sell the orb he encounters the cybernetically enhanced assassin Gamora and bounty hunters Rocket and Groot who are all promptly arrested and sent to prison for previous crimes. While in prison they meet Drax the Destroyer, a brutish juggernaut who wants revenge against Ronan and his associates for the death of his family. Together they break out of prison with the intent to sell the orb for a vast amount of money and keep it out of the hands of Ronan and the even more powerful tyrant known as Thanos. From there they uncover the mystery behind the orb's true purpose and prevent Ronan from using its power to kill an entire planet full of innocent people.Unlike other movies which would take a situation like this seriously and with some sense of urgency, the characters in Guardians seem to show little concern or reference to the whole saving the world aspect that you expect to form the basis of every superhero movie. That's not to say that the characters or the writers themselves don't care about what is happening and what is at stake but rather they focus more on the quirky Cheers quality fun-time atmosphere the film creates. This can mostly be demonstrated in Chris Pratt's portrayal as Quill, who has a very laid- back attitude towards everything with a rather mocking cool guy persona which is how a child of the 80s may have believed a cool space superhero would have been like.Speaking of characters, everything single one of them is memorable, interesting, and well portrayed by their actors which by itself is the main selling point of this movie. I have already mentioned Chris Pratt amazing job as the lead, but Zoe Saldana as Gamora is by far one of the best female action heroine in any action movie since Black Widow and has a very commanding presence throughout the entire film. By far one of the biggest surprises is Batista's portrayal of Drax. Never has a wrestler turned actor so much believability and charisma since The Rock delivering both laughs and incredibly entertaining action sequences. However, not one performance can live up to the two characters that completely steal the entire show, Rocket and Groot voice by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. Yes, the talking tree and the raccoon are by far the most entertaining and likable characters you'll find in pretty much any movie out there today and you often find yourself begging for another scene featuring them. They are also two of the funniest characters in the entire picture behaving like the classic straight and funny man routine of Abbott and Costello fame but twice as fun. Even though Groot pretty much only says the words "I am Groot", which you would figure could get quite annoying and repetitive, becomes funnier every time he says it.Aside from these characters the visual and special effects that are brought to the screen not only allow for some amazing eye candy and interesting creature design that brings the world to life. Everything seemed to have a purpose and meaning for their existence which makes you want to learn more about these environments and the history behind them.Music-wise this is one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a film in a long time thanks especially to Star-Lord's awesome mix filled with classic songs from the late 60s to the 70s and some early 80s. Not only are they fun but they fit quite well with the comedic and quirky atmosphere of the movie.Bottom line, if you have not seen this movie you're doing yourself a disservice and if you've reading this review stop now, buy a ticket, and see this movie if you have not already. It's funny, exciting, and you may even find yourself seeing it three or four times if not more just to experience it again.</fullReview>

It is probably on the same level with DC's Green Lantern. Totally painful to watch. At best it's a copycat of Star Trek franchise.Marvel has been surprising me for the couple of years, in a good way. They've managed to keep their form with Guardians of the Galaxy, but in a very very bad way this time. Is this a TV movie? No. It's a high profile space movie. Then why does it feel like a TV movie? Because every single thing in this cinema is a STEREOTYPE in one way or another. I've enjoyed few of individual moments. But mostly it was painful for me.The only reason this film has managed to stay above Green Lantern in my book is Bradley Cooper. He is better than his usual this film. Final Verdict: 41%.

Humour is mostly hit and miss, and is at times just plain dumb..to the point that it seemed intentional. Characters are as expected one dimensional, and hopefully the inevitable sequel will spend a bit more time on their backgrounds.The real downer was the 3D effects or the lack of them, honestly it felt like 3D was just tagged on to the title and many times i pulled off my glasses just to check if there was any 3D effect present at all. Like a good deal of 3D movies out there, its just a nice excuse for studios to rip us out of a few more bucks.If you didn't find the trailers for this movie funny, save yourself a few bucks and wait for a home release.</fullReview>

I do have to say one thing this movie was visually stunning but I'm still glad that I don't do these in 3D, I would have probably been sick afterward. I do think that the human characters were upstaged by the raccoon and the tree (can't believe Vin Diesel was paid money in this film and only said probably ten words during the whole two hours).

		<shortDescription>We are Groot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched Guardians of the Galaxy in the cinemas, I immediately wanted to watch it again. It's a great example of escapism that manages, inexplicably, to surprise expectations despite the waning Marvel trend. One of the words that is tossed around the most when describing GOTG is fun, and I certainly have to agree with that. But it also manages to be strangely heartfelt in some ways. There is no better character to champion this than the lovable living tree, Groot, who cannot communicate in any other way but a single repeated sentence. He's Chewbacca but animated with both facial expression and deadly danger in his stretching branchlike limbs, and so when he utters that line at the climax, we truly feel a part of the team as well. GOTG contains a mixed bag of characterisation, but it's done with eagerness and colour, so at the very least you cannot say they are boring or bland. It's a remarkable achievement to bring these unknown comic book characters to the big screen with financial success. The main character is the charismatic Peter Quill, or Starlord, as he dubs himself, played by the rising star Chris Pratt. It's a lovable goof that he portrays - in similar vein to the wisecracking Han Solo or Malcolm Reynolds, yet less entertaining and consistent. One moment he is being caring and considerate and slightly dashing, the next he's a insufferable man-child making dick jokes. There is a lovely opening prologue that surrounds the room with 10cc's "I'm Not In Love" in the same manner as those vintage earphones and establishes his back- story quite tenderly and gives some explanation behind the 60s/70s pop soundtrack throughout the whole film. That in itself is lovely and there are some great picks in there, yet it's not exactly fleshed out beyond that. There's a particularly unsubtle moment where the relatively unacquainted Gamora and Quill open up to each other and Elvis Bishop's "Fooled Around and Fell In Love" chimes in. A better and more nuanced scene would be when he drifts out into the beautiful but hazardous red-green backdrop of outer space and sacrifices his air for hers just as Yondu as his crew arrive. Similar treatments are given to the other guardians; Drax seeks vengeance for his deceased family, Gamora is seeking independence from his overlord step-dad Thanos, and Rocket Raccoon carries both physical and emotional scars from experimentation. But all these are conveyed to us via exposition and given hardly an extra thought, and then before you know it we're at the third act and they have made peace with these conflicts and become a super team that can face any challenge if they just stick together (or at least that's the cheesy explanation for them being able to tolerate the forces of the mind stone). Well, that's Marvel. What is more likely to be discussed as you walk out and dispose of your popcorn bags, the short emotional outburst from Bradley Cooper that we quickly move on from, or the running joke of him needing robotic body parts? Which is, to be fair, very funny. How good are Batista's antics? Opposing them is most definitely the worst villain of the MCU so far, the Kree warlord who doesn't even possess a few lines of back- story. He is evil for the sake of being evil, and in the blandest fashion imaginable, so much so that it comes across as campy because he is played so straight in contrast to the jokester of Pratt. Even the excellent Lee Pace cannot save it. Remarkably, it actually works in favour of that climatic dance off - the cliché villain is so unbelievably out of place that his face lights up bizarrely and he is momentarily frozen in confusion. It's such a shame then that this action sequence takes place on a rather cold and alien setting. The special effects and production design team create such a spectacle above the skies of Xandar in the Star Wars-esque laser battle, interlocking barriers and explosions and the massive hulking spaceship of Ronan, the Dark Aster. But we are given but 3 familiar faces to root for, and no real insight into the Nova Corps or the citizens of Xandar. It's difficult to really feel too threatened by Ronan and his invasion. For all the work put into the fantastically detailed and unique make-up and costuming, these are blank faces. The father figure of Yondu? A means to get the Guardians where they need to go, and be uncharacteristically content in Peter Quill being good for once in his life. The pink skinned assistant of the Collector? Placed there to trigger the events that allow Ronan to make off with the mind stone. And Karen Gillan might as well be the exact copy of her sister Gamora, only she's the baddie because we are told she is. Yet all this talk of the infinity stone reminds me of the real objective of this film; to introduce this band of heroes and further along the overarching storyline. What the MCU is doing is unique and ambitious, and GOTG serves the narrative well because we now will recognise the Guardians in the future franchise films. And cheer at cameos, as we've done when Captain America turns up in Thor 2, or savour those post credits scenes. Thanos doesn't even need to make that short appearance because GOTG for the first time has him in the flesh, and Ronan pales in comparison to his threat and presence. We're gonna need a Hulk, and a Thor, and lots more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible story, but funny and worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the film were to take itself seriously, it would have been horrible. BUT, as the director fully understood the limits of his script, he turned it into a virtual parody at which the main characters seem quite aware they're just pulling a shtick. They look at the camera without appearing really solemn for even a second. There are several ludicrous discrepancies in the story and a reviewer accustomed to deep stuff would throw this down the stairs, but the atmosphere of this fast-paced picture is replete with so much action and rich visual effects, the common man will not even notice. It leaves little room for thoughts like "WTF is this". Bottom line, this is quite entertaining. It will amuse you greatly, and that's just about that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>awesome but a little disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Was highly looking forward to the guardians of the galaxy because they don't make much movies about them so i was excited to finally watch them in action. The whole movie altogether was great i thought it was a fun action packed marvel classic, and the all the characters were awesome too, except one of them. Groot was the biggest let down, My brother who loves the guardians of the galaxy kept saying that Groot was this big and awesome tree dude who kicked butt, but the most exciting parts with him was when he stuck his branches up a guys nose, and when he stabbed threw a couple of guys and swung them around forever. so yeah he was not that fun to watch. Luckily the rest of the guardians picked up the slack and were awesome, especially starlord he was definitely the humor of the show. So in all the show was great so i would suggest to go see it but if you have high hope of Groot lower them or you may be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly the Guardians of the Galaxy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the movie came out, I decided to try one of the free comics from Marvel Unlimited. I found not one, but two, comics about the Guardians of the Galaxy. Not knowing who these characters were, I wanted to learn who they are. There, I learned about the characters Star-Lord and the rest of the gang.Therefore, when the movie came out, I was pretty interested in it. For a while, however, I decided not to watch it, because I thought it wouldn't be as great as another Marvel movie, Captain America: The Winter Soldier.After debating on it, I decided to go ahead and try the movie. It was brilliant.The humor made the movie funny. At the same time, however, we get amazing action with great CG for the characters, Rocket Raccoon and Groot.The movie also did fairly well introducing the characters, such as Star-Lord (primarily), Rocket, Groot, Drax, and Gamora.The Guardians come together unexpectedly, and eventually become a team to save the galaxy from the evil clutches of Ronan the Accuser. With the help of the Nova Corps, the Guardians managed to do so.With amazing acting and CG, the movie was unexpectedly good. This was another great movie in Marvel's Phase Two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A forgettable entry in the Marvel Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although somewhat entertained throughout, I wasn't that impressed by this one. The acting was fine. The soundtrack may not be as good as fans make it out to be but it was still pretty catchy. Also the cgi looked pretty good. However, I felt like the movie was trying way too hard to be funny. Even though it's suppose to be this very funny movie, nobody was laughing at the theater I was in. The comedy was very forced and I felt that it wasn't really necessary half the time. At the beginning of the movie. I thought it was going to be a deep movie but after the first 20 minutes, my hope was gone. It ended up being a misguided action movie. The unmemorable super villain was another misstep. And that's another main flaw in the movie. Character development was minimal and I felt no emotional attachment to half of the main characters. I did enjoy most recent Marvel movies but this was just okay. It was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't do it for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Avengers" of space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Guardians of the Galaxy first appeared in 1969 and in various Marvel comics of the mid-70s, like The Defenders, before appearing as the main attraction in Marvel Premiere in 1976-77. The Guardians are like the Avengers (or Justice League) of space, a superhero team with a revolving door line-up.This popular 2014 film was based on the 2008 version of the team, which includes Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (voice of Bradley Cooper) and Groot (voice of Vin Diesel). The movie details how these characters meet and become the Guardians of the Galaxy as they square off against Ronan (Lee Pace), Nebula (Karen Gillan) and the intimidating Thanos (Josh Brolin). Michael Rooker is also on hand as Yondu, the space redneck who kidnapped Peter Quill (Star-Lord) from earth when he was a boy.I'm only familiar with the 70's team, which included Star-Lord, Gamora and Drax, as well as the villains Thanatos and Ronan. It was fun seeing these characters come to life on the big screen. The movie combines elements of The Avengers, Star Trek and Star Wars and is a thrilling blockbuster that's fun, but probably too goofy at times for people who prefer the dead seriousness of Nolan's Batman trilogy. As far as galaxy-traveling superheroes go, I prefer the more-serious-albeit-still-amusing tone of "Thor" and "Thor 2." Despite that cavil, I liked the way these independent, misfit anti-heroes slowly learn to gel as a team and even care for each other as the story progresses. Their initial selfish goals morph into a noble universal cause. Gamora is my favorite character, followed by Drax, Rocket and Groot. The sinister Thanos -- Jim Starlin's knock-off of Jack Kirby's Darkseid -- is excellently depicted in his brief appearance.The film runs 121 minutes.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like anyone didn't know what to expect. It's made by Marvel, it stars Chris Pratt, and it features a talking raccoon who rides a sentient tree and shoot a gun. We're not exactly here for the plot. Yet, despite the absurdity, the utterly impenetrable miasma of jargon and in-jokes that passes for a plot, the lack of any explanation of anything?all of it, this thing is enjoyable as heck.It's the Totinos Pizza Roll of cinema. I shall explain. Anyone who has lived through college probably knows the phenomena I'm referring to. A pizza roll is garbage. By any practical measure, it's refuse shaped and sold as junk food. There is absolutely nothing you could point to and say is quality. And yet, you crave it. It's amazing.

		<fullReview>All the great reviews of this film, "the best", 4 stars, Robert Downey Jr. proclaims this as the best Marvel movie of all time. I went to this movie knowing from the previews that it was a spoof, yet as the film began it starts with a painfully realistic downer moment. From that point on it seemed that the movie didn't know what direction it wanted to go. The performances were all disjointed and the writing was some of the worst ever, yes, it's a super hero fantasy but even a little logic goes a long way. I seriously wanted to walk out after half an hour. Horrible directing and for all the fuss made about Chris Pratt, he failed to make an impact. The movie came down to too many special effects, green screen and of course, wise cracks and dialog that seemed way out of place, on top of that, the most overrated villain since Loki from "Thor". I will never watch this film again. Been there done that, nothing new for the genre in spite of all the accolades from critics. I must have missed something.</fullReview>

The one thing I was disappointed with was the character and story development, the storyline seemed like it was written as if we already knew the plot and characters, which I suppose some might have, seeing as it was a comic book series before it was a movie. The comedy aspect to this movie was really well written which makes up for the rushed development of the story. This was an interesting movie for marvel to put out, seeing as it was not following Marvels recent theme of super hero movies such as "Iron Man" "Thor" "Captain America" and so on. I Highly recommend seeing this action packed marvel production. Over all it was a very well done movie.</fullReview>

They strongly work on making everything right in the fight for domination of the universe. At times the dialogue is a bit mind numbing but the mix cast of unlikely figures is fun to watch. This marvel comic release comes out with a large amount of fanfare. The set design on the digital platform is beautifully laid out. The raccoon is the ring leader and the brains of the operation. It is a different mix of comic characters. The effects were top notch and have a realistic feel. It is a thrill to see and how the creativity of digital media moves the story along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Galaxy of Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While by no means a "Star Wars for today's generation", Guardians of the Galaxy is extremely fun and entertaining the entire way through. With constant laughs, though some forced, and an incredible cast you are sure to leave with a smile on your face.The plot begins to move when Peter Quill/Star Lord (Chris Pratt), who was taken from Earth as a boy, discovers a mysterious sphere, that he comes to find is called an Infinity Stone, that soon gives him some unwanted attention. A trio of characters attempt to steal the sphere from Star Lord, but after thwarting their efforts they decide to team up and find a buyer for the mysterious object. These new companions: Rocket (Bradley Cooper),a wise-cracking, hyper-intelligent raccoon; Groot (Vin Diesel), some kind of sentient tree alien; and Gamora (Zoe Saldana), an assassin who is the step-daughter of the evil Thanos; find themselves in prison after public brawl where they join up with Drax (Dave Bautista), a warrior who family was killed by Thanos). Together, they make up the Guardians of the Galaxy and seek to keep the Infinity Stone from the clutches of evil.The film never lulls, keeping the audience engaged and excited throughout, and the 70's (from Star Lord's Walkman) music is worked in wonderfully. As good as the movie was, don't expect to see it win any major awards outside of visual effects or sound. The plot is riddled with issues (i.e. an object that can destroy planets is guarder by no security yet it is fairly easy to find, Gamora ship get pulverized but she has no physical injuries, why would anti-gravity stop the prison guards from shooting )and the villain has no depth of character. Of course, the good greatly outweighs the bad, and Guardians of the Galaxy is exactly what it sets out to be; a ton of fun.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and Entertaining Fantasy Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fantasy" is surely the correct term to apply to Guardians of The Galaxy. Those expecting a grounded Marvel Movie, or one that bares any relation to the real world at all, like for example, Spider-Man or Capt. America are likely to be sorely disappointed. I don't think this is a movie for everyone. Indeed, at times it plays like a superannuated Doctor Who adventure.But I liked it, that's for sure! Bold, brassy, with some colossal action sequences - but not frightened to go for dumb laughs and cosmic weirdness on a scale Marvel have not yet approached. It isn't quite as funny as some of the reviews would have you believe - but it is witty and entertaining. I came to care about the characters, which in today's CGI infested modern blockbuster environment, is a refreshing change. And that's in spite of the fact that the film is loaded with special effects, explosions and action sequences of a type I normally loathe.The acting in this movie is spot on, with Chris Pratt an engaging hero, and the CGI Groot is just bloody brilliant. This is a greatly entertaining popcorn movie as long as you don't take it seriously. I don't know much about the comic so I can't compare it. But as a film I'd definitely recommend it as long as you don't want Citizen Kane or Vertigo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Marvel Space Frolic is Loads of Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A ragtag group of rebels are brought together and are forced to overcome their initial mistrust of one another to join forces and save the galaxy from an evil black-helmeted dark lord intent on destroying planets at will. Sound familiar? What if I was to say that one member of the group is a woman; another has a super-being father whose identity is unknown (in the first film in the series at least), while another is a monosyllabic creature who can only be understood by his partner-in-arms. There is sexual chemistry, wisecracks aplenty and spectacular aerial dogfights in deep space as our outnumbered heroes take on the might of the enemy forces. Ring any bells? Yes, of course I am talking about Guardians of the Galaxy, the latest offering from the production behemoth that is Marvel studios. What else could it be? Make no mistake, Guardians of the Galaxy is undeniably indebted to Star Wars, but if you are going to draw inspiration from another source, it might as well be the best. Directed with gusto by James Gunn (Slither, Super), Guardians of the Galaxy is a heck of a lot of fun; full of witty one-liners and pop culture references galore. Chris Pratt is Peter Quill ? or Star Lord as he prefers to be known ? a loner who trawls the universe in search of bounty that can be sold to the highest bidder. When a mysterious orb comes into his possession, he finds himself in the sights of notorious villain Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace), who is under instruction from Thanos (Josh Brolin) to retrieve the orb. Quill teams up with Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Rocket Raccoon and a tall tree-like creature known as Groot in an effort to prevent the orb from falling into the wrong hands. The fact that each of them want the orb for themselves results in double-crosses aplenty before they realise they need to work together if they are to survive. Joined by Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), who has his own beef with Ronan and no interest in the orb, the group endure a series of showdowns that push the CGI action into overdrive.Pratt is great in the lead role, imbuing Quill with the perfect mix of cocky swagger and a vulnerability that lingers from the death of his mother and subsequent abduction into space some 25 years earlier; a Walkman (remember them?) and a mixtape from his mum serving as his security blanket. Both Quill and Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) provide most of the humour through their ongoing efforts at one-upmanship while Saldana, whose sci-fi credentials also include Avatar and two Star Trek films, has seemingly mastered the art of being alien. With only three words to utter as the voice of Groot, Vin Diesel presents what may be his best performance since The Iron Giant. The stellar supporting cast includes the likes of Glenn Close, Benicio Del Toro, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Rooker, Scottish actress Karen Gillan and a subdued John C. Reilly, while Stan Lee makes his obligatory cameo, this time as a lecherous old man.The Marvel universe has never been entirely lacking in comedy, as seen in Iron Man and The Avengers, but there has been an overall sense of seriousness in these films that is, for the most part, absent in Guardians of the Galaxy. Aside from a maudlin pre-credits prologue that explains Quill's ascent into outer space in just a couple of minutes, much of the run time is played for laughs. George Lucas's influence is all over the film, from the cityscapes that very much resemble those of the most recent Star Wars films to the Indiana Jones-style adventures of our heroes. Whilst the film will undoubtedly appeal to a young audience, there are many references ? such as an ongoing riff on Footloose ? that will only connect with older viewers. Unlike, say, Man of Steel, which took itself far too seriously (Russell Crowe's unintentionally hilarious death scene notwithstanding), Guardians of the Galaxy has a playfulness about it that makes it a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Whilst his appointment was perhaps viewed with some skepticism, Gunn has ultimately proved himself capable of handling the expectation and scrutiny that is inevitably attached to any Marvel product. There is nothing deep or philosophical to be found here and it is very easy to enjoy the film for what it is; a fun-filled romp through outer space.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Time But Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy was an entertaining and funny entry into Marvel's Phase 2 of its cinematic universe. It contained some pretty awesome set pieces and some incredible animation, but suffers from a decent villain, jokes that missed, and a predictable plot.Following the story primarily of Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) a.k.a "StarLord," you are introduced into a whole new region of Marvel's world. After stumbling upon an orb, multiple different factions set out after StarLord to retrieve it. Along the way, he encounters four other fugitives that include Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper), and Groot (Vin Diesel). These five characters encompass what is the titular Guardians of the Galaxy. Opposing them is the agent of Thanos, Ronan (Lee Pace) who needs the orb for his master plan. Story-wise, the movie does everything you expect it to do (as with other Marvel movies.) By the halfway point, I could guess the rest of the movie and was mostly accurate. One thing the movie does achieve story- wise though is that for the most part, the movie accomplishes what Marvel's phase one did for the Avengers in just this movie; all the characters get good screen time and are expanded upon to make interesting and unique protagonists.Each "Guardian" of the Galaxy is acted extremely well. Chris Pratt handles the leading role with ease providing sarcasm and emotion. Zoe Saldana as Gamora does a good job showing the pain and conflict in Gamora. Dave Bautista as Drax is one of the pleasant surprises in this film. Being a former WWE member, he does a good job as the very literal brute. Bradley Cooper as Rocket Raccoon is a scene-stealer, playing the hyper-active test subject. He delivers most of this movie's comedic elements as well as its cheesiness. Vin Diesel as Groot does very well for what little he says ("I am Groot".) Finally however, the movie's main villain Ronan (Lee Pace) does his job of being the movie's antagonist but never does he feel menacing; he is functional but that is all.The action scenes are executed awesomely, containing exciting moments as well as a rip-off of a certain Avengers scene. The movie is heavily based on CGI animation with many shots that had my jaw-dropping at how realistic it looked. In my opinion though, Guardians of the Galaxy I believe is overrated. Although the movie overall isn't bad, it is not as incredible as made out to be. Firstly, as stated, the villain. Ronan as opposed to say Loki, from Avengers, a very similar movie, does not compare; Ronan lacks the depth and complexity (as well as the portrayal) for what this movie is being considered to be. Secondly, one of the factions has a stereotypical, over the top leader named Yondu portrayed by Michael Rooker. Admittedly, he did have one cool action scene but as a character alone, he came off as annoying and one-dimensional. Finally, two lesser characters who are Nebula (Karen Gillian) and Korath (Djimon Hounsou), have the same problem as Yondu. While not stereotypical, they're overacted and cringe-worthy when on screen. For this movie to be so praised it would need better supporting performances than what is already in the movie.In conclusion, I enjoyed Guardians of the Galaxy but do not deem it as amazing as many others on IMDb believe.8/10</fullReview>

Hearing mention of the original Footloose and that movie's star, Kevin Bacon, was also awesome!

Even in the most serious moments of the movie Chris Pratt starts being a circus clown, it destroyed the seriousness. The WHOLE universe is about to get destroyed by a power hungry maniac and Chris Pratt just starts dancing. It was funny BUT the audience forgot that a lot of people in the galaxy was about to die!!I get that a lot of people enjoyed the humor and it brought a bigger audience, but i go watch a sci-fi expecting an experience of a movie, and not a comedy sci-fi. I know the trailer gave a clear impression of a humor-packed movie, but i just had to give it a shot since the ratings where sky high. Ignoring the overload of humor in my personal opinion, I think it was an incredible movie but failed me a couple of crucial times. Marvel has made better movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is a Marvel Productions film that is based on the 2008 comic book created by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. I went to see it at the University 16 Cinemas today and I got good but unfortunate results. The cast was perfect for the film and their combat skills are superior. However, I was very disappointed when Vin Diesel was portraying the Tree Man, Groot. I didn't like the fact that he only said one phrase and NOT anything else for the entire film. The sequences were very similar to the 2008 comics, and they were action-packed and also funny. However, I didn't like the sequences where the main characters were fighting and arguing. I just thought that they needed to use teamwork in order to get the job done. As the movie progressed, it went from cheery and vibrant to dark and disturbing. The use of profanity and crude language was absurd. There was some hilarious, entertaining, and cheesy dialogue in the film. The wardrobe and cosmetics were very creative and detailed. When I saw Ronan's appearance, I thought that he looked like Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars. The soundtrack fitted the movie perfectly, and I think the songs were very cheesy like they were from the 1980's and you can download the songs on iTunes. There was excellent use of CGI. Those of you who have heard of or read the 2008 comics, get ready to experience some nostalgia! However, for those who have children under the age of 13, viewer discretion is advised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh God...this movie. Just when I thought nothing could get worse than The Garbage Pail Kids Movie (1987), or be like it, this happened. Also, Disney should give Marvel back to whomever they bought it from. But anyways, what do I think of GotG? Simple: it sucks. There are little redeeming factors in this movie. There are so many problems, I made a list of them right here: 1.The opening of the film is completely pointless. It involves the soon-to-be Star Lord witnessing the death of his mother (who scared me, by the way, no offense), and then the kid randomly gets abducted by aliens. I understand you wanna keep the plot going, but in a PG-13 movie that's meant to be realistic, you need a logical explanation! Also, that whole scene before of him witnessing his mother's death is only referred to again once. It's never mentioned again and it's totally unimportant.2.Why was Star-Lord taken away anyway? Did the aliens wanna probe him? Obviously not, because he's still alive 19 years later. Again, explanation, movie! 3.The characters are very unlovable, except for Groot. Most of the aliens are just people with randomly-selected skin colors or talking animals (Marvel is really running out of ideas). The Garbage Pail Kids Movie could be Citizen Kane (1940) compared to this. Most of the characters are also shameless, self-knockoffs of other Marvel characters (Gamora = She-Hulk, Drax = Hulk).4.I. Hate. Rocket. Where am I supposed to like him? All he ever does really is complain about things and yell at people with no motivation. Normally, I find that funny, but as said before, he has no motivation for it, so it's just mean-spirited. He also is a traitor! He, at first, is cruel to Groot, then Groot dies, then he's upset about it. Oh, so now you care about him? 5.Nothing about this movie is funny. Just nothing at all. See, random dancing, in this movie = not funny! What's the joke? I don't even remember laughing or chuckling once when I saw this movie.6.Howard the Duck's cameo at the end is awful. The 1986 Howard looked a lot better than this, and that's saying a lot.Please do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie- you were warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is the most overrated film I've ever seen. I still can't understand how it has gotten such high votes and positive reviews. Granted it's a good children's movie to take your brother to but I can't understand how full-grown adults overrate this and define it as a masterpiece. There's very little character development and a poor-written plot. The movie tries to get deeper into the main character's personality and psychology by including a walkman uploaded with songs left from his mom from Earth where he was abducted from. But it doesn't make any sense for our character to be attached to these songs and to his mother after all his experience. The walkman-thing just seems like a poor effort to add some depth into the character. So, if you want to see it, see it but my suggestion is take your little brother, cousin, or children with you for at least some of the audience to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anti-Heroes Don't Strike a Chord</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie for one main reason: it was a Marvel production. Marvel has been hitting home run after home run so I figured that this movie would be no different. Well, it was.Guardians of the Galaxy was very foreign to me. Unlike most of Marvel's previous releases, I knew nothing about this comic or its characters. And with comic book movies being so epic nowadays this movie had some hard acts to follow.The Guardians of the Galaxy are five anti-heroes that have been thrown together and are working to a common goal for different reasons. Each member is different in just about every way imaginable, they're not even all the same species. Starlord (Chris Pratt) is a mouthy arrogant human. The name, that he gave himself, says it all. Groot (Vin Diesel) is a tree that can grow its parts at will. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) is Kree (I believe) and has been raised to be a killing machine. Rocket (Bradley Cooper) is a loud mouth raccoon with a penchant for guns. Drax (Dave Bautista) is a muscular something. They were a team in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts because neither of them alone could accomplish much alone. The different characters were not superheroey enough nor intriguing enough for me.That's probably where I feel the movie fell short. I was mildly interested in the characters (Rocket more than the rest) and I was mildly interested in the story. The action and special effects were on par with today's standards, as they should have been, but the rest of the movie was rather flat. Simply put, the movie didn't draw me in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intergalactic Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy, I didn't know what I was watching. As you can tell, I'm not a comic book geek, so I didn't know who the Guardians of the Galaxy were. When Guardians of the Galaxy's reviews were first posted online, I was shocked. I thought that it could be Marvel's first flop. But was I wrong. I convinced my father and a good friend (who wanted to see Hercules) to see it with me. It's hard to say what genre to classify Guardians of the Galaxy, because like it's other Marvel counterparts, it has great action, yet, it has a great sense of wit and humor. Guardians of the Galaxy blends action, adventure, and humor into a great movie. From the beginning, Guardians of the Galaxy has you hooked. Though it's story is cliché, it's characters make up for that. Each of them have their own personality. They're each so different, that they go together perfectly, and the part I see that not many seem to notice, is that they contradict each other. Drax (Dave Bautista), a huge warrior out for vengeance against the main antagonist, contradicts Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a deadly assassin who is was raised by the antagonist. Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper), a "shoot first ask questions later" mercenary bounty hunter raccoon, is truly the star of the show, and he contradicts Groot (Vin Diesel), a peaceful humanoid-like tree. And then there's Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), the leader of the group, who is depicted as (at least according to him) a legendary outlaw, out seek treasure. The beginning of the movie sports a very Raiders of the Lost Ark feeling, with Peter Quill (Star-Lord) landing on the abandoned, rocky planet of Morag, to seek out his share of treasure. Little does he know it will lead him on an inter-galactic adventure across the galaxy. What I really enjoyed was it's connection to Star Wars. It felt similar, yet unique. Star-Lord is reminiscent of the personality of Han Solo yet the role of Luke Skywalker. Rocket Raccoon is a funny, radical Han Solo, and his partner-in-crime, Groot, is a peaceful yet powerful being, who only speaks one line. Sounds like Chewbacca, right? Even it's antagonist, Ronan, reminds you of and overly evil Darth Vader, who serves his master. I'll leave that part for you to find out. It probably won't be the next Star Wars (My favorite movies of all time), but it is a fresh, new, take on the sci-fi genre. It also features tons of '70's and '80's pop culture references, due to that being the time Star-Lord grew up on Earth, such as it's catchy theme song, "Put Down the Feeling". In conclusion, if you were to summarize Guardians of the Galaxy in three words, you could say it's like the Avengers in Space, but it topples the 2012 Blockbuster hit due to its humor, action, and the creation of this magnificent, jaw-dropping galaxy. I would say, that without a doubt, Guardians of the Galaxy has the greatest CGI and computer effects I have ever seen in a film. I thoroughly enjoyed Guardians of the Galaxy, and I can say without a doubt that it is the best Marvel movie that I have seen, and definitely the riskiest, but it all paid off. Guardians of the Galaxy is a great movie, and I recommend everyone who wants a light-hearted space film to go see it. James Gunn (Director) has made it funny and witty, and it doesn't bore you, like a lot of action movies being released now a days *cough* Transformers *cough*.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel does it again !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a plethora of Marvel movies out this year, GOTG is another hit for the Marvel universe. Now, mind you this is coming from a completely unbiased viewer as I had absolutely no idea what GOTG was or about until I saw the film. I went in with absolutely no presumptions or expectations of how the movie would compare to the actual comics/cartoon and I was utterly entertained.So far I am choosing this as a front runner for winning best visual effects for this years Oscars, yes, that's how good the graphics are throughout the film. The movie has more computer generated reality than actual people or places and every bit of it is done spectacularly. Along with the intense visuals, GOTG has its share of well timed humor (just enough, most action/superhero flicks looking for comedic relief tend to go overboard) a subtle romantic angle, and exciting action sequences.The most surprising of the cast was 'Dave Bautista' (he plays 'Drax the Destroyer'); believe me, I had my doubts as will most people, did a phenomenal job who I think will shock everyone at how well he plays the character. 'Groot' and 'Rocket' were perfectly made and voiced; probably the most entertaining/lovable of the ensemble.While in my opinion the cast and the visuals were the strongest points of the film, the only let down was the story; which was very clichéd. A menacing villain and the almost unstoppable hero(s) with the latter coming out on top like always still remains to be the perfect formula.Regardless, this is a MUST SEE FILM !!! p.s 'i am Groot'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adds Humour To Heroism. &#x2666; 73%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Come on now, we all know (and pretend that we don't) that all superhero movies are alike. But we still go and see them and come out of the hall enthralled by the visual effects, stunts, 3D, et cetera. So let me not focus on the story here, but the things that entertained me.To start with, I'm in complete awe with Chris Pratt. His brief dance performance is what kick-starts the films and continues to keep us hooked with his character, the main hero. Next, I found myself laughing and grinning all the way through 2 hours because of the large amounts of humor that this film succeeds in executing. Every single sequence is painted with a comic tint, thanks to Cooper, Bautista and others. I have no reason to blame the cast, nor the production unit.Here in India, there were few cuts that annoyed me but I believe we were spared more than we were in The Wolf of Wall Street.While I thought that the CGI was a tad premature at some parts, the story is narrated quite nicely. The action sequences are not much of a surprise as it showcases the futuristic gadgets and stuff. There aren't any twists that could have saved the second half from being a little itchy.Coming to the best part: the soundtrack. The Pina Colada song never felt so good before and it was also years since I heard that. Right kind of music used at perfect times throughout the film. Vin Diesel's Groot voice needs a pat in the back.Guardians of the Galaxy succeeds in holding the Marvel Cinematic Universe as it conveys few implications here: that tree life is so much more significant than we think. It touches topics like space and gravity and galaxies and science and stuff superficially, although stops right there when it introduces typical superhero formula of an ancient ball that has some celestial power and the heroes and the villains are behind it. Blah blah blah.BOTTOM LINE: A typical superhero film, embezzled with good humor, great music and an unconventional character ensemble. A raccoon plays a superhero, what more do you ask?Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disjointed but Entertaining Space Romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel films have crispness, like a newly opened can of tennis balls. GotG may be its freshest, leaning heavily on Whedon's Avengers to create a cowboy-space opera strongly hearkening "Firefly". The effects are impressive and humor is sidesplitting. Unfortunately, Gunn seems more concerned with being cool than coherent. For all its originality, GotG falls prey to the treaded and dreaded ground of melodrama and over-extended action sequences, made more apparent because of how good it is otherwise. Despite the sloppiness, the positives mostly win out.The plot is extremely convoluted. Essentially there is a mysteriously powerful object that some bad people want, and a band of misfit anti-heroes must keep it from them. Fortunately the actual film experience is better than the story. Whenever our five heroes are together, it's truly magical. Pratt charms by delivering great dialogue, Saldana continues her queendom of scifi franchises (this, Avatar, Star Trek), and Batista is surprisingly hilarious. Most notably, Diesel and Cooper as Groot and Rocket have the kind of comedic chemistry we haven't seen in the Marvel universe yet. The team aspects are a blast, even if they are a bit unbelievably familial.GotG is Marvel's first comedy, full of pop culture references, trope disassembling and a hilariously effective soundtrack. Its comedy is its jewel. However, when it falls into the rote destruction porn ending, indistinct action and short moments of sentimentality, I can't help but wish it would've kept its tongue more firmly in its cheek. Maybe I'm just suffering from blockbuster fatigue. At least GotG offers more than the normal summertime fare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whilst extremely fun, this one has been way over hyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For one to not find Guardians of the Galaxy fun they would have to be some type of Grinch, for James Gunn's loud, colorful and at most times unashamedly odd Marvel movie has an appeal in most areas you look, and despite slight moments of darkness has a mantra for entertainment over seriousness that allows the film to overcome its generic nature that has been strangely overlooked by the public yet is quite prevalent throughout the film.Guardians is going to go down as one of those odd movie cases where one can't help but feel people were far to lavish in their praise for a movie that at its core is built around the tried and true formulas of a rag tag bunch of mismatched antihero's banding together to stop the big bad nasty from destroying the universe. Director Gunn has done a seriously good cover up job of this by instilling an often ingenious and witty script into proceedings that, as mentioned previously, demands fun to be had by an audience member willing to jump in the journey and forget that what they are actually seeing is something that is not entirely as unique as one would think. It's a risky story no doubt thanks to the set of oddball characters at its center and it's a credit to Gunn that he manages to be so successful with the elements at his disposal.Without doubt, one thing that Guardians does better above all else is create a set of space hero's that look to be one of the most memorable and adored set of trouble makers this side the Millennium Falcons crew. Long held back by supporting turns the group is charismatically led by Chris Pratt as Han So?I mean Peter Quill/Star Lord. Pratt is an anchoring presence in the film and excels as expected at his comedic timing and as the wise cracking adventurer, but to say Pratt is alone in the charm stakes would be a lie, as the film also excels at perhaps it's hardest task which was to create a not-only believable but lovable duo in the form of genetically altered raccoon Rocket and his walking tree sidekick Groot. These two creations would've been a consistent worry on Marvel's and Gunn's mind, as getting them wrong would've plagued the picture beyond redemption, but the work of quality CGI creativity and the voice acting of Cooper and the unsung mo-cap work of Vin Diesel is that of the highest order, so much so that the two nigh on run away with the film. To a lesser extent Zoe Saldana and ex-wrestler Dave Butista provide solid, if a little more as-per-usual support as female heroine Gamora and angry man mountain Drax the Destroyer respectively, but no amount of good work by this group can overcome the film's Achilles heel (even while slightly petty for such a fun film) which is a weak overall story arc and even weaker villains.Focused too much on the 5 Guardians, there was arguably a lack of similar effort in the creation of the film's big bad Ronan the Accuser and actor Lee Pace, who feel like an afterthought in a tale that needed to amount to more in order to be worthy of the now ardent praise poured on it by audiences and many critics. It's not to say Pace is bad, but Ronan is severely undercooked and a culmination of his efforts in a far from satisfactory final act leave a diminished mark on a movie that should've prided itself on going for the unpredictable or for going all out. One feels that it all ends with a whimper and not with a bang, despite a late saving-grace effort by our favorite tree and a dancing hero.Without question, Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun, enjoyable ride that sadly lacks certain thrills and sense of adventure due to a story that didn't develop around the characters that come into a life of their own. It was a risk by Marvel (this feels a lot more edgy than your average Marvel piece, sexual innuendo included) to even commission this material to the big screen and it's a risk that has worked (especially in a financial sense), and Gunn seems like the perfect fit as director. Both however need to significantly step up their game in the story stakes next time, and aim for not only fun but a more original and unpredictable story to go along with its unique and now much loved character set. I am Groot indeed.3 and a half never dying Walkman's out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of CGI and Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the same night his mother dies a young boy named "Peter Quill" (Chris Pratt) is abducted by an alien UFO. Several years later he becomes a thief working for an alien by the name of "Yondu Udonta" (Michael Rooker). However, when he steals a valuable piece of merchandise known as an "infinity stone" that Yondu had his sights set on he soon finds that he has a price put on his head. But bounty hunters aren't the only ones looking for him as a savage warlord also wants the infinity stone and sends a beautiful assassin named "Gamora" (Zoe Saldana) to bring it to him. Anyway, rather than reveal any more of the movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that fans of CGI and action will probably love this particular picture as it has lots of both. Unfortunately, other than perhaps the presence of the afore-mentioned Michael Rooker and Zoe Saldana, I honestly didn't consider this movie to be as good as the marketing and hype surrounding it. The humor wasn't that sharp, the overall plot was rather predictable and neither the CGI nor the action managed to maintain my interest that much. Accordingly, I rate it as slightly below average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I have lived most of my like surrounded by my enemies, I will be grateful to die among my friends." Peter Quill (Pratt) is a space scavenger who has just found an artifact that is being sought by some very dangerous men. Immediately after taking it he is captured and is thrown together with an evil mercenary Gamora (Saldana), a brute bent on revenge, a fast talking raccoon, and a tree. When the true nature of the artifact is found out the group must find a way to work together to save a planet. First off I have to start by saying once again that I am not a big fan of comic book movies. I didn't see this in the theatre but the only thing I have heard since then is how great this was. Every single person that saw this told me how good it was. I head the "best superhero movie ever" over and over so the expectations were a little higher than normal for this. I don't know if it was the expectations or that I am tired of comic book movies but I was disappointed in this and wasn't all that impressed. I thought the best part was the soundtrack and the raccoon. This is a movie that is almost critic proof since it seems that any super hero movie makes a billion dollars so really nothing I say will change anyone's mind but I have to say I wasn't amazed by this like everyone else was. Overall, I'm sure I am one of the only ones to say this but I didn't really like this. I give it a B-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's like a Tarantino version of Star Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, when I say Guardians of the Galaxy is like a Quinton Tarantino directed Star Wars, some might think I mean its bloody and violent. It's not. It has action in it sure but nothing that doesn't fit nicely in a PG-13 film, acceptable for family viewing in the living room. What I mean is that Guardians of the Galaxy has the kind of space adventure vibe you would expect from Star Wars, with lots of action and roguish characters; but what makes the movie special is that it has an appreciation for the nostalgic, loads of pop culture references, and an offbeat sense of humor. The song 'Hooked on a Feeling' was featured in the first trailer as well as a scene in the movie. It is also in the Tarantino directed 'Reservoir Dogs' (one of my favorite movies of all time). The connection to Tarantino was instant in my mind. The whole movies sound track is like this, with memorable scenes made better with memorable 70's songs played over them. Just like a Tarantino film. Nostalgia is a core component of Peter Quills character in the film and it's prevalent throughout the movie but the movies style itself is also reminiscent of a 70's sci-fi film right down to the opening credits sequence. On a side note, I've noticed recently that most blockbuster movies won't have credits at the beginning of the film; in order to get the audience into the story more quickly. I've also noticed that they won't even put up a title card till the movie is over. Which is wired 'cause I already know what the movie is called so why show it at the end of the movie. But I digress.... Guardians of the Galaxy not only has a title card at the beginning of the film, with a full credit sequence, but it puts up the title card with a good bit of fanfare. Not to mention the title sequence is now one of my favorite opening sequences in movies.Guardians of the Galaxy is not just a Space Adventure it's a Space Adventure/Comedy. When you walk out of the theater you will have probably laughed more times than you would have from most comedy movies. In the middle of tense action scenes or moving character moments little comedy bits are slipped in...also like a Tarantino movie. The way it treats comedy gives the film a unique tone, which is kind of like when guys never want to show their true feelings, so they try to turn everything into a joke. That's what this whole movie is and I love it. It not only reflects the main characters overall attitude and motivation, but lets you know the film has a heart, without ever getting overly melodramatic.The only thing that kind of got in the way of me enjoying the film was the overall plot did get a bit confusing and convoluted. The conflict was there but at no time did I really care how it turned out. This is really only a minor complaint though since the real heart of the movie is the characters themselves. While I didn't care what happened to that one planet, that I can't remember its name; I did care about what happened to the central characters Peter Quill a.k.a Starlord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper), Groot (Vin Diesel), and Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista). The movie not only did an excellent job of introducing the characters but making me care about them. The movie did such a good job with these characters, much of it due to good actors, that by the end of the movie I just wanted to hang out these guys. I can't wait to see them all again in the already announced sequel.I AM GROOT!SPOILERS! SPOILERS! SPOILERS! SPOILERS!The final scene that shows after the credits however shows kind of a famous character from the 80 's?Howard the Duck. The movie theater I was in had a guy in the back yelling at the screen "Howard the Duck?! We waited all that time for that?!" I kind of understand how he feels despite my annoyance at his outburst. 'Howard the Duck' was a terrible George Lucas movie made in the 80's based on a Marvel Comics property. It's hardly something to be excited about especially if it is a hint at future appearances from this crude character. I found it funny though and perfectly fitting with the overall tone of the film. When you go to see a Marvel movie you know there is going to be an end credits scene and since this is the last movie before Avengers: Age of Ultron, it's only reasonable that audiences were expecting a tease about that movie. Especial since the last end credits scene before the first Avengers movie was an actual trailer for the Avengers. The movie punk-ed us just like Peter Quill would do. It took a serious moment of anticipation and made a joke about an old 80's reference. Just like Kevin Bacon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happens when Marvel pulls out five relatively unknown characters of its own, who have a terrible chemistry with each other, and decides to make a movie out of the mess?The result is surprisingly good.Guardians of the Galaxy starts out as an unholy alliance of five unlikely companions: a space rogue (Indiana Jones + Han Solo much?), a righteous assassin, an annoying tech-whiz raccoon, a humanoid tree, and a thespian prisoner on a vendetta, all of whom pursue their own more or less selfish goals. Without revealing much, they are joined together by the mysterious Orb, a crucial device for the plot.The movie is packed with chaotic and continuous action. No slow sections mid-movie, no meaningless pieces of dialog. Everything is so well- knitted in its weirdness that I'm beginning to consider the whole even greater than immediately after the show. It's fascinating to follow how the different personas co-operate despite their differences, and the leading actors thrive in their roles, doing amazing work! In addition, for an action movie, the plot has some very touching moments during which I had to fight not to shed some manly tears in the theater.The space is beautiful, and so is this movie. One breathtaking vista after another, visual orgasms will be guaranteed.When looking for flaws on purpose, the biggest con throughout the movie might be the overuse of the jokes and one-liners, some good, some not. However, they are a part of the spirit of the work. Furthermore, I'm sure that the 1970's soundtrack will divide opinions. I'm not particularly fond of it, on the one hand, the songs felt dime a dozen and alien as I didn't grow up with them nor knew them save one, why not use some other tracks? Either the movie was targeted to people over 30, or the authors wanted to use their favorite songs. Oh, one last thing! Did the Dark Aster really have to be so ridiculously gigantic?There's a squirrel with a big gun. He's the sole thing I remember about the flick's poster, and later he turned out to be a genetically enhanced raccoon. Anyways, he gave me the impression that this was going to be a tongue-in-cheek version of the Avengers, which was partially true. Massively superior, Guardians of the Galaxy is an idiosyncratic masterpiece amongst the blockbuster movies of Hollywood.All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy turns out to be unexpectedly funny and warm adventure that has all the rights for its cliffhanger ending and oh, we will be waiting for that sequel!Rating: 4,5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well if the universe has the corner stone of idiots this is it. Guardians of the galaxy comprised of five dolts who come together in the face of total annihilation from what is known as the Infinifty stone. A relic of ancient past where its properties are made up of the building blocks that created the universe itself. It could be used to create or to destroy. Between planets is a man named Quill who at a younger age was abducted from earth by an alien trash race lead by Yondu Udonta (Micheal Rooker) after his mother died from severe cancer.Some fifteen years later he becomes a relic hunter and not always by legal means. During his last trek to an abandoned planet he comes across this stone housed in an orb but is confronted by a league of trackers lead by Korath (Djimon Hounsou) who works for Ronan (Lee Pace). Ronan is by no means a nice guy. In fact he only wants the stone for revenge against another race who used the stones power to alter the natural means of creation but was destroyed in doing so. Taking ronan's people with them he vowed revenge at any cost.Now with quill's group is Drax (Dave Bautista) Gamora (Zoe Saldana) Groot (Voiced By Vin Diesel) and last is the over emotional Rocket (Bradley Cooper) who looks like a raccoon. Together they put aside their differences... that is to stop trying to kill each other and put an end to ronan from destroying the entire universe in the process. In many ways this movie holds a great deal of emotions from beginning to end. Passionate, anger, betrayal, the kind of self centred pessimism one looks for in another in order to get their point across no matter the cost.It is a big universe where many alien life forms dwell including Quill's own father who had kept his identity a secret from his family. Quill only learnt his entire being is half Terran, and half earth. Knowing this he decides to change over a new leaf to become a guardian with his new found friends and try to get along without throwing a fit. I had a great time watching this with the new characters, new action, and wonderful retro music that just somehow fit to quill's character. What I also found interesting is seeing how the other half lives out there in the deepest parts of space. Come to think of it they are not all that dissimilar from anyone else.Each has a family, dreams, goals, even opportunities which presents themselves evil or not. I give it ten stars for originality, music, special effects, and wonderful actors including an Oscar winner Benicio Del Toro who plays the pawn master that appraises the stone's value. Guardians of the galaxy is much better than Galaxy Quest for its story line, and optimistic characters. You couldn't take your eyes off of any alien in this film it is that well made. Highly recommended to all ages above 14. Excellent addition to the summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So Guardians of the Galaxy is finally out and how is it?....it matches every expectation you had about it. Essentially, it is an absurdly fun, cheesy, old-fashioned space adventure with a superhero edge. For those of you who didn't know, the Guardians are pretty much the polar opposite of the Avengers - they're loud, brash, free-spirited, and most of all.....human....or as human as you can be being 4 aliens and 1 human. Unlike the Avengers, they don't play nice when it comes to saving the galaxy.This movie has so much going for it that you can't really explain it in one paragraph but all you need to know is that the humour is great, the action is non-stop, the drama is riveting and genuinely heartwarming, the soundtrack rocks and unlike most superhero teams - everyone of the guardians are 100% awesome in their own way.I won't spoil the plot for you but i will say that what makes Guardians work so well is that it has a genuinely good-natured, back to basics, rock n' roll approach that has swagger and style aplenty. Despite their late entry into the Marvel franchise, rest assured that the guardians are here stay and will be defending a galaxy near you soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We believe in MARVEL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all had a pretty good idea on what this movies was going to deliver we had seen its trailer. The only question was how? Also there was a question if they are risking too much by suddenly introducing an all new MARVEL film, amidst of The Avengers franchise that was going on well. We also had our doubts if they are making things too complicated by connecting it to The Avengers in the future. Well, Guardians of the Galaxy manages to stick to your seats and keep faith in Marvel. Again.As the name suggests, this story is all about Galaxy and so many planets that you find it difficult to remember (Earth reference coming very rarely). As seen in the earlier reference of Thor the Dark World post credit scene, this movie is about one of those collectible objects(The Orb) that the collector is collecting. The fight for this leads to the meeting of Gamora (Saldana) and Peter Quill (Pratt) whom are joined by the bounty hunters Rocket (Bradley Cooper voicing one of the hilarious character of 2014) and Groot (Diesel). Then the story becomes more complicated with more people (or should I say Aliens?) wanting The Orb and their evil intentions. Drax The Destroyer (Bautista) joins the party and the all time quarrelling enemies become friends and call themselves of Guardians of the Galaxy. About the story I don't have to reveal many details here because there are so many other aspects in the movie which not only keep you on your toes but also has you in splits. A movie which is mostly dependent on CGI and green screen as there is hardly any part shot on earth has a tough ask on its hands to balance its main plot and also not confuse the audience with too many characters and planets/galaxies or any similar objects like that. At the beginning I thought things were getting a bit out of hand, but James Gunn manages to keep the humor afloat so that you don't complicate things too much. The characters are really well written and I think this movies going to be career changing feat for most of the actors. Chris Pratt looks like everyman's hero by playing quirky character as Peter Quill. Zoe Saldana is as sexier in green as she was in blue (Avatar). Though the Bradley Cooper's voice as Rocket is bit digitally modified it's one of the most intimidating character that you will ever see and more than half of the humor in the film is this character's contribution. Also, I salute the CGI team for bringing so many emotions into the Rocket character. You feel it's almost next to you. Vin Diesel as Groot doesn't have much to speak but the character is written very well. The surprise for me was Dave Bautista as Drax, I didn't expect much from him due to his WWE background, but he has performed equally well in both comic and emotional scenes. I expected more form Benicio Del Torro as Tanveer Tivan the collector but he has a little role here. There are other interesting characters played by Lee Pace (the main antagonist), John C Reilly, Karen Gillan and Glenn Close add to the strength of the cast. Creating a franchise movie with new characters and not so famous stars as protagonists is a challenging task. James Gunn has handled it really well. He doesn't bore the audience and also makes them feel involved as if the characters are already 2 or 3 movies old. A very special mention to the CGI and the Visual Effects team and also to every guy/girl who has made technical contribution to this movie. This movie is completely dependent on it. Yes, there will be a sequel and before ending this I quote Peter Quill from the movie, "You said it, b*tch. We're the Guardians of the Galaxy".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your original Marvel experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me the summary title is a good thing... I went to this movie with my brother (The comic book fan) as a non-comic book fan, thinking this will be another CGI-Bor-Fest, just like captain what's-his-face or the last iron man. Thankfully I was wrong within the first ten minutes, when the movie went from space-craft action straight into comedic fun, which set a precedence for intrigue-ness throughout the movie. It seemed to have this balance throughout the film, which I felt kind of related to other comic related movies like kick-ass. Just when you thought "the movie couldn't be funny during this scene", it goes and surprises you with a drunken escapade between the main cast. I Really do recommend to all stereotypes and especially those who sit on the fence with all marvel movies as I feel this may have broken the mould.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadly, that is pretty much the limit. There are a lot of explosions, weapon effects, chase scenes and so.There is a plot, but it really gets muddled, because they introduce groups like the Cree, Nova Corps and so on, but you don't really know why they are or why they are.If you were a reader of the comic, I suppose you might find this a better film. But I could see Batman without reading ONE of the books and follow it. Ditto for Iron Man, Captain America, etc.This film doesn't really define was a Ravager is, was or why I should care about them at all.It has A LOT of special effects, so if that is what you want, you'll love the film. If you want a story and characters you care about, this is the wrong film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost on par with the Avengers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Gunn is the guy to keep an eye on. His work on Super was already pretty good, but what he did with Guardians of the Galaxy was amazing. Sure it's not a Shakespearean drama, but still, he found the sweet spot between visual effects, action, humor, drama and capturing the source material. For me it was a highly entertaining movie that's almost on par with the Avengers. If they had made the transition between rag tag team to a united group a bit better and they had found a way to avoid the usual cheesiness then I would have given it a 10 and called it genius and the best Marvel movie yet. For now it's a close 2nd. The best part of it was that it didn't take itself too seriously, used an unconventional music score and went down the comedy road where Pratt, Coopers voice and Groots animation really excelled. Also kudos to James for getting quite a few of his usual actors into the movie - especially Nathan Fillion, his brother Sean, Rooker, Seth Green (Kevin Bacon wasn't far away either) - the cameos they had were quite enjoyable. Bottom line: if you liked previous Marvel movies then the chance is high that you're going to love this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words cannot explain the thoughts I have on this movie. Unlike the new X-Men, I think the more you think about it, the more you like it, although both movies were equally good. Guardians has a good humor vibe throughout the movie with a compelling plot and an ultimately brilliant outcome of a movie. I may even see it again! I have read the comics before the movie was thought of and let me tell you, it was very true to the characters, and let me say, I had doubts about Vin Diesel's talent between Groot's small role in speech, but now I don't think anybody else could have matched how well he performed. Marvel can surely be at the top of greatness at the moment with it's movies, however I highly doubt that and I cannot wait for the next installment of superhero action brought to us by Marvel. Roll on Josh Brolin and his take on Thanos!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most fascinating, fun and exciting movie I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning for spoiler guys.I've never heard of this title before, neither read the comics and I was clueless about this when I watched the trailer. It looked like just some sort of space wars battling out like galaga and it was nothing special to me, until I went to the cinema and watched it. And after 2 hrs, I left the place totally mind blown and laughing and giggling with their lines, especially with "I am Groot" which I kept repeating with my nephew. Such fun times!The movie immediately caught my attention with it's opening. It was very emotional, really made me focus on the connection of the first character, and then just after the abduction here comes the most amazing intro of Marvel that is the most coolest intro in all of MCU movies. It moves towards Peter Quill now dancing and singing and it was like that moment is so fun that if I had this movie on DVD, I'd watch that dance a hundred times together with that song of Red Bone! The following scenarios would be epic and I must say the scene in the prison where they all met together is the best place for them to meet. It felt so cool that all 5 of them would work together on a similar cause despite them having different principles and perspective on their own.From then on everything was just interesting and fun. It never subsides and all of the characters were fun, emotional, interesting and enjoyable to watch. The plot and story is so amazingly cool to hook me up and there was no boring part, all pure action, laugh, awesomeness and touching scenes. Rocket, Groot and Drax are the most fun characters in the movie, especially Groot and Peter Quill winning the funniest acts that made the whole audience in that place laughed for like 15 seconds straight and clapped their hands in pure majestic resounding loudness.Rocket and Groot are one amazing tandem. I never recognized Bradley Cooper's voice actually. Their lines were epic and it digs deep into my mind. This movie is the only movie to establish and rig those movie lines inside my mind without forgetting them. They've kept on repeating inside my mind like I just won the lottery with magic numbers. The CGI of these 2 characters is flawless and just fit the mood of the whole movie.Peter Quill, Gamora and Drax really brought it up to top notch with their insane acting skills. Chris Pratt nailed the character and I felt that amusement again when I first watched Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He's now a movie blockbuster superstar I guarantee it, together with Zoe and Dave. Dave being one of the most funniest wrestler turned actor I've ever seen. He hooked the audiences with his line that "Nothing goes over his head", epic, just Epic.From start to finish this movie grabbed my butt rock steady on my seat with amusement and amazement. Definitely the best movie of Marvel in par with Avengers. Congratulations to the new stars of this movie, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel and to the wonderful works of Director James Gunn and company, thank you for this memorable and amazing movie of the decade!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun family film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As could possibly be expected, fighting over earth was always going to become a little repetitive so now the galaxy needs to be defended, or guarded as it were by a ragtag collection of miss-fits called simply enough the Guardians of the Galaxy.These guardians are a collection of lost souls led by earthling Peter Quill (although he prefers the more swashbuckling moniker, Star-Lord); the green skinned and highly dangerous Gamora; a vengeance fueled warrior Drax with his blue muscular body adorned in red tattoo's, a psychotic yet industrious raccoon called Rocket and his side-kick the walking tree named Groot. They are brought together by accident and happenstance to save a planet (not earth, surprisingly) from the villain of the piece, Ronan the Accuser.The story is part Star War, part Raiders of the Lost Ark which I would prefer to consider an homage while some are suggesting a blatant rip off (although the Guardians in comic book form actually predate Lucas and Spielberg's respective films). What happens? Well in a nutshell, Quill finds an item Ronan needs. The hero is compelled to work with Gamora, Drax, Rocket &amp; Groot to get out of trouble and before you know it we have a team with the best parts of each malcontent brought to the fore.As far as performance is concerned who were my favourite characters? Groot and Rocket Raccoon, the animated characters voiced by Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper respectively. Some would say Mr Diesel had the simpler challenge as his walking tree didn't say a lot, in fact hardly anything. But he conveyed his emotions using only a few words which made for a truly intriguing and amusing character. Bradley Cooper continues to go from strength to strength in every role he inhabits on the screen and again here he was as lively and interesting as he was in American Hustle or Silver Linings Playbook.Former WWE wrestler Dave Bautista acted about as well as anyone you would expect with that kind of background but his character is meant to be a moron so he's believable. Zoe Saldana as the assassin Gamora was competent as both a fighter and the romantic interest. The term "coloured actress" is never more accurate then when describing Ms Saldana given her (blue) role in Avatar and (green) in this film. Surely she would be begging her agent to find her a role in a black &amp; white film so she can avoid arriving at the make-up trailer before sunrise? The lead and hero of the film is the "Ravager" Peter Quill (or Star-Lord) played by Chris Pratt of Parks &amp; Recreation fame. I was surprised to see Pratt in the role as he has always seemed more of a side-kick or comic relief kind of actor. In Parks &amp; Recreation he plays a no-hoper but I suppose he did it pretty well if I assumed he was just that? According to his bio, Chris worked out and dieted for 6 months to lose nearly 30 kilos for this role which left him with 6 pack abs and the ability to flog his exercise regimen on late night TV for the rest of his life... but I digress. In this role he was okay. Perhaps they specifically wanted someone a little rough around the edges or basically unknown? Who knows what Matt Damon or Johnny Depp could have done with this character? Alright they probably would have done it better but Chris tried hard.Overall the acting (from the human characters) was okay but could have been better. I actually blame the director &amp; writer James Gunn as it felt for at least half the film the actors were compelled to deliver lines with Shakespearean passion and it wasn't until the second half of the feature that they were allowed to loosen up. Special mention should go to Michael Rooker, Glenn Close and John C Reilly. The veterans played their small roles comfortably and with a charm the lead players weren't afforded.If I have a major complaint it's with the villains. Ronan the main baddie for this effort and his superior Thanos (presumably the bad guy for the sequel) are so dreadfully one dimensional that it's impossible to understand why they would have any supporters. Why would their battalions of soldiers fight for them? Just to defeat people they didn't know? To destroy planets and ruin the lives of anyone who comes near them? Sure it's why people join the US Republican Party or the NRA but this is a fantasy realm. It's completely impossible to imagine the bad guys being anything than exactly that so as soon as we were introduced to the evil doers the result of the film was obvious. If there was a saving grace for the bad guy team it was Nebula (played by former Dr Who side-kick Karen Gillan) who as the half-sister to Gamora gave us the only evil character we could imagine changing sides and having any empathy.The Guardians of the Galaxy is a quirky picture with plenty for everyone. There's plenty of colour and movement with loud bangs and explosions for the younger generations along with a few good laughs for the rest of us. Was it motion picture history? No. Does it stack up against the great Sc-Fi or adventure films? Not really but myself, my wife and two teenage daughters happily repeated our favourite moments on the way home from the cinema so we certainly got our monies worth from an action film that didn't take itself too seriously and will more than likely do it again when the sequel hits our screens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hands down the worst movie in the MCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh dear, where to even begin. This movie was so bad and the score that it currently has so ridiculous, that it made me register on IMDb after 6 years of lurking.Superhero movies. Movies aimed at man-children, children, and nerds. You could call me the latter, superhero movies being my filthiest sin.But what's worse than a superhero movie? A superhero movie dressed up in failing comedy, that's what. There were so many awkward and embarrassing moments in this movie that I just stopped watching altogether around the 1 hour mark, and skipped in 20 minute intervals forward. And guess what? Didn't miss a single thing in regards to the so called plot. It was that predictable.The acting was the worst I've ever seen in a superhero movie, even worse than the Transformers. Yeah. CGI up the cloaca in everything, I swear this movie spent 95% of it's production time on green blankets. Pacing was off, the main antagonist was an awful, overacting big mussel guy. The forced romance was bad, as always in superhero movies.I bet most of you watched this because you were promised Thanos. Guess what? He didn't do jack stercus in this piece of dirt. I guess you'll have to wait for Age of Ultron, although if you've gotten the hint so far, you won't see Thanos doing anything there either.Only people who rate this above 5/10 are Marvel shills, man-children who have never delved deeper into cinema than what Hollywood spouts out few times in a summer, and small children aged 12 to 18.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generally funny and entertaining, helping it get over the occasional more serious hump</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of articles have been written about just how many comic-book hero movies there are in the market and planned for the coming years; they talk about viewer fatigue and market saturation and other such terms. They perhaps have a point but it is hard to really pay it much mind when the genre produces films which are fun and entertaining. With its massive success and the fact that it comes with association to already successful franchises, Guardians of the Galaxy perhaps looks like an easy film, but I do wonder how much people were taking a risk when they greenlit a sci-fi film based on an pretty much unknown comic book series, with a lot of things that could potentially have been really silly; seeing Howard the Duck in here is also a reminder of how something that is quite cool in theory can fail to connect to the audience. What makes it work though is that it is really light fun, easy to get lost in because you are laughing or smiling for the majority of it. It is at its best when the main characters are allowed to do their thing, with the best laughs coming from the banter between them (who would have thought that wrestler Bautista would have such great comic timing). The silliness is kept at bay by how tightly funny it is; it is sharp, daft, cool and engaging. The actors do well, with Pratt being charming fun, Saldana being more than just a figure, Cooper having a lot of presence with his voice, Bautista getting lots of laughs with his straight delivery, while Vin Diesel (who must have wondering if they were making fun of him with this casting) produces one of the most lovable characters with only a few lines of dialogue.While the cast have good timing, it should also be said that the film does too ? for example cutting away briefly during an action sequence for one line to get a good laugh. The film unfortunately is not quite as strong when it has more serious or narrative driven moments. The opening of the film is a good example of this, but it is just as relevant during more intense moments or serious 'franchise' moments, because it still needs to be a film. The mix just about works, and the laughs, fun and cool silliness carry it across moments where it has none of this.It is not a work of art, and it is not as remarkable or brilliant as some would have you believe, but it is still very entertaining. In a genre filled with action-packed but overly serious films, or films that are just silly in a bad way, it is quite refreshing to be able to watch such a film, laugh all the way through it and come out having enjoyed it a lot for how well it balances, judges and delivers the humor consistently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very excited to see this movie. I love sci-fi and super hero movies and considering the glut of them out there, this one was sure to top them all. The good thing is that this movie does not require you to know anything about the back story, the characters, or even what the heck you're getting into other than it's a sci-fi super hero fantasy world. It reminded me of a Firefly meets Indiana Jones combination.The problem I ran into is that it was quite formulaic, quite a bit predictable and overall tried a bit too hard to be funny at times. I'm a big sci-fi geek and am able to suspend disbelief for the sake of entertainment but the character makeup made them look, well, made up, like I was watching a play as opposed to a feature film. Maybe the fidelity of films are getting so high that it's difficult to mask the makeup, but it just seemed like too much of a distraction to me.In no way am I saying this movie is bad. It's very good. Just not great. Maybe if I was fan of the characters I would have enjoyed it more, but overall I couldn't see it as the smash hit 10/10 everyone is giving it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy- Simply MarvellousYes it is a movie of cosmic proportions, an inter-planetary fantasy of epic scale. Yes it has a team of underdogs taking down a Goliath. Yes it has a talking raccoon and a tree as main characters. But what makes Guardians of the Galaxy the best Marvel movie of all times is the fact that it is the closest embodiment of the Marvel comic book ethos- full of wit and charm, spunk and fun, and of course, action.Sample this- somewhere in the universe, in a desolate planet with incessant water fountains, where a once proud culture reigned. A masked man lands in a spaceship, and charts out a path through the devastated surroundings. At one point, he puts on a Walkman, switches on Redbone's "Come and Get Your Love" and breaks into an impromptu jig. He is in some mood. On his way he encounters small dinosaur like creatures that he either footballs them or treats them as microphones, karoakaying his way and leaping across mortal dangers to steal an Infinity gem, as the credits start to roll. Marvel fans would be aware that the stone is one of the most powerful objects in the universe. This effortless boogey sets the tone for the movie- an irreverent take on universe shattering events.Unlike the Avengers, since the characters are all new, but even more bizarre, they do need a round of formal introductions-"Star-Lord, man, legendary outlaw. Forget it" - Peter QuillPlayed in zany style by Chris Pratt, Peter Quill was kidnapped from earth when he was a child by a gang of bounty hunters. Today he is a galaxy trotting thief and space scavenger who likes to call himself Star-Lord. Tremendously attached to his mother's music, Quill is a Romeo who has survived in this cutthroat profession so far solely because of his improvising skills."I am a warrior, an assassin. I don't dance" - GomoraActed by Zoe Saldana (this time in a shade of green), Gomora is an adopted daughter of Thanos, surgically enhanced into a killing weapon. Gomora is exactly what she says, but learn to dance, she does, courtesy Star-Lord."Nothing goes over my head! My reflexes are too fast, i would catch it"- Drax, the DestroyerPlayed by WWE star Dave Bautista, Drax is a naive to the point of stupidity, suicidal, tattooed mountain of a brute with a love for knifes matched only by his thirst for violence. He specifically seeks revenge on Thanos and Ronan, who he holds responsible for the death of his family. "Ain't no thing like me, except me"- Rocket RaccoonCouldn't be more true. Rocket is like no other thing. Motion captured and voiced in scene stealing style by Bradley Cooper, Rocket is a genetically altered, cybernetic-ally enhanced raccoon with a thing for sarcasm. Happiest when with a big gun and Groot by his side, he is also a master tactician and the technical whiz kid in the team."I am Groot" - GrootPerhaps the most emotive role ever essayed by Vin Diesel- Groot is an ever growing humanoid plant whose vocabulary is limited to three words. Serves as the muscle for Raccoon with whom he has kind of a telepathic connection.Also in the mix are even zanier characters- Xondu (Michael Rooker), the bounty hunter that trained Quill and was later double crossed by him, carries an arrow that would have changed the course of the Mahabharata battle, the super-villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) who we will see more of in future Marvel productions, Lee Pace as the fearsome, maniacal Ronan the Accuser- a Kree warlord with blind hatred for Xandarians, and Benicio Del Toro as The Collector- an ancient alien. "We are all standing, a bunch of idiots standing in a circle" The Guardians are an anonymous, friendless lot. They have all been scorned and have suffered loss. Till they come together as a team to defend the planet of Xandar and its 12 billion people against Ronan, they have never known a family. The movie is a VFX extravaganza with superlatively detailed action sequences, but at the same time director James Gunn draws effectively from established scifi franchises such as Star Trek and Star Wars to create an emotional and expressive tale, while at the same time endowing it with oodles of self deprecating humor. The script is a belly full of laughs, the soundtrack is as it claims- awesome, and the acting by all, though caricatured, is top class. The end product is a an amazingly imaginative, visually stunning, frothy, lively, light hearted "save the universe" romp that wows with its dazzling visual style and at the same time keeps tickling your funny bone. Cannot recommend enough- 11/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a moment in Guardians of the Galaxy when Rocket, the film's talking raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), is accused of faking his laugh; coincidentally, there were quite a few people in the cinema I went to who I could have hurled the same accusation at. Yes, GOTG features a couple of genuinely funny moments, but it also has more than its fair share of gags that fall flat and certainly do not warrant the kind of belly laughs that I could hear (probably coming from deluded Marvel fan-boys).However, even with its frequently-less-than-hilarious comedic moments, this big-budget dollop of sci-fi comic book silliness still manages to be quite a lot of mindless popcorn fun, delivering enough weird and wonderful characters, fantastic worlds, spectacular action set-pieces and impressive special effects wizardry to guarantee a reasonably fun time. Director James Gunn's eclectic and vibrant universe is brimming with such imagination and visual splendour, all accompanied by a poptastic '70s/'80s soundtrack, that the film proves a treat for the senses despite its obvious shortcomings elsewhere.</fullReview>

The characters are a tad snide and make a few quips but other than that this movie is EXTREMELY middle-of-the- road.The only lead character with any screen presence was the big wrestler guy. As for the lead, if that dude walked by me on the street I totally would not recognize him. No star power here. No screen presence. Zoe Saldana is starting to get typecast as "space babe." She should take another kind of role soon. Bradley Cooper's character was downright annoying. An angry little animated character is not new or groundbreaking.We don't even get a dynamic bad guy! People, everyone knows that if you want your movie to be kick-ass you have to make your bad guy dynamic, weirdly sexy...or at the very least, British (this is known as The Alan Rickman Principle). This bad guy was just some weird blue dude who apparently drooled a lot while eating black licorice and forgot to wipe his mouth off. This movie is a giant ho-hum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I was between 5-15yrs old I think I would've enjoyed this a lot more. I just didn't get any 'Marvel' as the film progressed; seemed more Disney or Pixar - like a kids film with a bit of violence thrown in to Marvel it up a bit. The fact that it was long and drawn out, did not enhance it. I think it should've stayed a comic. Also, was there any point in having Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket? This did nothing for Brad. Good actor but he's better known for his looks/acting rather than voice, which you do need for CGI - otherwise there's no point. Same with Vin Diesel, no point in him just grunting - anyone can do that. Poor film all round. I gave it a 6 at first but as I write, I realise how bad it was... Advice: watch if under 18. If you're expecting a straight up Marvel movie, forget it.</fullReview>

Still, i managed to make it over half way through, far longer than i'd normally stick with a superhero movie, hence the 5. I have to say more, OK.. good casting. bang on trend with the 80s music references. which actually were pretty original for the genre. but not itself a classic. 'I am Groot' is probably hilarious if you're 14, but it's harmless enough who can hate it? it's hard to write much for a movie like this sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy (a delightful mash between the Star Wars prequels and the Mass Effect game series) managed to actually be non-generic in the sea of mediocrity that Marvel keeps churning out. A very welcome reminder that some comic book movies can still be charming and funny. For that alone I was willing to forgive its flaws. Zany, colourful, and full of humour and heart, I rewatched it on a plane having lost much of my will to live after the excruciatingly moralistic A Most Violent Year. Suffice to say, it kept me going.When Hollywood decides to get a huge multi-million dollar space opera going, I bet Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel and Chris Pratt pre-2014 weren't high on their list. But I could not imagine this movie without any one of the five leads. Chris Pratt infuses Star Lord with such a delightful quirkiness that he's completely irresistible. I never find myself rooting for the main male lead in ensemble teams like this, but Quill is just so darn fun to watch. When he's not hurling one liners at his teammates, he's jamming to probably the catchiest darn soundtrack of all time (more on that later). I hated Saldana's fake green makeup, but she's a great actress and a terrific foil especially for Pratt. They have unbelievable chemistry, which I hope they continue to tease and resist Bonesing the Brennan/Donnaing the Josh/Becketting the Castle (you know, when they put people with great chemistry together and then you get bored of it?)Dave Bautista is not a great actor, but Gunn knew that and used him well. There's one or two moments where I thought Bautista killed it with comedic timing, and his confrontation with Ronin was actually very well done. Gunn directs the hell out of Bautista, who hurls himself at Ronin in rage and grief and is completely outclassed. Its a really well done sequence, because I could feel Drax's frustration. Cooper and Diesel do great voice work for their characters. Lee Pace is a serviceable villain - once again his makeup is pretty stupid, but I thought his speaking voice fit the part really well and he is a commanding presence on screen. Michael Rooker I've loved ever since first hearing his voice on COD Black Ops 2, and he stole every scene he was in.One thing that really irritated me was the film completely wasting John C. Reilly, Benicio del Toro, Djimoun Hounsou and Glenn Close. Between the four of them, they have EIGHT Oscar NOMINATIONS and in Guardians of the Galaxy, probably about eight minutes of combined screen time. Glenn Close is one of the finest actresses of all time, and she is stuck in a nothing role that could've gone to literally anyone. By locking her into this stupid role, she now has no other potential place in the MCU. What a disgrace.Guardians is visually dazzling, with the regions of Xandar and No Where created superbly. I was really torn on the makeup - I hated the full body pink/green that they gave to some aliens, but the body transformations of Bautista and del Toro alone made the Academy Award nomination worthy. The entire ride is heaps of fun, directed beautifully by Gunn (he captures some really emotional scenes very well, and the action set pieces are even better). And the soundtrack. That soundtrack.I needed to vent about some minor issues because they were so stupid that they took me out of the movie. - We open on a scene straight out of Terms of Endearment, with Peter unable to say goodbye to his dying mother. I loved this scene, and it was really well directed, right up until the SUDDENLY ALIENS ending. Seriously, what was that? They couldn't think of a better way to do it? I know both aspects of that were necessary, but the scene was so awkward. - I also take major issue with Peter's light ball somehow becoming capable of vaporising two enemy soldiers. Seriously. Its his light source, and by breaking it he obliterates them like the Nuke in Terminator 2 did to the world. If its capable of that, why are you carrying it around to flippantly! WHY DIDN'T ANYONE ELSE THINK THIS WAS STUPID? - Guardians takes major liberty with the whole vaccum of space fact. At several points, Peter and others are exposed to the vaccum of space, and by holding their breath they survive. Yeah, no.But hey, who cares. Guardians is charming as hell. If I had been a Sim watching baby Groot dance at the end of the movie, I would have gained three happiness points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like a lot of other people, I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. To say it exceeded my expectations would be an understatement. It's a clever and fresh gem in the stable of Marvel films. One of the best they've put out so far. The script is full of funny lines but it's also got lots of good character stuff with earned emotional moments. The action and effects are nice. The cast is great, including those just doing voices. Chris Pratt does a wonderful job blending the comic relief with the superhero. The soundtrack of old pop songs is terrific and integrated into the plot perfectly. The homages to Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and more are fun. Which is the simplest and best word to describe this movie: fun. You'll have a blast watching it.</fullReview>

I will not say anything ,and won't recommend any friends to see it. In my impression&#xff0c;MARVEL is a VERY GOOD Movie Maker and always surprised me. But THIS, and THOR 1/2,There are very serious logical problems to Make you feel vulgar.There are tons of good movie on IMDb top list(for kids). IF you think this is MARVEL presents.

		<fullReview>To start with the good points the effects and battles are quite visually spectacular. The out of place humor is funny now and then. But the characters aren't familiar so the don't end up really engaging the viewer. Can't feel for them. The first part of the movie was confusing figuring out who is fighting who for what. It all felt a bit pointless and silly after a while.Zoe Saldana looks pretty slim. Chris Pratt the ordinary guy isn't charismatic enough to lead a movie. Just cause he shed a few pounds doesn't mean he's suddenly watchable. The silly creatures are tiresome after a while.I don't think this one is that great despite all the hype and high production values. If you just forget about story and sit back and watch the visuals it's okay but it doesn't deserve any follow up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is mostly just a video game without the controller. There wasn't enough of the story to explain who the characters were. It just jumps right in. The scenes and dialogue happen very fast. The villain was yet another classic villain who only does things because he's the bad guy, and he likes dark places and wears spooky clothing, because he's evil. There is another villain who shows up in the movie who is presented as being badder than the main villain, but then never shows up again. This made no sense. The characters Rocket and Groot added a little humor here and there as well as the other main characters, but that's pretty much what all of the movie was. There was no real sense of danger, because at every twist and turn, the heroes would solve it within five minutes or whatever. Even very, very, very big spaceships with giant laser beams approaching a planet felt like no danger because it always seemed that the heroes could handle it. This is the problem with most action movies nowadays. Every thing in it is made to be EPIC and amazing. Movie viewers all around the world are constantly being shown movies with things that are specifically made to be EPIC and amazing that incredible CGI and other special effects begin to seem mediocre and they get used to it. So much that nothing seems to amaze anyone anymore, because every action movie is made in that way. There's no more Star Wars kind of effects on audiences where they are thrilled by something new and creative. This movie is mostly just a big show to dazzle spectators with special effects, that you have to look very carefully to find any good storytelling in the film. There has to be a balance between good story telling and good CGI in a film like this. But instead, this film is nothing but constant CGI explosions and cheesy one-liners that we begin to forget what the story is or why things are happening. However, the plot was extremely simple. The villain had no sense of having a specific reason why he wanted to rule the galaxy. All the characters are introduced too fast that we don't get used to them or relate to them. The movie is like watching a video game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy 92I came into the theater not knowing all too much about this movie, just knowing it was Marvel. I came out amazed. This movie was a great revival for this years blockbusters, redefining the Marvel Universe once again. It was fun, hilarious, witty, action-packed, and had great, classic rock music. Gunn knew that Marvel needed a reboot of originality, colorfulness, and artistry of filmmaking and the fact that it wasn't to be taken too serious. The way the cinematographer and James captured every single color of the landscape, and the characters; it was just spectacular. It was a great story, filled with colorful, complex characters, and great art/set direction. Music was also perfect for this film; bringing in old classics everyone knows, or doesn't, and setting up the fun atmosphere. Chris Pratt was perfect for the role, with his wit and personality he brought in. I'm hoping to see much more of these characters and colorful storytelling in the next Marvel films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much money, so little meat...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes I do not get the ratings at all on the site. This film was. without a doubt, the most overrated film I have ever seen, and that is saying a lot since I have been an avid film watcher for 60 years.I am used to comic based films as being somewhat thin on the depth of plot, lack of character development (I suppose one is expected to be a comic reader to fill in the gaps...I am not), and filled with a plenitude of special effects to wow the audience, taking their attention away from the actual film not being that good. That said, at least a newbie to the story line of the comic book being portrayed can get some minimal entertainment from the film genre. This film did not even provide that.I was embarrassed for the actors who apparently knew only two degrees of acting: recite the lines with no emotional involvement or overact every single line from the simplest to the more emotionally complex (of which there were few). It was painful for me to see the art so debased.The dialog itself was sophomoric and clichéd, requiring only a third grade education to comprehend. The film editing subtracted more than it added to the film. While there was much action in the film, the editing jumped too quickly between different shots of the action to get anything more than a vague sense that something was happening, with no real sense of the specifics of the action.All in all, at $170,000,000, Marvel could and should have done something to engage more than a superficial response in their audience , which began and ended with opening their wallets to pay to see this $170,000,000 travesty. I gave it 2 stars only because of the film's budget and took away 8 because it proves that spending that kind of money still cannot create a film with any redeeming social or intellectual value whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easy on the eye, but boring affair.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewing a comic book adaptation always is a tricky affair. With the rise of comic book movies over the past 10 years or so we've seen a genre appear that without exception almost always spawns overrated movies. I am sure this review will receive a lot of flak for not praising this movie as much as others do.I'm not a comic book fan. Never read any of them but some of the movies are good popcorn entertainment or just good movies (X-Men series or the Dark Knight movies even though those too are slightly overrated). Being disappointed by Marvel movies most of the time I still decided to give GotG a shot. Reason being: I love sci-fi and having a cinema subscription meant free entry, so why not?Let's start with the good stuff. First and foremost are the looks. GotG simply looks great. It's been a while since we've seen a sci-fi galaxy that looks as if people actually live here. It's surely not D9 or Elysium kind of worn looks, but it does look grimy and filthy nonetheless. As far as characters go the main villain has a good screen presence most of the movie and Rocket and Groot (basically a Space-Ent from LotR) are nice characters. There also is a certain 'lightness' in the story that I think most people will enjoy. Let me just put it this way: GotG takes more than one cue from the original Star Wars movie, spices it up with some space-Indiana Jones, Mass Effect and sci-fantasy Thor looks and that works most of the time.Where it doesn't work is a thing most Marvel movies go wrong: character development, the main villain, and CGI. We are supposed to care about this ragtag group of outlaws, but over the course of the movie they never really have a believable character development. Take the Gamora for instance (who I thought was just space-Wicked Witch). She's introduced as a bad guy...and the next second she's on screen she's suddenly betraying people and being good. Completely out of nowhere. Then there is the main character's nemesis/space daddy: Space-Merle. Who basically is just a blue version of Walking Dead's Merle...who we are to somewhat care about for story's sake but nothing he does makes a connection with the audience. These guys hate each other but over the course of 2 days they're suddenly 'best friends' who want die for each other. That would've been all fine and dandy if there was any character development. Since there is none this plot point is just too predictable in a bad way. Just like romance or certain characters being in danger/possibly dying is both predictable from the start and hollow due to no character development. Now, you might ask yourself "why is he calling him Space-Merle and the other characters Space- Wicked Witch etc?". Well: point 2 of things Marvel movies keep failing at: throwing around weird names all the time from minute 1. This universe hasn't been set up yet in cinemas but we're supposed to know exactly what everybody is taking about. Way too much unconnected info if you're not into the comics themselves. Onto the main villain. Quite a few recent Marvel movies have had a recurring problem. Being: a main villain that looks cool but packs no punch whatsoever. Thor 2 had such a hollow villain for instance, and GotG has one as well. Thanos is just a cameo that is somehow connected to the main villain, Super-Sith-guy, but how and why is barely mentioned. He's a religious zealot, bound on destroying a civilization. Problem is: we never see him destroy anything. Why should we be scared? Besides: for a galaxy that looks lived in and worn, it sure does a poor job of actually being alive. Characters on screen are just there to be killed and all look alike. An even worse thing is the fact that this 'great civilization' that needs to be saved is just one big city we only see from 2 perspectives (market square and from the sky). There is no connection for us viewers to that city. Why should we care if it gets destroyed?Lastly: while the CGI is great there are moments where you get the archetypical side character being a CGI creation and sticking out from the actual people a bit too much. Happens to most movies, so no big deal. But the whole reliance on CGI results in a lack of tension. There is no real fire. Actors just duck before a green screen. Explosions are not real. There is no sense of danger. Expendables 3 was hurt by too much CGI and this movie (and movies like the Avengers) as well. CGI means the craziest things can and do happen on screen, but because it is fake and we know it, it all feels so incredibly hollow. Add in some stupid things like surviving in space without a pressure suit/helmet and an Orb that is pretty random in who it destroys and I was unfortunately disappointed by what I saw. There are some fun moments. There are some funny jokes. The music is pretty decent, has a nice contrast to the universe it takes place in (the same kind of contrast chanting monks had in Halo) but its not my cup of tea. The entire experience was just hollow and shallow. How this has a 8.4 is something I just don't understand. I've seen a review on these boards saying this was this generation's Star Wars. I'm not saying this movie is bad. I thought it was really boring but I see the appeal for others. But the praise it receives, being compared to Star Wars, is nothing more than a confirmation of my earlier mention of this being overrated. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is so overrated, I said my peace, and don't care what other people say. There are no strong performances by any of the cast. Why was Bradley cooper in this movie. Plot was the worst of any marvel movie to date, including Daredevil. Okay that was mean it was better than Daredevil. But i think the worst thing about this movie is how so many people are willing to sacrifice themselves proving how good this was. lines and lines of hate rants to people who are just voicing their opinion. Not everyone has to like it. Also it is worth noting that the villain in this film Ronan was very cartoonist and generic. nothing against Marvel in this point, James Gunn has a history of this with his movies like Slither, and super. Not a bad director, but has a lot of development to experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really excited from seeing the review score on here, and all the hype I had heard from other people via social media. I eagerly pressed play. The initial opening scene was quite intense and moving, and I was quite taken aback by how that went. I wondered if this level of intensity would set the bar for character development throughout the film and I was immediately grasped. My illusions were soon dashed as the film fast forwards to when the boy is "grown up" and is stealing an item. He is most definitely not grown up, and a complete idiot. I guess this bit is meant to appeal to 6 yr olds? It is almost as bad as trump jokes. I cringed.I let it slide and hoped for better. It got exciting when the chase scene was happening. Then they went to prison, then they broke out, and then they tried to sell the item. That pretty much summarises the whole film. The main protagonist is a buffoon, who swears a few times for good measure (kids watch this film...), the only character that seemed to develop was Draxx as he reflects on his poor choices. The bad guy isn't even scary - he doesn't do that much. Compare the bad guy to Loki and the difference is infinite.No character development apart from a 1 minute scene with Draxx. The annoying Rocket character that had zero impact, a non entity villain, a weak weak weak plot line and the dialogue was so flimsy. In fact, most of the characters flip flopped around in reasons to do things that didn't really make logical sense. The only saving graces were the planet scenery and make up. I hesitate to say the cinematography as it was CGI. The worst bit (out of many) was where the Racoon decided he wanted a man's prosthetic limb to escape the prison, and then sniggered about how he wanted to see the guy hop about - I actually found this really offensive and don't want my children to think that is a) funny and b) OK. The best bit was the soundtrack. Overall a very disappointing, disjointed film. It felt as jarring as Star Trek: Into Darkness coupled with Star Wars "Jar Jar Binks" and a smidge of the Goonies (but nowhere near as good!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not terrible, but extremely overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can understand why so many people watched this film since it is a big budget Marvel film. But I really don't understand why everyone thinks this was so great. The plot lacked complexity; the whole plot seemed to be about a few freaks teaming up for almost no reason and then fighting the much stronger villain. The characters were pretty bland and boring, well, except maybe Rocket. I usually like Marvel movies but I was quite disappointed by this one. On a more positive note, the there were some pretty funny moments, and some pretty great special effects. Acting was decent. Overall, this movie is definitely not as good as other superhero films such as The Dark Knight or The Avengers, but sure as heck is not as terrible as Howard the Duck or Catwoman. If they do make a sequel, I hope it improves on the mistakes of this film. I would only recommend this to true Marvel fans, but if you are a more casual audience, I honestly can't recommend it to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lukewarm and formulaic - but funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have had a few days to ponder the film "Guardians of the Galaxy", and what makes it so popular is probably its greatest sin; the film is too cautious and accessible. Now that being said, one should never expect a subversive, though-provoking film for the $170M price tag that Guardians had. However, the film was constructed to please as wide an audience as possible. What that means for the audience is that cinema lovers will be disappointed as it fails to offer anything fresh or new, marvel purists will be disappointed because the film fails to capture the comic effectively, and general audiences will be disappointed because they were served up another, formulaic, apologetic film, with too many uninteresting villains, nonsensical plot points to hit the buttons needed (do we really need to know WHY WHEN and HOW they are called the Guardians of the Galaxy) side characters and cameos that are completely unnecessary other than to say "Hey! John C Reilly is in this!" and 80s music included for no particular reason other than to please the nostalgia of those that grew up with this music (after all, thats all comic book films are, nostalgia). Ultimately the film suffers from the fact that most audience members do not know these characters. That isn't a bad thing. We don't need this film to be the first act only. That being said, the film is worth a watch. The writing was clever and quite funny during multiples scenes so that even the most critical viewer can't help but chuckle. Will you laugh? Yes. Will you be entertained? Yes. Will you remember this film one year from now? That remains to be seen, but the staying power of this film is very low.Because of the above reasons i give the film a 6/10 rating. I would recommend seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvelous Recognition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the least known comic books of Marvel. The only reason why the whole world, aside of the fans of the source material, are going to see this because it's a Marvel production, but we should all admit that apart from the comic geek world, nobody knew who Rocket Racoon and Groot were before the film was announced, nobody heard of Starlord before Chris Pratt was attached to the project, and most people hardly knew what it is actually about. While many are still seeking for a Doctor Strange or an Ant-Man movie, we should first get to know something that haven't got enough attention before. And wondrously, these filmmakers introduce this mythology with huge love not only to its own, but also to the fantasy/adventure genre and its old classic form, which easily delivers the sheer fun. But even in the realm of explosions and zany worlds, the best parts of the journey ended up being the scenes with the characters interacting and often to engage a set of great humor and drama. That is already too much to ask for a ridiculously fun blockbuster.It is certainly a space adventure, it already offers a lot of strange alien designs and intergalactic action, but the big stuff aren't the only highlight of the movie. The film would mostly focus on its characters, nearly all of them may be aliens, but their pathos and personalities are down-to-earth. How the team was formed is the same way how The Avengers did. They aren't nice to each other, but they had to get along so they may save the world... or galaxy. But here their motivations are either for revenge or money instead of heroic pride. How they introduced themselves may be a little too over explained through their conversations. The exposition is so relied on the dialogue, but what keeps it from being exhausting is when those talks lead to a naturally clever punchline. The film is just best when the heroes are developing their sudden friendship, turning themselves from cold hearted thugs into a likable band of misfits. The film also has a big love for the seventies music, and it smartly uses it for Peter Quill's last earthly thing he'll ever possess in his otherworldly life.These parts with the characters make the action the secondary appeal of the film, but that doesn't always mean it's a bad thing. This is basically going back to the past blockbusters when rooting for the characters was more important than trying to advance the technical/style abilities. But then, it doesn't have any problem with the action, except sometimes the space battles can be hard to follow but again whenever there's a humor in it, the consistency goes back on track. It's simple fun, sometimes nostalgic piece of adventure that doesn't have to be over-serious to be outright compelling, but it also does have some drama, while it doesn't entirely embraces its sadness, it at least gives some hints behind the characters and manifests the heart and brutality of their backstories eventually. The actors are excellent indeed as they give plenty of shining and charismatic personalities to their awesome characters.The plot may not be too sharp or its villains may not be so memorable, but Guardians of the Galaxy still reaches its goal of lovingly introduces its universe to the ones who've never heard of it. Since everyone is aware that superhero movies are made for the mass more than its fans (let's have to be honest about this), this idea may not always be taken seriously, especially when comic book movies have gone to its dark and gritty era and yet this one offers us stuff like a talking tree and a gunslinging raccoon, but here it is: Guardians of the Galaxy, the movie that isn't meant to exist ending up being one of the greatest films that Marvel ever produced since Iron Man. Is it a bold choice for them? Probably, but it's really not hard having self-awareness. The triumph of the film is reliving the classic, somewhat campy space opera and marking its characters as its real deal, even when they are not as familiar as many of Marvel's heroes. In the end, it's just pure fun, the flaws are there but at some point it doesn't matter. Every moment of the film has the excitement and laugh that anyone would seek for a blockbuster, taking place in a fascinating new world that we are yet to fully explore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Familiar Yet Refreshing Experience! Witty and Intelligent, Maybe Marve's Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Guardians of the Galaxy' is not just another sci-fi movie, it's refreshing, enjoyable and giddy, and probably the best of its genre among summer blockbusters this year. The writers of this movie are witty enough to make sure that its cliché-sounding plot won't be as tiring as it rings the audience ears.The movie follows a band of misfits who are assembled to fight for the galaxy and save it from the hands of evil warlords aiming to take total control of the cosmos.While it follows a familiar and maybe tiring tale, a plethora of explosive elements made this movie a refreshing and enjoyable experience. Its biggest advantage lays on its comic tone, thanks to Chris Pratt's smashing take on Peter Quill, he's obviously one of the central elements of this movie. He is joined by equally interesting, and mostly funny, Groot (Vin Diesel), Gamora (Zaldana), Drax (Batista) and Rocket (Cooper) and some other stand out supports, in their thrilling adventure for universal domination. This one proves to provide endless humor, but it has heartwrenching tales to tell too, most of which relatable. There may be an over-stuffing of visuals and that tends to drown the humor and drama but overall, 'Guardians of the Galaxy', is undoubtedly one of the biggest movie event of the year, a pleasurable fun vaunting a stellar ensemble of casts, head-bopping and insanely good soundtracks and a surfeit of reminiscent anthems from the past decades. This might be the best Marvel hero movie to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's most absurd to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I thought this movie was one of the most overrated movies of 2014. All you hear is how "perfect" it is, and how it's "Marvel's best." If what you desire is a mediocre, silly science fiction film, this is well-worth your money. While this movie may have heart, and great special effects, it is simply not enough to compensate for it's unnatural, forced comedic script, and it's "Look how unique I am" aura. The story alone would only suffice as decent at best. Yes, it is extremely unique in the realm of Marvel production, but Marvel was never geared toward humor as it was geared toward compelling adventure and dramatic turmoil. Nearly every joke in this movie only distracts the audience from a potentially praise- worthy quality. Frankly, this film is too silly to take seriously. Its only redeeming factors are its special effects and it's undeniably aberrant features. This is simply not Marvel's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average with few funny moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy as I had to see for myself what the big fuss about this movie was. I'm not a comic book fan and do not have any background idea about the characters before, however super hero movies are one of my favorite genres to watch. Let's start with the positives: - Chris Pratt was amazing in the lead role: charismatic, funny, and a joy to watch. - Amazing music and soundtrack during and after the film. - Good CGI Now for the negatives: - Not much of a story and zero character development. You have the feeling that the characters just want to be friends and they come off as needy. - Too much action is happening all around that it becomes a mess, similar to the transformers movies. - The villain Ronan is so boring and predictable. They need a great villain like Loki from Thor. - Drax and Gamora are disappointments in the film. They don't seem like a big deal and Drax sends most of the time getting his ass kicked instead of being a destroyer.Overall I give the movie a 6 over 10. Don't expect too much and just enjoy the ride. It's watchable but definitely not as good as the reviews you will see on this site.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just..... a good time throughout, how movies should be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of this movie, I was kind of "might be alright". Then as it gathered momentum, and the first trailer came out, i'm thinking "hey, this might just be pretty good." It was the latter.And it was the latter and then some.I'm not going to go into the story, kind of pointless, i'll just detail what I did or didn't like.There's just something about this movie, where it just all worked. The VFX as we have come to expect are excellent. Groot and especially Rocket Raccoon look great.The acting is great from everyone, including, Dave Bautista, who underplays the character of Drax, and in all honesty, he nearly competes with Rocket for some of the funniest scenes and lines.And the humour is great throughout. Its not an out and out comedy, but it knows when to pick its comedy moments.The storyline has hints of stuff we've seen before, but it just did it all in such a compelling way that you never stopped to dwell on it too much.It almost harked back to the 1980's where movies then were a little more mad and virtually any concept stood a chance of getting greenlit.What about the theme music? I have no recollection of it at all, because the use of classic music from the 70's and 80's really did feature that heavily and worked so well, that I couldn't even pretend to know what the theme tune would be.My seven year old son loved it, the missus loved it, even the step daughter who is 'too cool' for this kind of thing, she liked it as well.Just about everything was right about this movie, when a character can get away with saying one line throughout, and it works, you know that Marvel and James Gunn have worked hard to not just have this movie ride on the coat tails of the name Marvel and previous efforts.I like Thor, Captain America and Iron Man..... but I have to admit, I'm keener on seeing where Guardians of the Galaxy goes over all three of those characters.Whilst its a comic book movie, they ain't super heroes, and the movie whilst being a part of the Marvel universe, does its own thing, and just works because of it.Only criticism I had is that the sound mix wasn't quite right sometimes, and some characters vocals were drowned out. Now this might simply have been an issue for the theatre I was in, but a couple of times I had to lip read, I couldn't hear what they were saying otherwise.Great stuff, hugely entertaining, and can't believe the time went by so quickly.Worth the wait</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailer looked incredibly stupid but I went anyway for the positive reviews. For the duration I couldn't shake the fact that everything I was seeing I had already seen many times before and that this film had nothing new to offer. GOTG lacks an ounce of anything it can call its own and so succeeds almost purely on sentimentality for the 80s (from which it took most of the scenes). Mid showing I walked out to make a phone call. I almost walked back in to finish the film but decided that nothing in the second half could justify the lack of story, character, wit, or creativity that the first half utterly lacked. Fortunately I saw it alone so I didn't have to deal with the social pressure to stay. If you see this, then I would recommend the early matinée discount.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid This Movie For Real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man oh Man, this movie was terrible, how this got an 8.6 is beyond me, and in fact that's what I went based off of and luckily never really go to movies now days because of all the crappy movies Hollywood pumps out.There is nothing to this movie, I went with a friend and I literally kept falling asleep every now and then looking at my watch hoping it will be over. Its just an empty movie, all action with no story nothing, just some shooting here and there and stupid jokes.All recent movies like this including the new Amazing Spiderman 2 are just terrible movies with nothing to them, Hollywood is just a cash cow now and this is why I refuse to pay for movies in theatres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wanted to see this... Only to discover a "B" movie with a big budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, don't blow up if you disagree with this review, but I was rather disappointed in "Guardians of the Galaxy". Like, I would guess everyone of you, I was very much looking forward to see this movie.However, within mere minutes, this film felt like a "B" movie with an "A" level budget (search all of the "B" Sci-Fi and Fantasy films that were released in the 70's and 80's!). The only difference was the money that was clearly put into this movie (the dialog, while many, I'm sure, had a good laugh, was cheesy to me, with pop culture reference jokes that just don't belong in a Fantasy film!).During the course of the movie, I kept being reminded of the "Star Wars" films -- and not the latter three! Yes, much of the film seemed to borrow from "A Phantom Menace" and "Attack of the Cones". But, worse, over and over, I was getting deja vu of... wait for it... "Flash Gordon"! Yes, a great, but very much "B" movie, from the 80's, that, thanks to the recent hit, "Ted", made a return to our pop culture radar. The final battle, didn't make me chuckle, but groan with it's similarity to the final battle in "Flash Gordon." If you loved this movie, great. Everyone has their own tastes. I'm just warning those who haven't viewed "Guardians of the Galaxy", and are considering going to see it because of all the money it's made. Wait until it comes out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrepentant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Version I saw: UK cinema release (2D)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 8/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 9/10Overall: 7/10My key word to describe Guardians of the Galaxy is 'unrepentant'. It is what it is, and it stands proud of that, refusing to change to suit anyone's tastes. The genius of the film is that it convinces us to agree.British comics writer Dan Abnett revived the 1960s superhero team in 2008, imbuing it with the spirit of comics legend Jack Kirby, but also giving it a distinctly British edge. In American comedies, the characters are fundamentally friends, but the Guardians are more like those in a British sitcom: they hate each other, but are tied together by circumstances.The setting is that of a pretty silly, far-fetched space opera of the kind that might have existed in the 60s and 70s, but it is brought right up to date by several factors. The most obvious is the look: the most modern CGI is used, bringing two of the main stars - Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel's voice) - to life in a way that would not have been practical even 5 years ago. The settings and backgrounds are also massively enhanced by computer technology.While I am on the subject, it's worth pointing out that the film is as full of stars in the celebrity sense as astrological bodies. Cooper and Chris Pratt (as 'Star Lord' Peter Quill) have shown that they can headline major movies, while Diesel and Zoe Saldana can do the same for medium-sized ones. Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, Michael Rooker, Benicio Del Toro, Karen Gillan, Lee Pace... The list goes on.Something so massive in scale can become humourless, but that is never a risk with GotG. The film is so packed with humour that I would class it as at least partly comedy by genre, and this neatly punctures any sense of pompousness, roundly mocking every character even while enjoying their antics.The music is key. I never would have thought I could like these cheesy 60s and 70s pop tunes, but they are well chosen and inserted perfectly into the narrative - and even the plot - with great skill. In fact, one is part of the scene which I think is the thematic heart of the film. In a brief down-time, Star Lord tries to explain to Gamora (Saldana) why his music is so great, but she only understands when he just plays it to her. The message is the same for the film: "If we explain it, you won't get it. Just watch it, and you'll realize it's awesome." And I did.The message goes further, when applied to yourself: accept who you are, don't compromise or change for anyone, and people will eventually 'get' you. It's a wonderful sentiment, and very laudable, if a little convenient for fanboy nerds like me, who are presumably the core target audience. Maybe they were actually addressing themselves, and their shallow Hollywood colleagues; I don't know.Before its release, GotG was predicted by some to be Marvel's first big cinematic flop, but its joy, exuberance, wit and sheer self-confidence have made it, for many, the MCU's absolute highlight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Quill is a thief working in the big galaxy, after he had been abducted from the earth when he was a kid. But he will steal something that will set the galaxy in danger. First and foremost, I must say that Zoe Saldana knows her aliens. After blockbuster Avatar and other successful movies like Star Trek she takes upon yet again another alien role in Guardians of the Galaxy and of course it works. Cris Pratt is really good as Peter, not too serious and not too heroic that works along with the other comic figures. Couldn't help but feel that Peter had some Star Trek resemblance, but other than that, the movie follows the star wars sci fi model only with the major final battle action scene. The humor and the odd music work here to set the film of the beaten track and create a hit that most possibly, as the credits in the end suggested, will have a sequel. So 6 out of 10 for this unconventional Marvel movie. Plus, its always nice to see Stan Lee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly enjoyable even to those who never heard of them!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many others, I was very surprised by how good this movie was. I would consider myself a fervent comic book fan, but this series has eluded me until the announcement of the movie came out. That's when I looked up a little on them, but not enough consider myself a fan of this series. This movie was watched with an open mind, but some assumptions of this being another Ghost Rider. I can't say how much I was glad to be wrong about a film. The movie has plenty of action, sad touchy moments and tons of humor the Guardians franchise is known for. I don't recall any slow moments in the movie. Some themes in this are kind of cliché, like the whole "anti-hero that only cares about himself suddenly finds a heart to care about others and saves the day." This is be expected to some extent as it is a comic book movie, though it's not to terribly in-your-face as some others are. One of the most impressive aspect about this movie was its CGI. The different worlds explored are absolutely visually stunning. The acting and character development was much better than expected. Many of the actors seem to fit their roles quite well. The movie opens kind of mopey, with Peter Quill as a child visiting his mother in her final moments. The movie quickly picks up after this with Peter as what seems to be a treasure-hunter type mercenary delving into a temple, easily avoiding traps and creatures Indiana Jones style while rocking out to the beats of the 80s. This piece of treasure unknowingly starts him on action filled adventure that will change the course of history for several planets.After a bounty gets placed on his head, Peter and all his would-be captures are captured and placed in prison. There's a scene where Rocket gives the group a list of items he'll need to help everyone escape. He gives Quill the task of obtaining a prosthetic leg from one of the inmates. As they all gathered in mid-breakout, Peter asks him what part the leg will play, only to receive the answer "none, I just thought it'd be funny to see you try to get that guys leg." This part had my rolling!The ending was a little predictable, but still enjoyable none the less. Despite some of the generic concepts, cliché characters and predictable moments, this is one of the few films that I would love to go back to watch a second or third time. The action is almost non-stop, the humor has the audience cracking up several times, and the special effects would even give Michael Bay a hard-on. To sum it best, the film is just that enjoyable!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Are Groot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By this time, we all know the kind of phenomenon this 'little' super(?)hero Marvel movie from the maker of 'Super' and 'Slither' has become. I confess, I was hoping for this, but was surprised at the reception. The nerds can also win!!!Kevin Feige is a wizard. He started doing unorthodox stuff by first bringing Downey Jr. to be Iron Man. he got Jon Favreau to direct it. Joss Whedon for 'The Avengers'. The guys who made 'Community' for 'Captain America'. By far, this may have been his riskiest move, since James 'Slither' Gunn has never been known for anything other than cult, a fact proved by 'Super' as well (one of my fav movies, btw). This guy is a phenomenal talent scout.In an ensemble, including the Whedon movies, each character has an arc, a beat, and a moment to call their own. In this one, the revelation is everyone coming together, and working as one single unit. Don't get your hopes all the way up though - plot-wise, this ain't no masterpiece, since there IS a central Mcguffin again, and everyone wants it, which other things are going on in parallel around the (hic) Galaxy. The end-of-title-sequence has such a high WTF quotient that it needs to be seen for you to believe what the f was just filmed, and on whom (Gross? Heh-heh).By far, my favorite movie this summer, and this has been a summer of greats for sure. I won't list them here, but boy, what a tiring summer! And what a way to ensure things go out - an astronomical bang that this one gives. The perfect way to go would be to watch this on IMAX 3D, though I have not been as fortunate. I'd urge everyone, given your access, to spend that premium on IMAX fare.I'm not done watching this one - I'm sure I'll see it at least twice or 3 times more before it completes its run, and am keeping my fingers crossed for one of those times to be on IMAX. Let us see.The first time I can say that I truly enjoyed watching someone from the WWF have a role, and make it his own. Dave Bautista, to be fair, with enormous support from the creative team on this, does such a bang-up job sometimes that he almost steals away the movie in each/every frame that he's in. Watch him try and rationalize something crucial that his character does, while attempting to 'get' metaphors. Zoe Saldana gets her metaphorical moment as well, and neither appears corny or as a callback, while there was a chance of that happening in lesser hands. Kevin Bacon and Footloose get some fantastic callbacks as well, along with some great 70s and 80s music.This is the most fun I've had at the movies in a long, long time now, and that's such a good thing now that I'm worried for all the ones that come later. Someone needs to do a thesis on how to re-invent mainstream blockbuster fare the way Marvel under Feige have done. Chris Pratt proves all his stupid detractors completely wrong, by 'owning' his moniker of 'Star-Lord' (watch out for that scene which reveals the back-story behind that - I confess not being prepped for that one). It's still puzzling how mature (so-called) critics end up reacting to a character rather than the actor, and I do hope they all hang their heads in something close to shame when they catch this performance. But then, they still might be reacting to the character once again.What's left to say of Rocket Raccoon? Amazing CGI on both Raccoon and Groot, but that's not all. he's as real as embodied by both Cooper and Diesel. You know they love each other, you know what they're capable of, and you simply adore them both. Each and every scene they both are in, singly or together, is a complete hoot, and playing to the galleries, this is how mass heroes should call back to their capabilities.One of the best times at the movies - meant to be watched on the largest screen possible, with perhaps the largest number of people possible, repeatedly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie escapism at its best! An excellent balance of action, visual effects, dialog, and clever humor. The ongoing interaction amongst the RICHLY distinct and diverse physio-personalities of the lead characters was the KEY, well-conceived and written element of this film, as was the welcome fact that it never took itself too seriously.The dialog of each of the lead characters was carefully and cleverly crafted to help further define their unique physical individuality (i.e., Groot was a wonderfully understated charmer, the raccoon a gregarious hoot).The (fortunately) brief opening scene was weak, stiff and mechanical in it's effort to set up the lead character's plot line, and could have/should have been done better so as not to be such a disservice to the well-done entertainment that follows.Pure entertainment, and then some!</fullReview>

I went into this movie knowing very little about the Guardians of the Galaxy but it surpassed every expectation I had of it. The CGI in the movie is amazing. The actions sequences were awesome and the comedy was there as usual for adults. What I loved most about the movie is that there's a character for everyone and anyone whether it's a gun-toting raccoon, a soft gentle giant tree, a super bulky violent and quite funny killer, a beautiful green assassin or a hilarious earthling. I wouldn't put it in front of the Winter Soldier or The Avengers but this movie will tie in well with any of the upcoming marvel movies and I can not wait for the sequel.

		<shortDescription>Rocket Raccoon and co. are worth watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here arrives the latest Marvel installment. Not the next sequel, prequel, or tie-in, but a new team. One part Terran, four parts alien. People have called this a filler story, but it's actually much more. It's a key move in the direction of Marvel's Phase 3, and it's a heck of a ride, mistakes notwithstanding.James Gunn had the tough task of introducing all 5 characters well enough, but still leaving screen time for plenty of spacey action. While he did so, he altered some origin story details, and this bothered me. Being a Rocket Raccoon fan, I have read his original appearances. He wasn't precisely "experimented on," and this may end up cheapening his story in the Marvel film universe. But it could be possible he doesn't remember exactly what happened, and assumes. Considering this, they might be perfectly in line, which I'm hoping for, but it's looking grim.Old Ranger Rocket was designed and voiced wonderfully. I knew going in he would be my favorite character, but they captured him just right, apart from his origin. In the coming film, I hope they heavily feature the other guardians also, notably Drax. I never felt Drax or Gamora's characters shine through, except when they were exploited for humor. I didn't feel much for their losses, cheer them on when they got the upper hand, etc.Groot was likewise amazing. His balance between gentle giant and brute warrior was spot-on. :SPOILER: I loved everything about him, until Gunn made a Hollywood-like move with his last words, "We are Groot". Why not throw away years of history and suddenly add a fourth word to his vocabulary? Because it needed to be a tender moment? The comics achieved that quite a lot without compromising the character. :END SPOILER: This was my biggest disappointment with the film.Starlord, Peter Quill, was the most complicated character of the film, but a bit less rounded. He's an 80's-loving, artifact-thieving, and wise-cracking momma's boy. We see his fun side, and his tender side, but I don't think his motivations were fully expressed. They're there, but could be deeper. While I enjoyed Chris Pratt's portrayal, I think it could have used a bit more cooking.Now for the plot. A fun-loving outlaw steals a valuable object, high-up baddies pursue him doggedly, and he must side with the law to save the galaxy. The way this plays out, and how they end up doing the saving, seemed very nearly clichéd and Hollywood-like to me. While it was intense, that's what I see in it.The action and tactical genius exhibited by the group was highly entertaining, Rocket of course being the mastermind behind most of it. If you're looking for intense fight scenes set to awesome 80's rock and roll, this delivers right to your door.As a note before I finish, there's a lot of good with this film, and I'm mostly highlighting the bad. Go see it for yourself, because I don't want to spoil much, and I'd have to in order to show you just how good. Trust me in that Marvel continues to do humor well, also. Don't let the heavy critique worry you. If you plan to see it, and I recommend that you do, know there is some mild language and intense scenes of violence. Here ends the critical part of my review.:SPOILERS AHEAD:I would like to discuss the implications of this film in the future of the Marvel film universe. Guardians of the Galaxy takes place far from Earth, but there are a few tethers to the story. First, there's Peter Quill, who originates from there. Second, this isn't the first time we've seen The Collector. He appears to be collecting the Infinity Stones, which appeared in Captain America: The First Avenger, then in Thor 2. This makes 3 of the 6 found. And a third tether is of course Thanos, who appeared briefly at the end of The Avengers.Now, I will make a few predictions here. Phase One of the Marvel film saga led all the way up to The Avengers. So we can safely say the climax of that phase was the Chitauri invasion led by Loki. Phase Two is still being released, but with the Guardians in theaters, the only film we have to wait for now is the climax, Avengers: Age of Ultron. This will conclude the phase, and very likely change the game for the future, just like several of the films in this round. Phase Three begins with Ant- Man, immediately bringing in a new character, instead of waiting until the end like in this phase. I believe this phase will be a longer one than the last two, since three stones have yet to be discovered.Now, if the first big threat was Loki leading an alien fleet against New York, and the second is Ultron, which we'll see very soon, what could follow these? Only Thanos, the biggest baddie of them all. And since both the Avengers and the Guardians have a huge beef with him, it stands to reason that the crossover rumors are going to be true after all, with even more possible attendees. It's going to be a huge throw-down. And I can't wait to see Rocket in the middle of it all.*I was given early access to see the film by Walt Disney Studios. I was not required to write a positive review, and the opinions here are my own.*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is very wonderful action movie. The most interesting point I think of this movie is 5 main characters are strangers and enemies each other at the first. But they have same purpose, and become like co-wokers, and finally they become friends. And the location is the space and many planets which don't exist in real, so the world view of this movie is so vastitude, and that make people enjoy watching. There are many elements, for example thrill and battle and friendship and so on. Especially, the friendship and teamwork of main characters are beautiful and heartfelt. During watching, I was sometimes moved my heart by their behavior to protect their friends with sacrificing themselves. This movie is of course good for people who like Marvel series and action movie, and also family can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Call me lost in space for taking an eternity to experience the "Guardians of the Galaxy", but I finally launched into it and it was worth the ride. The blockbuster stars Chris Pratt as a charismatic intergalactic criminal named Peter Quill who also goes by StarLord. Peter himself was abducted as a child by a clan of intergalactic criminals just after his mom passed away. His national treasure has always been a walkman with a cassette of some classic tunes, which was one of the classic aspects of the movie. Through unexpected circumstances, Quill teams up with other intergalactic bad guys that are really good; including the green gal Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the vengeful prisoner Drax (Dave Bautista), the sarcastic loudmouthed raccoon Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and the one-phrase tree Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). Sure, they are a diverse bunch but their mission to stop madman Ronan's Run to control the universe was quite imperative. Director James Gunn sure had some fun developing this one, and he did a commendable job, even though there were one too many action sequences. Where Gunn hit right on target was on the witty screenplay he scribed with Nicole Perlman. What I thought was really a blast off about "Guardians of the Galaxy" was the zany, pitch-perfect vocal performance from Bradley Cooper as Rocket. His Rocket launched vocal greatness, even though Rocket was off his rocker. OK, my pun mission is done here. Have a blast with this one, if you haven't already. **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The list of things that annoyed me about this movie kept growing. All aliens were humans (with rainbow skin shades) and all spoke English. It just seemed so lazy. Take a leaf out of the Star Wars bar scene and stick some varying creatures around the place and varying languages. Actually develop a believable alien world. You could have so much fun with that. Then there is the very one dimensional characters. The female character was about as deep as a puddle. She brought NOTHING new to the female superhero, the love interest, and to look pretty with a couple punches thrown in. The main hero was clichéd. Then there was the never ending fight scenes. They were just too long. A lot of action, not much character development. Then while they get blown up they don't get a scratch on them... seriously?? At least apparently hiding behind tables while the entire building you're in gets blown up saves you from even getting a carpet burn. I love superhero movies, they're fun when there is a well developed bad guy and characters that you care about. This didn't have that. The jokes were funny. But jokes can't and shouldn't carry a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Awesome, Fun Space Adventure from Marvel Studios</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel Studios got smart with their Phase II films. The first phase was fun but I worried that I would reach a point of over-saturation where I might grow tired of their formula. Then they proved they had more tricks up their sleeve when they introduced the concept of incorporating other genres into the world of comic book films. THE WINTER SOLDIER was a political thriller and now GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is a space adventure in the vein of the Star Wars films. When Marvel announced their Phase II series, I was the only one in my group of friends who got more excited for this film than the continuing adventures of Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America. No, I'd never heard of the Guardians before and that was probably what was most intriguing. It was something different. I immediately jumped on Wikipedia to get some idea as to what to expect and was quickly overwhelmed with the bizarre details of the characters and their cosmic adventures. I couldn't wait to see how it was handled on film. With the announcement of James Gunn as director, it solidified itself as my most anticipated film of 2014. In GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, we're introduced to Peter Quill (Christ Pratt). Quill was abducted from Earth as a child and has since led the life of an interstellar outlaw, referring to himself as Star-Lord. His most recent acquisition is a mysterious orb of unknown power that draws the attention of an infamous Kree fanatic, Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace). Ronan has been tasked with retrieving the orb and presenting it to Thanos, the major villain Marvel has been teasing since the end of THE AVENGERS in 2012. Quill's adventures lands him in an unstable alliance with fellow outcasts in an effort to keep the orb from Ronan's hands: Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Groot (Vin Diesel), and Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper).I almost feel as if GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is Marvel Studios' means of giving the finger to DC/Warner Bros. As much trouble as Warner has had in bringing DC comics successfully to the big screen, Marvel wanted to flaunt it's skills by making a movie featuring an anthropomorphic tree and talking raccoon as two of it's main characters. Regardless of their reasons, it worked and GUARDIANS skyrocketed to the top of my favorite Marvel movies to join the ranks of IRON MAN, IRON MAN 3 (yes, I liked it), and THE AVENGERS. James Gunn was an inspired choice for the job of directing the film and I knew from the time he was announced that this was a film to keep an eye on (I loved his 2010 film, SUPER). He brings an oddball humor to a film that needs it, where we're immersed in colorful aliens, strange new worlds, and?I repeat?a talking raccoon. In the end, it was the characters that really made this movie as fun and effective as it is. The casting was top notch and every member of the cast understands the vibe of the movie and plays into it perfectly. Chris Pratt was the perfect choice for the role of Quill and his comedic timing really set the tone from the very start as Quill is dancing his way through some ancient ruins to the tune of Redbone's "Come and Get Your Love". Groot and Rocket were, of course, audience favorites because they were the oddest of an already out-there cast. Groot, a humanoid plant, acts as the muscle for Rocket in their bounty-hunting duo but, despite his size and strength, is a softie at heart. Rocket is the resident wise-cracker with an attitude more than large enough to compensate for his size. Zoe Saldana is her usual strong presence as Gamora, former assassin under the employment of Thanos and Ronan, but the real surprise for me was Bautista as Drax. I'll admit some of his dialogue comes across a little clunky but he had some great moments and was surprisingly good at giving his character some depth. With the exception of the Rock, I'm generally against pro-wrestlers turning mainstream actor but Bautista might be a new exception to the rule.The characters are certainly the strongest point in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY but they don't all get the chance for full development. Marvel has been notorious with an issue of under-developing its villains and Ronan is no different. He's got the look and he's got the attitude and Lee Pace gives a rage-fueled performance, but we don't learn much about him other than he's a Kree with a never-ending hatred for a race know as Xanderians. We get no further information as to why the Kree and Xanderians are at odds or why Ronan refuses to let go of his blood vendetta even after the two species agreed to a cease-fire. Ronan had the potential to be one of the coolest villains in the MCU but he's left one-dimensional. The same can be said for Korath the Pursuer (Djimon Hounsou). Hounsou is a phenomenal actor but he's pretty much wasted in his minor role as Ronan's enforcer. Nebula (Karen Gillan) is done slightly better. At least we get hints at her history (genetically and cybernetically modified by Thanos to be a killing machine) and her motivations (anger/revenge against Thanos and Gamora). Then there's the complaint of the pretty basic story. GUARDIANS relies on it's eccentric characters to keep the movie fun (which it does) and sacrifices plot, giving us the most basic of story lines we've come to expect from Marvel. The villain is trying to get an item, it can provide ultimate power, the heroes need to stop him. It's an unfortunate side-effect for any of these movies tying into the whole "Infinity Gauntlet" plot line running through the franchise. They're limited to repeating the same steps. Regardless of these flaws though, GUARDIANS is the some of the most fun I've had in a Marvel film and easily recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every scene is for refilling purposes.The story is clichéd to death, and childish on every measure.I would not even care about that if the result were fun to watch, but I was bored along the entire movie.If you can recall the feeling of being bored on a too long scene of some movie, then you will get what I mean. I was bored on the entire movie. I spent my time wanting for each one to end.It haves generic heroes, joined together for no reason. They become friends just because.The entire movie is made of one liners. The CGI is generic at this point of time.The "heroes" are so annoying that you want all of them to die.Somebody got a lot of money to make a movie, and has no talent. The result is like the car designed by Homer Simpson: garbage pieces joined together by somebody really mediocre, which thinks is cool to add another bizarre honk, so he keeps adding stuff until a big ball of spit chewing gum is formed, with weird things pasted all around.This is what this movie is: a ball of garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never into Marvel comics as a kid. I didn't particularly like the Tobey Maguire Spider- Man films either. I disliked the first Andrew Garfield Spider-Man film so much I still haven't bothered seeing the second. But Marvel Studios (now owned by Disney) have been doing it right. Since Iron Man I've enjoyed every MCU film that's been released, pretty much. Granted the Iron Man sequels were flawed, and the first Captain America film meandered a bit, but on the whole I've enjoyed them all.Except this one. Maybe it was built up too much for me - everybody was raving about it - but I just didn't get the appeal. Couple of good moments... but I found James Gunn's script so irritatingly weak - like a first draft with the gags put in as placeholders until better ones could be written. And so much ham-fisted talk about teamwork and overcoming adversity, topics which have been tackled so much less clumsily in the two Avengers films.Perhaps the aim was for this one to be a little more obviously child-friendly (it is a 12A after all). Even so, child-friendly doesn't have to be dumbed down. Maybe I'm getting too old for all this nonsense. On the plus side, the fact this one was such a huge hit was a nice two-fingers-up to Sony, who still can't capture the world's imagination with one the most famous superheroes of all time. Spider-Man gets right on my wick.Verdict: I thought it was crap, but what do I know?yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GOTG is a mediocre film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie did do two things well, albeit minor. First, it had a great soundtrack. Second, it was lighter than the past Marvel movies which suffered from their attempt at being dark. The reason Avengers was so good was because it didn't do this.Yet as a result of the lighthearted tone, when I watched Guardians of the Galaxy I felt like I was watching a movie meant for a 5 year old. Marvel has done a fairly good job of avoiding this for a long time, while still making a movie kids would enjoy. But the characters themselves acted so childish. None of the dialogue was good because the things they said were said in a way that only little children say. In this movie, though, the humor was bland and the the characters acted more cartoonish than ever. It was more similar to Adam West's Batman than it was to The Avengers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Overrated Money-Making Garbage From Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being disappointed by many of Marvels most popular films, I thought this one was going to be different and an improvement to their franchise, but sadly I was disappointed. It was the same old lemming attractor with a foundation in mindless action and awful special effects/cgi that the masses seem to be sucked into and infatuated with. One good note was that they brought some more obscure characters to the screen, and unless you are a comic book fan you've probably never heard of them. The soundtrack was also great and got a lot of attention. Obviously people have never heard good music before and maybe it will give them a little change in their tasteless ways. I was really rooting for the film the whole way, wanting to like it in the end, but it just didn't deliver. I enjoy Chris Pratt but most of it just wasn't very funny, had terrible fake-looking visuals, cheesy speeches, a typical Marvel slacker-playboy turned hero, and uninteresting villains. As a sequel is inevitable, maybe I will just hope for improvement though I don't really have a desire to see it after this flop.</fullReview>

Sadly,a sequel will come out and it will also be successful.I would give everybody a suggestion. Wait for it to come on DVD, I would say.

		<fullReview>With Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel has gone to the C list of their comic book heroes. Otherwise who the hell are these people unless you truly are a comic book geek.In 1988 a young Peter Quill soon after his mother's death is abducted from Earth by some space pirates. 26 years later Quill is now also known as Star Lord and also a space pirate steals a powerful orb and forms an uneasy alliance with a group of extraterrestrial misfits who are being pursued by Ronan the Accuser.I watched this film twice, the first time I was underwhelmed with it but the kids liked it who were keen to watch it on the big screen. On my second viewing I appreciated the film more. Its an entertaining and anarchic B movie, fast and frenetic but it also felt messy and incoherent and also tricky to get into.Having watched the other Marvel characters where you are introduced into the world of Thor or Iron Man or Captain America here you sometimes feel that you have ended up in someone's party uninvited and no amount of 1970s music will make you feel at home. Its difficult to work out the motivation between some of the characters and the antagonism such as Quill and Yondu.The film takes it cue from some post modern Star Wars mixed with Indiana Jones in space. The CGI characters Groot and Rocket just about work in the film. I still not sure whether its Bradley Cooper voicing it as he sounds so different because he plays him as a more lovable Joe Pesci gangster type.However a bunch of misfits who argue and mistrust each other before putting away their differences and uniting to fight a common foe was played out in The Avengers film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am Groot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am Groot... That means i love this film.Guardians of the Galaxy is Marvel latest film in its cinematic universe which is currently in Phase 2, this film is the next Marvel film since Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which was great and i'm happy to say this film is even better.When Guardians of the Galaxy was announced a few years, i was one of the many that had no idea who these characters were and i was very surprised at Marvel for taking such a gamble on a film, but it definitely payed off. Image and video hosting by TinyPic The film is about Peter Quill (A.K.A Starlord) a human who is a child when he gets abducted by a spaceship, the film then cuts to 26 years later and Quill grows up into a egotistical, playboy, outlaw, who is only in it for himself and would betray anyone for a certain price. Quill founds an orb after a great first scene of Quill dancing around listening to his Walkman (which is a highlight of the film), Quill realizes everyone wants this orb he has required and tries to use it for his own self. On his journey he meets his eventual teammates; Gamora, a famous assassin and daughter to one of the deadliest people in the universe, Drax the Destroyer, a warrior who is set on vengeance to the one who killed his family, Rocket Raccoon, a loud mouthed Raccoon who is also a bounty hunter and his friend Groot, a humanoid tree, who can only say the words "I Am Groot" The explanation of these characters sounds ridiculous and they are, i think that's why they work so great as a team of screen, they are all rejects put together make a strong team.Guardians of the Galaxy is interesting because its tone is everywhere, but it works, from one laugh out loud moment to a quiet sincere moment and it all works which is a real testament to the actors on screen and the director, James Gunn.James Gunn does a great job at establishing these brand new worlds we have never been to before, from the wasteland planets to the beautiful Xandar.The film has a interesting story, full of galactic conquests, betrayal and villains, but James Gunn chose to focus on The Guardians in this first film and i think that was the right idea, i was worried going in that all 5 Guardians wouldn't be full developed by the end of the film, but i was wrong all 5 come out at the end of the film as fully fledged characters thankfully that's with help of course from the actors portraying the characters; Chris Pratt plays Peter Quill and plays the cocky playboy very well, and was very well cast, Pratt being a comedic actor worked perfectly because this film is really funny and he is a big reason why. Gamora is played by Zoe Saldana, who seems to always played primary colored characters! She plays the sexy assassins very well, having to act serious and dead- eyed for a lot of the film but can also be cute when least expected. Rocket Raccoon is voiced by Bradley Cooper and when cast i thought that was a strange pairing but it worked well in the film, Cooper played the Raccoon very cocky and funny and in interviews so he was trying to do a homage to Joe Pesci, which is apparent when seeing the film. Vin Diesel voices the humanoid Tree, Groot, and was the perfect casting, Groot can only say three words yet can put so much emotion in those three words that you always know what he is really saying when he says the words, they must of thought of Vin Diesel because of the film The Iron Giant in which he does the same kind of performance. Rounding out the main characters is, Drax the Destroyer, who is played by Dave Bautista, i was worried that he was going be the weak link in the cast but i was totally wrong, Bautista plays Drax very well, acting deadpan and having great comedic delivery which i really didn't expect.Because the film was so focused they didn't spend too much time with the villains of the piece which i think worked in their favor, Ronan the Accusor played by Lee Pace, is a very cool and meanacing looking character but he is very deep as well as his sidekick Nebula played by Karen Gillan, Ronan wants to get revenge, that is all, but that is all that is needed, for the film to have a baddie that the Guardians can defeat and i think it worked very well. The supporting cast also did their thing featuring such actors as Glenn Close, Michael Rooker and John C. Reilly but the standout to me was Benicio del Toro, who plays the Collector, a Liberace type character who as his name says collects interesting things.Another interesting film about the film is that it hardly is connected to the other Marvel films except for two small things, the infinity gems and Thanos and they are not big parts of the film, it is really focusing on the Guardians and the universe and doesn't feel like a sequel to The Avengers and doesn't feel like an advert for the second Avengers film.The soundtrack for the film is one of the best soundtracks i have heard in film, through the plot device of Quill's Walkman it allows the film to have 80's songs playing all throughout this futuristic film which is such a juxtaposition and shouldn't fit the film yet it does perfectly.But the reason i think the film really excels is because of James Gunn, the film still has Gunn's eccentrics that are in all his films and this is his best film yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Guardians of the Galaxy" is a movie that is based on the Marvel comics and as a result also the plot and the storyline of it is based on this. In this movie on the one hand we have an evil god that wants to destroy the universe and on the other hand we have a group of intergalactic criminals who have to work together in order to avoid this destruction.I really liked this movie because of the plot and the storyline because it combines very well the laugh with the action. The visual effects of it is outstanding. Also I believe that James Gunn did very good job in the direction of it. Even if we are talking about a Sci-Fi movie I have to say that the interpretations of Chris Pratt who played as Peter Quill and the beautiful Zoe Saldana who played as Gamora were magnificent. Another thing that has to be mentioned are the voices of Vin Diesel (Groot) and Bradley Cooper (who spoke more than Vin Diesel) as Rocket which gave a different beauty in this movie.Finally I would like to say that "Guardians of the Galaxy" is a great movie for everybody and especially of course for Marvel fans. I strongly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fresh installment into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, "Guardians of The Galaxy" is a fun adventure featuring an interesting leading ensemble of characters. The film's visual effects really help to bring the various extra-terrestrial settings to life. The pop compilation soundtrack is an additional fun factor to the film's light-hearted humour.However, these very features ultimately seem to make up for and mask "Guardians"' lacking plot in which a forgettable villain seeks to destroy the universe while the protagonists take measures to stop them, something not too dissimilar to other Marvel movie story lines ("Thor: The Dark World" in particular). This cliché plot needs to be given a rest, especially when the film doesn't seem to really accentuate that particular threat and its implications.Other than colourful alien worlds, there is nothing else that this film seems to offer or present other than its entertaining cast and (sometimes forced) humour. I really would have liked for a better insight into Peter Quill and his experiences, having been taken away so suddenly from Earth, and a better look at the various worlds we are presented with in the film. Star Wars is a great example of showcasing distinct planets that we become accustomed to and can easily recognise; "Guardians" needs to take a page or two from that book.I have a feeling that the direction in which this film could have been taken in was shunted due to the fact that Marvel wanted to introduce key plot points that would feature and play heavily in the overall arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and its Phases, especially with the expanded introduction of Thanos, whom we can speculate will be the ultimate villain in an "Avengers" movie. Though I understand that this film had the appropriate setting and theme in which to officially introduce these plot points, it feels like it drags it down from feeling like its own, separate entity and not just something that has to very specifically tie into Marvel's current plans for their movies."Guardians of The Galaxy" is an entertaining film at best with the crux of its popularity seemingly accumulated from the wild response to the vivid and discrete ensemble of characters and the film's lively and amusing tone. The cliché plot and forgettable villain disappointingly drags "Guardians" down. Don't be fooled by the critics' consensus; this film is good but its notable errors prove that there is definitely room for improvement. Origin stories often tend to fall into this trap but leeway is obviously permitted as the filmmakers get to find their footing and subsequently and hopefully deliver a more developed story and villain for the sequel.Is "Guardians" worth the watch? Yes, but don't expect anything more than just a fun comic-book movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, okay I have to admit that Rocket is the coolest character to come to the big screen since WALL-E. Rocket and his muscle(wooded)friend still the scenes many times throughout this movie. Just as in The Big Chill, the music will blow you away if you like classic Rock n Roll. The best movies have sound tracks that stick with you long after the movie ends. Bingo! Chris Pratt's character is so real that you can immerse yourself into him as you watch the movie. His actions are so realistic you can imagine yourself acting the same way. His costar Zoe Saldana continues her significant strong feminine profile with a character almost equal to her Avatar persona. Guardians of the Galaxy pulls you right into the movie with the opening scenes. Science Fiction fans will flock to this film, and its sequels in the future. There are so many different types of characters that pop up in this film, more realistic than Star Wars (not a slam either, just better CGI) and will make you look differently at how you judge others. I have very few films that I will give a 10 out of 10, but Guardians is a very strong 9.5 out of 10. Please take the time to watch this film and just enjoy the action and drama, laugh out loud, and cheer on the gang as they go from one situation to another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Marvel Movie thus far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been a fan of the Marvel Cinematic universe, but I have to admit that besides The Avengers and now Guardians of the Galaxy, no other Marvel movie really stands out as its own thing. Iron Man, Thor and Captain America are very good movies if you understand their importance to the overall universe, but when looking at them as single units, they're pretty disappointing. The first Captain America, for example, was a mess in my opinion and was not fun at all - but it set up the Avengers which makes its flaws acceptable. Guardians of the Galaxy is not like that. It is the first Marvel movie that can really hold up as a good movie on its own and actually feels richer than all other Marvel movies combined. James Gunn's writing and artistic direction really helps the movie take on a life of its own. The soundtrack, composed mostly of 70's songs is extremely catchy and one of the best non-original soundtracks I've heard in a summer blockbuster in a while. Every Guardian is extremely likable (especially Groot) and is each infinitely more interesting and fun than Captain America for example who is just a boring sack of crap. The action sequences in this movie don't really hold up to the visual effects of The Avengers but are definitely at least on par with those of all the other Marvel movies, which doesn't really matter since this movie relies much more on its cast and writing anyways. I was already a fan of Chris Pratt before this movie (he's my favorite character on Parks and Rec) but this made me really realize his potential as an action star. His comedic timing is off the charts. This movie deserved all the success it got and is not over-hyped at all."I am Groot"</fullReview>

Yes, most of us are not "100% d-icks". Even those who are pretty bad are still capable to do great things."So what should do next? Something good? Something bad?

		<fullReview>SO, I am not at all familiar with these marvel characters nor did I every get a chance to read the comics either while i was a kid so I walked into this film without any expectations whatsoever. It was a fun movie for the most part, but of course some of the characters felt forced and there was not enough back story or screen time to develop the characters. However, it was a bold film by marvel to take and i praise them for making the efforts and trying something different.I will tackle the characters first since there is a lot! While Chris Pratt as star-lord fits the part well and opens up with his abduction by aliens or bounty hunters of sorts as a child outside of a hospital after his mother dies from cancer. It was a very emotional moment and helps you sympathize with the character and his motivations. Rocket was a comedy relieve character for the film mostly having a smart ass attitude, but resourceful and intelligent, but despite these entertaining qualities i couldn't connect with his character at all. At least until later on in the film in a bar fight where we see an emotionally damaged hero discovering how victimized he was at the hands of genetic experimentation's which continues to be a hidden suffering in his life. It was a surprising scene in the movie because it comes out of nowhere in the film and arguably one of its darkest moments. That one scene alone sold me on his character since you saw how vulnerable his personality can be. The knowledge of the experiments were revealed early on in the film but marvel did a great job with showing the impact of how that experience still haunts him. Groot the big tree despite having only 3 lines in the movie was either a hit or miss for some. He was character served the films climax well and his loyalty as a sidekick to rocket was admirable. His powers throughout the film was a treat to watch as well but i wish there was something more to his character.Unfortunately the other characters were a little under developed and lacked something. Zoe Saldana as Gamora was another cool character and her dilemma is being the unwanted sibling of Thanos and is at odds with Nebula played by Karen Gillan both competing for thanos's exception. Gamora's home was destroyed by thanos and was later adopted and trained as a skilled warrior?(double check that one) So of course when she finds out Thanos is the underlying mastermind, her loyalties are quickly turned to the good guys while turning against her master Ronan. This creates the opportunity for Nebula to be the favorite and further amplifies her rivalry. Drax on the other hand is a bone head really. His back story is pretty much the same as Gamora except that his family was killed on a planet that was destroyed by Ronan the main villain and now he wants revenge if I'm not mistaken. So these little similarities are the connecting thread that ties all these characters together out of necessity to conquer a common enemy and is the binding tissue that will create a lasting friendship. This is where the problem is for me as well. Their back stories are too wrenched into the main plot of the story since their are so many little subplots in the film with all these characters so the film has to address them quickly. Selling their inhibitions while moving the characters through the story at a fast pace gives the film too much to juggle in my opinion. But what made the ensemble cast work is their comedy and little cultural differences such as Drax being a literal person and not understanding star-lords metaphorical language. There was also a a quick love subplot between star-lord and gamora which was a little out of place and didn't serve the film much either. I didn't find any build up to that point in both of those characters relationship and perhaps could've been explored in other films. There are other little subplots i didn't mention above since like i said this film has a lot.As for the story overall it was entertaining. However this compliant is not only directed at this movie but is a common trend occurring in all marvel films as of late. It is this city ending, world ending, or universe ending plot lines. The avengers film, thor 2, cap 2 some what, and now guardians. The second avengers film appears to be heading down that path as well but i am just hoping for something different. There is so much source material to take from but we keep ending up with these same plots. It seems a little bit lazy or is what sells and is probably both. Overall the film was riddled with comedy, action and suspense. The acting was good for the most part and a completely different territory that has been unexplored. But i did have to lower my score only because the plot was formulaic which is, the goal of the villain is to destroy a city, a world or universe. I don't know if that's the writers fault or the source material, but Its starting to become a played out theme in the marvel films. There has to be some new ideas in these films in the future otherwise it will get boring. But that is a minor compliant. It is familiar storyline for script writers to rehash and be safe, but at least marvel still manages to make it exciting! Would i go watch again ? No. but if its on TV or netflix in the future sure !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Guardians of the Galaxy" is a buoyant and joyful roller-coaster ride through a colorful, fantastically imaginative world somewhere on the verge between Sciencefiction and Fantasy only surpassed by "Avatar" in it's artistic abundance - and while missing James Cameron's sense for great dramaturgical peaks on a deeply emotional level that make you suffer with the protagonists, it in exchange comes up with a more or less great sense of humor. Certainly not every punchline hits its target, however, there are some really, really funny scenes full of self-irony. The main protagonists, the heroes, who are refreshingly different from the typical superhero characters Marvel has to offer, since they all carry the image of being outlaws beyond ordinary social conventions, somehow succeed in managing the balancing act between silliness and seriousness, harmonizing well together and even providing one or two goose-bump moments towards the end. The plot itself is not very elaborated and feels shallow at times, too much resembling other Marvel movies in its structural build up. More bravado and originality on part of the script authors would have given this in all other respects astonishing motion picture not only more substance and depth but also something that stays with you long after the curtain has fallen and the impressions of the visual effects have faded away. The good thing about the story is that it is fast-paced and does not need three hours to be told. Also remarkable is the - for such a genre - rather unusual soundtrack consisting of famous pop songs of the 1960's-80's, it contributes much to the positive vibe of the movie since it is played throughout the movie, even serving as a plot device. The 13 years old comic fan boy/girl will cheer at this, a more mature viewer can certainly appreciate the satirical quality and epic action scenes. Very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie for those who don't like superhero movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you DO you like superhero movies, then you might really like this movie. I am, however, generally not a fan of the superhero concept and have been turned off by at least some aspects of many recent Marvel movies, but I really liked Guardians of the Galaxy. Aside from the superhero thing, I found the movie overall to be an entertaining and funny sci-fi action movie; nothing too spectacular but definitely enjoyable and worth the price of admission. I saw this reluctantly with my kids and being a Marvel movie, I expected that I would not like it. I've seen pretty much all recent superhero movies (for my kids) and I just don't get into antagonists who are too unrealistically pious and impossibly good, with absurdly evil protagonists. I also can't stand seeing characters who are essentially privileged, spoiled individuals who are also lucky enough to be vastly superior to the entire human race, and yet they still have petty issues to whine and brood about.This movie was very different, as the characters were not only genuinely tragic (not billionaires or luckily endowed with powers), but also surprisingly ambiguous in their attitudes and moral choices. This superhero gang consists of: a thief, a couple of bounty hunters, an assassin, and a convict. With the exception of the main character, they all start off as potentially bad guys in the story. The overall feelings you get towards them is more of pity and rooting for their success, as opposed to the almost holy reverence you are expected to feel for the over-powerful X-Men and other assorted demigods in other Marvel movies. *SPOILER ALERT* Of course there is the standard clear moment when they make the decision to do the selfless and righteous thing to save the galaxy, as in all superhero movies, but overall this is a minor point in the entire movie.As others have pointed out, this movie has a lot more comedy element than other Marvel movies, as well as a stronger sci-fi and alien setting. If you happen to like 70's music ? did I mention the music? - then you will LOVE this. I wouldn't think many people under 50 (I'm under 45) would even get that at all, but I was floored at the inclusion of The Runaways "Cherry Bomb" in the movie. It's not Oscar material and definitely not beyond criticizing for various weaknesses. However, If you are expecting the typical superhero movie, this isn't quite that. More importantly, if you tend to not like the typical superhero movie, you might be pleasantly surprised by this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure sci-fi popcorn fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(67%) A vastly watchable, very fun, witty, fully fledged sci-fi action comedy with a great nostalgic soundtrack (even if old cassettes in reality sound a lot more fuzzy). The confidence shown by Marvel is commendable as the very pretty visuals must have cost a very pretty penny, and considering I've never even heard of the comic books before then the studio executives must have big cojones to green-light a relatively obscure series. The unending sharp sense of humour works well, and the writing in general is better than most with stuff always happening without it ever feeling like too much. It may just be a big flashy popcorn movie, but it's a fine exciting example of the breed making this a worthy one to watch at the cinema, with strong hope of more goodness yet to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of how several individuals of different races in the galaxy team up to save the galaxy from destruction by an evil villain.The great thing about films is that anything can become reality, and "Guardians of the Galaxy" makes good use of this rule. We have people of red, blue and green skins respectively, a talking tree (albeit a limited vocabulary) and a talking raccoon. It has comedic moments, especially delivered by Vin Diesel who is not usually funny. The action is great, augmented by the amazing special effects. I was so impressed by the formation of planes against the Dark Aster that I felt tingles down my spine. Emotional moments are delivered by the first scene, and the final scene which references the first scene. There are all the elements for "Guardians of the Galaxy" to be a successful blockbuster, and I enjoyed watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good superhero movie but no LOTR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say I am into all things scifi, and have read many a graphic novel. I have enjoyed all (well, most) of the other Marvel movies. This movie is very good, and even excellent within it's genre. The characters are spot on, the visual effects are extremely well done, and the plot is quite engrossing, particularly for an action film.HOWEVER, this is not another LOTR or Star Wars. This movie is not a 10/10 unless you're comparing it only to films in its own narrow genre. This isn't an exam, where you get a 10 if you don't get any answers wrong. This is a pretty shallow summer action flick, and a good one, but not genre-defying or earth-shattering. Most people will not remember it when next summer rolls around. I think the studios must have worked out how to game the system.By all means, go see it. It's a fun film. Took my 9 year old son with me, and he had a great time too. Just don't set your expectations too high.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite sceptical when first sitting down to watch this movie as I did not think it would be of my taste however I was pleasantly surprised! Guardians of the galaxy is a fun, light hearted movie but has managed to provide a serious super hero aspect also. The characters are fascinating in so many ways, from the simplicity of Groot to the complicated life of 'star lord'. The way in which 'star lord' enters the the beyond is dark and sets that scene from the start of the movie but with a jump from adolescence to adulthood we soon realise this is a different kind of movie with a fantastic main character. Chris Pratt seemed a suitable actor to deliver a performance that required an aspect of seriousness and comic with the not so impressive hard men Vin Diesel and Batista playing the roles that required lesser acting skills. The mysterious Gamora was compelling however the main villain not so compelling but well suited to the light heartiness of the movie. The fantastic soundtrack from the 60's and 70's which has a deeper meaning of which you will find out from watching the movie was refreshing even if they are from an older generation. The movie provided a fantastic imaginary view on outer space with the usual weird and wonderful communities and species a sci-fi movie provides. This is a great marval piece and is definitely keeping up with all the other marvel movies being released. Overall a splendid watch and highly recommended!</fullReview>

The same escapism feel to it, the heroics, the sidekicks, the humor, this film was exceptional in all ways.Guardians of the Galaxy gave me hope that the new Star Wars films just might be in the spirit of the originals rather than the serious tones of the later prequels not to mention features fantastic CGI characters that put Jar Jar to shame. Groot and Rocket are delightful. I've enjoyed most of the Marvel movies of late and this on is my favorite. I would watch this again happily.9 stars from me.</fullReview>

I loved basically everything about this film. I also like how the main hero, Peter Quill, is just some ordinary Joe Shmoe who happens to get blasted onto a great adventure and meets great friends along the way. Perhaps the most interesting character, though, is Rocket Raccoon, who is voiced greatly by Bradley Cooper. There is hardly any reason to not go see this film.

		<fullReview>I gave this movie an 8 because it was refreshing. I give it a 6 for them mixing up so much and giving wrong info. It was an entertaining movie, I just wish they didn't just outright change character histories without even making it sound legitimate - especially for those who are familiar with the characters and know their back stories. Marvel mixed and matched characters from various alternate time lines within the marvel universe in this movie. For example, Yondu, in this movie is such a character. Here is his data http://marvel.wikia.com/Yondu_Udonta_(Earth-199999)The Yondu from the comic books is here: http://marvel.wikia.com/Yondu_Udonta_(Earth-691)Those of you who don't know that there was quite some wrong information in the movie - the writers disregarding marvel history in their lame attempt to make it more sensational, check these linksGamora - Not the silly girl she was portrayed to be in the movie. http://marvel.wikia.com/Gamora_(Earth-616).Here is Thanos his file, http://marvel.wikia.com/Thanos_(Earth-616)Nebula http://marvel.wikia.com/Nebula_%28Earth-616%29The Nova Corps http://marvel.wikia.com/Nova_Corps_(Earth-616)Few characters who go from biggest baddest bad guy to good guy roles, need sensationalism. You might want to read the Infinity Sagas, to find out how much of a bad-ass Thanos really is.All Main Marvel comics take place on Earth-616. Our reality, is known as Earth-1218 You see, Marvel has many different alternate realities where their stories develop and characters originate. I suppose the mixing-up was done to cut some corners and to make it seem more interesting for the box-office. All in all, it was fun. But frustrating to see how weak and sometimes lame the characters were made out to be by the writers. I mean, Gamora, the most dangerous assassin, was taken down so easily so many times...Go watch it. Suspend everything you know of marvel, your ego, and enjoy.</fullReview>

This movie is absolutely fantastic, it reminds me of the first time i saw star wars so many years ago. That sense of wonder and excitement from new worlds being brought to life for my eyes. I love this movie and the characters he has given us are exciting and new. I enjoyed Gunns previous films and how offbeat they were. He has lost none of that here.The visuals are stunning and I wonder how he pulled off a Lucas worthy effects film in such short time. Every character is deserving of being there and delivers. The film knows when not to take itself too seriously and when to revel in it. I have not seen a group of characters come together like this since Han Solo and the crew. Even though the characters are very different that chemistry is there again. In fact the Guardians could well exist in that medium. Unlike the last Thor movie the bad guy here is memorable and striking on screen. The supporting characters are an interesting mix but never lingered on to long. In Short this film has all the right stuff and should absolutely be seen in the theater first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Review: Guardians of the Galaxy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would have thought that Marvel's next highly entertaining, multi-million (hopeful billion) dollar cinematic adventure would be set in a futuristic space world, whose tonal and narrative flow is shaped around a retro-filled soundtrack with songs dating from the 1960's to 1980's? With hits including Blue Swede's Hooked On a Feeling, The Runaway's Cherry Bomb, The Jackson 5's I Want You Back and Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's Ain't No Mountain High Enough, Marvel Studios Guardians of the Galaxy is the epitome of silly, mindless fun at the movies. I'm not sure what Marvel Studios obsession with Marvin Gaye may be currently, but after having the song Trouble Man dictate the narrative for the highly impressive Captain America: The Winter Soldier earlier this year, it seems that the powerhouse studio is repossessing old concepts and ideas, and polishing them up quite nicely. With a bit of frantic, highly busy visual effects as well as engrossing dark physical and illicit family comedy, and presenting them in exuberantly exciting fashion for people of all ages to enjoy, Guardians of the Galaxy is a clear-cut winner. There is no denying that Guardians may very well be Marvel's own Star Wars for a new generation of highly diverse and eager young film goers; the film, which is inspired by the classic series, also does a great job spoofing much of the universe brought to life by George Lucas in the seventies. Guardians is, in many senses of the phrase, a roller-coaster ride of a film whose intention of fun is never questioned. If ever Disney wanted to shape a theme park ride around any of their properties, Guardians would surely be their best bet?never mind Pirates.Geek culture has officially taken over cineplexes, and for the most part, so will Chris Pratt, whose turn as Peter Quill a.k.a Star-Lord, will surely be the clear victor at this weekend's box office. Quill, a rambunctious outlaw whose fame as a nuisance to the galaxy is as important as his alias, leads a rag-tag group of criminal misfits to iconic hero status. Like most heroes, Quill isn't quite sure he knows he's a hero yet. Stealing and collecting junk from around the universe on his filthy Corvette-like spaceship he uses more like a bedroom for alien women than as a means of transport, Quill finally steals something so powerful, it threatens to destroy the world and him, forever. But unlike Indiana Jones, Quill doesn't have to dodge booby-traps and outrun giant boulders, instead he just has to deal with an array of peculiar characters including; a crew of awful aiming mercenaries loyal to Ronan (Lee Pace) led by Korath (Djimon Hounsou), bounty hunters Rocket (a genetically modified, wise cracking raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper), a humanoid tree Groot (voice by Vin Diesel), an assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and a murderous maniac intent on vengeance Dax the Destroyer (former wrestler Dave Bautista).Eventually, everyone involved with Quill and the orb he has stolen are imprisoned (except the bad guys of course). In prison, the five begin unlikely friendships based on trust, sacrifice and intimidation that allows them to escape prison and set a course to a buyer, The Collector (Benecio Del Toro) who will stop at nothing to have the newly stolen possession in his hands. Upon discovering Quill's possession of the orb, Ronan gets direct orders from Thanos (Josh Brolin) to retrieve it. Led by his muscle Nebula (Karen Gillan), Ronan and his dark army go to extensive corners of the galaxy to retrieve the orb, and kill anyone in their way.Guardians can rest assure that it is by no means a revolutionary film to defies the boundaries of the superhero narrative and the 'stop the bad guy from destroying the world' clichéd storyline we have come to love and hate. Thankfully, the film is a practice of clever humour and nuanced physical slapstick that make its way into the superhero genre. Pratt does a star-lording job of leading a fresh group of actors to new heights in super hero comedy as well as interacting and getting the most from his voice cast.Director James Gunn (Slither, Super) whose previous work makes no indication at all that his fit in Marvel's world of intergalactic superheroes would work, does a surprisingly fantastic job writing and directing obscure comic book characters. Obvious losers in the comic book world, Gunn does an amazing job of making the Guardians cinematic heroes whose allure on screen, consisting of saturated visual effects and computer generated imagery, make for one of the greatest complete ensemble of the summer. So what if his overly ambitious score is distracting to viewers during intense scenes of built up drama and highly concentrated action. Gunn, has us, from the films first frames, hooked on a feeling of nostalgia and escapism that we haven't felt for a long time.Guardians is in no way a galactic achievement in the world of villains and heroes. Pace, who originally auditioned for the role of Quill, is wooden, unrecognizable and suffers greatly from any real ability to scare his audience with fear or threat. With the occasional close-up to the dark eyes or tarred teeth, Ronan is quickly overshadowed and squashed by the menaced-voice, short presence of Thanos. With the promise of such an iconic villain's chaos and the repercussions it will have in the world of the Avengers and now the Guardians, the film is very much an introductory film with very little new superhero material and rather a pastiche of potential for bigger threats and danger for future instalments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where does Star-Lord get batteries for his Walkman?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yup, I think writer/director James Gunn has done enough to make everyone forget about Joss Whedon. Bringing forth his big screen adaptation of an obscure team of Marvel superheroes called the Guardians of the Galaxy, Gunn's sense of humor and strong grasp of what made so many of the action/adventure films of the 70's and 80's so memorable, has single-handedly created another profitable layer to the Marvel film franchise.This origins story follows our main protagonist Peter "my friends call me Star-Lord" Quill (Chris Pratt) as he creates an unlikely alliance with a band of intergalactic misfits, including Gamora (a green Zoe Saldana) Rocket (a raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper) his sidekick Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel?) and Drax the Destroyer (played by Bautista, of WWE fame) who is basically Sheldon after a year of Crossfit, as they attempt to stop the evil Ronan the Accuser from obtaining an orb that could destroy an entire species in one fell swoop. Needless to say, "Guardians of the Galaxy" shares a lot of similarities with Star Wars?well, if the original Star Wars trilogy had focused on the life and times of Han Solo instead of boring old Luke Skywalker.When critics say Gunn is breaking the Marvel mold with this movie, I don't know that that's altogether true. Yes, this is the first (if I'm not mistaken) Marvel film that has little to do with Earth. And yes, it does have a strong comedic element, but so has every other Marvel film since the Disney takeover. What Gunn does do that is quite innovative, is strategically positions the strong comedic element as the star of the show, which along with the cast and an awesome late 60's/early 70's mixtape inspired soundtrack, creates a fun atmosphere first and foremost; even though he's working with a story and characters which may lack the depth of most other heroes in the Marvel universe. He is also responsible for casting Vin Diesel in the first role worthy of his limited acting abilities. With that move alone, I must give Mr. Gunn mad props. Here's to hoping that Diesel is regulated to one or two lines of dialogue in every movie he does moving forward.Chris Pratt: I think we all knew that Chris Pratt was leading man material. "Guardians of the Galaxy" just works to enforce this notion. Pratt, an actor who can seamlessly move back and forth between genres, is more than half of the reason why this comic book movie will be entertaining enough to satisfy your average Marvel movie-goer, while finding an audience with those who would otherwise steer clear of anything "comic book", as he gives both a dramatic and comedic performance as the protagonist Peter Quill (an endearingly overconfident character who maintains an underdog fueled moxie, which stems from his 1980's American upbringing) that is worth the price of admission.Final Thought: "Guardians of the Galaxy" has pretty much everything one could ask for in a superhero movie: An engaging lead, fully developed supporting sub-heroes, a badass villain, comedy, well choreographed action sequences and a raccoon that shoots machine guns. That said, is "Guardians of the Galaxy" the best Marvel adaptation ever made? No. But is it the funniest? Most definitely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marvel took a risk with "Guardians of the Galaxy": it's based on a fairly obscure series about an obscure team made up of obscure characters. While the GotG comics have been around for decades, they just aren't as popular or well known as the X Men, the Avengers or Spider-man. On a related note, the team is made of up morally ambiguous, down &amp; dirty, rough-around-the edges- characters characters who aren't quite upstanding role models like Wolverine, Captain America, and Spidey. Some might even say that Marvel was scraping the the bottom of the barrel, or at least getting close.Well, the risk paid off and there is indeed a reward. This is one the more fun--one could argue it's THE most fun--Marvel Comics movies. It feels like Indiana Jones or the Classic Star Wars Trilogy with colorful characters, thrilling action scenes that aren't so bombastic, and amusing banter. Things are even more fun thanks to a series of 70s hits played over the action at interesting times. The downside may be that it tries TOO hard to be fun, with the plot and humor getting in each other's way or how the more serious moments are almost out of place.Also...don't stick around for the post-credit scene this time. Just wait for the home media release. While other post-credit scenes in previous Marvel movies are interesting &amp; intriguing, leaving you wanting more while setting up future installments, this one...doesn't. That's all I'll say to avoid spoilers.Few people may have been clamoring for a movie based on Guardians of the Galaxy, but many people will like the results. Now they may be clamoring for a sequel...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the 'hooked on a feeling' trailer with the "what a bunch of a-holes" line, I had a feeling that I'd really like this film and abstained from watching any more trailers so that the experience could be as fresh as possible.As the launch date got closer I would read the top line headlines of the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes but not venture further into the body of the review. By the time I was sitting in the chair, waiting for the film to start, my anticipation was definitely peaking and I hoped that it would reward my efforts.Oh how it did.Right off the bat, I was transported into a rich world of characters and a film that wasn't afraid to mix touching scenes with laugh out loud moments. The wonder of the characters and their bickering exchanges, sometimes in the midst of action scenes, was fabulously entertaining and involving.Initially I was concerned that I was being hit with too many characters and would lose track but I understood that the film needed to move along at a pace and was relieved that all the characters were fleshed out enough to make them recognisable and engaging.So many elements made it fun - Star lord's wisecracks, Gamora's fiestiness, Drax's hilarious literalism, Groot's big emotive eyes and Rocket's sense of humour.I thought Lee Pace under a ton of makeup was great as a properly evil bad guy and Michael Rooker, along with many of the other supporting actors, hit his marks to create memorable individuals.The special effects were wonderful but, and this is important, always served the film to visualise the director's vision rather than them be a fall back for a poor story (a la Dawn of the apes).I enjoy the Marvel films but was disappointed with Thor 2 and Cap 2. I felt they become a little formulaic with Thor's over reliance on Loki and the interesting character of Cap being submerged under a tidal wave of empty action scenes.GOTG was a wonderous breath of fresh air. A film that didn't need three films worth of back story to have me engaged but hit me with a plethora of fabulously different characters that I could like and root for from the virtual get go.As an experience, as a jolt of entertainment, I felt this exceeded The Avengers as the final battle had just a bit more weight to it. The film was prepared to kill characters off rather than the rather clone like bad guys of the final Avengers battle. This in turn meant there was more of a threat to the characters and hence you felt more 'on the edge of your seat'.Guardians was a great film and I'm so pleased that Marvel were prepared/brave enough to release James Gunn from the corporate shackles and let him and his script writing partner let themselves go. They've created characters and a universe that I'm desperate to revisit and turned this 42 year old man into a cinema awestruck 9 year old.</fullReview>

Honestly, you're watching a movie with no guaranteed A-listers, from a comic book series almost no one has read.Chris Pratt is the read winner here, as Star Lord is a great character for him. It showcases his abilities as a leading man, as a comic leading man, as an empathetic leading man, and as a rather average leading man. He's good looking, but not in a freakish way. He's funny, but he's serious too.Zoe Saldana has another awesome role to chalk up to her resume. Why this girl isn't a leading lady already is shocking. They should have given her Lucy. She deserves to anchor her own movies.Also, Dave Bautista could be the next The Rock. He doesn't quite have the humor down, but then again neither did Dwayne Johnson when he was in The Mummy Returns. Dave Bautista handles the role of Drax, a character who doesn't understand sarcasm, and takes everything literally, with a tinge of humor that could hint at her having a bigger career.Bradley Cooper adds a bunch of humor to the role of Rocket. I didn't even recognize his voice. Michael Rooker and Lee Pace round out an strong supporting cast.The plot is basically everything you've seen before, reworked for maximum enjoyment. There's an origin story for Peter Quill, a scene right out of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, and a film with a feel of a more comedic version of Star Wars.James Gunn does a magnificent job turning this niche franchise into a fully consumable product, and one that will be remembered favorably. James Gunn, who used to work for Troma, and directed the low-budget Slither, has shown a ton of promise here. I imagine we'll be seeing him directing a lot more in the future.The next Guardians Of The Galaxy film isn't for another 3 years, but that feels about right. You don't want to oversaturate the market, and every two years seems like too much. That's every other year, and for a big franchise like this, it needs room to breathe. More importantly, Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana need to field other movie offers. Saldana has now starred in some of the biggest franchises, including Guardians, Avatar, Star Trek, and even the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise. It's time she got offered roles where she doesn't have to paint herself a bizarre color.Packed with action, laughs, and plenty of great pop culture references, Guardians Of The Galaxy is one of the best films of the summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and Hilarious, A Complete Different Style of Marvel Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailers itself might not entertain all the audiences but Marvel Studio has played its card extremely well by presenting a not-too-familiar superhero characters in a whole new style. It is fun, thrilling, funny; though not as emotional as Days of Future Past, and doesn't end impressively beautiful, the way of demonstrating is much more lighthearted and hilarious than other previous installments. While it is obviously that more than half of its budget is spent on hiring around 10 companies to work on visual effects, the CGIs which nearly covers the entire film does not upset the fans as the plot is overall fine. Star Lord might seems to be buddy of Iron Man due to their slight similarity, both Rocket and Groot have actually stolen most of the screen time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe the impressions are too fresh since I've walked out of the cinema an hour ago, but I'd say this is the best Marvel movie, and I've watched them all. Guardians does not have the superstar team of The Avengers, but has an equal or bigger scale with lots of new territory to explore. I'd vote for watching a new guardians movie over the new Avengers. The movie is rich in special effects, is fun to watch and very entertaining. Every character is unique and memorable. The universe feels truthful and solid.If you haven't ever heard of Guardians or Marvell, still is worth watching if you like sci-fi, action or comedy movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wathced this blockbuster yesterday and i got what i expected.A lot of jokes, all the time, and a action-filled adventure. Coupled with the "earthly" soundtrack it was a pleasant ride.Some issues with the story and it's obsessive need to joke everywhere, even when there was slaughter going on. I guess it's the new normal... not my cup of tea tough. The humor was fitting in some places but over the top in others and excessive in some. The stereotypes was another minus. This kind of easy humor is not my kind of humor but i like it in small quantities.Otherwise an incredibly well-crafted movie on the effect side, and concerning the pacing it flowed pleasantly.7/10 cheers</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Guardians of the Galaxy" is pure unadulterated sci-fi fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I'm not a big Marvel Comics fan, I have no problem admitting that they've found a successful formula for their cinematic universe and stuck by it justifiably. After testing the waters with the "Thor" movies and "Avengers," they've fully committed to the genre and jumped into science fiction territory with "Guardians of the Galaxy."Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) was abducted by intergalactic mercenaries moments after his mother died of cancer. He grew into manhood searching the universe for valuable items to sell to different collectors of all species. After finding a mysterious orb, it seems like everyone in the known galaxy is hunting him down to take possession of it... including the evil Thanos (Josh Brolin). Quill puts together a team of misfits to keep the object out of the villain's deadly clutches.Director / Writer James Gunn has captured the magic of "Star Wars" and mashed it together with the Marvel Universe to give audiences an exciting experience they won't soon forget. "Guardians of the Galaxy" is shameless sci-fi gusto with a healthy shot of humor along the way. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy it. The CGI work for "Guardians of the Galaxy" takes the viewer to so many unusual worlds and leaves you believing you're really there. There were a few spots that took me out of the experience, but I was sucked back in almost immediately. Everyone interacted with the CGI characters and blended well with them on screen. Chris Pratt looked like he was having a little trouble talking to an "X" in early scenes in the film, but he comes around quick enough.The 3D for "Guardians of the Galaxy" is even well-done. There aren't random items constantly jumping out at you off the screen. It simply and successfully used to give the picture depth, which is very rare. Most movies really don't make good use of it or completely go overboard. Each actor in "Guardians of the Galaxy" fully embraces the character they are portraying. You can tell they love what they're doing on screen and are happy to be a part of the ever-growing Marvel Cinematic Universe. Bradley Cooper's voice is unrecognizable as Rocket Raccoon, but definitely shows a range many wouldn't imagine the actor tackling. Chris Pratt is as sarcastically charming as he always is as Peter Quill / Star-Lord.Guardians of the Galaxy is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for some language. I found it interesting that through most of the film, the good guys use shock guns that knock out their enemies like a more powerful Taser. Of course people die, but it seems like the movie is steered in a certain way to make it appropriate for all ages. There are some sexual innuendos, but nothing graphic. The scene in the trailer where Zoe Saldana is taking off her shirt with her green back to the camera isn't even in the film that I remember. There are so many Easter eggs within "Guardians of the Galaxy" for die- hard Marvel Comics fans to look out for. I don't want to spoil anything, but keep your eyes open for a few different treats. Chances are if you blink at any given moment, you'll miss one of them."Guardians of the Galaxy" is pure unadulterated sci-fi fun! Marvel has delivered their version of "Star Wars" for a new generation. It's going to make people want more from its characters and seek out the adventures found in the comic books. I would consider it to be one of the best entries yet on the ever-growing list of Marvel movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great New Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Guardians of the Galaxy", starring Chris Pratt-Parks and Recreation_t.v., Wanted; Zoe Saldana-Columbiana, Avatar; Dave Bautista- Riddick, The Man With the Iron Fists; the voice of Vin Diesel-the Fast &amp; the Furious movies, Saving Private Ryan and the voice of Bradley Cooper- the Hangover movies, Alias_t.v.This is the start of a new franchise for Marvel Comics. It's based on a lesser-known book that was started in the 1960's, got canceled and then re-launched over the years. This movie is based on the 2008 version of the books. The story starts in 1988, when a little boy named Peter Quill loses his mother to cancer and is then abducted and raised by aliens. Chris plays the older version of Peter, or as he becomes known as, Starlord. Chris has become a thief and is after a mysterious orb that several other people are also after. Zoe-Gamora-is one of those other people and she is also the adopted daughter of Thanos-remember him from the end credits of the Avengers? Vin voices Groot, a sort of living tree with a very limited vocabulary-'I am Groot' is all that he ever says-and Bradley voices Rocket, a highly intelligent raccoon that has been surgically altered with cybernetics and can also talk. Thanos hires Ronan the Accuser to also go after the orb after Zoe fails in her attempt and the newly forming Guardians run into their latest member Dave-Drax-who has a need to kill Ronan for his own personal reasons. The Collector from the end credits of Thor makes an appearance, too. Chris uses a cassette Walkman to play music-there is a reason he uses it, instead of some more modern device-and there is a lot of 1970's &amp; 1980's songs heard throughout the film. Stan Lee does make his cameo as well as a few others. I saw the IMAX 3D version and it was well worth it. The effects are great, the story is good, the actors look the parts and there is plenty of humor, along with the action-the whole vibe sort of reminded me of the old t.v. show called Firefly. There is a scene just as the end credits start, plus another scene after the end credits-and the second one involves a different Marvel character that had his own movie, back in the 1980's. It's rated "PG-13" for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 1 minute. This is a good origin story and I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super-fun time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Guardians of the Galaxy is Marvel's newest and boldest movie about a rad-tag group of galactic outlaws who end up teaming up to save the galaxy! If that sounds cool and you think it should look like a Marvel Star Trek/Star Wars crossover than you are right! Because it rocked.-It was funny, well written, and had its touching moments with some killer action. It was SUPER funny actually. There was a lot to like and little to dislike I think.-The plot sounds absurd and you just have to go with it! If you have fun action movies like the A-Team than you won't like it. It really is a super fun story though! (Also, unlike other Marvel films) you really don't need to know anything about the story/characters at all! (Although it is not a bad idea to be caught up on some Marvel films like Thor 2) -The film has a very cliché feel and is a pretty predictable film with its conveniences, but it is still loads of fun! -The cast did well. Chris Pratt (Star Lord) nailed it and was very entertaining. Zoe Saldana (Gamora) and Lee Pace (Ronan) did pretty well, but the show stealers were Dave Bautista (Drax), Vin Diesel (Groot), and Bradly Cooper (Rocket)! The three characters were fun and hilarious and perfect with the actors! -The music was good, but not that memorable.-The effects were good. Not exactly Apes good, but good.-The content was PG-13. No nudity and not too much violence. Action and some language. It is not a young kid movie, but it is not horrible.-So Guardians of the Galaxy is not a super complex artwork of cinema, but it didn't try to be and it doesn't need to be! It is a super fun time and totally worth seeing in theaters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that I am going to start this review by saying that I cannot believe that the writer/director of a stinker film like Movie 43 actually also had a hand in writing and directed this film. James Gunn has completely redeemed himself, because Movie 43 was one of the worse films I have ever seen. Guardians of the Galaxy had a great story line and the acting was comical with non-stop action. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is a galaxy scavenger (thief) who goes around collecting stuff that other people have commissioned him to acquire. That being said, he acquires an orb that apparently is very valuable to a lot of people. This sets up the film and the adventure begins. Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick Groot (Vin Diesel) are some sort of bounty hunters and soon discovers that someone will pay a lot of money to bring in Peter (and his orb). During the film, the only words that Groot knows how to say are "I am Groot", but somehow Rocket has learned to understand him by his inflection rather than his words. This makes for a very endearing relationship. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) volunteers to get the orb from Peter and the evil Ronan (Lee Pace) agrees to let her go. The initial scene when all of these characters finally encounter one another was very funny and you kind of get to see what all of them are capable of (as far as fighting ability goes). Drax (Dave Bautista) joins the group shortly after the initial meeting. At first Drax is very self-absorbed and really has his own agenda (pretty much like everyone else), but soon comes to realize that the more the merrier (or whatever). The making of the sequel is already scheduled for 2017. I imagine that we will find out who Peter's father was because that is really the only cliff hanger in this film. Stan Lee made his usual cameo appearance as an elderly playboy (really?). Hell, I guess when you own so many characters you have the right to be whoever the heck you want to be. I recently downloaded an app called "Run Pee" which tells you when the best time to go to the restroom is during a movie. The app said there is no good time for this film. Maybe while they are running the credits, but come back because we all know how marvel does it. Great film!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good outing with a less known Marvel property.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Short Version: Peter Quill AKA Star Lord, played by Chris Pratt, recovers an engraved metal orb from a barren planet. Said orb contains an infinity stone and Ronan, a renegade Kree, is after it so that he can wreak havoc on the galaxy. Quill hooks up with Gamora, Rocket and Groot, and Drax while they are in prison after a scuffle for the orb. The patchwork team works at first to sell the stone, but then later they try to keep Ronan from destroying the planet Xandar using the stone's power.The film has great visuals and plenty of action, but the acting and dialog flag in the first half. That's not to say the movie is awful, but there are some cringe-inducing lines sprinkled about. Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista are the major culprits with acting that gets pretty bad in spots, but they pick it up in the second half of the show.On a more positive note, the film plot is solid and there are snappy scenes with dialog that is spot on. Bautista's acting and lines are awful in some bits(see above), but in other scenes he gets Drax's literal interpretation of language and the comedy that results just right. Rocket and Groot are another source of laughs, with Rocket's sourpuss snarkiness holding up well as he translates Groot's three word vocabulary. Chris Pratt delivers a good performance with dialog that edges on cheese, but the joke is that the character knows it and lays it on thick.The film also contains comic book action, so extra suspension of disbelief is needed in some scenes. Pratt goes outside in space in a couple shots and only suffers a minor chill. Saldana is blown up in a spacecraft and floats in open space as well with no ill consequences. Science purists will likely grouse, but the film is about superheroes doing super deeds in a fantastic universe.Verdict: The writing is intelligent with just a few rough acting patches, and the action is great. And there are high quality gems in the dialog between the characters. Although Bautista's Drax has some of the poorer line deliveries in spots, he drops genius dialog in other scenes. Overall, the film is well worth buying a ticket to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hooligans make the best heroes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The newest addition to Marvel's movie universe, Guardians of the Galaxy is about unlikely group of space ruffians with questionable motives brought together to be the protectors the galaxy.Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) a ravager who steals an orb for an unknown buyer when the market calls. The evil Ronan seeks the orb for an unknown menacing purpose and sends his assassin Gamora to retrieve it. Zoe Saldana, who plays Gamora, is once again no longer flesh toned, but lucky for her she makes green look great too! Bounty hunters Rocket and Groot, brain and brawn respectively, who attempt to capture Quill for his bounty and get entangled in the orb's fate. Lastly there is Drax, a nippleless massive brute of a man donned in red tattoos and apparently allergic to shirts, along for the ride while seeking revenge and retribution. Dave Bautista, of WWE stardom, is a gem of a casting as Drax and the source of many a laugh and my favorite of the guardians.At first, the film works feverishly but clumsily to lay the foundation for the plot and rest of the movie. Perhaps with more care, and a few more edits in the script, the introductions would have been a bit more nuanced and maximized the effectiveness of each scene. The beginning was a bit slow moving, the action scenes were expected and, at this point in the game, cliché. Once the five guardians and hooligans team up though, it's just pure entertainment with solid action scenes. There were definitely some plateaus and lulls during the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy (GotG) but in the end it was just plain fun, funny and ultimately very enjoyable with good unique jokes and interesting characters.Special effects guys earn their paycheck once again - in space there is a lot of body paint and prostheses, even on extras. It is weird to think how far we've come with CGI, I was never distracted and it seems like the FX team didn't spare any minutiae. But with two main characters, Rocket and Groot voiced by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel, being completely computer generated, every mouth movement, every hair follicle, every detail was on point and my figurative hat goes off to the entire team who worked on GotG.Guardians of the Galaxy seemed poised to lay the groundwork for an even better plot in the future - like it was a part one of a series. Don't get me wrong, it was great, entertaining and everything you want from a movie-theater-movie-experience, but I kept feeling like it could be excellent with a bit more time invested to soften the hard edges of the script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here an unusual group of heroes get together to save the Galaxy. Good performances all around. If you liked Zoe Saldana when she was blue you'll like her green. Bradley Cooper as Rocket likes to steal things and his performance steals every scene.The movie contains a "Star Wars" Death Star type plot and assorted bad and worse guys. There is plenty of who's fighting who sci-fi action but the movie works best when it isn't taking itself too seriously. The satire provides many light moments.Don't worry if you can't keep track of what's happening as there is plenty of dialogue exposition to tell you why, where and what the heroes have to do next.The movie should be enjoyed on the big screen with big sound. If you stay through the lengthy credits you'll get to see a cameo by a little remembered character from a flop movie from 1986. A big box office assures we will see more of these Gaurdians of the Galaxy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Fun Romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is a weird idea from its inception. When you describe even the main characters people will ask questions. It isn't easily understandable why they can't do something because the material asks much more than they can completely contain in a 2 hour film. Guardians of the Galaxy is just a fun romp.We begin our story with Peter Quill/Star Lord. We start with his mothers death and then we get to go to his space adventures. His trying to collect this sphere which many people want for different reasons that include our main villains Ronan and Thanos. We also got to see this group of crazy criminals to connect into the Guardians of the Galaxy.I find that each character is very well cast. Chris Pratt is incredible as Star Lord because he can play the silly kind of character that gets thrust into leadership and becomes the perfect leader to this rag tag group. Bradley Cooper's voice is perfect because he is really cocky and you sometimes don't even recognize him in the role. He is absolutely hilarious and you can tell that he put some real effort into the role.My favorite character is hands down Groot. Groot is something so weird and out there that I didn't know if I would like it. I thought that maybe hiss repeated line of I am Groot would get old, but I didn't get that feeling at all. He is just so well done and Vin Diesel is such a perfect voice that I can't hear anyone else in the role.If there any weak links in our hear characters, it would be Drax and Gamora. I never thought that Zoe Saldana was a bad casting, but at the beginning she didn't feel like an immediate fit, but I found that as her character developed in the film she got much better. Dave Bautista isn't a horrible casting choice, but I thought his character was really just misused until the last thirty minutes where he finally gets flushed out really well. But both of their characters still deliver some hilarious lines that you can't not laugh at him not understanding the culture of Earth.Through the source material, there is a lot to explain and I felt that sometimes they were just explaining the back story to the audience and no of this was included in the hilarious prison line up scene. I found that sometimes the story just deliberately explain what was going.Marvel again spares no expense on the special effects. This movie is beautiful and has some of the best effects in a Marvel film. It is incredible how well our two CGI characters blend with our three tangible characters without feeling like they are talking to a green screen.James Gunn really had some great direction in this film and his crazy style fits very well to this story and material. I find that the pop culture references are really fun. Sometimes I think they over stay their welcome at some points losing some of this films own identity, but they didn't get on my nerves that much.The really disappointing thing about this film is that the villains aren't really fleshed out at all. Karen Gillan has some character development and has somewhere to go, but needs some more time to get a true feel of what she is about. The main villain Ronan has no character at all and gets only like 5 minutes of screen time and only seems to do what he does because the script says he does.I find that some of the minor characters like Glenn Close and John C. Reilly don't hit the mark as well as I wanted it to, but Yondu played by Michael Rooker is a surprise treat that has a lot more to do than I thought he was going in.This story spreads thin in some spots as well as having some weak characters and mainly villains, but I laughed at a good 90 to 95 percent of the film and just had the most fun watching any Marvel film. The 5 Guardians are great and the writing defies a lot more convention than you might think as well as hiding some really cool tidbits for fans of not only the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but the Guardians of the Galaxy comic as well. An enjoyable film that deserves a 3.25 out of 4 stars.Now I want to hear from you. Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy? Are you going to check it out? Comment below and let me know. Thanks and remember that I love nerd movies and I am an addict.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real joy ride of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a soft spot for movies that take themselves with tons of levity and still do it properly. That is, while not regarding themselves with undue seriousness, still make the movie with the required amount of professional approach. Guardians of the Galaxy are topping the list on these accounts. The pace is relentless, the characters are "out of this world" (and you can take it as literally as you want). Acting is first class the plot is not as important (hence the 8 rating) but just like it worked in the R.E.D. movies, it works here. Nobody cares how much sense there's to the development of the narrative when watching it is so much fun. And as a native of the previous century - the inter movie jokes are super - written and delivered perfectly. This one may be an 8 rated movie but it feels like a 10. After watching a few great movies last month that for all intents and purposes felt like a medicine against feeling too happy, I sure liked the change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hooked On a Guardian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is flat out the funniest Marvel movie to date, and the most daring property they have brought to grace the silver screen. It takes the Marvel universe from strictly earth heroes to thugs, thieves, and assassins that are forced into becoming heroes. Upon announcing the film would go into production last year, I was very worried that it drastically shift the current tone of the universe and in return not bring enough audience into the theaters to see the film. Well I was wrong on both fronts. The trailers sold it as a space epic that doesn't take itself too seriously. Which is exactly what it turned out to be. Films that are self aware are smartest. Plus when a film has a talking raccoon who shoots rockets how serious can it be? The cast was absolutely perfect. Chris Pratt is a star who has some of the best comedic timing in the business. Zoe Saldana is as BA as Scarlett Johansson is as Black Widow. Dave Bautista was a pleasant surprise as Drax for a wrestler turned actor. And how can I forget Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel as Rocket and Groot respectively, who by the way steal the entire film. I was pretty surprised at how little some of the supporting characters were in the film though. Glenn Close, Djimon Hounsou, John C, Reilly, and Benicio Del Toro were basically cameo roles. I did think Ronan was pretty one note and a typical superhero villain. Much like Malekith in Thor, Ronan lacked relatable characteristics and wasn't nearly as charismatic or intimidating for that matter as I would have liked.The whole film looks beautiful but I will say I would have liked to see more of Xandar and it's people. The people in this galaxy never look like the next person, which does throw you off a little bit. Like I said, this is one of the strangest superhero movies, and movies in general that I have seen. Id like to think I know a lot about Marvel characters but there are so many characters in this film that I had no clue who they were. So for the general audience, it may seem a bit too distant from other superhero movies for their liking.For as great as each of the guardians were and how many great one liners there were between the 5, I don't think there's one big action scene that I will remember from this movie. The film itself is most definitely memorable but with these big superhero movies you always think of the action scenes. With Avengers it's the assemble scene fighting the chitari. With The Dark Knight it's the truck flip. With X-Men it's Magneto hovering with sentinels. And with Man of Steel it's the Smallville fight and the neck snap. Guardians will be remembered more for it's great laughs which is fine, but it's something to improve upon for round 2.So overall I really enjoyed this summer blockbuster and it's quite the movie-going experience. I think it can be enjoyed by virtually anyone and the great thing is you don't have to have seen any previous Marvel movie to understand the plot. I brought my girlfriend, who hadn't seen a single Marvel film to date and she had a blast with it. I am sure I will be seeing it at least one more time. By the way, I was stunned they went the route they did with the after credits scene.+Funniest superhero movie to date +Brings Marvel to the cosmos! +Groot and Rocket are incredibly charming and lead a perfect cast +Self aware+Everything looks beautiful +Memorable soundtrack -No defining action sequence -Ronan was bleh 8.7/10SECOND VIEWING 9.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crazy Uncle of the Marvel Family, Guardians of the Galaxy is the comic book wild card that entertains from start to finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Marvel enterprise has been practically saved by Disney as it's become more structured, more organized, more successful, and less prone to ill decisions since the buyout from the House of Mouse. Love or hate them, Disney knows how to draw up profits from any smaller company----just ask Pixar. And Guardians of the Galaxy is pretty much the assertion that the Marvel universe and comic book movies are here to stay as they took even one of the more obscure and pulp cult hit comics and transformed it into a big budget hearty fest of entertainment.Guardians of the Galaxy is a film that works but should not work because of the content and the heavy tongue-in-cheek humor, as well as containing a cast that hardly has the appeal of an Iron Man or a Captain America. For crying out loud, we have a regular joe, a tree, a raccoon, and a condensed version of the Hulk amongst the main characters. The comic book it's based on is meant to be a Scott Pilgrim type of cult hit that engages with a specific niche audience, but I assure you that it stands perfectly on par with the other Marvel films without overkilling itself.What mainly allows for newcomers and veterans to the franchise to warm up to the characters and the premise is the major focus on character development, fresh script, and also providing a beautiful blend of sci-fi action and rambunctious humor that dances along the PG-13/R line. Although the diehards were probably hoping for Disney to truly let this movie get unleashed, they should be satisfied with the fact that this movie is definitely the dirtiest, rowdiest, and most gutterball of the Marvel bunch. James Gunn holds very little back as we see plenty of dark humor sprinkled on nearly every scene.The outstanding cast also allows for the movie to flourish. Chris Pratt (Peter), Bradley Cooper (perfectly voicing Rocket), Zoe Saldana (Rising up the sci-fi queen ranks), Dave Bautista, and even Michael Rooker (small role, but steals the show as one of the antagonists) portray their characters perfectly without missing a beat and intertwine themselves with the heavy amount of special effects without any issues. The production value here is top-notch as we've come an extremely long way from 70s Superman.If there is something that Man of Steel (ugh.....) has proved, it's that special effects should not be the main hull but the icing of the cake. James Gunn does a fantastic job by giving everyone their moment to shine and allowing the audience to root for them. Unfortunately, Marvel still hasn't really given us a great villain outside the lines of Loki within the past decade, as we have several throwaway villains here that don't have much screen time or much personality either. Luckily the heroes and anti-heroes are far too much fun to watch to make up for the dullness coming from the evil side.Disney/Marvel has quietly revolutionized the film industry by providing us a yearly dosage of films that are connected heavily amongst each other by putting them in the same timeline. It almost makes for a required viewing of each Marvel film in order to be caught up and anticipate the next major blockbuster. So in other words as long as Marvel plans on using the dozens of heroes within its repertoire and maintain it in the same universe, they will not run out of movie ideas for at least a couple decades.Guardians of the Galaxy may have been a cult classic comic book with a quiet history. But thanks to a great script, great cast, and great direction and production value, this new franchise will fit and blend perfectly with Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and whatever else Marvel decides (and is legally allowed) to throw in between Avengers movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must Watch,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like action, humor, cheesy jokes that will leave you breathless. If you enjoy watching people excel into who they are meant to be in a way never before expressed on screen, or at least presented in a manner that will keep you at the edge of your seat. If you love quirky events that move slowly that no person can accomplish without the art of digital enhancement. If you enjoy seeing people get confused by metaphors, and out of this world puns. Guardians of the Galaxy is the movie for you.I just watched this film, and it blew my mind away. Was it the best movie I have seen so far? I honestly don't know, judging movies that way is not my style. I can tell you one thing though, I have never witnessed a phenomena of movies brought together. A successful transition from comic, to movie. Not just one movie, or one comic series, but a whole universe brought together simply because someone had a vision of greatness. Not to mention Stan Lee's cameo was great in this film.I had the pleasure of watching this movie in an X-Motion seat, also known as D-Box. D-Box is a chair that will move during the duration of the film, at least during the action scenes. I've seen a few movies in this seat ranging from Man of Steel, Journey 2, Transformers, Lucy, and Star Trek: Into Darkness. None of those movies were worth the price to watch in those seats. But Guardians of the Galaxy, this movie people, is worth every cent just to watch it in those seats. This movie is worth checking out. I can't promise you will like it, or love it. But you will never know.Go, immerse yourself into the mystery promised by the cut scene shown at the end of The Avengers. I don't make movie reviews that often, but just go see it. And Slap your face at the out of this world puns you will find within.Mr. Flare out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take this review with as many grains of salt as you like, as I had the flu when I watched it, and I am 61 years old.3 of the main characters could be mapped too easily to Star Wars characters. Peter Quill -&gt; Han Solo (w/ a little Luke thrown in), Gamara -&gt; Leah, Groot -&gt; Chewy, (did not see Rocket as any SW character)Special effects? Many say visually stunning, to me it was sometimes visually confusing, especially some of the space battle scenes. This could be the 61-year old, flu-ridden brain just not able to keep up. But my sense is it was too much of a good thing.Groot delivered an emotionally-engaging performance with a 3-word vocabulary. The others, not so much.Perhaps I'll re-watch it after some time has passed and see if my opinion changes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you took an infinite number of 12 year olds, threw them into a room with an equal number of typewriters, this is the script they'd come up with.I can't believe anyone above pre-adolescence would praise this film on any level.A massive CGI b-film with acting and dialogue to match, this movie is as high-budget as they come, but delivers junk food cinema to the pre-teen and adult with pre-teen tastes who thinks the latest Marvel-Disney offering is Oscar material.No, the film was not too fast for me. Yes, I could follow the story in spite of the massive load of special effects. Yes, I knew who "Thanos" was from the Marvel pantheon of bad guys. But, no, I did not think this was a good movie, and in fact thought it stunk to high heaven.The plot was idiotic. The subplot was marginally interesting. The world in which the characters in habit is never fully explained, and the "Guardians" don't seem to have a lot of others of their species in this sci-fi setting.Not only that, but the whole "destroy / conquer the universe" trope is just too stupid beyond belief. At some time you need to ask yourself why the bad guy is doing what they're doing. That's what makes them bad guys in the first place. When you don't have that, you don't have a movie.I can't believe I wasted my time on this trash heap. At least I checked it out at the library, and didn't waste one red cent on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films in the MCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy exceeded all expectations. Marvel took a risk with this film. Few had heard about the Guardians of the Galaxy, and even I, a huge Marvel fan, knew nothing about them. But this film changed all of that. Now everyone knows about Peter Quill (Star-Lord, man), Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket the Raccoon, and Groot. The soundtrack is incredible, the acting if top-notch, the characters are charming and surprisingly deep, the special effects are some of the best out there, the story is great, and it ties into other Marvel films. I only hope that we can one day see a film that combines all of the MCU (and by 'a film' I mean Infinity War Parts One and Two), and brings the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers, Earth's Mightiest Heroes, together. This movie will make you laugh, cry, and dance. If you have not already (what rock have you been living under?), check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I would normally not go watch a film like this my children forced it on me. I was surprised by the quality of not only the script but the CGI. The actors were funny and well developed. Each had a story and the movie went back and forth between humor and specific topics like death,birth, friendship and trust. Like I said, it's just best to look at Guardians of the Galaxy from a larger viewpoint and call it one of the most entertaining, fun, thrilling, heartfelt and happy pictures I've seen. The movie brings together a small collection of strange, disparate heroes/anti-heroes from the world of Marvel Comics who unite as a team and stop a dangerous enemy from killing a world. Going deeper, however, it's a story about five lost-but-adventurous souls who have experienced tremendous loss in their lives and begin to discover a way to start putting all of the pieces back together.I would recommend catching it on DVD, Netflix or where ever. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am going to start with that I am a little biased when it comes to Comic Book Movies. This is one of my favorite genres now, I used to love horror but in the last few years the rise of comic book movies has exploded.My wife and I went to see this movie right away after release. Between the wicked reminders of the music I grew up with and the comical antics of Star lord, it was impossible for me and my wife to not have a great time. Bright crisp colors, stunning fast passed visuals, great effects that deserved the big screen. The music and effects just riled us up more as the story unfolded. Serious comic book action.I don't want to give away anything about the movie for the chance that someone out there has not seen it. How that could happen i don't get it. But I will always do my best to not include anything from a movie in my "reviews".</fullReview>

Chris Pratt was great in the role of Star Lord, but great casting all around. Visually the movie also great, even in 3D. I'm glad that this movie did well because I think that Chris Pratt is a very underrated actor. I think the sequel will do better then this movie now that they got the origin story out of the way. Just like Captain America the movie was great but the second installment was even better due to the character growth. As long as them just keep the cast small with the 5 main characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak script, lazy direction or poor characters?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As most of the audience out there, I enjoy Marvel films. They're cleverly written to please the viewer a brain-resting title that makes you feel accomplished, part of something bigger and, most of all, doesn't make you feel uncomfortable. I wasn't dying to watch Guardians of the Galaxy for two reasons: I didn't know about that specific Marvel group of heroes and the marketing image built around it gave me the feeling that it wasn't for me. Something changed, several people made positive comments about it therefore I watched it. I was pretty excited at the idea of another brain-resting enjoyable marvel film (you know where I'm going here). The all film was a disappointment. Chris Pratt didn't get the sympathy he was desperately looking for with his melancholic mix tape. Rocket the raccoon tried to lift the humor of the film with few quite amusing episodes, but overall he also didn't make me want to care. Neytiri.. oh no, I meant... Gamora was cold an distant from the story itself. I felt I spent two hours watching at the desperate attempts of the cast of getting my attention, when I could really only focus and enjoy on Vin Diesel's brilliant performance. I don't know if it was a poor script or if James Gunn didn't feel as inspired with this cast as with Sarah Michelle Gellar and friends. Maybe it's just the fact that not all the characters from the Marvel jar of Superheroes can be turned into cinema. I was disappointed, therefore I will a bit more doubt the Marvel productions coming up next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Watch! 9/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I really enjoyed this movie! The director mixed up the comedy with intense action, just right and the individual characters all brought a different flavour to this well made movie. The script is very well written and the action scenes are impressive. Personally, the thing that surprised me was how funny the movie was. I really wasn't expecting there to be so much wit in a movie in this genre. That is what makes the movie original and a joy to watch, especially the soundtrack which cracked me up. The tree and the raccoon were brilliant and I loved the little bonus scene at the end. Anyway, I can't wait to see the sequel and I hope that they bring back the original characters who made this epic film so great. Brilliant!Round-Up: Chris Pratt, who has starred in movies like the Five-Year Engagement, 10 Years and the Delivery Man, was a great choice by the director. His comedic style of acting really works and he's a great leader to such a versatile crew. When I saw that Dave Bautista was in the film, I really wasn't expecting that much from his usual terrible acting, but he was surprisingly, a brilliant addition to this crazy bunch. Zoe Saldana has made some excellent choices in her career. Not only has she starred in the biggest film ever, she has also had major roles in the new Star Trek and Colombian. With some brief scenes with Djimon Hounsou, Glenn Close and Benicio Del Toro, this movie has really been thought through properly and it has to be one of my favourites for this year.Budget: $170million Worldwide Gross: $771million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their comedic space movies about a man called Quill who steals the Orb and tries to protect it from getting in the wrong hands, with the help of his new found friends. 9/10</fullReview>

Watching Guardians of the Galaxy i had this feeling again, the movie runs in a very good rhythm and the 2 hours are right used. The construction of the characters is absolutely well done, in 30 minutes we already are identified with them and the group is concreted.The motivation for all the events is a good one and all this events are more than enough to pay for the tickets. The return of the characteristics of the 80's movie and the action that can remember Scooby Doo may make strange the movie at first, but the happiness brought by the Guardians and all their individuality will convince you that this is the best Heroes movie of 2014.Waiting for Guardians 2#WeAreGroot #Brazil</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard a lot of people talking about this movie longer before I saw the actually preview for it. When I did see the preview, I was excited to watch a movie with creatures and action that looked so, well, awesome. During the movie, I was surprised at how well the directors and actors mixed comedy and action. Normally this type of mixture doesn't turn out entirely well, however Gaurdians of the Galaxy did an absolutely flawless job. I was so amazed at how awesome this movie actually was that i wanted to watch it all over again. (Totally buying the movie when it comes out) There wasn't profanity, that was noticeable. There wasn't nudity, and there wasn't a whole lot of action and minimal comedy. The comedy and action were balanced, and during the movie there was tons of oldies playing and being sung. (Loved that part a lot). This movie is a must see, for kids and adults.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. First of all, I'm not a comic book reader, so it doesn't come by a surprise that I wouldn't know who the hell are the Guardians of the Galaxy. After watching this movie, I know pretty much everything about them. They are a brave, comical superheroes team who try to defend the Galaxy at all cost.The story is interconnected with the Avengers storyline (we see many easter eggs throughout the movie) and it's beautifully crafted. One of my favorite characters is gotta be Groot (I am Groot!), I love him! He's such a sympathetic living tree and Rocket is a comical, badass talking raccoon (Oh...YEAH!). He is also an asshole, but that's part of the film charm. Peter Quill, Gamora and Drax are also relatable and likable characters (I simply love the actors) Thanos makes a small appearance, however he instantly becomes a remarkable character for future sequels and films. Ronan is also a powerful villain and makes you feel no one can stop him. The comedy works perfectly and the eye-popping special effects can't be missed as well. I think James Gunn did an excellent job while directing this flick.Better than The Avengers? It's a tough call, but The Avengers is slightly better (more because of the action). But that doesn't stop Guardians of the Galaxy from being a perfect entry in Marvel Cinematic Universe and a thrilling movie for all the ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprising treat that I"m happy to say works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching the trailers for James Gunn's "Guardians of the Galaxy" and scratching my head in confusion. A science fiction comedy set in the comic book world of Marvel's Avengers? It didn't add up to me along with the 1960s-70s soundtrack. However, all of these different things add up to make one of the best summer blockbusters of the year.With a script co-written by Nicole Perlman, Gunn introduces us to a new part of the Marvel's Avengers universe with Chris Pratt leading the group as Peter Quill, who likes to call himself Star Lord. Pratt is great as Quill. He's able to do everything in this role, from the action scenes to dramatic moments to dancing on a strange planet. Pratt is joined with a green Zoe Saldana as the assassin Gamora, the very literal and muscular Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), the ferocious and hilarious raccoon Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and the simple tree creature Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). Although they are visual effects, Cooper and Diesel are great as the scene stealing duo. They always come in at the right moment and have the right thing thing to say or do. All these characters have some loss that defines them. Gunn does a great job of combining that pain with laughter and making these characters feel real. Perlman and Gunn's script is quirky and action packed. They follow a comic book movie formula, but always add a little twist to complement the strange and fun characters we follow. It's nice to see a big budget movie like this play around with itself. "Guardians of the Galaxy" feels like Edgar Wright's "Shaun of the Dead." It's great for its genre, but also adds great, witty humor to it.Tyler Bates does a good job with the score, but its the 60s and 70s songs that you'll remember. The songs work so well and help give the film its edge. It seems odd at first, but they fit right in. Ben Davis' cinematography is epic and colorful. He gets to work with many colors with the backdrop of space behind him. The visual effects are also top notch. It's a very good looking film.You don't necessarily have to watch the other Marvel's Avengers film in order to understand this one. "Guardians of the Galaxy" is a very new part to this universe. The films that would help a little are both the Thor films and Joss Whedon's "The Avengers." There are little things that hint at these films.Gunn's "Guardians of the Galaxy" is a fun film that delivers both laughs and blockbuster action. It can be wacky and strange at times, but it's a really good film that keeps you engaged. Everything that I thought would go wrong for this film actually worked. It's a nice surprise for the end of this summer that is worth treating yourself to.</fullReview>

It's an action+comedy movie with great fight scenes and moments you'll die laughing at Bradley's jokes and GROOT :PAs you already know....The ends are always the best.Marvel brought comedy into superhero action movies unlike The Dark Knight series which are quite serious...though I wouldn't want to compare the both.Though this movie has new superheroes who are actually losers and good for nothing... it is an awesome movie. In a way, all of us at a point of time in our lives too think of ourselves as losers...so we all could connect to that and later on achieve the impossible. The avengers were already famous and had the hype too. But, this movie with complete newbie characters still is equally good as Avengers.I'm sure you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts with Peter Quill, kidnapped by a spaceship as a kid, he's then seen on an alien planet retrieving an orb. But he soon meets Korath but escapes. His buyer in Xandar refuses to buy the orb after hearing the name Ronan associated with it. Immediately after that Gamora jumps him for the orb and Rocket and Groot join the fight, in subdue Quill for Yondu's bounty. They all get captured by the Nova Corps and sent into prison where they meet Drax. Quill talks Drax out from killing Gamora and soon the five embark on a quite comical escape. Gamora lead the group to Nowhere to meet with The Collector. The Collector reveals the powerful stone inside the orb and an accident happens. The group escape but when they're outside it runs out that Drax sends a signal that summons Ronan and Nebula. Drax go to fight Ronan while Nebula chases Quill, Rocket and Gamora. Ronan bested Drax, while Nebula manages to destroy Gamora's pod and left her to die after taking the stone. Quill saves Gamora by giving her his mask and calling out for Yondu. After talking out a deal with Yondu and a comical standoff with Rocket, The group rallies again devising a plan to save Xandar from Ronan. After Quill calls the Nova Corps to warn about Xandar the group and Yondu go to battle in Xandar's skies. Rocket and Yondu pierce a hole on Ronan's ship and the rest of the group breaches it. Gamora faces Nebula, Drax handles Korath, and Rocket helps the Nova Corps handle Ronan's fighter ships. The four reaches Ronan but Quill firing Rocket's special cannon does nothing to him. Rocket slams Quill's ship to where Ronan is. That makes Ronan's ship plummets down even more unstoppably, so Groot grows his tendrils and cocoons the other four. Quill, Gamora, Rocket and Drax survived, but Ronan is still unharmed. After a speech by Ronan, Quill distracts him while Rocket and Drax shoot at his hammer, releasing the stone on it. Quill grabs the stone, but like what it did at the Collector's, it starts to take Quill's life. Gamora, Rocket and Drax instinctively grab on Quill, and the stone's power is spread between them and they kill Ronan with it.The story rolls out slowly just for the first three or four minutes, and then it's a hell of a ride after that. The pace is very quick with just enough moments to slow down and breathe a little, yet it never stops actually. I like how the story completes out the background very well for Peter Quill, although the same can't really be said about the other four main characters. The mood is very nice, crazy action and all the hilarious jokes you can laugh at. The action is nice. I was anticipating that the action will be quite boring since I expected to see the usual laser shootouts, m?lée blade fights, and heavy personal artillery fires, pretty much what there is in a typical space based action movie. But this movie contains the awesome m?lée smack down action with well designed moves nicely performed and edited stunts.Especially on the jokes, they make this movie into one of the best jokes in superhero/comic based movies. They very much laughable and enjoyable. What's even better is that they're not scarce to find. And also they come in many forms, not only the classic one-liner dialog, but also practical jokes, references, and long duration call backs.The acting is a nice overall. Chris Pratt gets the character of free minded yet past-bound bounty hunter nicely. Zoe Saldana and Karen Gillian gets the action scenes nice enough. Bradley Cooper can really make all Rocket's scenes enjoyable. Vin Diesel is the one who needed to make the least effort for his one line dialog almost the entire movie.The props, sets and makeup do their job nicely. But the thing that is praise worthy is the visual effects and photography combination. The right amount of light plays, combined with the right angles and pans and zooms make the scenes both enjoyable and enable them to deliver the story well.From me, Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) is worth an 8 out of 10 score and a definite recommendation to go and see in the movies. It is very enjoyable both on the action and comedy sides.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's Gamble Pays Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The love child of "Mass Effect 2," "Chronicles of Riddick," and "Star Trek 09" all while being starred by Han Solo. "Guardians of the Galaxy's" pacing is very awkward and sporadic. The humor feels overabundant and forced at times, like as if Marvel was spitballing jokes figuring if they shot enough, then a few were bound to stick. Luckily, the movie does a solid enough job with its characters to keep most of the humor feeling organic. The action, though vivid, tends to drag. The dialogue ricochets back and forth between good and cringe-worthy. But the movie also spits in the face of clichés with quirkiness which creates adorable results. The set pieces are gorgeous too, you'll find yourself gazing around the scenery amidst all the commotion.As for the cast, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel really steal the show as Rocket and Groot respectively. Vin channels "The Iron Giant" and shows us why characters like him and Groot are so lovable. This is not to say the others are bad, Zoe Saldana works with what she's given but Bautista does stand out as the weakest of the group. Chris Pratt though seemed in his element and his performance could very well be what "rockets" him into being Marvel's next big thing!The soundtrack is amazing, the costumes are fantastic, especially Nebula's, and Easter eggs are scattered everywhere just waiting to be found.Marvel took a gamble, and it's safe to say it paid off. This isn't Marvel's best film, but it is far far from the worst. Guardians of the Galaxy's wide range of humor, wonderful set pieces and color cast of characters will keep you enthralled in this scifi/comedy/epic. It's well worth a watch for the soundtrack alone. It begins the set up with big-bad, Thanos, and provides exposition on the infinity stones for the audience. If you are an MCU fan, then "Guardians of the Galaxy" is a must-see, if not, it is still totally worth it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-fi, comics, heroes, action and fun... A pleasant surprise....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Got to hold my hands up here! When I first saw the poster and saw the name of the film, I groaned thinking this was going to be something akin to the straight to video sci-fi stuff from the eighties (just updated). Keesh and cheap, but I was wrong. This is wonderful.We have here an original enough story of a motley crew who together end up being out to stop the destruction of some intergalactic worlds. We have a man from the 80s, a lovely kick-ass lady, a genetically modified raccoon, a big alien strong man a walking tree! It's different but trust me the humour flows, the characters are heart-warming, the story is fun and the action is well paced.Various good stars in this but they are either secondary or in some other form (for example the raccoon). It all just works! You wouldn't think it would but it really does.Wonderful stuff, already looking forward to more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Solid Summer Blockbuster!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What has been said to be Marvel's biggest gamble ever, is looking to pay off massively; And well, for good reason. GOTG is a hell of a fun ride from start to finish. It knows exactly how new it is to a wide audience, never taking itself too serious but also never poking fun of its dedicated fan base. Not being a reader of the comics, I have no idea how loyal it is to the source material; But I do know that this a funny, adventurous Summer blockbuster loaded with good performances and gorgeous visual effects. The film starts in the 1980's on Earth as we see a young Peter Quill (Pratt), who will later become 'Star Lord', go through a very traumatic event. Immediately after, he is abducted by a giant spacecraft. We shoot 26 years ahead and we now see 'Star Lord' on the hunt for a mysterious orb. Upon retrieving it, he is sought out by henchmen of the Kree radical Ronan (Pace). Ronan has struck a deal with Thanos (Josh Brolin) that if he retrieves this orb and delivers it to Thanos, Thanos will destroy the planet Xandar; Which Ronan has extreme distaste for. So now Quill aka 'Star Lord' is the object of a manhunt by Ronan, and Gamora (Saldana) finds him, along with partners in crime Rocket (Cooper) and Groot (Diesel). They all have a big scuffle, and end up getting arrested and sent to a galactic prison. In the prison, they meet Drax the Destroyer (Bautista) who turns out to have a beef with Gamora and her family tree; specifically Ronan and Thanos. Gamora also has a hatred for what we learn is her adopted family, and has vowed to betray them at every turn, and make her escape from the galaxy away from them. The gang all teams up, make a plan to escape the prison, and sell the VERY valuable orb, and split the profits. Of course the plot thickens when the group learns of the extreme power of the orb, and when they learn the reasons Ronan wishes to acquire the orb, they make new plans for it. So what about the film then? Why is it good? Well, it's because it draws much inspiration of successful adventure films before it. I've heard many comparisons to 'Star Wars'. From a visual sense, obviously yes. One HUGE difference between the two, George Lucas could never write dialogue this funny. I would say this film qualifies as Marvels first legitimate 'Action-Comedy'. Because it is actually very funny. Mostly due to Peter Quill, and the BRILLIANT Rocket voiced by Bradley Cooper.The screen is packed with eye candy, tons of bright booming battle sequences, and honestly the CGI is pretty top notch. At times, I found myself bored a bit with the battles as they seem to drag a little too long. And my only other big complaint is probably the development of Ronan. I mean, when he's on screen he's an effective villain, just not a memorable one. a movie like this needs to have a bad guy you love to hate, and hate to love. But I didn't feel really any specific reaction to him. It's obvious this film is a starting point of something much bigger, but a better villain would have sufficed. On the other hand, every character is great. Chris Pratt has become an A-lister and this film will just catapult him even further. Zoe Saldana is sexy and kicks ass by the minute. Dave Bautista makes a solid big screen debut as Drax. But the stars of the show are Rocket and Groot. Their friendship is infectious and it resembles that of Han Solo and Chewbaca from the Star Wars franchise.'Guardians of the Galaxy' once again will bring Marvel loads of money in box office, and this time it's well earned. Credit to James Gunn for hitting the nail on the head, and balancing the tone and atmosphere of this film all the way through between humor and heart. It's not a perfect film; Not for me at least. Some will find this to be one of a kind. To me it's one of many. But there's no resisting its charm. Not by anyone with a beating heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather unusual but fun superhero flick. "I am Groot!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly, I'm still a little surprised they made a movie out of this team since the Guardians are not as big as Spider-Man or the Avengers and are only just starting to gain some popularity. But, for a film that has a talking raccoon and a tree man that only says three words, this movie managed to be a great new installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a set-up to what appears to be the famous Infinity Gauntlet story arc for what may be Avengers 3. Anyway, the is Guardians of the Galaxy.Plot: Peter Jason Quill a.k.a. Star Lord is an intergalactic outlaw who finds himself in a heap of trouble when he steals an unknown object of unimaginable power from an old temple with the Kree radical Ronin the Accuser having his eyes on it. Wanted by this villain and the law (the Nova Corps) alike, this unlikely hero gains some unlikely allies to combat this threat, which consists of a skilled assassin named Gamora, a berserker out for revenge called Drax the Destroyer, Rocket the ill-tempered genetically-altered raccoon and his tree-like companion Groot. With the odds and checkered pasts stacked against them, can the Guardians of the Galaxy conquer a madman out for unlimited power? With such a bizarre concept and team, I initially wondered if people would even gravitate towards this movie, especially since the Guardians aren't as iconic as Hulk or Iron Man, but, to my surprise, it was well-received and I can see why. The story is actually pretty interesting and takes advantage of exploring this vast universe full of interesting creatures, technology, and even worlds. The action scenes are pretty awesome, well-choreographed with each character showing off his/her skills and abilities and beating the living crap out of each other. It especially gets intense during the big climax of the film with so much being at stake, on par with the final battle of "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi". The special effects are also good, with an amazing mix of both CGI and practical effects. There's also a surprising amount of comedy, which for the most part is bound to make you laugh throughout the whole film, especially the post-credit scene which only comic book fans will get.Now for the characters, who, by the way, are casted quite nicely. Star Lord is the kind of guy who has lost his way and needed some kind of crisis and a bunch of new friends to get him of the right path. Knowing that he has no powers, his greatest asset is arguably his wit as he can come up with the craziest idea and make it seem like he could really pull it off, that and his awesome gadgets. Gamora is sexy but also has an interesting depth to her, especially when you learn about her nice back story. Drax is fun, a guy of simple taste, a thrill for action, and a knack for speaking in metaphors. Rocket Raccoon, a fan favorite, may seem like the dumbest idea for a Marvel character but his rough personality combined with his skill with guns and ships make him a delight to watch. Seriously, this little guy can threaten you and you would believe him. By far the best character, in my opinion, is Groot. He has an impressive set of powers that can give almost anyone a run for their money, but he also has a big heart (and puppy dog eyes), which leads to some of the most heart-warming moments you'll find in this film. An excellent performance from Vin Diesel.As for the villain, Ronin is the typical religious fanatic and we all know how fun those are in a movie, but he at least has some sense of menace to him and he is a formidable enemy to the Guardians, plus his fanaticism is thankfully downplayed to an extent so he becomes more tolerable. A decent villain, though he's no Loki or Abomination.My only major complaint is the music. Now some of the film's actual soundtrack is pretty good. Star Lord loves listening to old music, which I can relate to, but some of the choices in music don't always fit the mood of the film and this makes it seem a little corny. There are also a few jokes that do fall pretty flat, but that's a minor complaint.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy is a refreshing entry to the superhero genre with its action, story, characters, effects, and comedy. Definitely worth a watch, especially if you're into superheroes or a good old-fashioned space adventures, so check it out. "I am Groot."</fullReview>

This kind of a terrible movie, and people are praising this crap to be epic. My god! An 8.1 (earlier it was something close to LOTR' s rating!!!) for this movie! A completely predictable, terrible affair. Flat characters. Without any action sequences worth mentioning. Lots and lots of lame pathetic jokes. Terrible acting.

		<fullReview>I don't know where this came from, whether it incubated in this form in comics for years. Or whether someone at the Studio hired someone else smart. What I do know is that Marvel is playing with fire with this. They know how to make roller coasters. They know how to seem profound to teenagers. And they know how to frame a shot. But now, what? Will we expect all of their films to make fun of the Marvel empire? Will this last bastion of non-ironic teen juice dissolve like westerns did after Leone? Is it impossible now to have a Star Wars with no snickering?With millions of others, I liked this in many ways. Seemingly alone, I find the other Marvel projects unbearable, uncinematic, solipsistic. If I could tease out one thing to celebrate in this, it would be the tree. It is a character that becomes an environment. Twice. It is a character that contradicts the standard Marvel speechifying. Most striking of all, it is the only character to break the fourth wall. In the middle of the ultimate battle, it performs a fight move typical of Marvel: performance fighting, the kind that assumes there is a viewer to admire the silliness. Then Groot turns to the audience, looks directly at us and grins as if he is the only one who understands what is going on. Did anyone else think of Hudson Hawk during that first Indiana Jones steal-the-orb sequence?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was simply fun, no other way to describe it. This is a Comic Book movie the way they should all be made. It's the "Star Wars: A Hew Hope" type of thing.Most moviegoers today did not see the original "Star Wars" as it was called in 1977, and moreover they did not see it up to 20 times in the theater like just about everyone did back then. In fact, there were no multiplex theater complexes, movie-going was much more of an event.By today's standards, it's impossible to create a movie that will have the same impact. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring ran for most of a year when it came out. But Star Wars? The Original Star Wars ran for almost 2 years straight, the line to get in was constantly over 100 people long.So when I say, this movie gets that feeling back, it does - Maybe not the same reaction. It is very rare that a movie runs for a year these days, so if a movie runs 4 to 5 months, it is considered excellent.But I started hearing very good things about this for months until I was able to see it. It looks good, the music brings back memories, and at the most important spot in the movie, they play "The Runaways" version of "Cherry Bomb".Vinny Diesel really does not need to say much beyond "I am Groot", after a while, you know what he means. But the guy who stands out here is of course Dave Bautista, who was also in "Riddick" as what Riddick calls "A Big Jamoke". Here, he's the the big Jamoke who takes everything literally. His performance is one of the best things here.Each of the main characters has that one quirk that makes them interesting, or, irritating.I can see tendrils of story leading into The Avengers and the first Captain America installment, look for The Cosmic Cube. There are several great character actors- "The Collector" (Benicio Del Toro), Michael Rooker (Yondu), Djimon Hounsou as Korath, John C Reilly as a Nova Cop, even Glenn Close as Nova Prime. Christopher Fairbank, "The Broker".Lee Pace (Thranduil from The Hobbit series) is a great Ronan. and we finally get to see that "Skrull" who was shown briefly at the end of "The Avengers" - It was "Thanos", voiced at least by Josh Brolin.I have the first edition of this comic in my comic bin, sadly I have never read it. Of course this is rife with CGI, but it's a comic book movie, and CGI is, or could be used as comic art of sorts. I wonder how much this story follows anything from that one comic? The cinematography is very much like recreated comic book frames.It's not just about CGI, it is using it cleverly, which this does. This film could not have been made without it.Zoe Saldana is great in green, but the big mystery of the day is "who is Starlord's dad"? According to Yondu, "The Guy was a Jerk".Hopefully we'll find out, in a sequel that's as cool as this one. And remember, Nebula (Karen Gillan) is still floating around somewhere sans hand, did she go back to her daddy?The bad reviews and votes: I found several verbatim 1 stars in here, repeated over and over as I went through the pages chronologically. Seriously, post it ONE time. Ya don't get 100 votes while we only get one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is not a serious sci-fi film at all. In my opinion it's 80% video effects, 10% script/sceneography and 10% humor. If you're looking for an epic, serious universe story alike Star Wars, this is NOT it!The acting is okay and of course there are some nice video effects with explosions, animated creatures (who are really well done), and space environment, but there are also poor looking characters with make up and lenses, starting more to look like Star Trek. From what I gather this is kind of a parody of the typical American "hero"-story, with all the dull comments and royal soundtrack. If you want yourself some action, a few laughs and kind of cool explosions and fights, this movie will do. But I doubt it will be anything that will touch your heart in any way, or be a movie you will remember whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a messy crowded storyline that jumps all over the place. I fell asleep while watching it since much of the detailing was confusing. It probably would have worked better in 2 or 3 movies. To understand it better the best plot summary is on Wikipedia. After reading that I finally feel that I understand the movie. Apparently the director, who is also one of the writers, is renowned for this shake it up and then throw it down type of plots. He says he would like to do a sequel movie. I would rather see them get someone who designs a better script. Lots of gears and complexity can be interesting, but they need to be seen to mesh together, and how the meshing works together in the whole machinery of the plot. Also I hope that in a second movie there will be more Marvel tie ins to the other stories. It's fun seeing the relationship between the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this movie and heard the music attached to it, I told myself;"This better not be in the movie". Unfortunately it was, as well as many more songs from the 70's.Although I do understand the reason for this (Peter Quill's sole attachment to Earth and to his mother), this music was totally inappropriate for the movie we were watching. And what about all that dancing? Didn't they learn from Spiderman 3?Putting that aside, why did all the aliens living thousands of light years away, speak with an Earth vernacular? I was looking forward to seeing Xandar, the world of the Nova Centurions, but it was a let down. The Nova Corp did not look very formidable.And what about the Collector? He's supposed to be an Elder of the Universe, a cosmic being of immense power, and he just lets his place get thrashed. No, this movie was a great disappointment. I'm a big fan of Marvel Comics but I was expecting a great film, not a comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serenity 2: Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Guardians of The Galaxy has been heralded as "The Greatest Comic book Movie of All Time" or "The Star Wars of the New Generation". I greatly admit without bias that those claims have been GREATLY exaggerated. This film follows the Marvel film formula to a Tee. One-liners, average acting followed in suite with flash effects. Unfortunately it did exactly like other Marvel films did and sold well , beyond any real rationale .When I went to see this film I was expecting the Guardians Of the Galaxy , I use to read. Instead what I got was a mash up of classic Science-Fiction shows and films of yesteryear. I.E.-Star-Lord was Captain Malcolm Reynolds (with a Sony Walkman) Kree soldiers representing the Minbari from Babylon 5 Star-Lord's ship thanks via Boba Fett's Slave II.All of this would be easily forgivable if the acting was not so horrid. Pratt did little more then sell why he is a great second rate Sean William Scott.Zoe Saldana proved why she is giving soap opera actress's a run for their money. But truth be told Dave Batista, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel were the highlights to this clusterf&amp;*ck of a film.Although the special effects offer some nice eye candy and the action sequences will almost have GOTG comic fan's ignore the complete lack of connection to the source material. But distractions are all they really were and in the end it worked (again) for Marvel.Seeing Ronin The Accuser portrayed as fanatical tyrant as little more then Thanos's lackey was a far cry from the noble warrior king fans know him for in the comics. Groot saying "I am Groot" as his only language and his partner Rocket Raccoon portrayed as little more then bounty hunters (Chewbacca and Han direct connections no less) was something that threw me off. But hey in film you have to adapt to entertain, but among the pile of classic rock, product placement and Saved By the Bell like plot development, it losses it's creative license.When we next see the crew of the Serenity maybe it will somewhat resemble it's title and we get the real Guardians of The Galaxy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-Spoilers? Kinda- Marvel, having spent the last fifteen years or so spitting out mediocre movies with an exception or two, are rolling in a significant amount of cash. Along with the island-sized money piles they already had from the comic book industry, they're more than capable of throwing however much money they need to make a film look great. Not only that, but ***THEY PAY PEOPLE TO GIVE THESE FILMS GOOD REVIEWS ON WEBSITES FOR PEOPLE TO BE FOOLED INTO WATCHING***. Guardians of the Galaxy is one of these.However, it's looks do not transfer over to it's movie quality. If you don't have much patience for movies and don't mind noises and colors bashing your face for two hours, this is a movie for you. As for the rest of us, don't waste your two hours. The characters are bland, the comedy is mildly funny but at the wrong times in the movie, there's a blasphemous amount of bad acting (Apart from Bradley Cooper), and the plot line is just.. Awful. It's Cinema Shorthand for -Insert reason to make movie here-. Doing things that have been done before isn't a bad thing, but the whole movie acted like this was a brand new concept. I felt like I Was watching a Scary Movie # version of Thor the Dark World. Or any preceding movie with the same exact plot line.Glaze over the good reviews, these are people paid to review the movie positively. Try a different one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably at a time when they need to change their formula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this because even though the trailers for this movie looked AWFUL I still sat down to watch it when it came out on DVD because even though aside from Captain America 2 Marvel has been making really bland movies I would still go in with an open mind. However with this said even though I might tear "The New Star Wars" to shreds (I really can't believe people are making that comparison!) I still think there is some good in it.So the plot is that it literally opens with a kids mother dying of cancer (I mean nothing, zero build-up, zero substance to the scene at all, she just dies - I don't think she even gets a name aside from "Mom") the boy runs out of the hospital to get abducted by aliens with strangely nobody noticing even though it looked like he ran about 100 feet outside the door.20 years later he becomes the poor man's Han Solo except - not really giving a crap about anything, just makes remarks and steals crap. Then he takes an orb which a villain (for the instance that I forgot his name I'll call him "Mua-ha-ha-ha-ha!") really wants who's an alien that believes he's above another alien race... for SOME reason and as the boy and an unlikely band of heroes run around trying to give the orb to someone for profit while trying to kill "Mua-ha-ha-ha-ha".Okay, one of my biggest problems with this movie is the villain - He's the blandest goddamn villain I have seen in a while. I referred to him as "Mua-ha-ha-ha-ha" in my plot description for a reason and that reason is that he is a one note character and he somehow seems to be even more "I'm evil because I'm evil" then the cartoons and comics they made in the 1960's. It just seems to me that the should define their villains as a bit more then that - maybe give them a bit more tact, maybe fool the heroes into thinking he maybe trustworthy, give them motivation, reason, have them be sympathetic, even just telling the actor to have as much fun as possible in the role - Just something other then a guy trying to be a Bond villain for 2 hours.I also have to say something - The universe they live in is really poorly defined - If anyone asks me to "Read the comics" then can I tell you 2 things - I have never read a Guardians Of The Galaxy comic and that this is an adaptation and adaptations do not come with the footnotes in the original text about where they are in correspondence to anywhere else, what these races are, who genetically altered a raccoon, why they did it, why a walking talking tree is there, what is the name of the green people, why are here humans there and why some of them see themselves as superior to others.Okay, now I'll tell you what I like about this movie. Well aside from The Collector I enjoyed the art design, I think that even though I didn't enjoy the comedy making a light-hearted adventure is actually a rather refreshing change of pace from some of the other movies on the market, the Special Effects are really good and even though I said I didn't like how poorly the world was defined I enjoyed the fact that each world has it's own distinct look and feel, even if it isn't original and I did enjoy the actors chemistry together even if I didn't like the jokes they made.So even though I don't like this movie I'm not going to go all out in saying it's bad. There are things that I liked. But I wouldn't really hold onto this as a series of movies - again maybe I'll watch them when the DVD comes out. So I would say that this might be considered by some to be worthy of the Top 250 or the next Star Wars (I really can't get over people saying this) I still think that maybe if your looking for a no substance light-hearted adventure then this is for you.</fullReview>

I went in really excited as for a new age sci-fi with Michael Rooker and Vin Diesel - i was wary of the rest of the crap cast- and the trailer did look half decent. I tried really hard to enjoy it, but it was just impossible. about an hour through i told my friends i was going to the bathroom but I ended up going out to the bathroom, going to the claw machines, walking around the shops for a bit, just so i didn't have to sit through more of this awful and monotonous movie. its honestly just part of the new fad, where posers are too deep into the fandom that they use ignorance as fuel to the empire and cant admit to the obvious faults of anything in the genre. The characters were bland and nothing new (you've seen it a million times in all the new Marvel/DC fad films). the storyline with the mothers death was an overused one, but it could have worked if they didn't use it as a crutch implementing more emotional elements to the film. The cheesy clichéd script and phrases were just tedious and annoying, as was the whole film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So here we are, Marvel's riskiest project? Or was it? In my honest opinion "Iron Man" will forever be their riskiest taking their own money and creating a film based on a character that wasn't their most successful in comic form. However, Guardians is a close second in the risky business category, I'm a pretty big Marvel fan myself (self proclaimed) and I had never heard of the Guardians until the time it was announced their was a film being made, since then I began to read up a bit and my excitement exploded.While being said to be a part of the MCU Phase 2, you would also be able to watch this film as a stand alone and enjoy it just as much. The film doesn't get itself stuck into the intermingling movie crossovers like the rest of the MCU has done, actually unlike 95% of the MCU taking place on earth, after minutes into Guardians we are thrown deep, deep into space to not return to earth. The Avengers had hours and hours of pre story to the characters when the film was being made, Gunn had to create back stories and bring a team together in one film, an incredible feat which he seemed to do with ease while it took the MCU 5 films at roughly 10 hours, Gunn done that within 2.The cast does and absolutely (inter)stellar job, yes I said interstellar, I used that pun deal with it ha. The entire cast is on their A games though, Pratt as Quill is one of the best castings in any MCU film since the franchise started his charismatic, funny, relate-able in a way portrayal of Peter Quill was incredible. Zoe Saldana as Gamora may seem like a bit more of a simple task, however her femme fatale badassery is second to none in recent years, however it is the rest of the Guardians who truly shine. Bradley Cooper absolutely steals the show as Rocket, his quick witted retorts and emotional completely really bring more than the gag of "oh a talking Racoon" to the screen and really create a character you care about. Dave Bautista really comes into his own, his performance is far superior to his previous straight-to-DVD displays, he really made Drax his own as for Vin Diesel as Groot there is not much you can really do with "I am Groot" however he still gives the characters a charm of his own.The film is easily Marvel's most beautifully stunning film, I can imagine George Lucas watching it thinking "if I made Star Wars today, I would win ALL the awards". I truly think, Gunn has changed the game completely when it comes to comedic based Comic adaptations, the tone of the film jumps between truly emotional to laugh your socks off to science fiction insanity, truly making Gunn a blockbuster director to keep an eye on. The soundtrack is another success by Gunn, it is by far the best I have ever personally heard blending incredibly with the gritty and beautiful cinematography.Overall, the film was an incredibly fun watch filled with laughter, action, good acting and a solid story to boot. Which in the comic world you rarely get the whole collection, usually get a two out of four, however Gunn delivers potentially the best comic film of all time, some will argue the best. For me it's easily up there with the best, Chris Pratt gets to put his comical side on show and he delivers a great performance. You will laugh your ass off throughout while enjoy the beautiful visuals and great character development from the start, has a very Star Wars feel about it. Okay, I'll say, it is the modern Star Wars, it's more than just a comic film it's a space operatic, and Gunn should be insanely proud. I would LOVE him to board all the main Marvel based films that use space and give the Russo Brothers the earthly based films, this would result in the greatest film franchise ever in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the galaxy one of the best hero movies done so far. Is given to us a stupendous harmony between action and comedy , that make us stay focus on the screen. A great cast and a great director that show us hero movies can be different and still good. The soundtrack can create an environment of emotions and dreams, as well as the brilliant special effects that take us to distant places and put us almost there with the characters (makes us leave our corner and embark on a place far away from everything and everyone we are us too). In sum this movie is amazing, one of the best of MARVEL so far for everything i write up here (in my opinion :P). good for a rainy night (as i saw it) XD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I entitle my review A New Hope as I walk out of the cinema feeling like I have just watched the Star Wars of our generation!As a huge Marvel fan (both comics and film) I was delighted to hear this film was getting made with the perfect choice of Guardians and what a perfect cast to play them. The biggest surprise for me was Dave Bautista who I thought was only cast for his size but his delivery was spot on for Drax. Chris Pratt was hilarious whilst still excellent at delivering some of the films most emotional scenes.CGI in this film was super, there's nothing I hate more than too much CGI in a film but it was so good in Guardians that I was completely lost in it. Never have a seen space look so good, the battles were incredible and Groot and Rocket never looked out of place (aside from being a tree and raccoon).Gunn is the perfect director for this, his tone, his balance of comedy, action and emotion blended perfectly and directing GOTG would have been no easy job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining movie, a good watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up in the 80's and 90's reading comics....a LOT of comics. I must admit that I never really got into the "Guardians of the Galaxy" series. However I was really familiar with one of the main characters in particular......you old school comic book fans might remember the original Drax. 1. Drax was green 2. Drax could fly 3. Drax had superhuman strength 4. Drax could shoot power blastsSo after watching the movie I was pretty confused. I had to read Drax's wikipedia page to find out they changed his character completely in 2004. I gotta say Marvel, this newer no-powers having, knife wielding, semi-psycho Drax....is rather pathetic/boring compared to the original. So, after I got over the shock of the "new Drax" I enjoyed this movie immensely. The CGI is fantastically done, especially the space battles. The characters and the dialog were engaging and I found myself really taking a liking to Groot. I look forward to seeing what they do in Part 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the 9 of august i watched Guardians of the Galaxy. It's the film which had one of the best film-starts of the year 2014 and got 100 % points in the coverage on Rotten Tomatoes for a long time. Guardians of the Galaxy is about a group of five "criminals" who save the galaxy together.First of all i have to say that i don't agree with many critics which said that it's the new Star Wars and the best film of the year. The film does many things right but it's a 1:1 Marvel form. Of course it's entertaining and no one would go out of this film saying: "It made me bored two hours long". The Marvel Studios know when to press the right buttons, when to put in a cool one liner or a great pop song so anyone stay tuned.Small Spoiler but not the Story!But is this movie worth mentioning in one sentence with Star Wars? I don't really think so. The movie doesn't take his universe very serious. When you're looking at Star Wars for example you'll recognize that there is nearly one one liner per film like: "I love you". - "I know". Guardians of the Galaxy has no scene without a funny cut, song or one liner. I have to say that this is subjectively and everyone should watch this movie to get his one opinion. I prefer more serious movies like The Dark Knight or Captain America 2 where the enemy is a true threat. The effects are great but standard for this period of time. The cast is great and Chris Pratt done a really nice job. I really hope that he will become a much more famous Hollywood star.Conclusion/recommendation:Guardians of the Galaxy is an awesome movie for all people who want to relax and laugh with friends. I miss the flare and think that the whole story is kind of predictable and replaceable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hilarious Paint by numbers Superhero movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One would argue that Hollywood is saturated with comic-book movies these days. I wouldn't complain though coz some of the best Hollywood blockbusters came to life from their comic book counterparts. The Dark Knight, Avengers, Sin City, 300 to name a few. But at the same time it does a tad bit tiring when studios like Marvel, Warner Bros and 21st Century Fox dishes out a dozen of these so called superhero movies with 'save the world from the bad guy' premise. Lets keep aside DC for the time being coz it gave us THE best superhero movie of all time, The Dark Knight. Yea, I am a DC fanboy, throw eggs at me, I don't care. Lets talk about Marvel who's on a winning streak since Iron Man, setting up their Phases flawlessly. The Avengers was no doubt, one of the best comic book movies ever made but you gotta agree, some of the Phase One movies that the studio churned out to fill in till the finale just felt like..well?fillers.It bewildered me why Marvel was making a movie on some lesser known galactic superheroes while they could have easily pulled off a Nova Corps, Alpha Flight or an Excalibur movie, hell they could have even gone for X-Factor. While I am fairly positive the aforementioned still might be in the pipeline I frankly thought that Guardians Of The Galaxy would be a quick cashing in before the behemoth release, Avengers Age of Ultron. My skepticism hit the roof when I learnt that James Gunn was directing the movie. No offence, I like the guys' movies, be it the darkly comic, Super or the disgustingly humorous Slither but Gunn isn't what I would call fit for a superhero movie. Turned out I was wrong and his weird humor and direction earned him my respect and admiration for making an Awesome Anti-Avengers movie.Thanks to no Worldwide release I had to wait out a week rummaging through the internet avoiding stumbling upon a Guardians of the Galaxy review/spoiler. But then again I wouldn't lie, storywise Guardians of the Galaxy is a paint by numbers save-the-world story and wouldn't have made a difference even if I had stumbled on some spoilers. But its those these dysfunctional crooks that make magic out of it. This group of outlaws comprising of Starlord, Gamora, Rocket, Groot and Drax is everything you've never expected in a superhero movie and when they team up, it works perfectly. Don't go in expecting an Avengers-esque movie coz you'll be let down coz Guardians of the Galaxy and The Avengers are tonally poles apart, almost. Thanks to James Gunn, the movie promises chuck loads of his signature humour and chockful of action. Amidst all the ruckus you'd almost forget the fact the antagonist is the least bit intimidating, oh yea that's flaw you are likely to look past.I had not thought once, when I'd seen Chris Pratt getting his teeth bashed out by James McAvoy in Wanted, that he'd end up as a main lead in a major studios' production. Chris Pratt was just amazing as Peter Quill aka Star Lord, his comic prowess stood out till end. When I asked one of my friends if he'd liked to go for Guardians of The Galaxy he scoffed saying "I am not going for movie which has a talking squirrel", I sincerely sympathize with the fellow for addressing so, one of best characters in the movie, Rocket the Raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper. Vin Diesels' Groot was adorable and having just 2 lines through out the movie didn't hurt at all, instead you'll saying it yourself post watching the movie. Zoe Saldana played Gamora and it would have helped to fill in her backstory just a bit more. While I initially questioned Dave Bautista's acting skills, I'd say he did his part well. Surprisingly the leads' packed the same kinda charm the Avengers had on its plate.I tapped my foot every time those soundtracks kicked in. I have a thing for old school music and Guardians of The Galaxy's soundtrack is most definitely my cup of tea. It includes Blue Swede's Hooked On a Feeling which had been a favorite since the Ally McBeal days, plus Redbone's Come and Get Your Love, Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terell's Ain't No Mountain High Enough, 10cc's I'm Not in Love are some of the frequent tracks in my usual playlist.Marvel sure had balls to make a movie on these less notable heroes and an unconventional director and the fact it worked out well amuses me more. Guardians of The Galaxy might not be as epic as The Avengers, but its a surefire entertainer and no comic-book movie fan would say NO to it. I am sure this would have boosted Guardian of The Galaxy comics sales, not to mention filling up Kevin Feige's pockets, but as long as Marvel churns out movies like this, count me in.PS: James Gunn's weird sense of humour came into play once again when the post credit sequence popped up, though take it with just a pinch of salt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great visuals, not so great dialog...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is a visually impressive movie, with beautiful panoramic views of locations like an enormous alien city, a giant skull in space now used for mining etc. It mainly utilizes 3D effects during the first few minutes of the movie, so works just as well in 2D. So far so good. The story line is OK, no dead end or superfluous scenes. But the story is very linear, much like an eighties platform game, and lacks surprises. The dialog too is unsurprising and at times become non-credible and boring. Under such circumstances, drafting credible characters is hard, and the cast, though certainly talented, does not succeed. What should have been an exciting movie with a grand, earth saving finale unfolds as a less and less gripping tale, towards the end all but losing its grip on the audience. So OK for entertainment, if you feel like leaning back and giving your brain a rest, with good visuals and cast. But not one of Marvels best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually I will go to see movies that I've anticipated for some time. Although Guardians was on my radar, I wasn't sure it was worthy of a cinema visit until I read the reviews here. I wasn't disappointed. The running time races by as the Marvel mayhem continues and the story pings from set piece to set piece. The welcome addition here is the humour, reminiscent of that other Marvel auteur Joss Whedon and his pinnacle of sci-fi, Firefly. The story threads link to a worthy final battle and at the end there are enough loose threads left to make you want to fast forward to 2017. One of the few films I've seen where I would gladly go straight back in and watch again, go see for a great evening's entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't expect anything more than cool special effects and awesome soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This feature is worth a movie ticket. In fact, it is the kind of film that I'd rather watch at the movie theater over owning a Blu-Ray copy. Cutting edge visual effects that only the latest Hollywood big budget can provide combined with a very nostalgic, tasteful and unorthodox soundtrack (with stuff like "Hooked on a Feeling" and "Cherry Bomb"). Plus, it is a nice little adventure, humorous and action packed while still being family suited.That is all... Do not be fooled by these sensationalist overrated reviews from fanatics and comic enthusiasts. This is very far from being an epic (a new Star Wars, as some of the most blindly exhilarated have stated).1. There are so many clichés that my wife rolled her eyes most of the entire time. The seemingly heartless bounty hunter accompanied by a scary/gentle beast that communicates through indistinguishable groans (did Vin Diesel get paid for that? cause he even shows up in the credits for this crap) that only his best friend can, somehow, translate to the audience through redundantly answering the beast's concerns (and no, I'm not talking about Han Solo and Chewbacca); the tough butt girl assassin that primarily shows no interest in the lead teen-like goofy heroic character; no point in mentioning everything, just be prepared to nothing new or authentic.2. The entire time, it seemed like the film was making a desperate attempt to be very very funny, failing miserably. I did laugh or smiled sometimes, but some jokes were just embarrassingly poor. This is the type of humor that will just make the targeted audience (teens) laugh. I guess Marvel fans will really appreciate it, though. Anyone growing up reading Marvel comics knows that a humor is present even during the most dramatic moments, and I commend the attempt to portray the same aspect in the movie adaptations. 3. I'm not sure if it was just bad casting or poor directing, but the characters are everything but charismatic. Especially the leading role. You see kids fighting for their turn to be Jack Sparrow, Iron Man or Maximus while playing, but I doubt you'll see anyone fighting to be Peter Quill. I'd be surprised if anyone even remembers his name. Nearly 2 hours was enough to get sick of almost every character, from hero to villain, so I'm hoping they never make a sequel. My 7 is because, all in all, this is pretty good for a super hero movie. It will make you smile and have fun, at the least. Disregard, though, all the 10's and the currently inflated rating (common while the box office commotion lasts) and lower your expectations, if you are a reasonable person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did I miss something?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone said this movie was fantastic. As a big superhero and Marvel fan, I obviously went and saw it. I'm not so sure I saw the same movie as everyone else who loved it. I'll start with the exposition. Peter Quill, a young boy on Earth witnesses his mother die. OK. This was clearly supposed to make me sad. Let's face it, though, every superhero has lost one or both parents. Plus,I didn't know anything about this character so it was hard for me to care about him. It was supposed to be dramatic and intense, but it was just a big pile of meh.But that's OK! Because now we get into the meat of the story. Peter is all grown up and played by Chris Pratt and he's... a thief? OK. I can cheer for thieves, I guess. I like the Italian Job. But I'm a little confused that the other thief (Some blue alien whose name I forget two seconds after they say it) who was his partner and got ripped off is not supposed to be cheered for. He doesn't seem much worse than Quill to me. What, we hate him because he is blue? Oh, sure, he turns out a lot worse at the end, but come on. Up until that point the protagonist is just as bad, if not worse, than him. Speaking of questionable morals, how about Bradley Cooper's Rocket? Only motivated by money. He's only on the good guy team because he can make a truckload of cash. I struggled to cheer for him. Also, I am a huge Batista fan, and was excited to see him in this one. Disappointed. His character has no reason to be there. He doesn't contribute anything to the story except make things harder for everyone else and get his butt kicked a few times. I was hoping the WWE star would show us his physical prowess by actually WINNING a fight here and there. The only physical prowess he shows is LOOKING really big and intimidating. Speaking of looks, this movie is very pretty. I will concede that. Excellent CGI. But in today's age of Avatar and Gravity, I just can't be impressed too much by CGI anymore. It doesn't have the same effect in the modern age of movies. Overall, this movie is OK. It holds up with other Marvel titles and I'm sure as the characters are explored a little more, I'll find more joy in it. But frankly, I was pumped for this movie and let down. And I really TRIED to enjoy. I found myself forcing myself to laugh at Bradley Cooper's remarks and attempting to feel sorry for the tragedies the various characters went through, but I really just couldn't care about the characters. I don't know these people. They aren't Iron Man, Hulk, or Captain America. They are... Starlord, Queen Ghidorah(?), Raccoon dude, Groot (You are forced to remember that one), and unintelligent beefcake alien. They don't fight Loki, they fight some cowboy alien and some blue dude with an infinity stone (OK...). Thanos is there too. He's also important. I guess. Meh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you want a fun film to watch this summer, Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely the right choice!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, I do think this is the Marvel (Studios) movie that focuses the most on the characters; on The Avengers you know that Thor and Hulk could solo the chitauri, but here you know how much they need each other both to fulfill missions and to support as friends. You buy how they grow from reluctant sort of mercenaries/bounty-hunters to really good friend, almost family. They all feel like they belong in the movie and they all get characters arcs (though Star-Lord's gets kinda lost in the plot until the very end), which are subtle, but (and especially referring to Rocket here) very Star Wars-y, particularly Han Solo's in Episode IV. This is fine by the way; Star Wars is one of my favorite movies of all time.The story is surprisingly solid and the movie absolutely knows what it is since the beginning. It's a goofy, fun, action-packed, character- driven space adventure with some emotional moments here and there.Characters:-Peter Quill/Star-Lord: I thought he was good as a protagonist, he was relatable, clearly taking inspiration from legendary characters such as Indiana Jones, Han Solo (back to Star Wars), Marty McFly, etc. and at the same he feels very unique because of the 80's child inside of him. Some of the humor provided by him is a little forced and out of place, but when it works, it really works. Chris Pratt becomes Star-Lord effortlessly and with this movie will easily become the Harrison Ford/Arnold Schwarzenegger of this decade, with all kinds of movies wanting him as a lead in many movies.-Gamora: My least favorite character to be honest; Gamora worked as a strong independent female at first but often had lines such as Captain America's fish-out-of-water humor in The Avengers that made her seem really stupid (as they did to Cap, in my opinion).-Drax: Man, did Dave Bautista surprised me. I liked the character of Drax a lot more than I thought I would; he's not just the muscle, he's also big part of the heart and charm of the film. One of the funniest moments of the film to me was his ''Nothing goes over my head...'' line, which, among many others, was greatly delivered on this role that is sure to make this former wrestler as popular as the Rock (Dwayne Johnson).-Rocket Raccoon: Alright, before watching the film, I thought he was going to be an annoying comedic relief with no use whatsoever in the plot and I wouldn't care about him (*cough* Darcy Lewis *cough*), but he ended up being possibly my favorite character in the film. The first time he shows up he is in fact very Han Solo-ish, a reluctant guy who just wants the money and has a friend with limited vocabulary. However, as the story moved forward, I realized he had a screen presence that I haven't seen in CGI characters his size (Caesar and Gollum may be exceptions, but other than that) and then he has an emotional moment that is also in a way expanding his origin, and in that moment I really felt sympathy for that guy. By far my favorite character, very reminiscent of why we like Han Solo so much.-Groot: Rocket may have been my favorite character, but Groot was definitely the first one for whom I really cared about. Seeing Groot being torn apart by Gamora while he has such an innocent facial expression gave that moment a lot of relevance to me; Groot quickly shows he's the most noble of the group and possibly the most supportive. Going back to saying he was like Chewbacca, I do think this shows just how much you can make us care about a character that doesn't even talk that much. Second favorite of the team.The action is really good; once again, reminds of Star Wars a lot. The visual effects are amazing; if the film doesn't get nominated for an Oscar for them, I will give up even more on them. I forgot Rocket and Groot were CG characters in some moments.There is emotion and it works, yes, and again, there's surprising dimension to Rocket's character (but don't get preachy; that still doesn't mean you can compare this supporting, mostly comic relief-ish character to Wonder Woman).My reservations:-Comedy: Again, I like to have fun in movies and this one succeeds at that, but some times the movie feels a little needy when it comes to humor. The film wants you to laugh and cuts many dramatic/climactic moments for unnecessary humor. That's not to say there weren't funny moments; there WERE, but some that attempted to failed miserably.-The villain: Once again, Marvel Studios shows how their weakest aspect is to write villains. No personality, back-story is pretty forgettable, and he just feels really out of place being all serious in the middle of this goofy world.By Marvel Cinematic Universe standards, it's around 8.5-9/10. By superhero movie standards, it's around 7.5-8. Overall, I will give it an 8/10 Overall, I think the strongest part of the film is the character interactions and they make the film, at least to me, more re-watchable than every other film I've seen this year, even X-Men and Apes, which I thought were better movies. If you want a fun film to watch this summer, Marvel's action-packed adventure space opera Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely the right choice.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining and funny, great main characters, and awesome story only lacks in the villains and the final fight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of this movie, I wasn't really interested, I had never heard of these guys(save Rocket Raccoon), but then the trailers came out and boom, instantly excited. This movie was a bit of a gamble for Marvel, because not many people are familiar with these characters, but it's a good thing they went through with it. Guardians of the Galaxy is very good. It is so many things, action-packed, hilarious, exciting and in some parts heartfelt. Chris Pratt plays Peter Quill, the self-proclaimed Star Lord, an intergalactic thief who hails from Earth and was abducted by a group called The Ravagers as a kid. Pratt is hilarious in this movie, his comedic timing is perfect, he's also very good in the more intense moments involving his character. Through a series of awesome events, Quill is forced to form an alliance with four other characters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a smokin' hot assassin with a complex past, Drax (Dave Bautista), a guy who is looking to avenge his family, Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a genetically altered raccoon who is the biggest badass ever, and his friend Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), an awesome talking, walking tree who is only capable of saying "I am Groot".The other Guardians are amazing as well, they deserve all the praise they have received. Everyone is perfect in their roles, and they all have their moments, Zoe Saldana was great, Dave Bautista was awesome, he totally had the physical part, but he nailed the dramatic scenes as well (plus he's hilarious), Vin Diesel didn't have much to do, but his presence was very likable, he's like the Chewbacca of the movie, and Bradley Cooper, wow, he was absolutely perfect as Rocket, he was very funny, and had lots of cool lines, but he did a great job in his dramatic scenes. The Guardians are all well characterized and investing.Every technical part of this movie is great, the soundtrack is very fun, it's filled with a bunch of quirky, upbeat 70s-80s songs, like Hooked on a Feeling, Cherrybomb, and other great songs. The special effects are amazing, Rocket and Groot look so real, the guns are awesome, all the ships look incredible, and there are some action scenes that are the coolest I've seen this year, particularly the scene where they meet for the first time. The movie's script is very good, it's so funny that I think it's just as much a comedy as an action-adventure. But it's not just fun and games, the movie also handled dramatic scenes very well, a great way James Gunn had of keeping the movie balanced. The only issues I had with this movie were the villains, all of them are one dimensional with bad reasons behind their actions. Also the way the final confrontation with Ronan ends didn't seem plausible, comparing it with the rest of the information that the movie gives us.Other than that, Guardians of The Galaxy is a fantastic movie, it is incredibly entertaining throughout its 2-hour run-time. There's rarely a dull moment in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read comics and manga only that published in the newspapers and weekly magazine, other than that I am not into the comic books. So I must admit that I never heard before 'Guardians of the Galaxy' till this project start to commence. That means I had no expectations, I mean the expectation was nil. Especially after seeing the trailers and teasers I was totally repelled away to see strange characters like a tree, raccoon and other colorful skin tone human like creatures. Frankly, I thought it would end up badly as 'Green Lantern' did. I discarded my negative thoughts and decided to go after all I am a movie fanatic and that's what I do. I can say all these things were in my advantage when I went to sit in the cinema hall like an empty minded. The opening credits began to roll, me too slowly started to dissolve with the movie. It was not even 5 minutes passed, but I was into it. In the end, I was very impressed like never before and how much? That's what I am going to explain in the below paragraphs.''I am Groot.''First, I never heard this director, kind of new in town (to me). When I checked his filmography I came to know that I loved his movie 'Super'. What a breakthrough he got from this movie to enter into the big director's league list. He's also going to make a sequel for this as well and that is the real test to prove he's not just lucky to get away with this movie. Because many has predicted it won't stand tall in the box office. But what I witnessed was exactly opposite. The responsibility has become so heavier.Secondly, its a another 3M or MMM. Don't get confused, I was saying Marvel's Marvelous Magic. Other side Disney and Pixer are battling each others in animation field to dominate. In superhero themes, is there anyone to challenge Marvel? It is like one man's pride walk on the streets of Hollywood. Recently I said in the 'Need for Speed' review that EA joined something like the same, but a unique league to transform their games into the feature films. Whatever they do, it is our gain for sure. It was Marvel's sixth movie series from 'comic-to-movie' conversion, after Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, including The Avengers.A story of a boy called Peter Quill, who was taken away from his home planet, Earth by the space pirates. 20 years later he becomes a skilled thief and calls himself Star-lord. As usual in one of his missions he meets some strange guys who are after the orb he stole from an isolated planet. Soon he realizes it is a bigger issue once he come to know what does orb do. Unexpectedly a five member team forms. They decide to work towards one purpose, but the thing is they are mismatched in everyway. That leads each others to get misunderstand, misuse and failures, in one word to say the losers. After the series of screw-up how they unite against the strongest villain in the galaxy Ronan was told before it wraps up with a grand final fight.Yeah, I know the story was very simple. Men after the object that gives the power and strength is what's commonly known theme nowadays. But the beautiful cast and performances, including astonishing visuals will definitely change the viewer's perspective. It is going to be a game changer for the Chris Pratt's career. Like always Zoe Saldana had been excellent and sexy under the alien skin avatar. Vin Diesel had the least display of all the lead characters, especially with his one and only dialogue that repeats all the time. The character Rocket was another impressive, voice rendered by Bradley Cooper. Me too, to call him a raccoon kind of feel it is a racism remark. LOL. Definitely it is one of the top in the list of non-human or graphical character in a live-shot movie appearance. I think it was one of the biggest role ever Dave Bautista did. He was equally great to all the above, I stated. The cast was really a big, only those I mentioned in the above lines were having major portions in this installment. So expecting the others' time will come in the follow-up movies.''We are the bunch of jackass standing in the circle.''Like I said the story was not the problem here because it was presented with plenty of fresh humor. Don't expect it like a serious movie with a serious mission that takes place travelling all around the galaxy in a spaceship. Especially it was far better than 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. It is what stands in the line after the movies 'Star Wars', 'Star Trek' etc but filled with lots of fun. There was a scene in the end that comes before the credits, just for the fun and the post credit scene was resembled to what 'Pacific Rim' had one.The visuals were very pleasing, it goes straight to the list of mine 'stunning digital 3D movies'. It got many long focus shots with sometime aerial views which give opportunity for the viewers to enjoy the inside deep depth. And the close-up shots with a very few pop-outs. So I am saying this movie is a must watch in the digital 3D version. Overall, it was a great first movie in the franchise, that concentrated only the adventures which presented in a good pace. It also had a few minor flaws and leaves questions about the things that are not explained like Nova corps, the boy's background, especially about his parents and all. So expecting the sequel would cover up those. In the meantime, don't miss this movie if you have not seen yet, who knows it could be a movie of the season and mean it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily one of Marvels Best Movies yet,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. This movie is easily some of Marvels best work yet, it is hilarious, action packed and also at times very sweet, the soundtrack is probably one of the finest I've seen in any movie, it had me humming along to several different songs throughout. The only thing I think this movie is missing is a love story, I know it's cliché but they do usually serve as a great contribution to the story, particularly with superhero movies, and it serves as great character development, something was teased between Star Lord and Gamora but it was never developed any further, could be a good idea to use in the sequel. Chris Pratt is outstanding as Peter Quill, it seemed like he was stuck playing supporting characters in comedies for the rest of his career, but that is all going to change after this, Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista also deliver great performances, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel's voice work as Rocket and Groot was stellar and the film wouldn't have been half as good without them. James Gunn, a relatively unknown director, got to make this movie, Marvel took a chance on him and it ended up working perfectly, I hope he returns to direct the sequels this movie deserves, I want to see more from these characters, Guardians of the Galaxy is very unique, funny and at times quite emotional, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great action or sci-fi. After the discovery of a powerful orb, Peter Quill must team up with four other outlaws to protect it from getting in to the wrong hands. Best Performance: Chris Pratt Worst Performance: Nathan Fillion</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film has surpassed my expectation, it has taken all that Marvel has learnt since 2008 and expressed it through this unique, funny and emotionally touching epic. The Avengers took 5 films to build up our relationships and connections to the characters, and we knew what to expect from them during the film, however in Guardians of the Galaxy the director has set the characters up with back stories and then made a connection between all 5 individually in the space of 128 minutes.The film explores, drama, romance and comedy and has funny highs, and heart touching lows. The villains weren't the focus, as this movie was all about the guardians, but we still felt the presence of evil in the background, and for all those who follow the Marvel cinematic universe, this film was a further boost for what could be the ending of the biggest movie event in history, it gives us a hint and what is to come, and hopefully we won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky, funny and lovable, "Guardians" pulls of being geeky and cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years of success bringing earthbound superheroes to the big screen, Marvel Studios opened eyes when it first endeavored to make a film out of "Guardians of the Galaxy." If Iron Man was once considered an obscure Marvel hero, these guys were total D-league. Yet surprising to no one, the studio's creative process has yielded another hit, even with this ragtag group and set in a galaxy far, far away.Although an ensemble superhero film, Peter Quill a.k.a. "Star Lord" is the clear main character of "Guardians," a human boy abducted by alien mercenaries as a child who has become an adult skilled in scouring the universe for items of value and turning a profit. When he snatches a prized orb, however, he discovers it isn't just some average bounty; Kree warlord Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) wants it badly and sends Gamora (Zoe Saldana), an assassin and daughter of the titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) to retrieve it. On the planet Xandar, Star Lord and Gamora get tangled with bounty hunters Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a genetically engineered raccoon and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), a tree-like humanoid, and they all find themselves imprisoned by Xandar's Nova Corps, where they soon unite in common cause ? getting a huge payday for the orb.Sounds like overblown science fiction, but "Guardians of the Galaxy" is far from it thanks to director and writer James Gunn ("Super," "Slither"), who, with co-writer Nicole Perlman, utilizes humor as a way to ground the film in something universal (in the non-sci fi sense of the word). The tone of the movie is irreverent and silly, fitting for such the "rag-tag group of heroes" motif and unusual for the genre, which tends to overestimate the average audience's interest in alien species and the names of planets.Start with the "Indiana Jones"-style opening, which is a fairly common technique. Following a brief prologue with young Peter Quill watching his sick mother die, we next see him landing on a strange planet and using some of his gadgetry to search for the orb in a mysterious cave. But then, he puts on his Walkman and headphones (his only belongings from Earth) and "Come and Get Your Love" plays over the title sequence, which features Pratt boogying his way to the orb ? an unusual twist on a normally serious-toned genre to say the least.Humor is truly the movie's backbone, and the script takes a page from "The Avengers" in terms of playing up the dynamic of the various personalities in the group. The difference here is these characters don't just have egos, they have unusual quirks. Quill is a stubborn dancing fool; Rocket a cynic with a quick temper and a complex; Groot a powerful simpleton with a soft heart; and Drax (Dave Bautista) a vengeful literalist. This lovable cast of despicable characters, together with jokes based on "Earthly" references, and the humor exudes a freshness and fun seen in few action movies, let alone space operas.Also compared to other "space operas," "Guardians" doesn't downplay the sci fi elements or dismiss the movie/comic nerd's interest in the geekier aspects of the film; it complements them. They serve as context pieces rather than focal points of the story. The imaginative art direction abounds in each and every digital set piece, but no time gets wasted on explaining any of it. You don't have to understand the complex history of the Kree and the Xandarians, for example, to appreciate or take interest in the plot, but if you look and listen close enough, you'll get a taste of it. All compliments to Gunn, and to Marvel for backing another small-budget filmmaker on a film of tremendous scale."Guardians of the Galaxy" could fairly be hailed as the first great alien-filled interplanetary sci-fi movie since "Star Wars." As outrageous an assertion as that sounds, when you look at films such as the "Riddick" series, "John Carter," or "Green Lantern," it's not such a reach. It also doesn't lack for heart and cares deeply about its characters, which should strengthen the comparison. Only the "Star Trek" reboot seems to have done something similar, but that had a pre-established brand ? "Guardians" has a just a handful of Marvel Comics readers.The likely box office success of "Guardians" compared to some of those aforementioned films, for example, speaks volumes to the way that Marvel Studios has gone about its business. Just compare this film to the studio's last, "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" ? night and day, but both outstanding movies. The fact that the minds and string-pullers behind both movies are the same is astounding, but edge to "Guardians" for being the riskier of the two. The intergalactic components of the Marvel comic universe are now completely available in the cinematic one, when for many years it was largely seen as a pipe dream to sink money into a "Star Wars"-like project and expect a worthwhile return on investment.Although it makes its mark more with humor than science fiction, fans should be grateful for the doors "Guardians of the Galaxy" could open for the genre. At the very least, it will make for one wickedly awesome (and hilarious) cross-over with the Avengers in a few years.~Steven C Thanks for reading!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to write a thousand words like some people seem to have done. I figure folks want to know quickly if they're going to enjoy something!1. Great music, especially if you grew up in the 70s and 80s. 2. Beautiful animation - these folks are getting really good at this. 3. It's funny, especially pretty much everything that comes out of the raccoon's mouth. 4. A not too silly storyline, I wasn't bored and didn't feel the need to roll my eyes too much. 5. Enjoyable villains, especially the blue guy Yondu, played by Michael Rooker who was Merle Dixon in Walking Dead.Overall this was a creative story with charismatic characters and if you're a parent wondering if you'll be bored taking your young teens to it, don't worry, you won't. It's also not horribly violent - violence is sort of cartoonish and not at all gory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say enough about this movie. Would give it 11 stars if possible.After you get past the opening 10 minutes of sentimental dreck (which really is not bad), the rest of the movie never stops exceeding expectations. When I was 9 I saw Star Wars in the theater with my father, I knew nothing about it except that there were lines all summer at every movie theater where it was showing. I remember being mesmerized and thinking it was the greatest movie of all time. This is the first movie experience since then that I felt that way about.See it in the theater, you will be transported back to when you were a kid at the movies and everything was simpler. When it was over, I immediately wanted to go see it again.This is no super-hero movie, it is much, much more. The action is there, but this is more than an action movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy is visually the greatest film you'll ever see. Truly an unmatchable achievement with thrilling visuals, heart-felt moments, and more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Might contain some very mild spoilers, but not huge ones that gives the entire film, or point of the film, away.***Guardians of the Galaxy is a fast-paced, visually-stunning phenomenal superhero film with heart-felt, touching moments, extremely lovable characters, unique effects, and tough, badass villains. It's definitely the best Marvel film yet, and it's truly wonderful in all ways. It has the most unusual team of protagonists as the main characters ever, but they're the most awesome, enigmas you'll ever see. The villains, too, are inexplicably great, and the main one is a right show-stopper. I was so hyped for the film, and you ultimately should be too, it's exquisite in every-way-possible. The outstanding, unmatchable visual effects are beyond anything I have ever seen before, it's truly remarkable. Character development for the film is so touching and amazing, every character was truly tremendous, but I can't help but feel DRAX was the right badass out of them all, although they're all absolutely superb. The main antagonist of the film, who's also one of the best villains I have seen in ages, might I add, is Ronan, the Accuser. Well Guardians of the Galaxy starts with a very-young boy named Peter Quill, who's just a kid at this stage. He gets picked up by Yondu and his pirate-like ravagers after something truly terrible happens whilst he's in a Hospital with his mother. Years later, in the far-reaches of Space, and such, Peter Quill steals a powerful orb aka the infinity stone, a stone that Ronan requires to take to the powerful, almighty Thanos, and in return, Thanos will ultimately destroy the city of Xandar. Star-Lord steals the orb just as the Kree, Korath, finds him and ultimately tries to stop him. Quill gets the better of them and manages to get away from them by using his smart techniques and skills. An assassin, named Gamora is then used to try and manipulate Quill into giving her the orb; well, in some ways you could say she tries to use her innocent eyes and looks and such, just after Quill attempts to sell the orb to the Nova Corps. Rocket and Groot, too, are there when this happens (this all happens on Xandar).After a big scuffle and all of them trying to fight against one-another to get the orb, they're ultimately taken by the Nova Corps. They get taken to prison. Drax, lastly, is introduced, after Quill, Gamora, Rocket, and Groot are picked up and taken to the prison. Drax almost crushes Gamora but changes his mind and comes to something at the last moment. I shall say no more, as you've got to see this film. Visually it's the greatest film ever. Beautifully-done character development, lovable characters you just can't get enough of. Gunn's directing was off the charts, it was a truly wonderful. Guardians of the Galaxy is somewhat a unique achievement and film for all Marvel fanatics, and generally Comic book fanatics. Ultimately it's the greatest adaptation ever, alongside a few more comic book films. You won't be let down, trust me. Guardians of the Galaxy is something of a true gift to us comic book lovers. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marvel is at its highest right now, Phase 2 is near its end, Agents of Shield is doing OK on ABC, Marvel Animated Universe is going well and they've issued new Netflix shows that'll expand the universe with B-Superheroes such as Daredevil, Heroes for Hire and Jessica Jones. So they plan to make Guardians of the galaxy which at first everyone was preparing to trash this movie. But its as if u got a mysterious present on Christmas day and it turned out to be the best gift you ever got in your life.Guardians is the perfect Marvel movie! Some may say it's the Star Wars for a new generation. The movie focuses on Peter Quill, a bounty hunter who tams up with a deadly assassin, a maniac, and two thugs to stop a power hungry menace from destroying the galaxy. The movie has the lore of Marvel, the outstanding cast of any Star Trek movie and the feel of a star wars movie. Each actor, specifically Chris Pratt, Batista, and Bradley Cooper, bring their own flare into the characters.The movie is full of easter eggs for anyone who's reading the cosmic stories of Marvel Comics and is enjoyable for the whole family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is a new low for Marvel and for the comic book sub genre in general. No one was clamoring for a movie to be made from the comic book that almost no one had even heard of. However, because of the Marvel brand and the stunning visuals and action sequences, this became one of the highest grossing films of the year. The film is no more than a cash grab and a stepping stone in setting up the second Avengers. The characters are trite and obvious and the villain (I can't remember his name for the life of me) could not have been more inconsequential or underdeveloped. Groot was the only part of the movie besides the visuals that was mildly interesting. The story is ridiculous as well as the setting. This movie has a higher rating on IMDb than some of the best films of the year including Foxcatcher, The Grand Budapest Hotel, and The Theory of Everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so burnt out on back stories it's ridiculous. Spoiler alert Hollywood; most of us already knew that Peter Parker was bite by a special spider. We already know that when Bruce Banner gets mad he turns into the Hulk... so now... just show us the Hulk! Guardians is a comic book movie that has the characters wearing there super hero costumes for the entire movie. Not Peter Parker wearing a hoodie in the rain thinking of his relationship woes. The one of the rules for something to qualify as "epic" is that it has to start in the middle of the action. Guardians did this; a one minute seen about a boy being pulled from his planet after a tragedy and then BOOM, we have our lead character IN COSTUME and having an adventure. within the first half hour the whole team is together (not necessarily getting along yet)kicking ass and taking names! To me, one quality that an action movie needs to qualify as a good action movie is that the plot needs to move in accordance with the action sequences. Guardians does this. Because Star Lord stole the orb and fought the villains they followed him. Because they all fought over the orb in the middle of the city they were taken to prison. The results of the battle determine the next plot point. Plus, it was fun! All the characters had decent screen time, they all interacted with each other, they all had good battles. Two numbers I track with comic book movies are: How many minutes were spent in actually in an action sequence (car chases and suspenseful happenings count) And how many minutes were the super heroes actually in costume. With guardians you could tell the cast and crew were all very excited to make the movie as great as possible, and it shows through. Of course there is always room for improvement. But who cares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mediocre Gift in Gold Wrapping Paper/The Case When IMDb Users Get it Wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As usual, I headed to IMDb before renting this movie. I didn't even bother reading the reviews since it received the outstanding score of 8.3. I was reassured that I would be getting a great movie when the girl at the store said she absolutely loved it and watched it "everyday." Maybe she was a big fan beforehand? Anyway, I placed serious doubt as to whether this could actually be that great of a movie and was sad to see that I was right.Guardians of the Galaxy (GOTG) is a movie that has been done many, many times before it. You might even say that it is a bunch of pieces from different movies combined into one title. Those who think they are going to get something unique and interesting are in for a shock because this movie does not have a single original idea of its own. In fact, imagine a plot that you would tell a young child in order to keep him/her from getting confused and this is exactly what you're going to get.The characters will come across as very familiar because they've all been done too many times before, but these characters do worse because they lack authenticity. For example, the Ravagers are supposed to be a group of smugglers and thieves, but you never really get the sense that these guys are true representatives of their profession. The only character who manages to stand out is Groot because he adds a little variety to the movie by not being so painfully predictable, but do not expect to hear much from this character throughout the entire movie. As far as the other characters go, there is next to zero character development, and there are times when characters fail to give you a sense that you are in a certain environment, especially the ones that are supposed to be hostile. The true highlight of the movie is how good it looks. The makeup artists did an outstanding job. There are also some very good looking scenes in the movie. Next, the jokes also help improve the quality of the movie but they are often simple and sometimes irrelevant. The action is just OK. Last, the music that Star-Lord likes to play helps but feels awkward at times and never really finds a scene where it actually belongs.In conclusion, GOTG looks right but does mostly everything wrong. This is a movie you watch when you are bored and do not want to be challenged to think. If this is the case for you, a single rental might be worth it. If you want a solidly good movie, you will be sadly disappointed. This movie comes nowhere close to great, highly rated movies such as Forest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption, Gladiator, Fight Club, and Pan's Labyrinth and shouldn't be rated so close to them. There are equalizers who will give the movie a single star to see its overall rating go down, but I won't go that route, although I would like to in this particular instance. GOTG is a soft 6.3 and probably rates a little higher if you like eye candy and simple jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The galaxy needs protection and these heroes are perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1988 a young Peter Quill is by his dying mothers bedside, the last thing she wants to do before she passes on is give her child a final gift and say her goodbyes, but the emotion running through Peter is so strong and surreal his mother's dying wish to just hold his hand is never met. So as some kind of talisman the gift Peter receives is shoved into his backpack and never opened. Emotions run high as his mother's last breath leaves her body and young Peter runs out of the hospital and into an open field where he is suddenly beamed up and onto a spacecraft. Jump forward 26 years and a few galaxy's away and the young Peter Quill now known as Starlord as he likes to call himself is on an adventure of relic hunting, he picks up a strange orb which we discover is a treasure he has been commissioned to find and comes with a very lucrative reward attached. Starlord takes the orb back to the buyer who has offered the cash prize but once the buyer learns that Starlord was actually approached Ronan a madman who is intent on destroying the planet they stand on the deal is quickly shutdown and nothing is exchanged but a few awkward words. Starlord is then met by Gomora the assassin a stolen daughter of Thanos now working alongside Ronan who attempts to steal the orb away. Rocket a bounty hunter raccoon who can talk and who has been genetically modified to be a kind of gun tooting engineer and his bodyguard Groot a humanoid tree learn that Starlord has a bounty and attempt to go after it. Soon after the four characters are picked up and thrown into prison on an inescapable compound where the four meet Drax the destroyer a warrior who had his family slain by Ronan and wants nothing more than revenge. The five decide to team up and escape the prison to then go on and sell the orb to "the collector" a man who does exactly what his name states; he collects things. The group eventually learn that what lies within the orb can wipe out the universe and do whatever they can to ensure not Ronan nor Thanos the warlord Ronan works for do not get their hands on the orb. I cannot tell you how much I loved this film, I loved it from start to finish. I loved how it opened with such a powerful image and I loved how it ended with one much the same. It was funny, but not just funny ha-ha, it was hilarious, some of the dialogue was so natural in its delivery it all worked so well. The film never takes itself seriously unlike a few other films released it's just great fun. The CGI and visual effects are inspiring, the score is gorgeous and the 70's soundtrack worked so well with the entire film. There wasn't much you couldn't hate in this film. The characters were so real and believable (well as much as possible anyway) The cast were fabulous, I loved every one of them the standouts for me though were Ronan in my opinion one of the best bad guys to ever be given life! And Rocket, a Racoon with anger management issues is brilliant. Then of course Starlord who just holds everything together. Directed by James Gunn who is relatively an unknown he also helped write the script, I now believe he has a huge career ahead of him. Starting Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, Starlord, Zoe Saldana as Gomora, Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket, Vin Deisel as the voice of Groot, Dave Bautista as Drax, Lee Pace as Ronan, Michael Rooker as Yondu, Karen Gillan as Nebula and a handful of other quite well-known names made for an amazing cast. So now onto what I would have liked to see differently, the only thing I really hope they do is some origin films, nothing else, for once I didn't care there were no back stories on who these people were or where they actually came from but I would love to eventually see origin stories for each and every one of them. Guardians of the Galaxy is the must see film of the year for me so far, so go out and see it on the big screen before it finishes!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy, o Star Wars wannabe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My fears were confirmed, the Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) is but a paltry Star Wars wannabe.As is my habit I have not seen the movie trailer and kept me away from the reviews of it to keep my neutral expectations. So today still is almost impossible not to hear sound bites of a blockbuster of this scale and I was noticing that the views of the guys I follow on social networks was a little divided.There are two things that even I do not want to end up weighing on my analysis in this movie, I'm a big fan of the films of the Star Wars saga and I am increasingly tired of superhero films (Marvel / DC Comics). Still tried to abstract me these facts and be fair to the film.Starting with the director and writer, James Gunn, who is this guy? I asked myself. Only after I have seen the movie that I search for him and his resume is not anything special, noted that wrote the Scobby-Doo's and the Dawn of the Dead (2004), films those who did not impress me whit, such like this Guardians of the Galaxy.As for the soundtrack, the director gave him a lot of emphasis in history and is basically made up of songs from the 60's and 70's I recognized much of the music but the one I really like is the Cherry Bomb from The Runaways. I even like movies with this kind of soundtrack, but in my opinion here did not work very well.Regarding the cast, another negative point, there lacked a lot of chemistry between the main characters, especially in the romance between Peter Quill and Gamora. ? Chris Pratt as Peter Quill - Who? ? Zoe Saldanha as Gamora - They could have chosen a more talented or more beautiful actress, or maybe both. ? Vin Diesel as Groot - I am Groot. ? Dave Bautista as Drax - I am muscle. ? Bradley Cooper as Rocket - The character that I liked more.But the argument does not captivated me too, a story like so many others with the usual cliché's. The mood is present throughout the film and the jokes are easy, too easy in my opinion. With regard to the romance as I said earlier, there is no chemistry between the Quill and Gamora. I wish this movie had been a little more attractive for my brain cells, this Guardians of the Galaxy is fast food, give us that feeling of full stomach but devoid of essential nutrients.But everything is bad in this film, the special effects are top of the best I've seen, the animation of the Rocket and Groot are fantastic, and the spacecraft and the scenes in space. So good it almost made me want the whole film was an animation, although here also weigh enough that the cast be weak.I began this piece saying that the Guardians of the Galaxy is a paltry Star Wars wannabe, then why? As I a fan-boy of Star Wars, I could not help noticing numerous parallels with this movie. The Groot is clearly the Chewbacca, is big, brown and says nothing special. In Peter Quill and Rocket see there a lot of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker divided by the two characters. In the bad guys idem, Ronan is the Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine is Thanos. Maybe ordinary mortals do not see much of Star Wars in this Guardians of the Galaxy movie, but for someone like me who knows very well the Star Wars saga will notice that the director went to get a lot of inspiration to George Lucas's work, is not it is a bad thing, just that he could have done to make the film better and did not succeed.Finally, the Guardians of the Galaxy is not a cheap movie, only it is when compared to Star Wars, but it's not a great movie as it turns around so many people say. Note that not penalized the final note of this movie just because I thought it was a Star Wars wannabe, not just captivated me anything. Expected a bit more from this movie and I ended up quite disappointed.Meh [5/10] &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &#x2729;&#x2729;&#x2729;&#x2729;&#x2729;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the movie was good. Not great, not hyper-super-extra-mega incredible, but good enough. It is fun, it is exciting, the heroes are not typical (and are thus more enjoyable), the visuals are just as stunning as any Marvel production, and, hey, it has genetically altered raccoon (or what?) in it.Seriously, the mutated raccoon is awesome. The best character ?and the most realistic and layered one, as ridiculous as that sounds ? by far.Now, for the negative aspects:Like I said in the beginning, don't expect anything spectacularly groundbreaking (except for the raccoon). The heroes ? and the villains ? may not be typical, but they ARE stereotypical. A goofball anti-hero with more love for money than honor, later gaining a moral backbone for (random) love? Check. An Amazon type gal with a tragic past, finally learning to trust? Check. A humorless, selfish avenger out for blood, but learning friendship and morals are more important than revenge? Check. Then we have the good-natured, but stupid tree thingy / Ent for comic relief. The raccoon is plain cool. Watch the movie, if only for him.The plot is... packed. Way too much for one film. You can follow it fine, but only because more is left unsaid than said, and much is vaguely implied ? sure to be explored in the countless sequels to come. So, it's basically dumbed down. Which is annoying, even if I understand the necessity. And it's STILL packed. Don't expect a breather. You don't go to the bathroom ? or attempt to blink ? during this movie without getting catapulted out of the loop faster than light. And in the end, expect to leave your seat in a catatonic state, without being able to recall anything of substance, including the main leads' names.But regardless, you get exactly what you payed for with Guardians of the Galaxy. It's enjoyable, really. Surprisingly so, seeing as it's basically a barely coherent, jumbled collection of clichés. That's actually quite a feat, if one thinks about it. (As an after-note, I must admit some of the movie lost its magic for me because of the villain. I'm on team Ulquiorra. It's rather miserable when you're rooting for the bad guy all along.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the last few years, I've seen an increasing trend for 8+ ratings of new movies on IMDb. Many do not warrant the rating. Even with this in mind, I was expecting at least a good story and good character development because even a 7 movie should be good. Instead, for Guardians of the Galaxy, I got a very plain story with an unsuccessful attempt at character development. While its normal for an action film to move quickly, this movie summarily jumps from one scene to another with a totally contrived plot. The attempts at character development and building friendship were totally lost on me. There was nothing in the story that made me think the characters had a useful reason to unite and get along. And the jokes were so-so at best. Probably the worst 8+ IMDb rating movie I've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review on IMDb and the reason I take the time to write is because of the absurd rating this movie has right now. 8.5?? seriously?? I saw this movie yesterday and it's a 7 at best. Having read a few reviews here in IMDb I thought this movie would be one of the best superhero movies ever but I was pretty disappointed. The story is OK nothing special. The acting is bad.Very bad! Also I wasn't drawn to any of the main characters because all were very simple and their jokes were awful!! I didn't laugh once in the runtime. maybe smiled but not laugh. The thing I hated more was the scene where Ronan was about to destroy that planet and Starlord stopped him by dancing?!?!?! seriously??. All in all I think this movie is worth watching only one time. At least for me it was more than enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertainment at its best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I did go to this movie expecting to be entertained. But what i didnot expect was to actually end up getting tears in my eyes and get hysterical. Not many new movies have done that recently. This movie DELIVERS entertainment in a bombshell. It will get you smiling ear to ear just as about as soon as it starts, why?. Well the choice of background scores they chose is why and how perfect they sync with the scenes. Chris Pratt did a fantastic job as Starlord and definitely got me to look into the character as i wasn't aware of it before. The story was nothing extraordinary like many of the superhero movies out there, it was just about interesting. But the characters are what pull it off, Rocket Raccoon has definitely become the most badass raccoon out there considering not many are there. But it definitely packs a punch giving a run for the money to many of the characters for "the most favorite comic character" in the marvel universe or DC universe for sorts. In short, this movie is solely an entertainment power-bag with a decent story that would just suffice to get you watching it over and over again N times and crack you up every single time thus making it a probable future comic classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extremely fun and entertaining superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know anything about Guardians of the Galaxy before the movie came out with no knowledge on the comics. However, I do like the cast they gathered and the major selling point is the appointment of director James Gunn to direct the movie which is a very out of the box choice for a superhero blockbuster film. The end result is not only one of the most entertaining films in 2014, but one of the most fun I've had with a superhero movie in a long time.Good: James Gunn really brings his sense of humor to this movie which really pumps up the material. The direction is a very comedic, sarcastic, and witty form that helps bring the admittedly out there elements work so well. The comedy hits the mark all the time thanks to a game cast with Pratt, Bautista, and the combo of Cooper and Diesel bring in great performances. The movie is also very colorful with some great action sequences and a fast pace despite it being over two hours.Overall, this is an extremely entertaining film that brings some edge to the Marvel superhero movie plate with a great cast, effects, action, and most importantly a sense of humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Marvel Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie, saw it in IMAX 3D. The acting was great. The writing was great. The 3D was fantastic, very rarely was a part that wasn't 3D. I thought that there should've been more Thanos in the movie than there was and I wanted to see more of the villain, Ronin. The characters were very likable, my favorite was Rocket Raccoon. I thought having Howard the Duck in the film was very strange because he's not really a Marvel character. Stan Lee's cameo was funny as usual. If you do go see this film then I would recommend the 3D version over the 2D because the visuals are fantastic and worth the extra ticket price. Overall I would recommend this movie for sure to anyone looking for a great Marvel film or just an all around action/sci-fi film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel Studios' Biggest Gamble To Date... That Pays Off Tremendously Well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the studio that brought us Iron Man, Captain America, Thor &amp; The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy arrives as Marvel Studios' biggest gamble to date and yet the risk pays off tremendously well as this crazy mixture of an oddball cast &amp; an eccentric crew strikes gold for the studio in both critical &amp; commercial departments and succeeds as an immensely enjoyable, extremely entertaining &amp; most satisfying Marvel piece since The Avengers.Set in a galaxy far far away, Guardian of the Galaxy concerns a notorious scavenger who finds himself as the main target of a manhunt after stealing a mysterious orb and is put in prison along with a deadly assassin, a genetically-engineered raccoon &amp; a tree-like humanoid where they encounter a brute looking for vengeance. As an uneasy alliance form between these extra- terrestrial misfits, they learn to work together as a team &amp; try to save the world when a greater threat arises.There is so much in here that could've so easily gone wrong and there's no denying that many eyebrows were raised when James Gunn was brought in to direct this high-budget space epic. But he has directed this picture with such precision craftsmanship that it feels like a work of an auteur &amp; the remarkable use of humour infused into its blockbuster elements only makes the experience all the more amusing, enriching &amp; delightfully engaging.Coming to its technical aspects, every single filmmaking department works in near-perfect harmony with the other in a manner that only elevates its overall story &amp; characters to new heights. Set pieces are impressive to look at, make-up adds a dimension of its own to its characters, its homage to many space classics is tastefully carried out, cinematography makes dynamic use of camera without ever getting carried away, editing is tight, VFX is seamless &amp; the selection of songs is near-perfect.The cast is as eccentric &amp; diverse as the characters present in the film with Chris Pratt (Peter Quill), Zoe Saldana (Gamora), Dave Bautista (Drax), Vin Diesel (Groot) &amp; Bradley Cooper (Rocket) playing the role of Guardians and each of them deliver excellent performances with Groot &amp; Rocket leaving the most lasting impression. Also chipping in with fine doses are Lee Pace (Ronan), Michael Rooker (Yondu) &amp; Karen Gillian (Nebula), with brief appearance from Benicio del Toro &amp; John C. Reilly also adding more flavours to the film.On an overall scale, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the most exquisitely balanced cinematic offerings of 2014 that promises a lot of fun from start to finish and seamlessly delivers it in an endlessly entertaining &amp; immensely rewarding manner. Ingeniously directed, wonderfully light- hearted, fluidly photographed, skilfully edited, splendidly performed &amp; featuring dazzling visuals, Guardians of the Galaxy is arguably the ballsiest big-budget production to surface on the silver screen since James Cameron's Avatar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely the best superhero movie to ever come out so far. This movie had fun characters, hilarious humor, amazing action and special effects and the perfect plot to go with the story line. It was different and had its own very unique concept. I loved the villains in the movie and iv'e really become a huge fan of rocket raccoon after seeing the movie. The movie had pretty much everything it needed including drama, suspense, humor, crime, and action in the right order. This movie is indeed a new age classic marvel superhero film and i am really excited to see how the movie follows the other marvel films. I enjoyed this movie a lot and i think it was better than the avengers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy is the Best Film of 2014</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the day I first saw the preview with Rocket the Raccoon I knew I had to see this movie. Being a fan of many of Marvel's films I had high expectations and was not disappointed. I love this movie and would jump at the chance to see it again. I plan to purchase it when it comes to DVD. Now I have to try and entertain myself until the continuation of the story.Characters:We start with Peter Quill, or Star-lord as he likes to be known. He is the fun loving 'ladies man' who's learned how to survive in space and still have a good time. Gamora is the girl with an axe to grind with her adopted family. Drax has a hard time understanding sarcasm and likes to take everything seriously, especially since his family was killed. He has since been around the galaxy destroying those responsible. Last but not least, Rocket the Raccoon and his sidekick Groot, a giant tree creature, provide the comic relief. Rocket is the bad raccoon in the movie who likes bad toys. He is always making something that can cause massive destruction. Groot, on the other hand, is more of simple tastes and is only capable of saying three words, 'I am Groot". The characters in this film are entertaining and dynamic. They bring the story to life and keep the ball rolling throughout the film with their witty humor and unconventional relationships.Graphics:Every once in a while you go to the theaters and come out thinking, I totally knew that three headed rhino was computer graphed. This movie, however, proves that even if it's in an environment?a world? we have not yet visited it can still come to life on screen. Both Rocket and Groot were computer animated, but most of the time I couldn't even tell. I felt like I could get out of the theater seat and walk into the world of Guardians of the Galaxy.Sound track:I have to say though that the movie might not have been that great without the soundtrack. The film featured classic 1970's songs that brought an air of lightness and buoyancy to the film. These songs also let us look closer into Peter's character because all the songs came off his "Awesome Mix Vol. 1", which he was able to take with him to space. The score was also composed well and contributed to the film when needed for the more action packed scenes.Action:For the action buffs out there, do not fear, action seemed to be just around the corner in this film. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat, and I don't believe there was ever a dreary moment. I don't even think it took it five minutes for the first action scene to start and it kept going until the very end. The movie even surprised me because just when you think the good guys have saved the day think again, more action.Romance:Ladies I have to say this probably isn't the most romantic film out there, but there is a little something between Peter and Gamora during the film. The love interest appears when Gamora and Peter first interact in the movie. Peter thinks his good looks and charming personality make him a lady killer. Gamora isn't entertained by this notion because she has other business to attend to. However, later in the film when Peter saves Gamora's life, you can begin to see how much Peter loves and cares for her. Their relationship builds over the course of the film, and in the end you know they just might become a couple when Gamora finally learns how to dance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen I have to admit. When I walked in the cinemas I was actually preparing myself for a major boredom because Marvel's new movies I feel have been having a lack. But this turned my thought completely upside down.This movies is pure awesome. First of all the screenplay was brilliant. The humor was intellectual at times but still hilarious LOL moments. The story was just so unpredictable it wasn't just destroy the bad guy and kiss a random girl. It was very interesting, sad at times but still funny. And the fight scenes were just extraordinary, if your here reading my review pondering if you should watch this I am begging you to watch it, this is a great movie. It is number #30 on the top 250. All that tells me is "awesome awesome awesome ." 70% of movies which are a hit at release drop down after a week, but not this movie obviously, if anything a week ago this movie's rating was 8.4 and now it has rised, instead of dropped so just watch this movie please, it's my favourite as of the time I first watched it</fullReview>

Rocket was awesome, Gamora was sexy, Peter was funny, and Drax was Drax. *Spoiler* They also show THANOS!

The film was well balanced between Action scenes at her funny.Then there Groot who always say "I'm Groot". I think Vin Diesel would feel bored with the only sound filling it alone. But, that's what makes this film funny. I just realized that this film is actually linked from Avenger &amp; Thor The Dark World, because confirmed so far are only three: Tesseract (The Avengers), Aether (Thor: The Dark World), and Orb (GotG). Maybe one of them sticks Loki is using that in The Avengers, but there has been no further confirmation.It seems from all the Marvel movies, I'm more interested in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Trailer gave a Rising Eyebrow but The Movie was Everything I Hoped For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I watched the trailer of Guardian of the Galaxy on IMDb and at other movies several times. Besides being so-so funny, the film isn't intriguing enough. But then the high score came out at the same time as the release. Still also not proving anything good. Why?Because previous released film in this summer are all fishy. First, The Winter Soldier had a huge hype with a huge score but didn't prove to be an 8/10 movie (IMDb scale). Godzilla had a huge hype with a huge score but fell fast, this movie is actually a high 7/10 Movie (probably 7.9), but viewers dropped it to a low 7. Time will prove the quality of this film. Dawn of the Planet of The Apes is the same as The Winter Soldier, disappointing. So I didn't give any high hopes with Guardians of the Galaxy.Guardians of the Galaxy got lucky because in my country, it looked like all summer blockbuster release got hold with no reason. In my opinion it was probably due to local holiday events, so the cinema company chose to fill the cinemas with local films, and put the Hollywood films on hold.The release of Guardians of the Galaxy as the first Hollywood Blockbuster (probably second after Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) gave me no reason to not watch it because I was so thirsty for a popcorn flick. The Result! Guardians of the Galaxy turned out to be anything that I hoped it should be. Full action and high paced, every second through this movie you will never get bored, there is a wow factor in every segment. A sci-fi dream! This is probably the most satisfying space movie after Star Wars. I'm sorry Trekkie's, the Star Trek Reboot can step aside because this one gave a jaw drop to the just told genre fans. Rocket by Bradley Cooper did not fail. At first I thought Bradley Cooper as the voice of rocket was just a marketing strategy. But through out the movie you just can forget the good looking guy behind that (racoon?).The Movie was a screamer, the audience clapped their hands once a while at some jokes. O yeah did I mention? the movie was hilariously funny, every jab worked, Age of Extension and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle can crawl in a cave for humiliation of unfunninness (is that a word?).One other thing, the CGI is amazing, you can just sit and admire every still moment. Every scene looks great, every scene works. This is probably the cinematography and the direction.This movie is like watching a Disney musical cartoon classic but in a form of superheroes and space suits. You just can't expect were the magic is coming from.So is this your movie? I think every 9 out of 10 people would love this movie, fan or not fan, willingly to come to the cinemas or not. Teenager or no teenager. 10/10 from me right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Groot film - but not bad either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit to having a very negative view of both Marvel and DC movie properties of late. These seem to range from the massively over-recycled fayre of Batman, Superman and Spiderman to dredging out the most marginal characters from the back of the metaphorical kitchen cupboard. I fully expected Guardians of the Galaxy to fall into the latter category, like a forgotten 1992 bottle of Five Spice. Also, with very few exceptions, these fan-boy films have been plot and character light and, in all cases, they have been so drenched in CGI and dizzyingly fast-cut fight scenes that I have lost both patience and interest in them well before their flabby running times are up. As such, I went into this film with my "1 star" button at the ready.And - with that background understood - I was pleasantly surprised.Chris Pratt (too new an actor to safely have "Movie 43" on his resume) plays Peter Quill (aka Star-Lord) who is abducted from Earth by aliens as a young boy and turns up, 26 years later, as a Han Solo-style freewheeler looking to make a fast buck where he can.The truly tortuous plot revolves around a metal orb that Quill obtains for a collector, without realising the true power of what lies within. Also wanting to possess the orb is the evil Krill warlord Ronan, who wants it for trade with the even more evil Thanos in exchange for Thanos destroying the planet of Xandar. Xandar is ruled over by Nova Prime, a dialled in performance from Glenn Close. A couple of hot girls are involved in the pursuit - Nebula (an almost unrecognisable Karen Gillan from Dr Who) and Gamora (a more recognisable Zoe Saldana), and one or both of them might have been daughters of Thanos: I'm really not sure, it was all very confusing! Throw into the mix a vengeful wrestler type dude called Drax (Dave Bautista) and couple of bounty hunters (a CGI raccoon-like creature called Rocket, voiced by Bradley Cooper but it could have been anyone, and an Ent-like tree creature with a limited vocabulary called Groot, voiced by Vin Diesel (ditto)) and the course is set for a climactic showdown above and on the surface of Xandar.Yes, everything IS drenched in CGI. Yes, the numerous (and often very violent) fight scenes are dizzyingly fast-cut. Yes, the laws of physics and medicine go out the window. And yes, various bodies survive a range of unsurvivable injuries. But what lifts this film into the bearable is the sense of humour it is infused with. For reasons made obvious in the opening scene, Quill is very attached to a Sony Walkman and a mix tape of 'oldies but goodies' pervades the soundtrack to great comic effect. The opening scene with Quill as an adult sees him stretch the neck of some alien reptile creature but then karaoke disco dance with the creature as his microphone. Very funny.By the way, there are a few entertaining cameo performances involved: Stan Lee makes his usual Marvel appearance, as a ladies man on Xandar; Benicio del Toro makes a brief appearance as "The Collector"; John C Reilly is a Xandar security guy; and - best of all - stay for the end of the titles, where a true superhero of the past turns up, for which he should have been higher billed! The director James Gunn (a relatively big-screen newcomer, also tarnished with "Movie 43" but also the darkly comic Kick-Ass-like "Super") co-wrote the movie and clearly knew what mood he was trying to deliver. This is played more for the laughs than for the tension, and is a much better film as a result. The editing and special effects are excellent ("You'll believe a raccoon can machine gun" could be the by-line) and the running time of 2 hours doesn't make the film overly outstay its welcome. Quill makes a very likable rogue with Chris Pratt (set to appear in next year's Jurrassic World) clearly a name to watch.So, in summary, its not really my cup of tea and my rating probably rather unfairly reflects that, but with a record breaking opening week of $162M (on a $170M budget!) who really cares what I think! It's not bloody Shakespeare; but it could have been a lot worse.(If you enjoyed this review, please see my other reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up to "Follow the Fad".

		<fullReview>This movie improves with repeated viewings. The first time I watched it, I just saw another bunch of heroes trying to stop a super villain from destroying the universe. For whatever reason, I didn't get it then but eventually did--this movie is pure fun. Great humor and (mostly) memorable characters make me forget how thin the story seemed at first. It sneaks up on you, but the world-building in this movie is also notable. This, combined with Super, makes me want to see James Gunn direct every movie from now on. Yes, it's a space adventure with a super villain trying to blow everything up, but somehow they get you to care. Peter Quill, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot have so many standout moments and lines that I would recommend this to just about anyone. Worth owning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Marvel movies to date!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely a must-see. The plot may be a bit generic and not very compelling, but the main point of this movie was to introduce us to some of the most interesting characters in recent memory. The acting is superb almost all around, and the comedy is genius, with most material hitting the mark. Of course there are also some action sequences. Not the best I've seen, but they get a pass. One of the best things about this movie: the oldies soundtrack; from the offset, the old songs are used stylistically to great effect, making it seem as if they were made specifically for use in the movie. If I had to make any complaints, it would be that I wish the main character's back-story had been explored more. I realize they're setting up for future entries, but I can't help but feel cheated out of a necessary origin story. And of course, I wish the plot had been more thought out instead of the cliché "bad guy wants to take over the universe without much motivation." Despite those minor gripes, I can't recommend this movie enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fantastic film, very funny and hugely enjoyable.It honestly felt like I was watching something in the order of the original Star Wars films back in the day they were released. I could engage with all the characters even though they are each so completely different.The way the story brought them together was very clever. The film was put together with a lot of flair and professionalism I think. There is nothing I can really fault here.The effects were amazing but really only added to a great story, great dynamic acting and touching scenes where and when required. Fun for the whole family I would say. And it never got boring, the film just got on with it for 2 hours.This was far more entertaining than the quite average and slightly old fashioned approach that we saw in Avengers in my opinion. This really blew it out of the water in fact. More zany, funny and fast past.One of the best films of 2014 so far and another super Disney related release after Frozen and Maleficent. I seriously doubt the new Star Wars movies can top this but who knows.Guardians really felt like a proper Sci Fi fantasy refresh, which we needed I think. Happened to catch a bit of one of the Star Wars prequels on TV after I came home from the second viewing of Guardians and wow what were those films dry and drab. More like political dramas in comparison to Guardians! A real lack of fun I think is safe to say.Can't wait for Guardians to come back. Hope it's as good as this first outing we got.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm bored of superhero films. There are so many of them and so little that is original within them. I loved what Nolan did with his near-perfect Dark Knight reboot, I've thoroughly enjoyed the Iron Man series thus far, the third installment being a particular high, and Andrew Garfield succeeded in making The Amazing Spider-Man his own. Beyond that? I've almost stopped bothering. Ho hum.And then came Guardians of the Galaxy.I knew nothing about this series of comic books. I hadn't read them. I hadn't even heard of them. The trailer amused me, the concept intrigued me and last night James Gunn's third full feature as director added the sweetest cherry to a very fine cake of a day. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 can't come soon enough for me! Guardians of the Galaxy opens with the young Peter Quill watching his mother die of cancer before escaping the morbid hospital scene only to be whisked into space by aliens. Fast-forward a few years and the adult Quill (Chris Pratt) aka Star Lord steals a mysterious orb much to the chagrin of Korath (Djimon Hounsou). Quill finds himself the subject of a manhunt and is thrown together with a tree (Groot - Vin Diesel), a green girl (Gamora ? Zoe Saldana), an oaf who takes everything literally (Drax ? Dave Bautista) and a Racoon (Rocket ? Bradley Cooper). Together they form the Guardians of the Galaxy as they bid to evade Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace), stay alive and, oh, save the universe.Guardians of the Galaxy is silly, funny, rapidly paced and an absolute ball. Gunn's writing and direction are filled with energy so that, whilst there is a formula to the proceedings, it is thoroughly enjoyable and demands a second trip to see it in the next week or so. I'll even forgive him for his segment in the execrable Movie 43.There is little need for thought and no effort required for emotional attachment to the characters; they are so beautifully written that one engages with them from the off and delights in every second spent in their company. Guardians of the Galaxy is an exciting, enticing and very funny. The standing jokes are not over-egged and on the occasions where one can guess the outcome of a particular mishap, the result is entirely satisfying.The costumes, production design and CGI meld seamlessly to make Guardians of the Galaxy as visually pleasing as it is exciting. Everywhere there is colour, shape and sparkle and when we reach the domain of The Collector (Benicio del Toro) it is such a visual feast of quirks, curios and filmic references that the lack of a pause button in the cinema is a frustration. As for Glenn Close's Nova Prime, she might easily have stepped out of The Hunger Games' District 1. Fabulous! Fun, funny and fantastic. It's rare that I say this, but bring on the sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy is out of this world fun. Very entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people first heard that Marvel Studio &amp; Walt Disney Company were making Guardians of the Galaxy; a lot of people were scratching their heads, what &amp; why!? First off, the comic book series created in 1968 by Arnold Drake and Gene Colan, wasn't that popular. Second off, there are way better comics that could be made into movies. Third, some critics thought that the movie couldn't be pull off. After all, who will go see a movie about a talking raccoon and walking one word talking tree? This movie prove, every doubter, wrong. It was very successful. You can pinpoint the exact moment in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy became a success, when the comic book was reboot in 2008 with the Annihilation: Conquest storyline. It was there, that the comic book, got a face-lift, with new characters, and new story lines. The film would use these comics as an outline, but even the film would change things around. As of most comic book characters, there are reimagining's, and different version of people's past. The film writers Nicole Perlman, and director James Gunn change the group from an interstellar group of space cops into a group of criminals turn super-heroes. James Gunn also add some really needed humor and indeed also a very awesome soundtrack, made from 1970s &amp; 1980s hits. Great use of Blue Swede's version of "Hooked on a Feeling". The soundtrack on a mixtape in the Walkman, and the pop culture references work for the audience as it was a good way to stay connected to the real world. Too many, out-there fantasy would made the audience feel lost, and disconnect, as they can't relate with the characters. The story tells the story of a theft named Peter Quill AKA Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) who find himself, being chase down by an alien lunatic name Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) after rediscovering and stealing an Infinity Gem from an abandoned city. Along the way, he teams up with an alien Assassin, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), two alien bounty hunters, Rocket Raccoon &amp; Groot (Voiced by Bradley Cooper &amp; Vin Diesel), and a vengeance driven maniac named Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista) to prevent Ronan from getting the stone and destroying entire planets that go against him. I wouldn't say, the plot is anything new from Marvel. It's pretty much the same plot in most of their films. It's just in space, this time. The movie did need a little more exposition, and things did felt a little bit rushed. The whole thing about them, becoming friends so quick seem a bit forced. There were a few good emotional scenes. The acting was pretty good for the main cast. Chris Pratt proves that he can be a main lead actor. Zoe Saldana is alright. Fans and children will probably go crazy over Rocket &amp; Groot. Bradley Cooper did a great job. You really couldn't tell that it was him, the whole time. While, Vin Diesel is limited in his speak; he was charming. It was like watching Iron Giant if he was a tree. Last of the main actors, Dave Bautista was pretty good with his role. He has really improve his acting chops. The villains were alright. Lee Pace was menacing, but his character was a bit one-dimensional villain type. Karen Gillan as Nebula is just plan hot. She was pretty good as the henchmen. Still, there were a few supporting actors were a bit disappointing like Michael Rooker as Yondu or John C. Reilly as Corpsman Rhomann Dey. I'm sorry, but I can't picture, Rooker as an alien with his redneck voice. Also, I can't picture Reilly as a starship trooper with his overweight body. There were a few scenes that I just couldn't picture, as well. The movie became a bit too unrealistic even for a Sci-Fiction with scenes like the heroes surviving dry-freeze temperance in deep space or them surviving large spaceship crashes. I just had to suspense my disbelief to get through them. Still, for the most part, the movie was indeed great. The humor was mostly hits, then misses. I love the 'over my head' joke. For a PG-13, the language is a bit harsh, there were a lot of frighten imagery, and extreme violent, but I think it's still alright for most children to watch it. The special and visual effect are pretty awesome. The action scenes are really stunning to the eyes. The 3D works, but it's not a must to see it in 3D. Watching it in 2D was good enough. The movie is also comic book Easter eggs nest that would make any comic nerd come to see the film and notice. Look for the cameos of horror director Lloyd Kaufman, musician Rob Zombie, and comic book writer, Stan Lee in the film, when watching. The whole collector (Benicio Del Toro) scene had enough to get fans talking for months as it has a lot of characters from previous films. The post-credit sequence was a bit disappointment, as it didn't really, promote 2015's The Avengers, the Age of Ultron nor any hint at any other oncoming Marvel film. It was a bit of a bad joke. Why did the movie had to remind me that Howard the Duck still around? At less, we know, for sure that a sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy will happen, one day. Overall: While, it's a good movie, it's not the best movie, I ever saw. It was indeed a pretty good popcorn film. I have to say, I can say I recommended watching this ragtag epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumph of original sci-fi with a giant dose of humour..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Guardians of the Galaxy' ? 8.5 out of 10 Reviewed by Matthew French.Things looked a bit shaky for Marvel Studios for a while there with 'Iron Man 3' and 'Thor: The Dark World' both being something of a let down. Then along came the excellent 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' to remind us Super Hero movie nerds that the folks in charge of this most excellent film franchise had their heads firmly screwed on. Still, there's no doubt that making 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was something of a gamble. Going with a movie about a relatively unknown group of space traveling vigilantes was definitely not the safe option. I can gladly report that the gamble has well and truly paid off. This is a movie that has the winning combination of being fresh and original while still carrying the laugh out loud sense of humour and spectacular action sequences which have become the hallmark of the Marvel cinematic universe. It is to 2014 what 'Iron Man' was to 2008. From the genuinely heart breaking opening through to the after credits scene it is a triumph of original cinema.The story revolves around Peter Quill, the self-proclaimed 'Star Lord'. Quill (who is excellently portrayed by Chris Pratt) was abducted by aliens as a child and brought up by a band of space pirates. By acquiring a priceless treasure (which turns out to be one of the all- powerful Infinity Stones) Quill finds himself on the wrong side of the Galactic law enforcement and seemingly all of the universe's shadier characters, not to mention, in the middle of an interstellar war. Joining him along the way are a motley group of misfits, all with their own agendas, comprised of 'Rocket' a genetically engineered Racoon, his bodyguard 'Groot' a super strong walking tree, 'Gamora' a master assassin and easily the hottest green chick in movie history, and 'Drax ?the Destroyer' a homicidal psychopath on a mission for revenge.The cast all do a fantastic job. Chris Pratt delivers a performance which may go down as being as iconic as Robert Downey Jr's 'Iron Man'. He is perfect as the wise-cracking, womanising, half human lead role. Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel do a great job as the voices of 'Rocket' and 'Groot'. Zoe Saldana is believable as 'Gamora', daughter of 'Thanos' (the big purple guy from the after credits scene in 'The Avengers'). And WWE wrestler Dave Bautista just about steals the show as the maniacal, and very literal 'Drax'. The interactions between this unlikely troupe provide many a laugh. For example: Rocket: (about Drax) "He takes everything literally. Metaphors go over his head". Drax: "NOTHING goes over my head! My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it." If the primary objective of a movie is to provide enjoyment, than this should be considered an instant classic. It is just about the ideal mix of action, sci-fi, and comedy. Sure, it has its faults, but given the source material that is perfectly forgivable. Go and see it.'Guardians of the Galaxy' ? 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Entertaining 2 Hours!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 10th Movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe upon it's announcement was considered a risk. "Guardians of the Galaxy" is not the among the most popular of Marvel Comics, and is or should I say - was mostly unknown amongst the General Public. To Date, for the Previous 8 MCU Movies, there are some I love, some that I like and or find entertaining - not 1 Dud amongst them. Guardians continues that streak. The movie begins, with a young Peter Quill, played following the opening sequence as adult by Chris Pratt, being abducted as boy in 1988, by a Space Ship, immediately after a personal loss. Fast Forward 26 Years - Quill is now an outlaw in another Galaxy, giving himself the personal moniker "Starlord". He ends up hooking up with the 4 fellow outlaws/orphans - Green skinned "Gamora", played by Zoe Saldana, who is adoptive daughter of "Thanos", voiced by James Brolin (Last seen post credits in "The Avengers"), "Rocket" a talking Raccoon, voiced by Brad Cooper &amp; his partner in crime "Groot" ? A Tree Creature, voiced, and motion captured by Vin Diesel, and The Gray and Red Skinned "Drax The Destroyer", played by Dave Bautista of WWE Fame. I expected a lot of Humor going in, and I was not disappointed. It's the movie's strongest trait. Pratt's character, when he was abducted, was left a mix tape of 70's Hit Songs. That and some 80's references he makes, help define the movie's personality, coupled with downright hilarious and or quirky humor from Rocket and the other characters. As you may have heard,regardless of what he means to say, Groot simply says, "I am Groot", as he his has vocal issues, explained briefly by Rocket. This gag if you define it as such, is not overused, and is used very effectively! As per the title, the 5 must band together to save the Day, At times, I feel the Dramatic Quotient of the movie could have been better, and sometimes during the first part the movie, you might feel things are rushed along, but in the end ? you are entertained for 2 Hours. And for us children of the 80's - A treat of Post Credit Scene at the very end of the credits! 3 ? out of 4 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the Avengers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first time in a long time, I have watched a movie and was really entertained. Guardians of the Galaxy beats the One-Comic-Relief, Overdramatic, Rehashed Action Movie format by a long shot. One more movie with the punchy sidekick, only there for the laughs as he accompanies the vanilla Boy Scout main man, and I will Hulk-smash the disc. It's either LOL Larry or Love Interest Lucy in these films. Many Group of Heroes (Avengers) movies fare no better, featuring literally thawed-over, stereotypical characters from older films in name or in spirit about to blast the baddies with the newest tech of the times. Yawn. Thankfully, the Guardians have actual odd and not contrived odd personalities. So does the movie. Oldies music infiltrates the film instead of overdramatic trumpet flourishes, the theme takes place in space instead of downtown Big American City (like Star Trek), and graphics are stellar. Punny, huh? Watch it on a big television screen. Yeah the Guardians film was funnier than most intentional comedies, but it had a heart. Bad guys without friends they may pretend to be, but the Guardians show that they care for each other and for other people, even if they don't say it. Insanely likable characters. Loyalties are a bit confusing at first, but it will be apparent after awhile, unlike some films, where it's painfully clear who's aligned with who from the title sequence. Also, the number of quotable lines within this action film is incredible, rare from a movie with a talking animal character, I know. Halfway through the movie, I wondered when the movie would be over. Except this time, I was hoping that it wouldn't ever end. Do yourself a big favor, crawl if you must to your local movie rental location, and watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You're off the artistic roll call forever. You're another shill. Everything you say is suspect and every word that comes out of your mouth is now like a turd falling into my drink." - Bill HicksMarvel Studios has repeatedly hired "quirky" directors in an attempt to elevate the quality of their blockbusters. Based on their postmodern superhero flicks ("Kick-Ass" and "Chronicle"), for example, Matthew Vaughn and Josh Trask were hired to direct "First Class" and "The Fantastic Four". Based on his supposed "reinvigoration" of the romance genre with "500 Days of Summer, Mac Webb was similarly given several "Spider-Man" movies. Shane Black and Joss Whedon, postmodern nerd-kings who specialise in narrative irreverence, were likewise tasked with "spicing up" "Iron Man 3" and "The Avengers". The rest of the Studio's catalogue is filled with pictures by such "prestigeous" guys as Ang Lee, Sam Raimi, James Mangold, Bryan Singer and Kenneth Branagh. In most cases, the demands of the Marvel brand suck these films dry of anything interesting. Though engineered to be "edgy", these films mostly have the effect of neutering their supposed auteurs. James Gunn directed "Super" in 2010, another postmodern - and supposedly "irreverent" - superhero movie. Gunn was given the helm of "Guardians of the Galaxy" in 2012. Like most Marvel features, the result is a zillion dollar cartoon made by machines. You can almost see the boxes being ticked."Galaxy" opens with a child being abducted from his dying mother. This kid grows to become Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), an intergalactic space thief. The film's opening action sequence ? lifted from "Raiders of the Lost Ark" - finds Quill stealing a gonad shaped MacGuffin. As this MacGuffin houses an INFINITY STONE! which grants AWESOME POWERS! to whosoever wields it, it is pursued by seemingly everyone in the universe. They want it. Quill has it."Galaxy" then introduces us to Rocket (a genetically engineered Racoon), Groot (Chewbacca with chlorophyll) and Gamora (warrior-eyecandy). All three are attempting to get their hands on the INIFINITY STONE! The film also contains a dull subplot involving a BIG BAD VILLAIN who wears a cape, spews dull bad-guy dialogue, wields a hammer and flies around in a giant spaceship attempting to destroy planets. Why? Because he's a bad guy."Galaxy" is less superhero movie than space-opera. "Star Wars" without the novelty value, "Serenity"/"Firefly" without the cleverness, "Futurama"/"Fifth Element" without the irreverence, it mostly bludgeons you with money. Gunn's idea of "wit" is to play 1980s pop over sequences. Elsewhere he thinks a grunting tree and a talking raccoon alone constitute "wittiness", as though the duo's mere presence somehow turns bad writing original.Our hero, Peter Quill, is himself a weird bag of juxtapositions. Quill's supposedly a space rascal, a lovable archetype in the vein of Han Solo or Mal Reynolds. But this "resourceful underdog" archetype doesn't work if he's also an insanely muscular, man-child. We the audience are never sure if Quill is clever, dashing, lazy, disciplined, funny, strong, weak, stupid, a virgin, a stud, naive, a rogue or an idiot on steroids. Han Solo was consistent. Quill's Flash Gordon with a Ken doll's IQ."Galaxy's" best sequences involve Quill and his buddies escaping from an orbital prison. It also contains one good running gag in which Rocket tricks people into stealing body parts. The rest of Gunn's film ? its "heroic sacrifices", its "A New Hope" inspired climax, its CGI dogfights and endless fisticuffs ? unfolds as per formula. Co-starring John C. Riley, Zoe Saldana, Benecio Del Toro and Glenn Close.6/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING- This review is made from the opinions of a person who has never fully seen a superhero movie.Guardians of the Galaxy has a simple plot yet it is so versatile. For people who have never read the comics, all you need to know is that the five bickering good guys join together to stop the bad guy from getting the 'special object' that can end the world. Sounds like a typical PG movie, eh? WRONG.The characters are lovable, the acting is great, the music is AMAZING, the action scenes are great, the CGI is great, EVERYTHING IS GREAT!The movie is amazing but only has two flaws. The movie doesn't really explore locations and it feels like we didn't go anywhere by the end and the main villain is just 'okay'. This movie is by far the best of the year and will be remembered for a long time. P.S Gamora is by far one of my favorite villains in years, her actress is amazing! She should have a spin-off!!!</fullReview>

I enjoyed how the whole thing is adult comedic yet the play of it all is animated family fun created, it can fool the parent too late by the time the kids are snuggled on the couch. I personally love it because it's a breath of fresh air and frankly I'm a sucker for top of the end CGI and cinematography given that as an artist myself, I see my style on the latest and up to date innovation of technology quality. This script although some parts I found cheesy, I couldn't help but to tear up with how they chose to make grut tree the protector of the guardians.

		<shortDescription>A sublime assault on the senses, easily the biggest hit of the summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1988, the young Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) has just seen his mother die of cancer and, after rushing out the hospital in a flurry of tears, finds himself abducted in to space. Twenty six years later, he's a space hopping, inter-galactic misfit, with a penchant for '70s soul and Motown and is in possession of a special orb, which is wanted by a distant relation of Jim Carrey's The Mask named Gamora (Zoe Saldana) who is planning to use it to betray her maniacal ruler Ronan (Lee Pace) who is planning to overtake the universe. But the orb is also wanted by desperate duo Rocket, a talking raccoon, and Groot, a rather monosyllabic talking tree. However, it turns out none of them are entitled to it and they all find themselves thrown in to the jail house, where they cross paths with the strong, silent Drax (Dave Bautista) who has a personal vendetta against Ronan. Together, they must unite together as one and stop his diabolical plan in it's tracks.Guardians of the Galaxy has undoubtedly been the box office hit of the summer. So much so, that even I, on the last day of it's release, have taken a trip out to give it a glance. While the fanfares had died down slightly, it's interesting to chart how over the course of two months, this grandiose offering has taken the film world by storm, a risky venture as well, in as much as there are no established Marvel characters in the lead roles. But simply from the publicity poster, it inflames the senses, with it's dazzling, colourful array of characters and effects. And this would be a real case of reliably judging a book by it's cover, since the film delivers what it promises, a jaw dropping visual spectacle in every sense of the word.Like the previous Marvel encounter, Avenger's Assemble, this doesn't make the mistake of becoming all style over substance, keeping the film flowing with an easy going humour throughout the film that is resplendent with the characters. Pratt's lead is a naturally buffoonish guy through-out the film, who has a wise cracking personality to match, while Cooper's talking raccoon is unavoidably crazy by it's very nature. As for Groot, he's voiced by Diesel, who just says the same line over and over again, which would probably suit his acting ability in more parts where he just appears as himself, although his character here, in the end reel (and throughout really), provides the film with it's more emotional, touching element. These characters are juxtaposed through-out with the more dynamic, forceful character's, in the shape of Saldana's lizard skinned female heroine and Bautista's hard, no nonsense presence. That's not to mention a supporting cast including the likes of Michael Rooker, Djimon Hounsou, John C. Reilly, Glenn Close and Benicio Del Toro.Word of mouth, at least in part, must spread to make something a hit, and in Guardians case it's that it ticks all the right boxes and there's something to appeal to everyone, a lot of effort has been put in to every part of it and it pays off brilliantly. *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I regret not watching it earlier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just start off by saying that I am generally not very picky with giving a 10, I am not saving it for some 12 Years A Slave kind of movie because it would be unfair to group all movies together, each has its own genre and should be rated according to the movies in its genre. So I rated it according to the movies in this genre (Superhero-action) as oppose to the 'all movies I've watched in my life' .So this was a movie I was not excited to see at all. All that came to mind was the lousy old days when my father would make me watch Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy, and for some odd reason, I just assumed it would be the same thing. And god, Chris Pratt ? Seriously ? But when the movie came out, I was in the UK and I heard some of my friends who watched it say that it was too American and bad. So it just assumed it would be one of those movies that try too hard to be different but they fail so miserably. Then I heard that it was doing so well in the box office and I thought hey I should at least check it out. I finally got a chance to watch this movie last week (I know, so late). So I entered this movie having only watched the trailer and heard how much it earned, and that was all I knew about it, so it was a surprise to know that it was a Marvel movie. Here's my sort of brief review of -Movie introduction: So right off the bat, the movie grabs you and makes you 'tear up', even though you have literally known the characters for two or three minutes. Then the next six minutes or so, it all changes and starts with a pleasant song that brings a smile to your face.Characters: The movie then started to introduce various characters with some pretty cool makeup and holy guacamole those graphics were almost as good as Avatar. But there was much more to the characters than their looks, they each had compelling story lines and backgrounds that were not a snooze fest, you actually felt bad for these characters and did at some point feel their pain and most definitely their excitement and bad-ass moments, you'd be like Oh Yeah you about to get SMOKED - BOOOOYAAAAAH. Music: So anyway, the movie kept surprising me with its choice of music, each was carefully picked and oh so divine. I haven't listened to such a great play-list in years. From the Pina Colada song to I Want You Back, they all brought back so many great memories. And I'm pretty sure than any person with a decent taste in movies/music must have heard of at least 30% of those songs because they are gold.Actors : I was least excited to watch Chris Pratt in the movie because I didn't think I would take him seriously but I was wrong. Yes I can't see him acting in a drama but he kicked some serious butt in this film. His body transformation was the most surprising (and pleasant). He acted really great and not once did I think that he was trying too had or even be someone else, he really became Peter Quill and I am so happy that they cast him. As for Zoe, mama mia ! Who knew these girl was such a bad-ass ! Generelly, i superhero movies, the girl is always wearing super tight or revealing clothes (which I don't really mind) and keeps pouting and talking slow and seductive and keep doing this thing with her eyes and her body.. I can almost never see past the fact that they are in this movie just for the eyes. But she was not ! not once did I feel that she was trying to be sexy, which I loved, because she came out looking like a complete bad-ass. More actresses should learn from her: don't try to be sexy, just be your awesome self. The other actors of course also did a wonderful job but Groot and his Racoon (I'm sorry I forgot his name) were animated to there's not much acting there, but even their acting was superb.Graphics: AS GOOD AS IT GETS. I got to watch it in 3D and the most amazing scenes were the ones with Groot. To me, the scenes where Groot was featured were the most magical, and that beats some sick shots of the galaxy.No doubt has this movie raised the bar for superhero movies in terms of graphics.Plot: So the movie does its best to make everything clear by letting the characters reveal the plot by either their cations or words. To me, it was not very confusing especially having no prior knowledge to Guardians Of The Galaxy or any Avengers hero 's story. But my brother watched it me, and he did have enough information to keep talking to me and saying Oh Look Here Is This Guy from Thor, Here Is This Guy From The Next Avengers.. bla bla. So you will definitely understand 98% of the movie, its only that 2% that people with prior knowledge would know. To sum up, this is by far the BEST Marvel film I've watched (discounting X-Men if you'll count it) and only the Third best superhero film I've ever watched (the first being The Dark Knight then X-Men). Everything in this movie was perfect, the action, the music, the graphics, the actors, the storyline, the comedy.. It was all just perfect.I highly recommend you watching it, and while this is not particularly a children's movie, you can take a child older than 10 to watch it because its not bloody or violent, its just too slow- paced for children to understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marvel has hit the ball again out the park with another great hit adding to the line of the successful films in their current cinematic run. Guardians of The Galaxy is different, fresh, and a brand new take on the superhero genre. It focuses on a team of misfits who would have to set aside their own differences to save the galaxy, and I know this plot may sound generic but with the amazing story and the nice touch of humour throughout it's a guaranteed fun ride all the way. One of the best characters to look out for is Bradley Cooper as Rocket, a raccoon with a dangerous attitude. Even Chris Pratt who plays Star-Lord gave a surprisingly great performance. All around this film is excellent and if your a Marvel fan bonus as there is tons of Easter Eggs and a certain galactic titan that makes a surprise appearance in the middle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a typical action, action, action movie. To me that means that the movie is just a collection of action sequences, without must thought given on how to get from one action sequence to the next.The good part of this movie is that the glue holding the action sequences together is fairly well done. They use a lot of humor, which is why some people have enjoyed the movie. And some of the cast are 'characters'. You know - interesting beings.The downside is that 20-30% of the action sequences are fluff. Totally unnecessary to the story. At one point I leaned back, and considered how I could while away the time until the current action sequence was over. IE it was boring. Zoom, zoom, bang, bang. Seen it.Another part that I disliked was all the time that went into setting up for the sequel. Leaving some loose ends is one thing, but this could have just as easily been called "Part 1".</fullReview>

I loved how the song was an important part of the story and the only part I didn't like was when Groot died, but that problem was quickly resolved. Stan Lee was seen in this film and that made me laugh because he is in marvel films and it is always amusing to see him in the films. Rocket and Groot were a funny combo and I was always laughing when they were around. Everyone was so amusing and the plot line was entertaining. I really enjoyed watching this film and would happily watch again and again. 10/10, I recommend that people watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most surprising movies I have ever seen in multiple ways. Not that I thought it was going to be bad. James Gunn was already one of my favorite Writer/Directors of all time. He made quite a few cult classics including one of my favorite movies, Super, which really took me away. Once I knew that James Gunn was directing this, I was skeptical. Having seen his independent films, I knew that him directing a Hollywood movie would either be one of the greatest films of all time, or a complete flop. I was very relieved coming out of the theater that it was the first one. Or I would've been if I hadn't been laughing my *** off at the easter egg.Another reason that I was surprised is that this is a Rocket Raccoon movie. Rocket Raccoon was probably created when someone at Hollywood got high and doodled a Raccoon with a jet pack on. Not to say the comics were bad, it's just that now, Rocket Raccoon is better than The Avengers. And that's saying a lot.The casting, action, comedy, and CGI are all superbly done. There's a ton of comedy, which is made better by the fact that it is good comedy. There's truly stunning special effects, but not too much that this turns into a Michael Bay movie. The action is everything anyone wants from an amazing space opera, but they don't get carried away and end up with a sci-fi Expendables. And everyone plays their various characters incredibly well, even Vin Diesel, who literally only says "I am Groot" about fifty times.All in all, I would recommend this to anyone, even people who don't like science fiction or super heroes. This is even family-friendly, and has enough 70's and 80's references to make anyone from that time nostalgic. Any age, any personality, this is the perfect movie for anyone to watch. Good job, Marvel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Third Best Marvel Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is a triumph of Hollywood filmmaking. It's probably one of the biggest risks in the history of blockbuster movies; an unknown property with unknown characters played by (relatively) unknown actors written and directed by an unknown director about a team including a talking racoon, and a tree. No studio in their right mind would ever have picked that up. Marvel is a studio of risk-taking though. Their risks keep paying off and as a result they keep paving the way not only for superhero movies, but for the movie business as a whole. They even greenlit a sequel before it was even released. Well, Guardians of the Galaxy is another roaring success.A big worry for Guardians was setting up a team, developing the characters, and giving them a good enough plot to warrant them all together. I mean, there's a reason why Avengers was built up with solo movies to develop each character individually. Again, this is another thing Guardians was successful with, as each character is developed really well. They're each given a past, a specific role on the team, their own personal quirks, differing goals and aspirations, but never at the expense of the rest of the movie. Guardians, unsurprisingly, was also full of comedy. While previous attempts in Iron Man 3 and The Dark World completely failed, Guardians was absolutely hilarious. There are just so many moments that had the whole cinema laughing, from Groot constantly repeating that phrase, to Drax taking everything literally, to Rocket in general. The post-credits sequence is also played for laughs (it doesn't tease anything, so don't feel you have to stay through all the credits) with a surprising cameo that I won't spoil. Acting is...well it's a good effort. Chris Pratt does a really good job of Starlord, especially with the amount of work he had to put into his body. I mean, it wasn't long ago he was quite podgy, and here he's shirtless with a chiselled torso. Dude bulks up really well. On the actual acting side of things he does a great job balance the comedic elements with the more serious and heart-felt moments. If this doesn't make a star out of him, nothing will. Zoe Saldana is on top form as Gamora. Besides the fact she looks gorgeous (even in green) and is as capable as ever with the action scenes, she also manages to balance comedy with emotion. Bradley Cooper pretty much owns the movie, even though it's only his voice that's present. He manages to do so much with it. He puts so much emotion in, from his bouts of rage to his more touching moments when the truth comes out. Again though he does a marvellous job with his character's humour. 50% of what makes Rocket so funny is Cooper's delivery. Dave Bautista shows how he really can't act, I'm sad to say, although it's a hell of a lot better a job I expected. The script he was given is full of words you'd never expect a man of his physical stature to say in a movie, and like everyone else his comedic delivery is spot on. Maybe, though, the lines were a bit too much for him as he does stumble a bit here and there, and beyond a lust for vengeance, he doesn't really portray any other emotion other than bland. Then there's Vin Diesel who just says "I am Groot" in three or four slightly different ways. It's not bad, but it's hardly taxing work ripe with opportunity.Wrapping this up with the visuals, which are as good as always. Rocket and Groot are rendered to absolute perfection, as are all the sci-fi backgrounds and ships. There's a number of shots that are almost breathtaking, including one of Starlord thrusting himself across a cloudy green void to clutch Gamora, and Groot lighting up the interior of a ship with lots of glowing spores. Of course the 3D really helped these shots pop out, giving them a huge amount of depth, but they will always be seared into the back of my eyes. James Gunn. You the man. Only you could have made Guardians of the Galaxy work so well, effortlessly balancing humour with genuine emotion. It's very rare for me to find myself bawling my eyes one minute and laughing my head off the next and not feeling put off by either. Guardians of the Galaxy looks great, sounds great, adds depth to the MCU with a plot of itself that is quite layered, with three-dimensional characters and moments that'll make you laugh and cry. I cannot praise Guardians of the Galaxy enough, although I feel subsequent rewatches will start to show the cracks. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Sci Fi Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was definitely one to remember for a lifetime. There are many twists and turns make for quite the adventurous movie. Each characters encounter problems, tragedies, challenges and power that they are forced to use if necessary. Enjoyable aspect of the film was the way they deliver the funny lines. Acting was so real that I almost forgot that some of them were aliens, creatures and the music is unbelievably good. Film was a good length: not excessively long but long enough to tell the story. Another great aspect of the film was the special effects, particularly with regards to all the scenes featuring the advanced weapons and air combat. This movie was also different from the rest because it had more story concerning the characters ' lost loves. The way they interact to each other is very very funny. It was so cool to actually fell like you were there. Overall, this was, in my opinion, the BEST SCI FI FILM yet and portrays the fantastical story of marvels, super heroes extremely well. The fast-paced nature of the film, team cooperation, comedic and well written script. It will leave you feeling good, happy and a sense of being helpful to anyone. You will fall in love in each guardians. This movie is truly a great one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprised Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOW! I'll tell you. I was quite skeptical about this movie. Its funny because during the trailer up to maybe the first five minutes of the movie I kept a pretty straight face on while the rest of audience laughed it up like a bunch of babies at Disney world. I was like... seriously? Its all giggles and smiles for you people. I really thought this movie was going to blow, and for a second I really thought this was a movie that would simply appeal to lame people. Seeing the trailers and such, I thought they were forcing more than necessary comedy for the movie and I thought it was going to be absolutely ridiculous. I guess what made me go watch it was the reviews. I always read the bad reviews to see whether or not the movie is going to be good. I was quite surprised at the limited bad reviews, because honestly we live in an age where there are simply a lot of haters, and if you don't want to waste money they actually give you an excuse not to. Many times I have disagreed with them, but hey, they have actually helped me at times too. But there weren't that many reviews and after a couple days it was a ridiculous average of 9/10 stars! I was like whoa! I had to watch it... not because I knew it was going to be good, but because there was probably something really stupid in the movie that a group of people would really like and inflate the reviews.But honestly, I go in, and after the first five minutes I am like okay... not terrible. And we slowly see a development of the characters. The story arc is very good and appeals to a huge range of audiences because it has a neutral tone which doesn't force any ideology. In many ways the story arc is actually pretty innocent and away from politics. So in that sense it was very appealing. The main character gets taken from aliens right after his mother dies and is raised as a merchant and hire for money. The main focal point is there is an orb which actually connects the entire Marvel Universe together. So besides for the Story Arc, the "fluff" or universe is expanded and makes more sense if you watched Thor 1 &amp;2 as well as The Avengers with these stones of power. There is one in here, and you see familiar enemies from those movies. It gives you a better view of whats going on with Marvel and future films. Back to the story arc, not knowing what it is, Star Lord takes it and connects with other Merchants who have their own agenda's to fulfill while being tracked a monstrous alien race who wants nothing more than to destroy all life in the galaxy. We see how they actually relate to one another and become friends on a quest to defeat an enemy who simply wants to destroy worlds. The Marvel Film Industry has done a fantastic job making the villains look freaky as hell. We have gone from Frost Giants to Dark Elves to these dark mysterious dudes who maybe related to those in The Avengers. WOW! Good story, comedy adds a bit more character to the characters in the film without being ridiculous and wow to the special effects and creativity as always. Maybe the top Marvel Performance yet... I'm still deciding. Some interesting things we see, are the Collector from the end of the credits in Thor II, as well as a glimpse of Ultron. CREDITS SUCK! Stupid ending, don't waste your time, its just a stupid joke, unless they are really going to make a Howard the Duck movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frigginn Epic!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the trailer, I wasn't expecting a very 'amazing' film compared to the other Marvel films... but boy was I wrong! This film has literally everything: comedy, tragedy, action, epicness etc. I have never written a review for a film before and if this movie made me write one? Well I think that speaks for itself. One aspect that I love about this film is that the comedy isn't forced or desperate - it's perfect! There are moments when you'll definitely have tears of laughter! With films nowadays, I always feel that perhaps they had too much story and less action or visa versa. But this had the perfect balance which made it that much more better. I can honestly say that this is probably the best, if not, one of the best films of the year so far - the rating just confirms how amazing it is. This is one of the highest rated films! Only 0.2 below The Godfather... Surely that's enough to convince you to watch it! MUST SEE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Marvel Universe goes cosmic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially I had low expectations for GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, a comic book movie built around a group of Marvel Comic's D-listers, but they won me over with a series of great trailers that really sold the movie. And for once, the steak was better than the sizzle, because GUARDIANS is everything a great summer blockbuster should be and more.What makes GUARDIANS so great:Start with great characters played by perfect actors. While GUARDIANS story is noting new-a group of ragtag misfits and losers have to save the universe, its the who that's doing that matters. Chris Pratt in a star making performance,is Peter Quill, kidnapped from Earth as a child and now in the employ of a bunch of cosmic bounty hunters. Zoe Saldana is the green skinned Gamora, and deadly assassin and adopted daughter of the tyrant Thanos. Dave Bautista is the truly literal minded Drax the Destroyer, a brute out to get revenge for the massacre of his family. Then there is Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel as Rocket and Groot, a trash mouthed, gun slinging raccoon and a walking and talking tree respectively. Rocket and Groot might be the finest blending of voice acting and CGI ever, as these two charge through the action as fully realized characters. Very impressive since Groot has only one line, "I am Groot," which he repeats with changes in inflection to get across what he's saying.A terrific script by director James Gunn and Nicole Perlman, with plenty of rat a tat dialogue that perfectly defines the principle characters, such as Quill's smart mouthed bravado, Rocket's growling snark and Drax's utter literalness. There is also plenty of heart and soul, never once does it stray camp territory or parody.Great special effects that take the Marvel Universe into the heavens of for the first time: we get to see the Kree and Xandorians, The Collector's lair, a Kree prison in space along with the head of a dead Celestial. There is an appearance by one of the crystals from the Infinity Gauntlet, which our heroes must keep from falling into the hands of more than one villain. The action scenes, and there are plenty of them, are as good as anything in THE AVENGERS.A great supporting cast that includes Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser, the chief bad guy, along with an un-credited appearance by Josh Brolin as Thanos. John C. Reilly and Glenn Close are Kree officials, Benicio Del Toro is The Collector, while Stan Lee makes his now familiar cameo; some where in there is Nathan Fillion. And Michael Rooker seems to be doing Merle Dixon in Blue Face as Yondu, Peter's not so happy boss.A wonderful soundtrack of 70's oldies courtesy of the tapes Peter's mother made for him as a child before he was kidnapped; there's no way I can dislike a movie with "Come and Get Your Love" by Redbone played over the opening credits. Best of all, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY brings back a real sense of fun to the summer blockbuster; as good as THE DARK KNIGHT, AMAZING SPIDERMAN, any one of the X-MEN movies were, they all had a big halo of angst around their heroes. I'm not complaining, that's who they are, but it's nice to spend some time with some comic book guys who are clearly having a blast at being who they are.As for the after credits scene, lets just say that one of the greatest crimes of 80's cinema gets a reprieve of sorts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GOTG: The Next Star Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many went into this film with high expectations and hype that was unprecedented, much like the somewhat disappointing Godzilla (2014) from earlier this year. Not many knew what to expect with this film considering that the Guardians of the Galaxy were for the most part unheard of characters to the general public. This film did not disappoint in any way. It is by far the greatest Marvel film ever made, downing the Avengers and Days of Future Past.I went into this movie with a feeling that I don't usually get with a film. I knew that this was going to be different and good at the same given time and I was not let down. From the very opening scene to the ending credits, there was not even a second of boredom. To say that this film was entertaining would be putting it under the bus. This film was exhilarating. Never have I seen a film that grasped my attention and kept me in awe from start to finish.As for the technical aspects, this film has the best CGI I have ever seen. Not once did the animation look even relatively fake or cheesy. The CGI will probably revolutionize the field much like 2009's Avatar. I felt as though I could reach out and touch these alien creatures and the amazingly designed ships. The score of the film was beautiful as was the cinematography. There were emotional scenes that were played so well with the score that it was as if they were interchangeable parts that had to be together to work in unison. Every shot of this film was gorgeous and breathtaking. I saw so many things that I have never seen in a film before and for them to capture it so crisply is truly astounding. The acting was very well done by all of the cast members. There may not be any Oscar buzz for the cast, but that doesn't mean that they weren't perfect for their roles. Chris Pratt was genius as Star Lord, Bautista was hilarious as Drax, the Destroyer and Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel did great jobs for voice acting, both being highlights for the film.As far as writing, this movie did something truly unique. it focused on all of the Guardians with equal screen time and equal information of their lives, though Star Lord may have a bit more for obvious reasons. All of the personalities of the main characters were written so well that I forgot for a period of time that it was even a movie. The humor is not dirty (for the most part) and is not slap stick and tiresome. Every scene with humor did its job to make the whole crowd in the theater laugh hysterically. The dialogue was simply that well written.Every aspect of this film was great. Obviously, it isn't a perfect film but it manages to do something that directors have forgotten about. It entertains the audience and that is the sole purpose of the entire film. Films now rely so heavily on art and the director's ideas of "uniqueness" that most films are only appreciated by certain groups. Guardians of the Galaxy is a film that anyone can watch and they will enjoy themselves from start to finish and never want to leave the theater.While watching this movie at the opening Friday, I couldn't help but think to myself over and over again that this is the next Star Wars. It has the same chemistry and formula but, in my own opinion, it exceeds the original Star Wars. It is an updated and modern form of that film technique of pure entertainment mixed with humor and character development that adults can relate to as well.It is rare that I say this, but this film will make you cry, make you laugh, make you excited, make you fearful, etc. It is every genre and yet no genre. Guardians is going to be a staple in film and will one day be considered one of the greatest Sci Fi films ever. James Gunn was the director of one of the worst films of 2013 in Movie 43, but he has proved that he is one of the elite despite a horrible effort a year prior. This film resurrects the original intention and purpose of film: to entertain. I believe it will be the next Star Wars and spawn many more films to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great film i am a bit of a fan boy but even my wife loved this movie. I think the fact that is lesser known allows for a wider audience to come in and enjoy just as a sci-fi action comedy. The comedic timing in this film was perfect. The way the characters play off each other easily makes this the best ensemble cast marvel has put together. The character development was well done. Guardians gave enough to support the story but left much to be desired for the subsequent sequels. Guardians also totes the best soundtrack for any marvel film. While it focuses on some the most popular pop records from years past the score was also done very well. For all of the none comic book movie fans go see this film you will be throughly entertained.</fullReview>

It is very well written, funny, has a perfect editing, good dialogues, irony - but transports a nonetheless crude ideology of war and the esthetics of weaponry and death. Thus it insults the intelligence of anyone who is not into ego-shooters. It pretends to undermine clichés but finally consists out of nothing else. What a bitter disappointment after great movies like the latest X-Men etc. Are the other people who rated it so well really not aware of its message? Wage war at any cost against your enemies!

		<fullReview>This film has had the whole treasury thrown at it and ought to have been fantastic for it. It fell below that aspiration for two crucial defects:- Firstly the main hero of the piece isn't a strong character. He is lead along by others more than doing any leading himself and that detracts from his appeal.Secondly the main villain may as well be a cardboard cut-out for all the emotion and menace he brings to the plot. Utterly devoid of any ability to inspire fear he appears at various points in the film like an advert may appear on TV - ie an interval to the rest of the plot.The supporting animation and effects do their best to prop matters up but the failings of the leading characters limit their effects to merely dragging matters back to adequate. One other thing is that there appears to be no reason at all for the characters to band together. The bonding is utterly forced. It's not awful by any stretch of anything but Star Wars it isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie, not knowing much about this lesser known comic series, and hearing all the early reviews.I will say, it's squarely aimed at younger teens. The humor, while there, isn't very witty and rather obvious, stuff that would have made me chuckle when I was a little kid, but now? No. This was disappointing as most of the other Marvel films often had a lot of clever adult wit to them. The plot is also very basic, and just isn't very inventive.The action is all very PG-rated stuff too. Much as there was all sorts of things going on, you weren't worried about any of the characters at all, nor in how the story would turn out.Groot turns out to be ridiculously overpowering and he eliminates a lot of the perceived danger to the other characters. He quite literally smashes something like 30 guys all at once.The main villain is as cardboard as you can get. I can't even remember his name, or what his motives were. He was just like the bad guy from THOR Dark World. Just kinda 'there', with another big scary looking ship.Rocket Racoon, while expertly crafted in CGI, his voice acting was just terrible. In fact, everything about him was very wooden. I had thought that a Racoon whose been experimented on with cybernetics and such and with a penchant for heavy caliber weapons and street slang would be funny, but its obvious that his character is just trying too hard to BE that diminutive overachiever... His dialog really needed a better voice actor who sounded more like the character should, and with some sharper lines....I just don't know with this movie. It just doesn't rank very well compared to most of Marvel's other outings. It has all the splash and dash 'appearance' of those films, but lacked the adult angle that the others have had. The last thing I expected was such a child oriented film. I guess the good news is, I can show this to my son a lot earlier than the other films due to their content.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than exactly 3 of the 6 Star Wars films - I bet you can guess which ones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No spoilers in here, the movie wasn't substantial enough. I decided to succumb to the hype and see it in the theater, mainly because the "hated it" reviews on this site were rather unconvincing and underwhelming. After seeing the movie, I think I can understand why - it isn't really that bad, isn't really that good, and isn't really worth a lot of effort for a deep analysis. I fell asleep during some portion of the movie, not sure how long I was out and don't really care what I missed. I do know that the plot was about retrieval of an all-powerful orb. This may very well be the Star Wars for the current generation, but then again Justin Bieber may very well be the Elvis for the current generation.The spaceships were mostly goofy looking (can't quite call them unoriginal) but there was nothing as memorable as a land speeder, X-wing, or TIE fighter on display. It's getting tiring writing about how the need to exploit 3D is ruining the action scenes of major motion pictures, but it's true here too.I had trouble following all of the characters' and planets' names, but to be fair, I'm sure I couldn't have named Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO, R2-D2, Tattooine or Alderaan in 1977 before the 3rd viewing (or maybe it was before buying the action figures and play sets).Chris Pratt tries to channel Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Indiana Jones, with a little bit of John McClane thrown in for good measure. I guess I'll let the millenials decide if he succeeded, it didn't work for me. I like Zoe Saldana but her sickly pale-green pallor and facial markings in this movie were really disturbing and off-putting. I'm not even sure if this Freaky Five are more interesting than the Fantastic Four, and those movies were near the bottom of the barrel.The selection of 70's music was good, though it is totally out of place (imagine if Luke Skywalker went around jamming to Beach Boys tunes). I know that the movie is set in 2016, not "a long time ago", but that still can't help its "sci-fi classic" status.Probably the worst element of the movie was Glenn Close as Nova Prime. It just kept reminding me of another over-hyped movie with a threadbare plot: Air Force One.The things I liked the most were the costumes and makeup of some of the villains, particularly Nebula. The main villain (forget his name, but he was a cross between Darth Vader, the emperor, and the Terminator) was sufficiently badass, though by the end I was wondering why Michael Rooker's blue Mr. T wasn't the sole main character, what with his whistle-controlled space needle and all.I have no idea whether this film was faithful to the comic book - now I know how people who say stuff like "I didn't know anything about the origin of Spider-Man before seeing this movie" feel.In the end, I guess the movie was OK but I have to say I was fooled by the hype. For a movie that many are calling the Star Wars for our time, I just kept thinking "OK, this is obviously much more entertaining than Episodes I-III (so is a Ti-D-Bowl commercial), but it doesn't hold a candle to the original trilogy".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just heard it should be a great film. Well, it wasn't. During the first 90 minutes i couldn't get rid of the feeling that Disney sent Marvel some people to make the film more about cheap humor and family action than a real superhero action film. A merely explained universe and situation and just in the end some action that fits the effort taken for the nice effects. For me the first scene was OK, i hoped they would explain the personality of Peter Quill and his motivation. But you only get a plot hole of 26 years which is never filled. It is just a cut into nearly 90 minutes of cheap slapstick and mediocre action with nice effects. Too much time of the movie is just about bad jokes and slapstick comedy as well as 'action' scenes which were really disappointing for me. Far too late towards the end it got better and in fact really nice - just to end with again bad comedy scenes during the credits. Afterwards when thinking about the film i had so many unanswered questions.. What is that treaty of peace they are talking about all the time? Why is this whole galaxy mostly about awkward colored people? How is the earth involved into this galaxy? What has Peter Quill to do with this Planet he saves? What is the motivation for Ronan? He is just evil, right? They wasted too much time on bad and (for me) misplaced comedy instead of explaining more about the whole universe and how they got to this situation and in fact what the situation really is.. The best thing about this movie is the maybe great story to follow this when Peter finds out about his father and the bigger evils in this universe than Ronan..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing...but #37?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Currently, about a week after its debut, "Guardians of the Galaxy" is ranked #37 on IMDb. I assume that by the time you read my review it will have dropped in the rankings--mostly because the most rabid fans were probably the first to see and review it and the rest of us folks will be getting to it a bit later. This is often the case with big blockbuster films--though with an overall score of about 8.7, it's bound to stay well within IMDb's top 250. As for me, I really enjoyed the movie but cannot agree that the film is THAT good. Excellent yes....#37...nah.The best thing going for "Guardians" is that with the huge glut of super-hero films during the last decade or so, this one manages to stand apart--something that cannot be said of most of the films. There is just a certain sameness that make me less than thrilled with all the comic book hero films. But a few, like this film and "Scott Pilgrim" manage to seem different enough to merit your rushing to see them. So, of course, rush to see this oneSo how is it different? Well, there are MANY ways. Chris Pratt (Peter Quill) is NOT your typical super-hero. He is NOT a disaffected millionaire or guy bitten by a spider or a super-being from outer space- -he's actually pretty ordinary in most ways. But, like his character on "Parks and Recreation", Pratt is a bit of a goof-ball--a dopey but likable guy who manages to do well despite himself. This is kind of cute--but fortunately the film is NOT just about a dopey goof-ball but he's assisted by a strange group of new-found friends with strange abilities. Another way this is VERY different is that almost the entire film takes place in outer space. While "Thor" and "Superman" have their brief moments in space, "Guardians" is almost completely there--and as such has a HUGE reliance on special effects and CGI. It is a SUPER- expensive film because of this and its all-star cast--coming in at about $170,000,000--which is greater than the gross national product of many nations!!! So, although the film has earned over $100,000,000. it has a long way to go to earn back its costs--though I am pretty sure this will soon be the case. As for these special effects, they are beautiful and the film has such an other-worldly look as it jumps from one weird planet to another. So, the film is absolutely jam-packed with eye candy. Finally, the dialog (mostly from Pratt but also due a lot to his new friend, a VERY sentient raccoon) is amazingly strange. Often crude, it sounds much like the dialog was spiced up a bit here and there by 13 year-olds. While I usually don't like this, it DOES make the film very different.So what's not to like? Well, not much. However, because the story has so much action and CGI, you do sacrifice a bit when it comes to plot, back story of many of the characters and you might just feel a bit overwhelmed. Still, it's the sort of overwhelmed I don't mind feeling from time to time.By the way, if you do see the film, you'll certainly enjoy the obligatory Stan Lee cameo--it's one of the better ones I can recall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Sci-Fi and so hoped that this movie would be great given the reviews, but it is literally one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!There are no emotional or intellectual catalysts behind this WORSE THAN B MOVIE film. Who gives a damn about such stupid, un-developed characters? "I am Groot." This is the best line of the film, and Groot, a living tree, is the best character. Enough said?If you like stupid, campy, sci-fi films, smoke some dope and maybe you'll like this one!If you want to listen to 1970s pop music, get a cassette tape!Such a disappointment! Wasted 2 hours of my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is simply overrated the vote given here is just to neutralize the scoreIMO, this movie failed FEW aspects, 1. casting, why would they cast Bautista in the first place? because of his size? Cast Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper for their voice? why don't they switch Bautista for Vin? I think that will be more awesome2. obsolete and laughable plot, a guy could hold the infinity stone and conduct the energy to his partner like he is a conductor? sister affairs? the 'destroyer' with no any ability but talk big?lastly, old music doesn't make a mediocre movie looks good, plot does, but the score of this movie simply indicate that some people are obsessed by the 80's music</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And what was all the fuss about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really had high hopes for this one after seeing the ratings and reading the reviews. However, this movie disappointed me big time.There was nothing new in this movie that we have not seen before, the plot was just too plain and familiar making it boring. The acting by both Starlord and Gamora (especially star lord) was pretty weak and in fact there were times that i wished he would just be killed and free me of boredom. The action although a lot was boring at times since it follows the same old pattern we have seen several times.The only saving grace for this movie was the acting and actions of Rocket raccoon, Ronan and Thanos and maybe Groot. These were the only people keeping the movie going.To sum it up, you can skip this movie (to CM winter soldier) and you wouldn't be missing a thing because it's nothing you haven't seen before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost: The plot is virtually nonexistent. &amp; Characters are bland and shallow.If that wasn't enough: Action scenes are poorly planned and performed. The gags, which are supposed to be an important part of the movie, are cringeworthy. And to top it all off: The weirdest part is the CGI, which is just bad - the sceneries are nice but the characters are designed and animated poorly, and sometimes barely lipsyched. I find it hard to believe MPC, Framestore, Luma Pictures and many other great companies worked on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is nauseating. I felt sick from the dialogue. And not just make believe sick to make a point, but literally like throwing up. Initially I thought it was the pizza I'd had earlier, but I was wrong. The two more known names (to me) were Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel -- I like 'em both. Respectively, one of them does a voice-over for a raccoon, while the other is a talking tree. The tree only has a single line that it keeps repeating... "I am Groot".What more needs to be said?The special effects are very good -- in fact, I would have given this movie 2/10 had they removed all dialogue. But, alas, we have to sit through an inspirational speech, where the pivotal line is, "we can change that, by giving a s#*t". Epic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, Guardians of the Galaxy, is a Marvel movie about 5 space criminals who works together in order to stop Ronan the Accuser in destroying the entire galaxy. These comics were only known by few people. It became famous when the actors were announced to play each of their characters. It became more famous when the trailer and the movie was released. The movie was liked by everyone and this movie is very excellent. You will enjoy this movie for sure. Unlike other Marvel movies, there were jump scenes unlike here, there wasn't any.

		<shortDescription>A Star Wars for today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was strange how much I ended up enjoying this movie. The first time I saw the trailer I was not terrible impressed and it seemed cliché and tacky (Especially the music). As a longtime fan and collector of marvel comics I felt obliged to go see the movie on the opening night and so I did... The movie had everything you could want in a film; space opera, comedy, explosions and even Michael Rooker as blue space alien with a magical stick!The casting was amazing, the writing was excellent and the CGI and special effects were the best I've ever seen. I have no doubt that this movie will be considered the next Star Wars (The original one, not the Jar Jar Binks version) in a decade or so from now. At the end of the film everyone clapped (Except me because I'm cool) and even my girlfriend seemed to have enjoyed it (And she hates everything). I actually felt sad leaving the cinema because I enjoyed the film so much I didn't want it to end. If it isn't a better movie than than the Avengers, it is definitely on par with it.If you haven't seen this movie yet, go watch it now. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Much FUN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians Of The Galaxy is the summer blockbuster I have been waiting for. The movie opens and it automatically just sucks you in with the awesome credits sequence. The visuals in this movie are insane, the colour palette for the film is just a treat to the eye, so vibrant and...well... so fun. The one word to describe the film is FUN. The film steers away from that bleak colour palette we are so used to seeing in 'serious' summer blockbusters and offers a nice fresh looking film with so many popping colours. The visual effects in the film are also top notch, with spectacular work done on Rocket and Groot, they feel like they are always there, you forget about the CG and focus on the characters. Chris Pratt does an outstanding job as Star Lord, he has depth, is hilarious and is great in the action scenes. He really is the perfect casting for the role, he has a certain wit to him but is still so darn likable. He delivers in the dramatic moments of the film and shines in the comedic moments. Zoe Saldana as Gamora also does a good job with her character. Gamora has a really awesome backstory that i hope gets explored in further films. She is great in the action scenes, funny when she needs to be and looks awesome on screen. Dave Bautista as Drax is also great, at the start of the film you can see Dave slightly adjusting to...acting, but after that he is awesome, his character doesn't have as much depth as I was hoping for but he has some of the funniest lines in the film, I was very impressed with his performance by the end of the film. He also was great in the action scenes as expected since he was a pro-wrestler. Now onto the awesome duo that is Rocket and Groot. Rocket is the crowd favourite and is one of the coolest characters I have seen all year, Bradley Cooper nails rockets voice and you can't even really tell that its Cooper behind the mic. Rocket is hilarious, bad ass and really delivers in some of the emotional scenes. Groot only has to say 3 things in the film, but that doesn't mean he isn't the coolest tree ever. For me Groot surprised me the most, he was so greatly portrayed through the VFX with his eyes and facial expressions. And I didn't expect to get so emotional near the end of the film, that was mainly due to Groot. Vin Diesel is great as the voice. The film, just made me feel happy. Im sure one of the major reasons for this was the soundtrack. The soundtrack for this movie is perfect, with classic 70's and 80's songs, it just makes you feel Happy. They mend so well with what is happening on screen, especially during the opening credits. The score for the film is also fantastic, it is sweet, epic, scary and fun. James Gunn has done an absolutely fantastic job directing the film, he has really added a certain magic back to a summer blockbuster, a scene involving Groot showing the gang one of his abilities was just so magical. It took me back to some of the classic films we are brought up watching, and was just amazing. The film balances all the elements of action, adventure, comedy, drama really well and if i were to describe it to someone it would be STAR WARS + RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK + FIREFLY = GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. I have no real complaints about the film, I would have liked to see the villain Ronan fleshed out a little more, as he is kind of just one of those 'bad guys' who is just bad, but we don't really know why, we do find out why he does what he does but it is brief and not really a focus of the film, which is not a bad thing, the Guardians are the main focus of the film and I'm not sad about that at all, its their first movie. Karen Gillan does a good job as the psychopathic sister Nebula.The film was a fantastic way to finish off a great 2014 summer movie season, it brings the magic back to the summer blockbuster and I can't wait to go back on another adventure with the gang in 2017. Also stay around for the after credits scene, I was shocked big time, I'm not sure if Marvel are going to go that route, but they've earned my money to watch anything they make. Thanks For Reading, I hope you check the film out :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why this movie has 8.5 IMDb rating. It's pretty boring movie. Acting is pretty lame. It's not engaging at all. Basically, if you are not under 13, you'll start yawning and checking your phone more than the movie.I felt like I'm watching a live play act rather than a movie. Direction, acting and animation felt like it was done by amateurs. I've seen better acting in a fan base remake of other movies and better animation in video game trailers. There are quite a few scenes where it's so dark that you can't make anything out. Storyline is very short and not enough for a movie. In the end, it shows that they will be back next time or something. I hope they don't as I won't be watching it, at least not in the theater anyways. Waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing....If you're 15 and have A.D.H.D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be fair, Marvel announced many moons ago that it would be taking "liberty" with the stories it gives a green light to be made into film. That is all well and good, because the characters in this film are as pointed out elsewhere "not well known". Indeed I do not think that many in the movie going audience will be, aside from the old school comic fans.That being said, let me address my qualms with this film. I hate to be "that guy" here but I love film as most of you do, so lets have at it shall we? This film was far to quickly paced for all that it hoped to encompass. It felt like one giant set-up scene for comic relief which it used in grandiose fashion as it replayed the same set-up formula over and over. There were some splendid shots in this film completely ruined for me at least by the entry of yet more misplaced comedy. There was little if no serious context in the film at all, a fact for which I am disappointed. No amount of cgi can make up for the abuse of a film element that plays on ad-nauseam until no hope remains for anything serious enough from the film finally makes it to the audience to salvage an otherwise good idea.It may be fresh as far as Marvel movies are concerned, but that is really no feat in itself is it? How long have they been playing the same worn out record? OH! they were bought by Disney, that's right! I almost forgot about that depressing fact. No hope for originality. I was not overly impressed by this film. It was pretty, It was colorful, but I felt it failed the characters involved by being too corny to accurately portray them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak and hyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was interested in seeing the film based upon a number of reviews and the unusually high rating on Rotten Tomatoes from both critics and fans. The comparisons to a fresh 'Star Wars" excitement and experience had me intrigued.Well, the hype burned me. I found the experience to be less than engaging and at stretches very boring...very formulaic and a horrific lack of depth in terms of characterization. This is particularly the case for Ronin and Thanos -- wow, how corny and shallow can one get. If I were 5 years old, maybe I would have thought they were well done. Incredibly bad!Outside of a few comedic elements among the protagonists and a creative way to bring 70's music into the future, the story is a throw away. Special Effects are mixed, with a few clunkers mixed in with some nice work.Strictly a bargain rental only. Will not see the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film because I kept hearing nothing but amazing things about it, and I was skeptical/curious. I must say, I was disappointed to find the film was exactly what I thought it would be. This mood of this movie felt like somewhere in between Star Trek (the one with Chris Pine) and the Avengers, but not as good as either. I needed more of a back story on Quill for one thing. And i have a huge ladyboner for Chris Pratt, but his character did nothing for me in this one. Besides look good in that jacket. In general I found the jokes to be trying too hard but also restrained, probably because it's only rated pg-13. Maybe it's younger people getting all excited and rating this a 10 that made it skyrocket onto the IMDb 250 (which I don't think is deserved), but overall this movie was "cute" and just barely entertaining. The villains were cheesy and cartoony and not very threatening. Everything was too cartoony. I need grit in my movies. I didn't hate the movie, but I won't name all the things that made me snicker a little (no big laughs) because enough people have gushed about this movie. The make-up and costume and vfx and sound were all great. I will not be seeing the sequel.</fullReview>

Really had high expectations and they really delivered, Guardians of the Galaxy is the best Marvel film yet. If you liked Avengers, you will like this even more. So happy this movie came.3D is not usually my choice of spending money, but this was totally worth it. This movie is just made for Imax, with 3D as a desert. The acting is superb from the main characters, soundtrack, editing and cinematography are also excellent. This is the type of movie that makes you beg for the sequel. I am probably going to watch it 2 or 3 more times. I wont say anything about story or the characters, just go and be surprised how the movie sucks you in its awesome world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing New</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a galaxy far far away, a part human, a green lady, a brute, a talking raccoon and a walking tree set out to save a purple stone, which can cause a purple explosion, from falling into the wrong hands. That is Guardians of the Galaxy. There is nothing more to it.All the characters are one-dimensional with generic interests in the mission; Peter Quill, the part-human outlaw (Chris Pratt), Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and the magic tree (Bruce Willis) are only interested in the payoff and of course in the end they change their motive to saving the world, without any apparent reason. Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the obligatory lady in the team, knows how evil the villains are and wants to stop them. The extremely annoying Drax (Dave Bautista) wants to avenge his murdered family. And the villains want the purple stone to take over the world. Why do they want this particular stone, don't they have any other explosives with them? Who knows.There is the overused cliché of circumstances bringing the motley bunch of heroes together, them having an adventure and becoming friends at the end of it. But none of them share any chemistry between them and is it hard to see what made them become friends. Not that we care though; we know they would all end up as friends and so they do.We don't care about anything else in the movie either. We hardly know our heroes and since it is the Marvel Universe, we know none of them would die. The planet, the villains are threatening to destroy is alien, we know nothing about its denizens and again, we know it is going to be saved. The stakes never seem high.The movie, however, is visually pleasing. 3D has been used innovatively. CG is realistic and the worlds created using it are beautiful. The action is good. There are some funny moments and good one-liners. There is nothing new though. It has a run-of-the-mill feel to. Watch it if you like generic action flicks or a die-hard fan of Marvel comics. Give it a skip otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel like this movie is overrated for a number of reasons. They didn't really make me care about the characters. I'll explain. When they announced the characters in the movie i thought they where pretty okay. They wanted Quill to give out like a player vibe ( not a douchebag ) , the tree a loving vibe , the raccoon a silly but cool vibe , the girl an assassin but loving vibe , and finally the rock looking guy, a man who wants to avenge his family. They managed to do this very well , but in the middle of the story it felt like they wanted to change the aspect of the characters , which made me feel less about them. And they kept giving an illusion that the characters had died when they never did ( to many times ). This makes the movie come of as not being ballsy and to unrealistic ( more of a kid movie ). The vfx and the makeup was amazing , the story was fine , the actors where great. but they failed making me people care about the characters. This is why i give it 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched this today at the iMAX Manchester. I love watching movies at the cinema, and have felt slightly cheated on a few recent movies that disappointed and appeared to be more of a cash cow: Taken 2 springs to mind, but there are others. The premise to this film excited me, as did the cast involved: a Marvel movie with a raccoon, a tree-shaping humanoid and adorable bodyguard, the amazing Chris Pratt (watch it and be enchanted/amazed by his stellar performance), Vin Diesel as 'Groot' who you will *love* by the end (trust me) and the surprisingly excellent David Bautista, whose comic delivery is sublime. The action is well throttled and not OTT. The perfection lies between the tangible chemistry between the main players and the razor sharp comedic script - it just works, trust me. The icing on the cake is the soundtrack throughout, it was well judged and impeccable. We all left the cinema dabbing tears of laughter from one of the final 'Groot' scenes. Honestly, this movie ticked all the boxes and more - best movie ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is artistically and politically as conservative a film as Marvel Studios has ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is unoriginal, insubstantial and most significantly, it's not funny. Once touted as their riskiest film to date, it is artistically and politically as conservative a film as Marvel Studios has ever made. The disappointment of the space adventure is that it is little more than a retread of a pedestrian formula, the numbingly predictable scaffolding of the comic book and superhero genre, hidden under the disguise of a broad comedy. The film's jokey banter, self-referential tone and pop culture references are smoke and mirrors used strategically to distract us from what is a threadbare narrative of unimaginative climaxes. When the film pauses briefly between action sequences lifted from Star Wars and the digital imagery of video games like Mass Effect it is to pursue an ideological viewpoint that doesn't inspire or rewrite the blockbuster but merely redecorates it. The film's values for family and nostalgia are not to be mistaken for depth or thematic goals but compulsory staples of Marvel's production line, the intention of which is to preserve the genre's wide commercial appeal while drastically limiting the variety of what mainstream Hollywood chooses to explore. The film is an adaptation of Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning's comic book with James Gunn directing and co-writing the script with Nicole Perlman. It opens in 1988 with a young boy named Peter Quill listening to a cassette tape in a hospital. His father is absent and his mother is on her deathbed. Under insanely melodramatic circumstances, she passes away right before he can take her hand. After he steps outside the hospital he is abducted by an alien spaceship. The film is extremely vague about what happened next and what his reaction was to being taken away as a child. Instead, the story forwards twenty-six years later to when Peter (played by Chris Pratt) is now a trained smuggler and explorer of alien worlds. He is also still carrying the same cassette player with him, allowing him to play many of the film's retro tunes. Peter stumbles upon a magical orb of power, which he learns is too dangerous for him to sell. It is wanted by a powerful samurai-like villain named Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace). Also in pursuit of the orb are a number of different misfits including an alien named Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a fast-talking, aggressive raccoon aptly named Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and his anthropomorphic tree friend Groot (the voice of Vin Diesel) and a muscular warrior named Drax (Dave Bautista). Each of these characters has different reasons for wanting the orb or for stopping their enemy Ronan as they become the guardians and protectors of this space world. What Guardians extracts from this plot is not to parody the superhero genre like Gunn's previous film Super but to continue Hollywood's two most formulaic and overused ideological goals: individualism and the restoration of the family unit. Although the guardians are touted as being misfits and losers this is not a character study. The guardians are more like action figurines, distinguished by their bizarre appearances, catch phrases and one-liners, while their suit gadgets and weapons become a cliché expression of how individual talents can save the world. Initially setting the film in the 1980s is also crucial to understanding Marvel's ideological complacency. This time period means that much of the film is encompassed in Reaganesque values, who in his terms in office stressed the importance of sustaining the American family. The guardians reflect this ideology because a number of them are tormented by comic book clichés like avenging their families who died at Ronan's hand. Dead parents syndrome is abound. Similarly, the guardians become integral in resolving Peter's desire for a new family, which is climaxed by possibly the most unintentionally Freudian moment in a superhero film. An extended hand from one character to Peter recalls memories of his mother. But Peter Quill's transformation from a womanising man-child, into a more caring, selfless family man, is not a change at all. His arc is merely synonymous with Hollywood's narrow and formulaic ideological aims about the goodness found in people when conforming to Western and Christian values like the family unit. The reason Marvel has employed an immobile, nostalgic lead character is because they want the adult audience to have a synonymous emotional reaction. As they are unwilling to change the formula of these films, the studio risks losing its adult audience as they grow older. As such, everything here is geared towards the past and makes no promises for future directions of this genre. The director and his writer know this because in a deliberate move to make adults comfortable with being adolescent again they resort to including "mature" references and jokes about The Maltese Falcon, Jackson Pollock and a soundtrack comprised of hit tunes from the 1970s. In the end these are superficial additions, aimed to nudge the nostalgic ribs of the adult audience and to deter us from how dreary this action-comedy formula has become. The narrative in Guardians is terribly slight, running out of steam before the end and padded extensively with tension-free set pieces where characters are rarely hurt. Much of the exposition involving the film's forgettable villains is confusing and rushed, especially for people like myself who haven't read the comics. It is also unfathomable that after this many films in Marvel's universe they are still relying on something as derivative as a MacGuffin device to rigidly string action sequences together. The most telling moment throughout the whole film though is at the story's apex, when Peter confronts one of his enemies and says that he is distracting him. It is a moment of Meta fiction because comedic elements like this are simply papering over what has become formulaic and all too predictable from Marvel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know that feeling, when you for example taste a good quality product and it for sure should be awesome, but it lacks something. That is precisely how I feel about this movie. You have awesome effects, great camera angles and from time to time a joke that can get a chuckle or two. Although, this humor is not my cup of tee, but I can understand why people can get behind it. But there is an inconsistent world, shallow villain, undeveloped characters, plot full of Clichés, etc. So why do I even bother? It is after all, a movie for a younger audience so one should not expect a masterly portrayed characters and thought-provoking plot. The thing is, that the overwhelming majority of todays cinema is consumed by this kind of filmmaking. But again, this is easily understandable. People want to run from the real world into fake one, where rules does not apply and everything turns good at the end. Have we become mentally weak, that we can't handle the movie that is more serious than a cartoon? The audience won't ever visit the cinemas after they shed a tear there or had themselves pondering over movie they just saw? Than again, it is a comic book movie and it does the job. It just feels that every movie today is some sort of a comic book movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the reviews and they were fantastic. I've love all of the Marvel movies so far and have always preferred them over the DC comics movies. I read how funny and snarky the script is and how great Chris Pratt and Bradley Cooper are. In contrast to what I'd read, my actual reaction to the movie is that I didn't believe any of the characters (except Groot. Loved him), I didn't believe any of the relationships, and I didn't care about the quest. I generally like snark, as I can be snarky as well, but I thought the script was pretty lame. I hope the sequel will be better. I place the blame squarely on James Gunn, who directed and wrote the script. There is nothing on his resume that should have led anyone to believe he could handle a big budget, special effects laden, tentpole movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>average film - nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I put off watching this film especially to get away from all the hype and build up so I waited for that to die down.. I have to say that this film has much to be desired and is nothing special at all. The people I spoke to all said it was good but by good I guess they meant passable. The story is childish, the plot predictable and generally a very cheesy film that tries and failies to be funny. I am not sure who its targetted audience is but if you are a xmen, avengers fan this won't appeal to you - maybe to your 10 year old son?!I feel that I am being honest here, the only plus is that the CGI is good and looks good visually but thats all you will get from this film i'm afraid - a waste of time. I haven't watched avengers two but hoping its better than this!Avoid and save yourself two hours!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is the second of 2014's Marvel action/superhero movies, the first being Captain America: The Winter Soldier. I really enjoyed it a lot more that I originally thought I would, considering the strange subject matter featuring a talking raccoon and a tree.The story focuses around Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), whom 26 years after being abducted from Earth, is thrown right into the middle of a conflict involving the possession of an orb which is being sought after by Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace), a dangerous extraterrestrial supervillain. During this, Peter is forced to form an alliance with a group of alien misfits in order to prevent the orb from falling into Ronan's hands. The misfits are Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a green-skinned orphan woman, Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a genetically engineered talking raccoon, Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) a tree-like humanoid and Drax The Destroyer (Dave Bautista (Batista) a butch warrior seeking vengeance against Ronan for murdering his family.The film started off kind of strange but it became better from the second act onwards. It was action packed and very funny in places. I particularly enjoyed the talking raccoon Rocket and his wisecracks. I would love to see him and Tony Stark having an argument in a future Avengers film. The soundtrack was excellent as well, filled with classic rock songs from the 70s and 80s.I rate it 8/10. Like with just about all of their films, there is one post-credits scene to stay back for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Guardians of the Galaxy" is easily the most exciting and pleasant surprise of the year. Personally, I was hooked the minute I saw the preview which gave us hints of the fun coming our way. Fighting over a walkman, mocking the superhero's name, and that irreverent raccoon. Of course, there's no way to dislike anything Zoe Saldana does, and there is much, much more to love here.This movie appears to be paying homage to a few science fiction classics, particularly the original freshness and humor that made "Star Wars" such a legendary title. Star Lord joins forces with some impulsive characters and try to stop the evil forces from grabbing this magical and powerful sphere that can alter the universe.It's hard to describe the film. It suffices to say that it's an exciting ride from beginning to end because it has action, some sensational special effects, killer funny lines, introduces terrific characters that come across as sensitive, human, and heroic. There are beautiful spaceships, and everyone is literally and figuratively having a blast.You will laugh, be moved, root for the various heroes, never get tired of the "one-line" tree man. The voice work by Bradley Cooper is as good as Robin Williams' deranged Genie in "Aladdin", and can anyone complain about having Glenn Close and John C. Reiley in the same movie? And to be top everything there is the terrific scene at the end of the credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Guardians of the Galaxy" is a successful American movie from 2 years ago and successful is actually quite an understatement. The film made the IMDb top250, got lots of love from audiences and critics, finished no°3 of the year in terms of box office and was nominated for two Academy Awards. The cast includes a handful pretty famous names, but it was especially a breakthrough for Chris Pratt, who was probably only known to fans of "Parks &amp; Recreation" before. The story is a bit similar to "Despicable Me" as we have a criminal here as well who changes sides. Actually, it is not just one criminal, but a whole bunch. Writer and director James Gunn made very smart decisions here by how he chose to make the bad guys look likable. The raccoon and the tree are just cool, but Bautista's character for example only really became evil because of what happened to his family.Speaking of James Gunn, he is known to be a director who had quite a few flops during his career, in terms of box office, but also in terms of critical reception, so it was quite surprising how well he did with this film here, certainly well enough that there will be a sequel, probably more than one unless this sequel really bombs, which is almost impossible I think. I myself enjoyed the movie too. Its biggest strength are definitely the characters who are all so memorable and unique that it is a delight to watch them. The only one I do not count among these is probably Ronan, who seemed a bit one-dimensional to me as the main villain, but even he wasn't bad, just not as notable as the other characters I guess. I am not a great fan of Vin Diesel or Bradley Cooper I must admit, but their characters are simply amazing in this film.I am probably a bit biased because I almost always enjoy superhero films, but this one was certainly worth the watch. One thing I liked about it is that it never gets lost in boastful action sequences as many of these genre films do, but this basically only has an extended scene of explosions etc. near the end and that is very much acceptable. The rest of the film focuses a lot more on character development and creating a smart story. And this was very much needed with so many characters. This is far from a one man show ? la "Iron Man". Every (anti-)hero gets his fair share of screen time. I recommend "Guardians of the Galaxy" and I will probably also watch the sequel once it comes out. Also nice that they did not try hard to push this film towards the 150-minute mark. It works very well at approximately 2 hours. Thumbs up, go check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flaws but Decent on Action and Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy starring Chris Pratt as Peter Quill proves to be the ideal leading man, carrying the bulk of the film and making the cocky, self-centered Quill likable enough to garner our sympathies and get us to root for his redemption without dulling the guy's edge. Saldana is the perfect foil for him, cutting Quill down to size before falling for him. It's Diesel and Cooper who steal the majority of the spotlight, however; Rocket and Groot are fascinating and wonderfully realized creations, and the two actors do a superb job of acting through the CGI "makeup" to make them stand out as flesh and blood people. Cooper's approach to the killer raccoon plumbs new levels of sarcasm. Bautista also surprises; Drax is written as an alien whose people take everything literally, setting up some choice gags that the former MMA fighter-turned- thespian delivers with perfect timing and the deadest of deadpan deliveries. In the end the film has been praised and the hype has matched the praise, however the film struggles mid way and becomes a decent action film. Perhaps a second and more viewing would be necessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was Forbidden Planet once upon a time, all about the journey to and mystique of discovering a new world in the stars. Then Star Wars. Inbetween these, Marvel seems to have cranked out a few hundred thousand panels populated with sundry worlds, mythologies, heroes, vast beings, demigods. So when time came to fashion their cinematic world in the stars, there was already a vast reservoir of Marvel myth on one side, cinematic ways to build worlds on the other. They have a few dozen people whose job is to keep threading this universe these days. The only one of those that appeals to me is the first Thor and now this a bit less. Two things they do well enough here, one is they chose a corner of their world that will be completely new to most of us but look how uniformly we're placed inside, in such a way as to feel it's a broader world with its own structures in motion. The motley group of heroes have spark. I see this as coherence that gestated for a long time on the page that the filmmakers had the luxury to mine; built on Star Wars.The second thing is that they poke fun at the usual grandiose Marvel world. They often try it but only Thor excelled in this; it was Branaugh poking fun at his own Shakespearean world. So in the middle of it here walks a slightly buffoonish guy abducted with his tape recorder from the 80s and sent to a world where powerful beings threaten to wreak planetary annihilation. (the Kree, the name reminiscent of Forbidden Planet)I like that we traverse a world and the charm that lets us parse movie vistas in the shoes of someone like us who would have known them as movies, it's pleasant to watch. Formulaic in myth, dilemmas, lessons, and some of the action, expected from Marvel; it's what their library is made of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love it more every time I see it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, the first time I saw this film I liked it but I was multitasking so didn't really have the focus. Then I said to myself another day to watch it again and I liked it way better. Then after I've watched it about 3 more times and every time I have more I love about it.It has to be the best Marvel film because it's so much more than that. It actually does not have that much superhero in it, it feels more like Star Wars. I am a huge Star Wars fan and this film is making me feel the same feeling I had with Star Wars.I'll just name the things I love and what I would others want to love as well:- Great cast. Chris Pratt is Star Lord and god is he great. He is funny, smart, strong and turns out to be a really good leader. As a leader he actually chooses to play to the strength of others, he let's them do what they do best and it works. Then we have Rocket and Groot, two bounty hunters who are both misfits to society, however they also are just amazing. They're funny, emotional, strong and have a really good bond. Then we have Gamora and Drax and they're also good strong characters. Lastly I want to say that the villain, Ronan, is a great villain, just see for yourself.- Memorable score. The music pumped me full of adrenaline or made me sing. The songs on Peter's Walkman are very nice 80's songs and the film music made me have goosebumps and I just enjoyed it so much.- CG. I have seen enough films to recognize bad and good CG and here it just all seems like it's real, I couldn't see any mistakes (maybe if I watch it more often closely I'll spot some) and everything just works.- Epic action scenes. From the second scene until the second to last there are quite a few action scenes and they were just epic. All the scenes still have me watching the screen wondering how they're gonna get out of it and luckily there are some twists to it. Also, every time when it becomes a little too serious they throw in a bit of humor to lighten the mood and it's perfectly balanced- Funny as hell. Seeing that sci-fi films are usually quite serious, this one just has great humor. A lot of times the 80's songs are used to lighten the mood and make people laugh. Also the characters are really funny, every character has their own way, Drax is very literal, Groot is very not thinking but doing, Star Lord is done by Chris Pratt so that speaks for itself, the list goes on and it's just very nice to have such a good comic relief.- Finally some things about Thanos and the Infinity Stones. *Warning, spoilers ahead for the MCU* Apparently in the coming films in the MCU, it's going to focus way more on the Infinity Gauntlet. This is a glove that uses all the six infinity stones for an epic power. However we've only seen short fragments so far. In Captain America we had the Tesseract and in Thor we had Loki's scepter, but we had no idea those were infinity stones (this is explained later). Then in Thor: The Dark World we had the Aether and there is finally said something about infinity stones. But Guardians finally gave us a story about them. There are 6 and can be used to destroy everything. In this film, one of the stones is used to destroy things. So we finally know a lot more about these things and that is going to be very important of the upcoming infinity war films. So the nerd in me was very satisfied with this.All in all a great film and I'm definitely looking forward to Guardians Vol. 2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT*A young Peter Quill is taken from his home world of Earth for as of yet unknown reasons to far the far of reaches of the Galaxy. He then grows up to be a professional artifact stealer who steals valuable items and then sells them to his resident benefactor. One such item is an orb that is desired by a group of nefarious individuals lead by Thanos who chase Quill due to the orb containing an infinity gem that possesses infinite power. Along the way, Quill meets other unique individuals that are in pursuit of the orb and himself due to the bounty on his head. They are Gamora the most dangerous woman in the Universe, Rocket Raccoon and Groot then Drax the destroyer who is in pursuit of Gamora herself since she is Thanos's daughter and he wants revenge for what Ronan the Accuser, who is Thanos's right hand man did to his family. In captivity, the all meet together and join forces for a common good, calling themselves the Guardians of the Galaxy in order to save the Galaxy from certain annihilation. The theme of this movie seems to be a focus on plot. None of the protagonists are dominant in the sense that they control the overall movie with the possible exception of Peter Quill and each are very unique in their own ways, bring different talents to the table. The movie places its focus on the main objective, the orb which contains incalculable power that threatens the very existence of the Universe and the characters go to wide variety of different lengths to keep it out of the hands of Ronan the Accuser. Unfortunately, all the events lead up to the point of Ronan actually acquiring the orb for himself and then betraying Thanos. It is through the combined teamwork of Starlord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and Groot that the Galaxy and possibly the entire Universe gets another proverbial day in existence.This film in a lot of ways is akin to many of the Indiana Jones movies, particularly Raiders of the Lost Ark. This has an Archaeologist searching through dangerous areas and being chased by lost tribes protecting the artifact and a dangerous individual who is also in pursuit of the glass skull. Like Guardians of the Galaxy, the main antagonist does manage to gain possession of the item but in the very end its power betrays him and he perishes at the very end of the film.The lighting of Guardians of the Galaxy is very colorful and brightly lit when they are free, in action and in favorable moments when the team is clearly in positive standing. This uses the illusion of natural light from a Sun. When the team is in captivity or on the losing streak the lighting is very dimly lit which tries to convey a sense of negative conflict within the group.In conclusion, Guardians of The Galaxy is a fast paced movie that starts off with high speed action form the get go, but not without putting some of Peter Quill's background, which happens to be very sad, into perspective. His character received the most exposure which should not come as a surprise being that he is the leader of this rag tag group of misfits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy- good, not as amazing as people make it out to be, but as we wait for Star Wars episode 7, this was the fanboys substitute. There's nothing too much to say for this, but for what it is, guardians is a really fun film. It's not mind blowing, but groot is a man amount men, and this is evidence that marvel is a juggernaut. If they can make a tree and a raccoon the most popular thing of 2014, then they can do anything. You know what, guardians is just evidence that the music of the 70s 80s region is truly the best, at least that's what I think. That deserves a 8.7 at least, right If you guys want more in depth reviews, please be sure to check me out, Quinn C with the James Bond emblem, on YouTube.

		<shortDescription>Avengers in space, but more fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe takes us into the far reaches of space and introduces us to a lesser known lineup from the comics, the Guardians of the Galaxy. Comprising of Peter Quill aka Star Lord (Chris Pratt), Gomorra (Zoe Saldana), Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) and Drax the Destoryer (Dave Bautista), this ragtag bunch of misfits must join forces to stop Ronan (Lee Pace) and protect the galaxy from complete destruction.What works well for the movie is its humor and performances. Every time an insulting or witty joke is spoken, it stems from the character's motivations, feeling genuine and not forced. The best performances would be from the CG characters Rocket and Groot. The dialogues, on screen persona and buddy love between the two were just splendid. Another unique touch to the film was the use of music. It was well written into the story where Quill's mother gives him a mix tape of rock, pop and soul songs from the 1970's. The songs that play continually throughout the movie establish a quirky yet human tone to this space adventure.For a movie that is completely immersed with CGI it looks visually fantastic. The colors and textures, cool spaceships, the various worlds revealed, as well as an appearance from the mad titan Thanos, were a delight to watch. The make-up has to be applauded as well, making a completely green Gomorra look stunning and a totally blue Ronan feel menacing. My only quip with the movie would be that Ronan should have got more screen time to show off his strength. Instead he's just reduced to the role of a dictator, although a really terrifying dictator with a great performance from Lee Pace.A lot of credit has to go to director James Gunn for execution of Marvel's in-house style of epic scale and implementing his own method of humor and character development for the film. He handles the humorous tone with ease and balances them well with a tragic back story to maintain a steady momentum of the plot. The script, casting, costumes, make-up, set design, editing and sound were all effective in making Guardians of the Galaxy a genuinely fun sci-fi film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Popcorn to the stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this movie is a shining beacon of hope. Because the fact of the matter is that the new millennium has been a dark time in cinema. And I don't mean that the movies have been bad, they're actually pretty good. It's that they dark. They're brooding, melancholy, painted with black, blue and grey, full of themes like fallibility of man, loss, consequences, despair...So you can imagine what it must have felt like for me walking into this movie, sitting down and watching the first few minutes of this minutes as we set up the backstory of our hero. And it is dark. Like did I walk into a wrong film kind of dark. Where's the talking raccoon I was promised kind of dark. But then something magical happens. We see our hero, Peter Quill a.k.a. The Starlord, played by Chris Pratt, years later as he walks into some ruins. He rotates his shoulders, walks forward, the music start playing, and it's just... perfect. It's the movie telling you that it's here to have some fun, to make jokes, to play funky 70s music and to simply entertain you.And from there on out the movie is one of the finest examples of popcorn film there is. It's pure cheese, hearkening back to the 80s, where the heroes are cocky, invincible, always quick with a quip, where the sets were colourful, the action had a sense of grandeur and the main goal was to have an adventure.And yeah, the plot has some holes, the villain is kind of one-dimensional and the only female member of the team still has the least amount of character development and screen time. But those are minor problems for me, and for most of the people, I'd think, because the majority of the film is simply so entertaining.Guardians of the Galaxy might very well be the best Marvel movie yet made, aside from The Avengers that is. Who would have thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On Earth 1988, Peter Quill loses his mother and is taken by a spaceship. Twenty Six years later, Peter (Chris Pratt) is caught trying to steal an orb but he manages to escape Korath. The Krees have signed a peace treaty with Nova Prime which is opposed by Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace). Ronan needs the orb to satisfy Thanos who promises to destroy Xandar. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) goes to track down Peter and the orb. Also trying to capture Peter are Rocket and Groot. All four are imprisoned in the Kyln. They escape with the overly literal Drax who has a vendetta against Ronan.This is a rip-roaring fun space opera. Chris Pratt is at the top of his game. This is a bright, wild, crazy ride. There is a lot of Marvel lore to go through for the uninitiated. That's probably my main concern about this movie. The 70s soundtrack is a terrific touch and the humor is infectious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel do good again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-7/10Guardians of the Galaxy is a Marvel made film that boasts a lot of differences from other movies that they make. The main point to this is that it is humorous and it can feel at times this is one big action comedy, well actually maybe it is that. It has good action too and the fights seen are good, well spread and the movie doesn't have too much of the same thing, I do feel this is overrated for me but I will come to my reasons later, I did find it to be a good film though and here below is why.I found the plot a little confusing and the characters especially the villains in this, unnecessary. Now I mean I got the plot and it isn't bad, it has it's excitement and all but what I felt is that the villains are so in depth and serious about all this, where as there are only brief moments when the heroes seem serious, didn't work well for me that. Having said that the plot does conjure up some good action scenes and some truly crazy special effects that push the boundaries of effects.I liked Chris Pratt as Peter and he manages to blend comedy and emotion into his role and comes out impressive enough to hold the main role. All the cast are funny, no one ruins the party and even the voice acting of Bradley Cooper(Rocket) and Vin Diesel(Groot) make some scenes much more fun and again, emotional. The film goes kind of crazy casting people, some actors like Glenn Close aren't seen much but provide a welcome sight in such an effects driven film.James Gunn is the man behind the helm here and he directs very well and could be the main force for why this is good, many will point to Pratt etc but Gunn manages to get the ball rolling and rolling fast. He and others write the script too and that again provides the laughs, brilliantly acted out by the cast but also very well written too and the choice of music by whomever it was, it very nicely done too.Now to why I felt it is overrated, now don't get me wrong I watched It and look back on it thinking "yeah that was good", but great?, for me the answer is no. It just isn't clinically excellent and you may even come out of this with effects sickness, the film is a big jumble of a film and I do feel some people are won over by the jokes rather than the poor plot and those awful villains, and I know where talking about a comic book film here but seriously, I just couldn't take them seriously.You know this film has odd bits of the beautiful, Groot the large tree like character is so lovable and if you haven't seen this, he could quickly become your favourite after watching. The music and the effects can create a strange experience as when they're flying through space, the 70's soundtrack and massive effects create a kind of trippy experience. Overall it is a fine Marvel film though and yet again they have dispensed Sci-fi that is tip-top and to be remembered too. It isn't for me one of the best Marvel films, or maybe it is I am not quite sure on that, they seem to bring so many out it can sometimes get lost a film by them, but this I feel will not be lost. I would recommend this to anyone, a fun film full of lots of well fun things, the sequel I look forward too as of the time of writing this it has not come out but I hope it is as funny and kind of weirdly sweet as this one.</fullReview>

They kind of are, but they are just as good. The makeup artists did a beautiful job for Gamora, Drax, Nebula, Ronan,and Yondu deserve a big thank you.

Peter steels it but then meets greeny, Gamora, whom is trying to steel it from him. Then there is Ronan and Thanos whom both want the orb to be all powerful.Peter, Gamora, and 2 new fellows, Groot and Rocket, are caught by the police and put in prison. But Rocket is known for escaping so a plan is hatched and they bring along massive, Drax, with them whom wants revenge on Ronan. They get the orb while escaping, plan on selling it, till they find out how powerful it is. But of course, Ronan is on their trail leading to a huge battle at the end.FINAL VERDICT: I liked the characters in this and the plot was good. Also good special effects and some funny parts.

		<shortDescription>A fun, entertaining addition to the MCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a lot of other comic book fans, I wasn't that familiar with Guardians of the Galaxy. After seeing the trailers for the movie, I just had to see the movie. Glad that I did. Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely one of my favorite MCU movies along with the Avengers, both Captain America movies, Iron Man 1, and the 1st Thor movie. Marvel did a great job taking risk on this rarely known group of ragtag misfits.The movie does a good job of telling the audience what they need to know about the five main characters so their backgrounds wouldn't bog down the story-line. The characters in Guardians of the Galaxy are fun, quirky and memorable. My favorite characters are Star-Lord, Gamora, Rocket Raccon, Groot, Nebula, and Yondu. The one character I'm indifferent to is Drax. They should've pick someone better to play Drax the Destroyer. I really like how the story for this movie ultimately ties in with the Avengers-Infinity Wars movies and the rest of the MCU.In the movie, Peter Quill aka Star Lord finds himself in trouble when he finds a mysterious Orb. He finds out that a Kree radical named Ronan the Accuser is looking for the item as well. Star-Lord gets help from Gamora (one of the daughters of Thanos the Mad Titan), Drax the Destroyer, Rocket Raccoon (a talking raccoon bounty hunter), and Groot. Ronan was a pretty cool villain. It was cool seeing more of Thanos in this movie after his cameo in the first Avengers movie. Guardians of the Galaxy has an awesome soundtrack of music from the 1970's and 1980's. I also enjoyed the humor in the movie. Guardians of the Galaxy is a must watch for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happens when you... (some spoilers added--sorry)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...take a green alien girl--like, where have we seen that before?--a homicidal tree, a smart-aleck raccoon, a pro wrestler who looks like he lifts mountains before breakfast, and a cheeky hero cut in the same insouciant mold as a funnier Indy Jones? You get Guardians of the Galaxy, that's what, and Hollywood is far better for it. The story concerns a mysterious orb that holds the secret of life and death, five characters who all have their own goals in mind as they set out to retrieve it, a truly nasty villain (excellently played by Lee Pace)who wants to use it to destroy worlds, and a gang of thugs (led by an equally superbly limned Michael Rooker) who want the orb for their own purposes. The lead five have to band together in order to stop the villain and the chase is on. Needless to say, there are laughs and tears and lots of physicality, and it all works.Major pluses are the acting. Chris Pratt as 'Starlord' (Peter Quill) captures the devil-may-care attitude of an old-time adventurer, Zoe Saldana is fine as Gamora, an enhanced alien who betrays her master in order to help save the universe, Dave Bautista as Drax--and he sounds a lot like Wes Studi (from Mystery Men) in some scenes--who takes everything literally, and the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel as Rocket the Raccoon and Groot the walking tree, respectively. Lee Pace is appropriately rotten to the core, and although he's buried under a ton of makeup, the look of horror on his face as he's consumed by the orb's energy is perfect. Karen Gillam as the robotic Nebula is fine, and Benicio del Toro turns in a patented, eccentric and slightly creepy turn as The Collector.The direction by James Gunn is solid, cutting away to show the action far and near when necessary, and the script (by Gunn and Nicole Perlman) has loads of endlessly quotable lines to recommend it.The music is also perfect, not just the 1970's songs used, but also the theme music. Brilliantly employed at the climax, the lovely moment when the lights slow down for a fraction of a second as Peter controls the power and turns it on his adversary sent a shiver up my spine.Now, there are a couple of deus ex machina moments given out at the end, but really, that's carping. What this movie is, is really a throwback to the old Errol Flynn swashbuckling movies from the late '30's and early '40's with modern sensibilities and a nifty set of CGI effects. Well worth watching time and again, and yes, I'm up for the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually Funny and Kick-Ass! A must see!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first thought was "Oh, great! Another glorified supervillian-gone hero movie!" Then I watched it and was blown away about how wrong I was. The movie is not only good but like a fresh breath of air to a dying movie franchise. Whoever wrote the script should REALLY get an award. Everything from the dialogue to the plot is new and exciting. Nothing can be anticipated. Plus, the comedy bits are actually funny! The movie charms everyone of any age and movie taste. I was watching it on a plane full of strangers. Even though we were all staring at a small screen about three feet about our heads, we all felt like we were on one fun, action packed roller coaster. We were laughing and cheering together! That being said, Guardians of the Galaxy delivers an experience like no other. You won't be sorry you've tried it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. The soundtrack was cool, surprising and unique. I was glad that the songs that Peter listened to weren't there just there to punch up a scene. I might have chosen different songs but these songs were perfect. And Chris Pratt's Peter is such a contemporary and real guy that no matter how odd situations became his reactions and utterances made everything seem plausible. I only had a quibble with the narrow, metaphorical background which seems to be a constant in most super hero films. I won't go into details here, just suffice it to say that when I saw Chris Pratt's other film, "The Lego Movie", I was encouraged to see the idea of "the one" relegated to the position of nonsense. I loved it when Morgan Freeman's "wise man" states that the reason that his prophesy is true is based on the fact that "it rhymes". Back to "Guardians ...": The plot and script were solid. The graphics were just amazing. I watched the 3D version and it is excellent. I always feel like 2D films are really missing something after a good 3D viewing. And this 3D film is superb. I do think that we are on some strange path of always having to "one up" the mayhem levels of previous films. And I think that it does not make the drama more effective to continually raise the body count. What is our intent in making films? I think we could make better films with less mindless darkness. Zombies and vampires and fears. Oh my.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rompiest...and the best of the Marvel Universe films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This right here is endless entertainment. It's a Marvel comic film that doesn't take itself too seriously, and knows how to have fun. Creative sets, visuals, dialog, and characters is still cutting short how much is in this film. Some of the most epic proportions of any comic book film I've ever seen.Peter Quill, or Starlord, obtains an orb powerful enough to destroy the galaxy. With the hands of Ronan at its grasp, he unwittingly teams up with three other intergalactic criminals to keep it from falling under Ronan's hands.Right away what I like about this film is it knows how to have fun. It's by far the rompiest of any Marvel universe films. It knows when to address emotion and drama, but never takes itself too seriously. Characters are likable to the extreme, even some that get off at a bad start. Chris Pratt as Peter is irresistibly charming, and Zoe Saldana as Gamora is very motivated and determined. I could not recognized Bradley Cooper's voice as Rocket when I first saw this. Never the less, he is by far one of the most entertaining things of this film. Groot is Groot, and Dave Bautista as Drax is hilarious! They all have different sides of themselves that we all see. They all have their own moments and you instantly feel for them and are on their side until the end.The action is beautiful. The cinematography is slick, fast paced, and it's just great to look at. The overall universe is so amazing, and it reminds me so much of Destiny.The villain, Ronan, is not the greatest villain, mostly because his on screen usually consists of nagging and being badgered. With that said, he has his moments as well, and Thanos, well, until the sequel, there's not too much there.The soundtrack...goodness gracious this has a fantastic soundtrack. The songs are fun, cute, perfect for the type of film, and they fall into place in all the right parts of the film. The soundtrack is one of my favorite of several other things about this film. Literally love this soundtrack to no end. Its presence in the film just gives all the right moments the perfect amount of essence.I could go on, but that'd take all day. In conclusion, this is a must see, not just for Marvel or comic book fans, but anybody who enjoys fun. It's simply a fun film made for all audiences. It speaks to the soul and has something for every type of person out there. Whether it be action, visuals, dialog, or characters, there's basically nothing to not enjoy about this. Highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average plot but cool graphics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've put off watching this film for so long despite all the good reviews, because the trailer honestly did not entice me. I do like Marvel films, but I'm not really into the aliens and galaxy thing (except for Thor), plus I had never heard of the comics before. I probably watched this trailer about 5 times in the past few year and still didn't watch the movie until now. Even while I was watching it, I was debating whether I should continue. Not to say that I'm glad I did, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.This film was pretty entertaining as I didn't realize time passing by while watching this. Chris Pratt is a very charismatic actor, and he was able to hold being the centre of the film well. The supporting cast was great too and Cooper did a great job lending his voice. It doesn't actually sound like him at all, but his voice matched that of his character really well.The story is pretty straightforward and kind of cliché. You have the average guy going about his business, and then stumbling upon something and getting into trouble. He makes friends along the way and at the end he grows to be a 'better' person. Also, it kind of feels like it's trying to be a comedy, but subtlety. Sometimes it even feels too casual and more of a comedy, but without actually being in the genre itself.The cinematics was cool though. Being in space and all, the layout of the planets and the graphics were pretty good. It looked really futuristic and from a totally different planet, so it did its job. The gadgets used were interesting too, however they didn't really explain how the major ones worked. During action scenes its pretty self-explanatory to see most of the gadgets in use, but when they needed to create a weapon from scratch to defeat whatever, it wasn't explained how it worked. It just 'magically' did.People have been saying that this film has the best soundtrack but I disagree. Sure, there are a few great songs in here, but they're only played for a few seconds (OK maybe up to a minute) here and there, it's not enough to fully enjoy it. Plus it seems like it's just added in for the sake of it. It doesn't feel authentic to me.Also, there was this one character who appears for a few seconds in the beginning but then disappears from the rest of the movie. Where did she go? I'm not hating on this film, it's well made, but I just feel like its another ordinary movie.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians Of The Galaxy is the best Marvel movie ever made so far. There are many things I can say to this movie. It was awesome, it was funny, it was beautiful and so on and so forth. It's a good feeling seeing something new on the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story was so good that you won't realize it's kinda cliché (a little). Like for example, the hero's parent is dying cliché or that one part when the villain doesn't finish/kill the hero cliché (that part when Star Lord was dancing in front of Ronan). But just because it had that doesn't mean it was bad but of course, almost all superhero movies are like that. In conclusion, Guardians Of The Galaxy is a must watch especially those to Marvel fans out there. Fun, awesome and amazing!</fullReview>

This is Star Wars level of enthralling interesting characters matched with great visuals and special effects. With how heavily saturated theaters are with comic book adaptations, GOTG has a fresh sense of humor and style like nothing I have seen in a while. I was really surprised at how great this movie was!

Haven't laughed about a movie that much as i have during this movie. The plot and the characters fit together very well and i liked the dialogs. They never get boring or "too much". Its just good and simple entertainment. Liked it a lot and would definitely watch it a couple more times. Seen it in the movies and at home on my TV and the effects are still pretty cool and the jokes still do not get old. Small example is the speaking tree. I mean he does not really speak but somehow only the Fox understands him and just comes up with random interpretations of what he could have said, or really said?! Some funny things just pop up out of nowhere, that makes so movie so cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A combination of Star Wars and The Avengers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, when I saw the trailer of Guardians of Galaxy I thought it was going to be straight-up stupid. But when I saw that it got great reviews, I decided to go see and is was surprisingly good. It was action-packed, it was funny, it was exciting, it was science fiction. What I really liked about it was it took some elements from Star Wars and The Avengers. My favourite character in the film is probably Rocket because he was the funniest and Bradley Cooper did a very good job with his voice-acting. Though I have to disagree with IMDb users that rated it on the Top 250 list. I mean it's a very good sci-fi flick but I don't think it deserves to be on the Top 250 list and even higher than The Avengers which is the greatest superhero movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy showcases all of Marvel's talents with an intriguing, exciting plot,relatable characters and some pretty sweet action sequences. But with Guardians they added a new ingredient to the bowl with a big fistful of comedy and I loved that. First of the characters. Chris Pratt as Starlord is a witty, brave and cool protagonist. His character is the most fleshed out out of the five Guardians. Zoe Saldana as Gamora was a good fit. She had a tough edge as well as mind of composure and her chemistry with Starlord gave a hint of romance into the story. I was however hoping to find out more about her but her back story wasn't explained entirely. Bradley Cooper as Rocket and Vin Diesel as GROOT stole the show for me. The pair together interacting was hilarious and Rocket was even wittier than Starlord. GROOT had a couple of touching moments in the film and conflict,heart and humour were used brilliantly in the movie. My gripes with the movie was the villain Ronan. He was a functional villain but his storyline was condensed plus he is belittled by a more powerful force in the film. Drax another guardian was functional but his characters pain didn't shine through. Overall Guardians is an insanely fun time with good action from an unknown comic book. It's what Marvel do I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story from the oddball corner of the Marvel galaxy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I added this title to "My Movies" list, I first awarded it a 7 before downgrading it to a 6. On it's technical merits, few movies can surpass it. The effects (even if this is the age of CGI) were spectacular. I especially enjoyed the scene where Peter Quill escapes the planet with the orb.I never got into the GOTG comics. They came along too late for me. I did get into Thor, Iron Man, et al earlier but girls started to gain my attention and comics became embedded in my past at that point. I really appreciate the attempts to bring the Marvel Universe (please pardon my use of 'galaxy' in the title of this review) to life. They've done a really good job of it."Guardians of the Galaxy" was appealing on many fronts but the use of top musical hits spoiled the mood for me. I suppose that's because I never read the comics. But if that's something that doesn't get in your way then you'll like this movie more than I did.That's the only negative I have to say about it. Chris Pratt seemed made for the role of Peter Quill/Starlord, Dave Bautista as Drax, and even the animated (and Vin Diesel voiced) Groot was a surprise. I enjoyed Rocket as well as Karen Gillan as Nebula. I can't knock Zoe Saldana in her role as Gamora because I didn't find the character all that relevant to the story.But those are only my digs. I'm sure more people will find this film to be very enjoyable entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These meager pleasures are swallowed up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The term 'superhero fatigue' has been floating around for a while now and you've either got it or it's gonna be setting in soon. The fact is that in the last decade (give or take) there's been an influx of people with powers dominating our cinema screens and ever since Robert Downey Jr. made Tony Stark a pop-culture legend, Marvel Studios has been the main offender; pumping out sequels and prequels of guys with hammers and anger issues and spangle outfits. Their crown jewel, The Avengers, put the whole gang in one big flying fortress and then burned down the box-office to the tune of around a billion and a half in ticket sales. As well as the Disney/Marvel juggernaut, Sony has Spidey and the five movies he's starred in, Fox has the X-Men and around a half-dozen movies of varying quality and Warner Brothers has Batman, a phenomenon unto himself with Superman occasionally showing up in various combinations of performer and tone. Safe to say, people in capes are no longer the exception, they're the norm when it comes to picking a movie for the weekend. And with Marvel's newest cab off the rank, Guardians of the Galaxy has set its sights on a pretty risky set of characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was out in August, and I finally got a chance to see the whole sh'bang was about. There was hype as always, 'fan boys/girls', critics ready to rip another movie that Hollywood has put out, so-on. After 4 weeks of this movie in the theater (around where I live) it stood it's ground as the number one movie to go see. I waited it to come out on Directv ppv, I wasn't disappointed at all. The movie is awesome, while it had a few kinks here and there, the storyline may be a 'same old thing' for some; but some stories need to be brought back up to life again and GOTG was the one that brought needed new life into an old good vs evil story. I'm new at the review thing on here, so I'll leave you people to choose as to whether you want to see it, have seen it and had thoughts on it, but I would see this movie again on a heartbeat. =^_^= -Foxlink</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before viewing this movie I didn't know what to expect. Is it a comedy? Or a sci-fi? Or both? Since sci-fi and comedy aren't usually a good match I didn't expect to much. Just another movie over which I can relax a little. And this is exactly what it is. It contains special effects, it contains good 3D scenes, it contains good comedy. Actors are doing a great job. The story is a little bit messy and unpolished, but funny elements covers this up. And a good music. A great one indeed. Overall it is a great movie to watch, a good enjoyment for two hours. But it leaves nothing to think about. You will forget it as soon you turn off the TV. Although the good mood will stay with you for a while longer. So definitely recommend watching it with your family to have some lough and good time. Sci-fi fans please should not expect too much details and logic though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I was hyped for the release and joined in on the wave of anticipation shortly prior to its release, I put off viewing it for quite a while due to the mixed reviews. There was a lot to be expected and very high standards to be met, yet after viewing it, I believe that it achieved and even overcame them.As many other reviews state, at the start of the movie there is an unsettling scene that could upset young viewers or those who have dealt with parental loss. Considering that this movie is geared towards a younger audience, I did not think that this was appropriate, although it is a core part of the story.Other than this, the movie does not have many flaws. Those that it does have are mainly in the dialogue which is expected because of the audience it is geared to, but this is quickly forgotten with the excellent characters and the stunning visuals. There was a kind of loll towards the middle, but the ending more than made up for it.Very entertaining 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardian of the Galaxy is a fun, wacky, explosive movie.The movie begins with Peter Quill who was abducted from Earth as a little kid just after his mom had died of cancer.He always carries around the old-fashioned Sony Walkman with a mix tape his mother made for him.Twenty six years after his abduction, desperate to be recognized as Star-Lord, he becomes a bit of a thief and steals a mysterious orb. This orb is wanted by a few other people namely Ronan and Thanos the villains and Yondu who abducted Peter.Peter is then compelled to team up with a ragtag crew of space adventurers. They are, a huge creature in the shape of a tree called Groot (played in motion-capture by Vin Diesel), the enormous musclebound, oddly coloured Drax (Dave Bautista), a strangely beautiful female alien Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Rocket, a cunning little talking raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper.At first, they plan to sell the orb and share the money, until they discovers the true power of the orb and the menace it poses to the galaxy. Peter must do his best to rally his ragtag crew for a last stand to guard the galaxy.Directed and co-written by Peter Gunn, all of the effects are so gorgeously beautiful and the script so funny that the film never feels boring or dead.The cast is also great and every character could not have been played better.Another great aspect of the movie is its soundtrack with classic songs like Hooked on a feeling, The Pina Colada etc, a lot of which I had not heard of previous but loved and downloaded after the movie.Overall, the movie is worth watching even more than once. It has everything it needs to have to be an amazing blockbuster: the action, a great story and wonderful visual effects. If you have not seen it, it's a must and I am definitely looking for the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That said, if you were going to compare Pratt's Quill to someone, the character is quite reminiscent of Chris Pine's Captain James Kirk ? smart, womanising, reckless leaders, who eventually find their feet.The editing is supreme and makes each bit of dialogue super-sharp and tight, so when the infamous five are bickering or talking generally, the repartee all feels really clean and natural without being awkward or forced.Thor can be stubborn, Iron Man can be arrogant and Captain America is considered too stiff, but all of the Guardians bring even more wildly different qualities to the table and offer some diversity that doesn't ever grate or bore, which wouldn't have been possible without such excellent casting.Meanwhile, the film is very much in the here and now, with Quill's backstory the only one that truly gets a look-in, which creates a sense of intrigue about his colleagues who only have their pasts hinted at, meaning sequel fodder.There's just no way of knowing where you're going and tonally the movie delivers a piece of everything and it's done big and without hesitation.Guardians may have been a gamble, but I'm Grooting for it to Rocket to the top.10/10Please Check This link To read more=&gt; http://jamess.org</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy Guarding the galaxy means having to protect all of the universe's star constellations - even the lame ones like The Poop Deck.However, the galactic protectors in this sci-fi movie are too busy fleeing foes to stargaze.An orphaned earthling (Chris Pratt) spirited away by aliens grows up to lead a band of rogues (Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel) on a quest to prevent a zealot (Lee Pace) from destroying a populated planet.Elsewhere, Thanos (Josh Brolin) continues to collect the omnipotent infinity gems for his nefarious endgame.Expanding the Marvel Universe with oddball - but endearing - characters, eye-popping action and heartwarming antics, this adaptation of one of Marvels' lesser-known books is an amazing cinematic achievement.Funnier than any modern comedy, this space opera utilizes the laughs to cover up its darker themes of loss, betrayal and extremism.However, if aliens existed, they would've enslaved us by now.

		<shortDescription>2 Part Synopsis and Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel's latest summer superhero blockbuster The Guardians of the Galaxy takes us away from the world of The Avengers and out into the cosmos. This movie contains action akin to the previous Marvel movies, as the fate of countless people are dependent on the success of the protagonists, in addition to a hefty amount of humor that creates a fun and exciting adventure for mostly mature audiences. The movie starts in 1988 with a young Quill (Wyatt Oleff) at his mother's death bed in a hospital. Shortly after, Quill is abducted by aliens with nothing but his clothes and a Walkman with a 1980s music mix tape. Flash forward to 2014, or present day, and the much older, now interstellar thief Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) is off exploring some distant, uninhabited planet. One traveling montage later, Quill reaches an orb that is sought after by several powerful groups of people, including a powerful warlord named Ronan (Lee Pace), for reasons unknown to Peter. After escaping Ronan's forces and attempting to sell the orb on another planet, Peter is attacked and he and three others are thrown into a maximum security prison. It is in this prison where the "?bunch of a-holes" (Guardians) first meet. In order to escape this prison, Quill must team up with the assassin Gamora (Zoe Salanda), the psychopath Drax (Dave Bautista), the genetically engineered raccoon Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper), and the tree Groot (voice of Vin Diesel). Once they escape, they once again attempt to sell the mysterious orb, only to fail and have it stolen. Because of this, the group is forced to attempt to save the galaxy from ultimate destruction at the hands of Ronan, thus becoming The Guardians of the Galaxy. The movies belong to the geeks during the summer. Ever since Iron Man in 2008 Marvel superhero movies have been on the rise in popularity at the box office. Following with movies from The Avengers to Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Marvel has experienced huge amounts of success with comic book hero movie adaptations. Marvel's latest release continues this trend while moving the story away from Earth. The Guardians of the Galaxy are not actually heroes, and are, instead, a group of criminals who get tossed into the role of heroes. The movie quickly became one of the most popular superhero movies to ever hit the screen, and is often described as "?the most fun I've ever had at the movies in a while" (Crawford). Unlike other superhero movies, humor is at the forefront of the entertainment value along with the action, rather than being just an added bit during the less exciting parts of the movie. The movie still contains copious amounts of action and explosions, however the humor adds goofiness to the whole experience, allowing the movie to stand out. The humor in The Guardians of the Galaxy is made effective by the situations in which it is used and how it is executed by the actors, which in turn makes the movie ridiculous and exciting causing the movie to stand out among all other previous superhero movies.Chris Pratt's acting style as Peter Quill aka Star-Lord creates a goofy side to a movie that has a serious plot and tone for most of the film, causing a memorable contrast that stands out from other movies of the genre. In most cases of exploring a desolate planet in search of rare and potentially dangerous treasure a 1980s music traveling montage complete with dancing and lip syncing is one of the last ways normal treasure hunters or thieves would proceed. In the case of Quill however, this is just how he works. The casting of Pratt, a known comedic actor, for the role as this strange galactic thief is the perfect fit for this movie. Pratt's interpretation of the main action hero is humor in itself, as "Most of these guys are bad-asses who have occasional moments of goofball good humor. Pratt, though, plays Quill as a goof ball with occasional moments of bad-assery" (Alter). Pratt's sarcastic and carefree attitude along with his occasionally skewed motives, such as risking life and limb for a Walkman, contrast that of the rest of the group who focus on surviving and getting paid. Thus, the interactions between these differing characters create even more humor as they bicker with each other when the entire police force on a maximum security prison is shooting at them. However, Pratt is not the only actor whose interpretation of the character. Dave Bautista as Drax creates his own humor because he takes every statement literally. From gestures to metaphors, his small comments when the others use literary wit come as small chuckle moments, while Zoe Salanda as Gamora creates more laughable moments when interacting with Quill. The romantic moments that occasionally occur go south for Quill once she threatens to kill him for his "pelvic sorcery" (Guardians). And not to forget the all-stars of bizarre in the film, Rocket the raccoon and Groot the tree, voiced by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel respectively. Rocket's obsession with blowing stuff up and the fact that he is a talking raccoon, and Groot's limited vocabulary cause people to laugh in most serious situations. The criminal backgrounds of the characters the actors play also cause problems, usually involving law enforcement. However, the contrasting styles of the actors and their memorable and ridiculous interactions with their environment and co-stars makes The Guardians of the Galaxy a movie worth watching. Twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel fans- a must watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Gunn brings you the much anticipated Guardians of the Galaxy, the latest addition to Marvel's movie collection. Big fan of what marvel is doing, and for those whom are familiar with the overall plan of Marvel's upcoming movies- this was just so exciting. If you are not a Marvel fan, or are not familiar with the other films, don't waste your time here. Marvel's recent films have a certain feel to them, that action with some comedy thrown in.The characters were magnificently casted: there is no better person to play star lord than Chris Pratt. Not to take away from the rest of the cast which really brought the characters to life. Guardians balances the story line of the movie while still advancing the BIG story that we see unfolding through-out all of the Marvel movies. There are easter eggs if you can spot them, i saw the movie numerous times so it became easier the more you can watch and spot. Overall, this movie was beautifully done- marvel fans you will not be disappointed. In my opinion, i like the avengers better, but that has nothing to do with how they brought this movie to screen, more to do with just the characters involved. Go see it, bottom line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious version of its own genre #Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>#SpoilersLeft the theater with a smile after two hours of superb entertainment, with a brilliant soundtrack, which was streamed immediately when I got home.The movie gives a lot of good laughs, without trying to be a goofy comedy. I don't think the plot of the movie is the best ever seen, but it does not matter due to the characters, the word play, the songs and not to forget - a raccoon shooting a machine gun. The comic books of Marvel of course have the credit for the creation of the characters, but the writers, directors and animators have done a fantastic job of giving the characters life, backgrounds, feeling, jokes and stories to tell, and this is the main reason this movie is that good!For me the soundtracks played a great part in the movie - not only to the main character (Peter), but also to the audience. With the only exception of "ain't no mountain high enough" (a bit too far fetched), the songs set the right emotion of many scenes and tell Peter's story about his relationship with his mother without making a bunch of cutaways or flashbacks. A great way to indirectly telling the audience a story.I love the way James Gunn manage to make GotG do jokes on its own genre. For example, the widely used "heroes walking in a line in slow motion"- scene, is of course joining this movie too, but Gunn keep their antihero-look, which they are, by for making the Rocket (the raccoon) scratch himself in slow motion. Even more brilliant is the circle scene where Peter is telling his plan, and when Rocket finally joins the plan he says: "Look at us - A bunch of jackasses standing in a circle". It is a typical cliché in this type of movie, and that it is pointed out in the movie is just brilliant.A great movie, worth seeing again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy is a smart, funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel Studios' film Guardians of the Galaxy is a smart, funny movie.Chris Pratt (from TV's Parks and Recreation) plays Peter Quill, whose cynicism masks an inner hurt: he was abducted from Earth as a little kid just after his mom had died of cancer and always carries around the old-fashioned Sony Walkman with a mixtape his mother made for him. Peter Quill finds himself the object of an unrelenting bounty hunt after stealing a mysterious orb coveted by Ronan, a powerful villain with ambitions that threaten the entire universe. To evade the persistent Ronan, Quill is forced into an uneasy truce with a quartet of disparate misfits. Rocket, a gun-toting raccoon, Groot, a tree-like humanoid, the deadly and enigmatic Gamora and the revenge-driven Drax the Destroyer. But when Peter discovers the true power of the orb and the menace it poses to the cosmos, he must do his best to rally his ragtag rivals for a last, desperate stand, with the galaxy's fate in the balanceProbably the best Marvel movie to date. It delivers every time on the humor, the visuals are incredible, and it did a great job at introducing a group of very distinct &amp; likable characters that are definitely gonna catch on more &amp; more with time. Not to mention that the way the music is integrated into the movie is just plain awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note ahead: although I am a huge fan of Marvel comics an consequent (recent years) movies, when I saw the preview, I though this would be a disaster. An enraged raccoon and a tree like creature saying only one thing (his name)? Oh boy! But this movie was not at all what I expected. It was very entertaining, with touching characters all with a unique background and depth delivering all the way. Every one of the character has its issues and to first order, it does not seem like they would be forming the right brew of individuals for a team "saving the galaxy". An assassin, a destroyer, an enhanced raccoon and a humanoid tree end to be loosely led through and unlikely bound of friendship and realization of a commonality by the character of Peter Quill aka Star Lord. The dynamic was great, the acting superb for characters which were difficult to embody in the first place.The movie is full of humor and avoids getting you bored with cliché. A scene may start and feel like it will go toward a common lecturing between two characters but aborted by a "yeah yeah!" and a gun shot. Seems trivial and simple minded but this is just one example (don't want to provide spoilers) that this film is not following the standard framework for the genre, does not take itself that seriously and as a result, is highly entertaining (actually, you probably would have liked to shoot yourself to stop the boring lecturing, wouldn't you?). Some parts and explanation are a bit under-developed (not sure what made the end possible still) but I did not mind. I was equally surprised by the awesome graphics, visual effects and spectacular fast moving and well executed fight scenes.From start to end, I was totally taken by this flick as the dynamic and balance between dialogs &amp; actions was well done and extremely well executed. It was captivating, not pretentious or over-serious, full of humor and overall a great fun. Go see it and judged by yourself (I may go and watch it again if in 3D).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this film is best suited for fans of science fiction. And if you are familiar with the Marvel universe, so much the better.In the early minutes of the film I noticed two things. One, that I was seeing something really interesting about every ten seconds. The images and the surprises just kept coming. Two, they did an excellent job creating the visual aspects of the characters, particularly the large, powerful characters. You see a big bad guy. Then you see a bigger badder guy. Then there is another awesome version of another forbidding character, etc.Although the CGI is quite impressive, I thought the best scenes were those that involved the main characters. Scenes of spaceships battling each other, while competently made, are not as interesting as those in which there is dialogue between characters.There is plenty of humor in this film. Some is worthy of out-loud chuckles. Rocket, the cantankerous raccoon, is predictably funny.I will definitely watch for the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great!! CGI is great and has a great science fiction feel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an amazing film. One reason being is the animation is phenomenal. Not only is the CGI great, but the movie implements make up on most of the cast. This is nice to see since a lot of films these days use CGI for their characters. The story is very good, yet the reason why I'm giving an 8.5 instead of a perfect 10 is because at some points you feel the story is being rushed and kind of jumbled, it is not rushed too badly nor jumbled a lot, just feels like it sometimes. The character interaction within the team is wonderful. You really get a feel of the characters personality and how they at first do not want to work together. As the film progresses you can see the character development within the characters and how they treat each other with respect and consider each other as true friends. The film does a good job with humor and action. It is good for an action lover and a comedy fan as well. Also one thing about this film that is nice is that it is not based on Earth. (All the Marvel Universe films are based on Earth) This film is based on other planets. I loved that! I felt like I was watching an awesome Science Fiction film set in new worlds and felt like I was discovering new planets. To be honest I felt like it was a weird hybrid of Star Trek meets Marvel. The different alien species and humans living on the different planets is an awesome welcome. Even if the film was set on Earth, still would be a good film. Overall this films animation/CGI, balance of action and humor, and a great character development gives this film a good balance. As I mentioned earlier the story is a little bumpy at first, but smooth's itself out in the later half. Overall I give this film a 8.5/10- The_Kansan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great but not near The Avengers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy: 8/10 Parental Guide: Future Men ApprovedOK, here is the deal with this movie. Indeed the acting was great. The CGI was oh so amazing! The story was that of any superhero movie. It was entertaining and funny. The action was OK in comparison to other movies, yet it was still world-class. This may make it sound like it was the best movie ever. Was it? No it was not. Guardians of the Galaxy's major flaw was that it was its lack of focus on anything other than humor. Unless your sole intent in making a movie is to label it a comedy, humor should be used as a seasoning. Precedents have been set for comedy in superhero movies. I understand that the bar must be raised, but here we have a classic case of quantity vs quality. There are two ways to be a good gift giver. Either A) give a lot of decent gifts with a few pretty good ones or B) Give a really nice gift. Applying this to movies; you can either flood the audience with humor and the laws of marginal utility come into effect or you can give the audience a few nuggets and hope that they like them. It is pretty obvious which one the writers decided to go with when they wrote the story and script of Guardians of the Galaxy. They over seasoned an already great steak. Now I personally like my salt, so as I have said before I am very biased and since it was the comedy that they overdid I am not going to hold it against them too much. Since everyone already knows the great parts I am going to continue to point out the flaws. One big mistake I saw was Thanos's armor. The most evil and powerful guy in the universe and they portray him as more of golden tinfoil wrapped space dad in his special edition floating La-Z-Boy. What were you thinking? And what about Peter Quill apparently being a demigod? (Not the fact that he is the son of Jason of Spartax, that he is a "demigod") That's the only explanation I can come up with for how he can convince so many people to do what he wants. Obviously his mother was actually Aphrodite and she gave him the gift of charm speak. There is just no way he could be that persuasive with such lame arguments without the gift of charm speak. One more thing. This movies villain, did you ever, at any point, even a little, feel like he was actually a threat? Because I did not. To wrap it up, this was a great movie. But taking into consideration all these good sides and bad sides I do not find this movie deserving of the first ever "Stew's Seal Of Approval"</fullReview>

The Henchman Nebula was also she was menacing and feisty she was great also a scene stealer. The Film was good but Drax and Ronan were severely Underdeveloped which it kinda hurt it a bit we got some solid Backstory from the rest of the Guardians but Drax was just there unfortunately. 'Contains Spoiler*Also Ronan was Cool but totally became a pawn in the climax"Contains Spoiler". Not as a Great as Marvels Previous Adaptations Like The Avengers,Captain America The Winter Soldier,Iron Man,Thor :The Dark World and The Incredible Hulk but Still Noteworthy despite some incomplete Characters 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few problematic scenes but a really fun ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think there is much of a point of telling you that this movie is good. A seemingly endless amount of positive reviews speaks for itself. The movie surpassed $200M in box office revenues. However, perhaps we all got a little carried away in our communal cheering. This movie is not without sins.I continue to lack understanding for the argument that action movies do not have to adhere to realism. I do not see the need for the sacrifice. Towards the end of the movie I lost count how many times this flick broke the laws of physics and I felt it did not have to. According to this film, being encased in a ball of wooden branches makes you survive a crash. Come on! Sometimes one is able to suspend disbelief, but sometimes the violation of truth pulls you right out of the movie. Suddenly you are just an ape wearing 3d glasses and starring at a large screen.The other issue with the movie is a number of movie clichés. Maybe this says more about the number of movies we, the public, have been spoiled with over the years, but throughout this film I saw scenes from Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and Serenity. Sometimes, either during or shortly after such a cliché, the movie would acknowledge it with a joke or a little twist, but if it is so self-aware then why did it not avoid such scenes in the first place? I mean here was the one chance to be different. The movie has a talking raccoon in it and yet the makers still decided to stick to formula. I don't get it.The plot resembles Serenity quite a bit. A crew of rogues with a spaceship, who do not all like one another, are thrown by fate into a situation that eventually turns them into heroes. And I am sure Serenity probably took it from somewhere else. Again, come up with some new stuff, people.Another issue is that some characters change their motivations mid-movie without there being a discernible character arc justifying the change. The main male protagonist is portrayed as a scoundrel for the first 80% of the movie and then suddenly he is convincing others to be altruistic, including those who were already established to be more so than him. That felt forced and contrived, like the makers remembered that they had to wrap this movie up so they started cutting corners.In fact, with the story containing so many different characters and motivations, this movie really could have used another 30 minutes or so of screen time. The backstory is explained in about 30 seconds and if you didn't pay attention, too bad. Here's a bad guy, he looks evil; moving on.As already mentioned, the movie is good. The visuals are pretty. It manages to be funny, which often does not work out in action movies. But it is unfortunate that it feels the need to trod in formula. I hope that next time, in the inevitable sequel, Gunn just takes a left and doesn't look back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun rocking Sci-Fi experience which rarely lets up the pace.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not familiar with the characters from this aspect of the Marvel Universe so perhaps went and saw the film with less excitement than some. Only the recent Captain America has worked for me of the more recent Marvel efforts, but GOTG really hit the mark.Revolving around a group of down on their luck mercenaries, one of whom was once kidnapped from earth as depicted in the prologue, this disparaging group are thrown together to try and save the universe getting mixed up in all sorts of adventures along the way. Its set in a universe you believe is real, so there is always a sense of jeopardy (unlike in say an Expendables movie) This is a film that you can watch alone from others in the Marvel Universe without having to understand their relevance on impact on the characters depicted here. What you have in this film is strongly written, humorous well acted, character driven action adventure Sci-Fi romp that squarely points out to you from the get go that it doesn't take itself too seriously. The CGI fx work here feels more in place and less overwhelming than more recent efforts, but there is such great attention to detail in every other aspect of the movies Production design as well that there is so much to be savored and enjoyed on screen beyond the top notch cast all of whom are excellent (Including Vin Diesel who as mutant tree creature 'Root' is at his least wooden) Fears that Zoe Salanda playing a green alien would be retreading her recent Avatar role are unfounded as she couldn't be more different but Chris Pratt leads the troop with bags of charisma as Star Lord (Finally!) This is a film about likable anti heroes who don't want to save the day but end up doing it anyway. The supporting cast of stand outs such as John C Reilly, Michael Rooker, Glen Close and many more are all great. It's a film you may want to watch again and almost certainly own. Yes I got the bit at the end, only because I saw that film in the 1980s!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first say that this movie is rather over-hyped, rather overrated. I've read things like "most epic world building since Star Wars," and other things of that nature. This is not some sort of groundbreaking film. It is not a masterpiece of cinema. What it is, is a very good movie. A great popcorn flick. Visuals are outstanding for the most part.Starlord as the main character is the typical lost boy who is finding himself throughout the movie. Zoe Saldana is great, as always, the love interest. Some of the humor falls a bit flat, but most of it is reasonably funny. Christ Pratt, again, is overrated here. He is good, but I get the feeling that after all the goodwill he built up in Parks and Rec, people would have said he was the greatest lead ever, no matter the movie. I'm not sure he really does serious very well, but he will only get better with time.Overall it's a great flick to see before the summer ends. Absolutely worth it, just don't try to take it seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy: A fresh take from Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with it is difficult not have high expectations for this movie. There has been so much positive hype, and since I and a lot of other viewers knew nothing of these Guardians, we did not know what to expect other then an incredible movie. The expectations were met. Marvel is indeed making quality movies at the moment, earlier this year we saw Captain America 2 that was indeed a great film with a different feeling then other Marvel movies. Guardians of the Galaxy is the same. A film that excels on various levels. The most notable must be the humor, soundtrack and the CGI. The humor cannot be delivered without a strong cast, even though most of them weren't on set with each other while filming (thinking of Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper). The soundtrack never failed, never strayed from the concept of songs from the 70's. The CGI gave you the feeling of great video games. One thing that could have been made better was the various skin colors, they didn't seem natural to me. The story has been done before. But there is a reason why we keep seeing these story lines. They are good. They entertain. So I will not say a negative word about it. The only downfall of this movie, and the reason why I cannot go higher then 8 - Superhero movies are coming out to fast and to many. I am full now. I need a break. I need to rest. But we are being stuffed like turkeys at thanksgiving. And I am saying this even though this movie delivers on a great balance of being serious and humoring the audience. This is one of the great movies this year. A great blockbuster and a lovely fresh take on the generic superhero movies out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars for a new generation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was incredible! I honestly believe that this will be 'Star Wars' for a new generation of kids... where almost every character is Han Solo.The story wasn't exactly ground breaking, but it was interesting and different enough to keep me guessing and at the end of the day, this movie gives focus to the characters firstly, and the narrative secondarily - which under normal circumstances I disprove of, but in this case it worked.Pros: Rocket was spot on and Groot was the heart of the movie - I mean, every single time Groot did something adorable (which was all the time), I wanted to cry! Definitely 2014's two most awesome team IMO. Chris Pratt's Star Lord was a lot better than I was expecting (and I was expecting him to be hilarious) so as an actor he's gone way up in my "keep an eye out for that guy" list. Dave Bautista was probably the most surprising part of the movie... I really thought he'd be terrible and stale, but he actually ended up stealing quite a few scenes from the rest of the cast. Other than the actors &amp; characters, the visuals were awesome: It looked fresh and new and colorful world that James Gunn created here really popped and stood out for me. The score was great, and the soundtrack amazing... I can't wait for Vol 2. The humor in the film was also a big surprise... I never thought Disney/Marvel would let Gunn and the cast get away with the shenanigans that they came up with. I mean... semen jokes?!Cons: Gamora was totally unlike the character I've gotten to know in the comics. I guess they wanted a more sympathetic and softer character to counter balance all the rough 'n tumble ones on the team, but for someone who's read GotG and knows Gamora as a character, it was something I just couldn't get used to. Same goes for the Nova corps, but IMO they were just downright lame in this movie - although apparently James Gunn isn't exactly a Nova fan, so obviously not much thought went into that aspect of the story. Lastly, all I can say is that it was a pity that they killed off Ronan so early, which I felt they could have written differently, but aw well. Even though it is connected to the rest of the MCU, it feels like the most stand-alone movie they've made so far, yet surprisingly, there were still references and easter eggs abound (probably more so than any other movie). I mean... Cosmo... the movie had Cosmo!!! All 'n all though, a solid 9 out of 10 and I can't wait to see it again this week... and next week XD</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fun that I expected *Spoiler at the end*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this is the film I've been waiting the whole summer for. Finally the Guardians of the Galaxy are here!! OK, so to be honest, I know little to nothing about them. I was a huge comic book nerd during my post- pubescent years and that includes the less iconic characters, but to be perfectly honest this is one of the stories I wasn't very familiar with. I found it somewhat odd that Marvel would choose such an obscure hero team to focus a movie on, but I found it refreshing after continuous iconic hero's such as Spiderman, Ironman and Captain America kept churning out redundant film after redundant film. Also, the first full trailer was pretty awesome.I ended up going to the Saturday night showing of the movie to avoid the influx of nerdiness that can end up making the environment either very fun or a pain in the ass. The plot loosely related to some of the events that occurred in the first Avengers movie, but definitely stood on its own. The story revolved around Peter Quill (aka Star-Lord) who comes across an orb that unbeknownst to him possesses one of the most powerful stones in the universe. While trying to pawn off the orb, he stumbles across a group of social outcasts that end up becoming the protectors of the known Universe.The movie reminded me of a cross between Firefly and the rebooted Star Trek, which I realize Zoe Saldana is also in. The intergalactic social degenerates theme has been done before, but throwing in some pretty interesting characters made it come into its own.Chris Pratt does a great job as Star Lord, and I was a fan of him being a lead since hearing he was casted for it. I was concerned about his look since I know him best as Andy Dwyer on Parks and Recreation, a tubby dimwitted Jack-of-all-trades, but he obviously took the part seriously and got into leading role shape. The real actor that drew me in was all CGI. A foul-mouthed, machine gun toting Raccoon named Rocket. That was enough to consider this a must-see and definitely didn't disappoint.Director James Gunn held back no punches with the visuals creating some spectacular environments and colorful creatures that possessed average depth, but contained originality in super powers and intelligence. The only drawback I can think of is that there wasn't too much back story on any of the characters other than Peter Quill, but that would've definitely added an extra hour or two.The one thing I will say was absolutely amazing and flawless was the movies soundtrack. It was based on a cassette tape called "Awesome mix Vol. 1&#x2033; which Peter's mom gave to him some time in the 80's. It contains some really awesome tunes from the 70's and 80's including Blue Swede's Hooked on a Feeling, Norman Greenbaum's Spirit in the Sky and one that's my current favorite, Redbone's Come and Get Your Love. It's so good I've been playing it since the movie came out.Overall Grade: B+WHAT??? WHY???? Before you bite my head off for this review, the only reason I give it a B+ is because of what I said earlier; it's been done before and there's nothing new or unique about it. It's still a fun and funny thrill ride of a movie, but there was nothing out-of-the-box about it. The characters are engaging and hilarious, even the very literal Drax the Destroyer. The visuals are incredible and the tongue and cheek approach to a superhero movie gives it a nice colorful comic book feel that some movies in the genre lack.Look forward to laughing and enjoying a nice intergalactic movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and has a dope soundtrack.*Spoiler coming up below. Do not read further if you do not want to know the ending credits*OK, so the Howard the Duck cameo in the ending credits I think that's just a nod to another obscure Marvel character and not another Howard the Duck movie. I still think that the Howard the Duck movie was very underrated and one of the greatest films of all time ..I think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a kid. My very first exposure to the Guardians of the Galaxy comic came by way of the Avengers. There was Vance Astro a future astronaut who idolized Captain America and carried his shield into battle. Yondu Charlie 27 Starhawk and others who I forget. they were banded together by Vance Astro who was inspired by the exploits of the Avengers and he decided that the Galaxy needed a Avengerslike team. They were from the 31st century. and granted things change and the Line up of the Gaurdians of the Galazy changed. A few years back The powers at Marvel decided to bring the band back together with some of Marvel's old and forgotten Sci-fi heroes. they brought back Peter Quill A.K.A. Star-Lord to lead this band. They brought back Rocket Raccoon and a old d-list villain called Groot. then there was Gamora the daughter of Thanos the death dealer. Drax the Destroyer a living engine of war. These Guardians had a fairly long run for a sci-fi comic consisting of forgotten heroes. When Marvel annoucned they were bring the Guardian to the big screen I was convinced it wasn't going to work. Too obscure too far reaching of a concept. I heard reports of the making of it. and it sounded interesting. I was going to see it anyways . I've seen every Marvel film in the theatre. My kids are starting to watch them with me. As a whole the entire family enjoys them. but still I was convinced that Marvel had a bomb. The previews were cute and everything looked great. Then my ten year old son. Started asking questions about the Guardians of the Galaxy. He wanted to see it. And I started to rethink my opinion. that it was a dud. Because suddenly looking at it from a child's eyes this was like Star Wars all over again. There was action and suspense and romance. And they tie it together all in a pretty bow. The story is this. In 1988 young Peter Quill loses his mother. He's never known his father and his mother insists his father was not from this world. His father she insists was a being of pure light. She dies and Peter runs away from the hospital where he is taken by a alien ship. 26 years later Peter Quill is a intergalactic thief and pirate who is a womanizer from one end of the galaxy to the other. Quill calls himself Star-Lord and he tries to act like he is more of a bigger deal then he is. When Star-Lord is hired to retrieve a orb from an abandoned planet he sets into motion a series of events. That lead from an unholy alliance between Thanos and Ronan the Accuser a galactic butcher from the Kree race. they want that orb and so does Quill's former team mates the ravagers a band of pirates headed up by Yondu a merc. With a heart of larceny. When Quill eludes both Ronan's Agents and the ravagers Yondu places a price on his head. Quill heads to Xandar the home of the Nova corps which is currently at war with ronan. Quill wants to sell the orb to a dealer. While he tries to sell it he is spotted by two bounty hunters A Raccoon named Rocket and a treelike creature named Groot. Rocket sees that Quill has a bounty on his head of forty thousand units. He thinks he'll be rich. Until he confronts Quill who is attacked by Thanos daughter Gamora. Gamora is willing to betray her father to save Xandar. Star-Lord Rocket Raccoon and Groot get into a fight with Gamora which bring the authorities. they are taken to the Kiln a galactic prison where they meet Drax a walking time bomb. Drax wants to kill Gamora because Ronan killed his wife and daughter. and he is convinced killing Thanos daughter would bring him peace. Gamora reveals to them that she has a buyer for the orb. And he is willing to pay forty million units for it. Rocket and Quill do the math and figure it out they'll be rich. Rocket comes up with a plan to break out. This break out scene is easily one of the film's highlights. after they escape they bring the orb to the Collector. A mad immortal who collects one of every thing that is unique. He reveals the weapon to be a soul gem. A Gem of such vast power you can destroy galaxies with it. Star-Lord discovers he can't let this thing fall into Thanos hands or Ronan's hands. And so begins a quest to save the galaxy from those who would destroy it. The climatic battle is beautifully rendered. And you see the Gaurdians begin to come together as a team. They trust each other. Because of what they've been thru already. By the time the film ends they are no longer a team they are a family. And they are more then ready to assume their new responsibilities as the Guardians of the Galaxy. Now you don't need to be a comics geek to watch this and enjoy it. Nor do you have to be a huge sci-fi fan either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew nothing of the source material going into this, and it was a pleasant surprise. To be honest at the beginning I had a "wtf is this" feeling, but once I figured out it was a space opera with a lot of purposeful humor I latched on and had a great time watching.The plot is part of a larger Marvel arc with the Infinity Gauntlet (crazy powerful thing created by assembling some other powerful things) but not knowing much about that didn't hinder my enjoyment. The characters are diverse and very vivid. The humor doesn't get in the way if you don't find the jokes that funny, and the pacing is good as well. You're treated to some cool locales as well. My only complaints would be that the villain looked like a laughable version of Zartan from G.I. Joe and the movie looked too clean. The latter is kind of a general complaint I personally have with a lot of movies these days though, so take it for what it's worth. I don't know what it is but for some reason when green screen backgrounds are involved no one can look dirty or tattered, and when they do it's very obvious a make up artist did the work ("here let's put some fake dirt on your face"). Aside from those two things, which didn't make or break anything for me, this is a really fun movie I think most people can enjoy or at least sit through even if they're not comic book or science fiction fans. Being a fan of both but not knowing what I was getting into I came out of it very pleased.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a really good Disney movie that really blew me away when it came to acting cleverly written dialogue. I absolutely loved Chris Pratts character and how he portrayed it spot on, but not to forget how I quite enjoyed Vin Diesels voice acting in this (even though he only said "I am Groot" for a large percentage of the movie)since he seemed to add emotion to the creature. The movie really builds a like for each character and I personally felt for each character in this like they were real humans making real decisions.The comedy in this really helps you to realise its a Marvel movie and thankfully Disney avoided the family friendly zone a bit and made it quite enjoyable for older audiences. I definitely recommend this one and it is by far the best Marvel movie since Avengers, yes have seen every other marvel film since then and they are no comparison</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The very definition of cinematic fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a group of heroes consisting of a raccoon, a tree, a green-skinned assassin, a red- tattooed warrior and a man stuck squarely in the 80's, GotG was always going to be the weirdest entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That it's now up there with The Avengers as Marvel's best is testament to director James Gunn's vision, execution and utterly perfect casting. After a backstory-building scene with a young Peter Quill we jump ahead 20 years to witness Quill, aka Star Lord (Chris Pratt ? a superstar in the making), in a dank cave dancing around to Redbone's 1974 hit "Come and Get Your Love", and the movie never looks back. It's not long before we meet the show-stealing Rocket Raccoon (voiced to perfection by Bradley Cooper), a cocky, smart-arsed bounty hunter with a penchant for bombs and machine guns, and his bodyguard Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), a regenerating tree-like creature whose vocabulary consists only of "I am Groot". Throw in Zoe Saldana's sexy but badass Gamora, adopted daughter of genocidal maniac Thanos who is searching for redemption, and Dave Bautista's grief-stricken man mountain Drax, whose race of people take everything literally, and you have a ragtag bunch ready to save the galaxy from Lee Pace's indefatigable revenge- seeker (and awesome looking) Ronan the Accuser. If the success of these eclectic characters is the driving force behind the film's triumph, then Gunn, on both screen writing and directing duties, deserves the lion's share of the plaudits. His script delivers some of the year's best lines ("if we had a black light, it would look like a Jackson Pollock painting") with a consistency that puts most modern comedies to shame, whilst there are also some genuinely touching moments that reveal a deeper emotional level then initially noticeable. The climax poses as a small weakness from a narrative standpoint, but with an otherwise outstanding story leading up to it this is a minor quibble. As with all Marvel flicks, the action sequences are damn impressive, however this outing gets bonus points for dishing them out with increased originality and a wicked sense of humour. A prison break set piece, with the inclusion of a hilarious mechanical leg gag (you'll have to see it to understand it), is just one of the many technically astounding, inventively choreographed and giddily enjoyable action-packed sections of the movie. Forgiving a couple of undercooked side characters ? Benicio del Toro's The Collector and Karen Gillan's Nebula ? and a finale that can't match the magnificence of the preceding 100 minutes, GotG offers the most unbridled, unconventional fun of 2014.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Knocks it out of the Galaxy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard &amp; read so many wonderful things about Guardians of the Galaxy, yet I didn't want to get my hopes up because this has happened with many films for me in the past, and I was disappointed all too often. This movie was executed so perfectly! It was by far one of the best films I've seen of this kind in a long, long time. Not only is the movie filled with action and thrills, but it's hilarious too. This must have been what it was like to some degree for those who saw Star Wars in theatres back in 1977. Even though the movie is of purely fictional substance, you believe it. It's the kind of film that sucks you in from start to finish (which, of course, you'll want to stay for the end of the credits, as with all Marvel movies). I truly cannot wait for this movie to come out on DVD. The acting was great and the dialog was fantastic. We were laughing the whole way through. Chris Pratt was fantastic as Peter Quill. He really is a master of his craft with perfect comedic timing, not to mention he's rugged and charming, in the same vein of Han Solo, with a much bigger sense of humor. Even Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper as Groot and Rocket were fantastic, all with playing animated characters (Vin Diesel only has one line said through the whole movie but still manages to get you laughing the whole way through). Zoe Saldana kicks major space butt and Dave Batista was awesome as Drax! There really isn't anything bad I have to say about the movie. I cannot end my review without commenting about how fantastic the music is in this film as well! Such an awesome soundtrack. Seriously, go see this movie! You will not be disappointed! Guardians of the Galaxy was simply MARVELous :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Quill is no Hero. He has some special tools but he's mainly normal. What marks him and distinguishes him from the rest is his courage and his love for life. He is no hero, he's an amazing loser. Someone that we can all aspire to be and identify ourselves with.The rest of the characters have flaws that are stressed during the whole movie. I honestly feel that there are no heroes in this movie, only outstanding losers. And that makes me love this movie like i could never ever love a hero movie.

		<shortDescription>"Guardians of the Galaxy" is a testament to how far the film industry has gone since the days of model building and rudimentary special FX</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a rush...!!! Is the best way to describe the new Marvel visual extravaganza titled "Guardians of the Galaxy"! My senses are still tingling and It took me a while to be able to unplugged from the theater of the make believe but the satisfaction I feel right now makes me confident that I saw something very special. In fact I just might have seen "STAR WARS" like experience of this generation. I was asked once by the outsider to the film industry, why only Hollywood studios are capable of bringing the big CGI supported action Blockbusters? Why Europa is incapable of making this type of movies? What does that depend on? Don't we have the talent to create similar type big and to some extant epic movies? The answer is very simple and the best example to prove my point we can go no further then "Cloud Atlas" which back in 2012 was made for 102 million dollars by few German based production companies. Despite of the fact that I thought "Cloud Atlas" was a very well made movie (minus not always believable make up) and carried a depth that is often missing from their American counterparts. It failed miserably at the box office bringing total of 27 million dollars. The fact that it was treated as a art-house film and was shown in small screening rooms did not help in it's all around success. It is not that European companies are incapable of making big blockbusters (a lot of big American movies are often shot at the European studios like Pinewood in UK, for example) it is just very risky to do so. One flop can mean the end of that studio, where in Hollywood exists more of a factory type mechanism were big movies are being planed years in advance and if some movie ends up not making as much money for the studio, month or two later there is a next blockbuster premier that hopefully make up the financial difference. This brings us to this summers awesome representation of what we love in Hollywood movies "Guardians of the Galaxy". Based on the Marvel comic book released back in 70's, with considerably less known characters comparing with Iron Man, Batman or Spiderman, among others. The premise is straight forward.After stealing a mysterious orb in the far reaches of outer space, human Peter Quill (bulked up Chris Pratt) is now the main target of a manhunt led by the villain known as Ronan the Accuser (charismatic Lee Pace). To help fight Ronan and his team and SAVE the galaxy from his power, Quill creates a team known as the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' to save the world.This team consist of: Sexy female assassin Gamora (hot Zoe Saldana) Overgrown muscle man trying to avenge his families death, Drax (surpassingly emotionally deep performance by the WWE wrestler Dave Bautista) and two CGI creations: Groot (Vin Diesel) and Bradley Cooper as Rocket.Together they create "Guardians of the Galaxy". Group of misfits, losers, and very unlikely heroes that are put in the position, were they have to extend themselves beyond what they normally are capable off.Most audiences as a rule often like to share their support with the underdog and trust me there are no bigger underdogs then this bunch and perhaps this is were the strength of the movie lies. We want them to succeed. Mostly they are motivated by pain and loss of a loved one. As an example Chris Pratt's character as a child looses mother to cancer and after being abducted from Earth by cosmic bounty hunters, his feelings intensifies of wanting to make something out of himself to become a legend, a self-proclaimed Star-Lord. Chris Pratt natural comedic taming and bravado fits perfectly with this character, who uses humor as a form of protection from dark thoughts which pollute his psyche. The balance between comedy and action is handled superbly by director James Gunn who is also co-writter of the script. Plenty of smart remarks made by characters create very enjoyable roller coaster of vocabulary choices which often bring loud laughter from the audience. My favorite was an exchange between Gamora and Peter Quill. Gamora: And by the way... Your ship is filthy. Peter Quill: Filthy? She has no idea. If we had a blacklight, it would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.The production design, but specially costume and make up design is so detailed and perfect in its construct, that all of the art design helps creating a Universe that we loose ourselves in, completely. It is truly Oscar worthy work, no doubt about it. The action scenes are breathtaking kinetically and auditory wise and I almost guaranty that you will want to see "Guardians of the Galaxy" again to make sure that you had an opportunity to catch all the details that often overwhelm our senses during the first viewing. There is so much to experience here.This film is a testament to how far the film industry has gone since the days of model building and rudimentary special FX that started with Fritz Lang's "Metropolis"(1927), long before "2001: Space Odyssey" (1968) and continued through "STAR WARS" franchise till this day. I take my hat off to the Hollywood filmmakers who created this arguably the most visually interesting movie of the decade and bunch of interesting and sometimes silly and other times cocky characters unseen on the Silver screen since the days of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. I loved "Guardians of the Galaxy" and I am pretty sure that you and your family will too. Go and check this one out, specially in 3D if you can.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an excellent movie- massive spoilers ahead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my personal review of Guardians of the Galaxy and it is a brilliant movie by doing this Marvel has expanded its universe. The first thing to note is that the introduction is very sad because peter's mother dies from cancer, he is then taken by aliens away from earth. The storyline picks up twenty six years later on a planet which contains the orb, this holds the purple infinity gem which in the comics controls space.Then it leads to all the main characters excluding Drax to a secure prison. All members including Drax escape from prison and go to sell the orb to the collector. However this turns out bad because Drax calls Ronan telling them the location because he wants to avenge the deaths of his family members. The story leads to Ronan having the infinity stone and the guardians of the galaxy need to save the day. This is part of Marvel's phase two movies but is helping to set the up phase three because it has characters such as Thonas which is apart of the storyline. My personal view is that this movie is very well directed and has a very good storyline James Gunn has done a brilliant job and should direct more movies. I would go as far as saying that this is better than the Avengers Assemble and that is quite something good job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fresh Feeling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel's latest entry into the MCU is what would appear from the overly explosive trailers to be a film given a sky-high budget to set off expensive fireworks for two hours and leave the story-line/character development at the door, raking in a shed-load of profit in the mean time to fill in for the Avengers. Certain assumed knowledge such as this gives audience members a particular mindset as to what to expect, forces them to buy more popcorn to help them through it but ultimately leaves them pleasantly surprised when that once-in-a-blue-moon blockbuster takes a turn for the better.GOTG is one of those blockbusters, and while there are explosions galore, this thankfully proves to be one of the film's assets rather than a downfall. The main factor that separates it from other Marvel films is that it could easily be viewed as a comedy as well as a sci-fi action drama or even part-thriller; with both visual and verbal gags running constantly throughout, a feel-good soundtrack blasts viewers back to the 80s in a ballsy picture that isn't afraid to not take itself too seriously.With that said, the movie's greatest strength also proved a major weakness with the dialogue, although hilarious at times, turning cringe- worthy and often boring when time had to be taken out to explain what was actually going on (since the whipper-snapper one-liners didn't quite milk it). It didn't help either when certain scenes were 'rescued' by overly-extensive action sequences that seemed to drag on, often making the film appear rather desperate to make it through the 2-hour run time.All in all however, GOTG was a welcome relief from the same-old superhero movies Marvel seems to be churning out quarterly. Breaking new grounds in the field of comedy (and with pretty decent characters to portray it), it left us Hooked on a Feeling for number 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Friday I saw Guardians of the Galaxy... and it was amazing. The summer blockbuster was worth the wait. With a great blend of action, adventure,comedy,and graphics that made this movie one of the best Marvel movies ever.This cast was amazing and the direction was on par, James Gunn did a great job with his cast. Star Lord was hilarious to his 80's nostalgia to his great fight scenes.He reminds me of a funny Han Solo. Rocket and Groot were funny and action packed in one. Even David Batista as Drax did a good job, Drax took ever thing literally. All the Guardians were a good cast and team for the movie. I still have a big problem with the villain, even though it was play by Lee Pace, Ronan need more action. Other than that the Guardians of the Galaxy was great. This is Marvels best work and I give it a 9/10 Allen Sowersby (Guardian of the Galaxy 9/10)</fullReview>

It was not your normal marvel movie this one was funny. This movie is good for anyone who likes marvel movie, but it maybe scary for a little kid. The kids will love Groot he is funny. This is a movie that if you like to take your family out to the movies then this is the movie you should take them to. It is just not a funny movie it is one of the scariest marvel movies I have seen so far this year. Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the wildest movies you will ever see it is not like other movies it is different in so many ways.

		<fullReview>A boy is abducted and as an adult is required to work with a group of criminals to stop a fanatical warrior from taking control of the universe.Opening with a grim death scene on earth the film moves across the galaxy to hi-jinx chases and showdowns. James Gunn offers solid entertainment that links to the current Marvel film universe (one of the infinity stones appear). Although very CGI heavy (which will date quickly) it is compensated its likable characters, humour and fast pace action. Tonally its mash up of Star Wars, Thor and Iron Man 1-3 to name a few.The lead cast are on fine form, there's cheek Chris Pratt but more notable are Zoe Saldana and Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket. Vin Diesel given his not existent lines seems a waste however the Groot as character and his interactions are great. The characters (created by Andy Lanning and Dan Abnett) are not a stereotype as most films of the genre and there are a few memorable setups. It's pure pop corn comic fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel movie to date. This is a MUST-SEE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like Marvel has a formula in motion that combines critically acclaimed performances and effects with box office success, which is a rare feat these days. Then along comes a movie based on the Marvel Comics called 'Guardians of the Galaxy', which I'm sure most of you never read or heard of before this movie started being made. Marvel Studios decided to go a different route with this film and gamble on the "not-so-big-names" and a different kind of script and story than it's previous flicks. Not since 'The Avengers' has there been this amount of visual effects or a big super-hero team like this one, and Marvel is betting big that it makes 'Avengers' type money in the long run. And I'm here to say that 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is my favorite Marvel movie to date, and I'm betting it will make the big box office splash that Hollywood so desperately needs this summer. Yes, it really is that good.If you are unfamiliar with the story of 'Guardians of the Galaxy', they were first introduced back in 1969 in Marvel Comics, but it was a different team than you see on screen and in comics today. No, not until 2008, did the new team appear in comics, which is what this new film is based on and writer/director James Gunn knocked it out of the ballpark. Gunn got his start with the infamous movie group 'Troma', but then went on to write a great superhero indie film called 'The Specials' (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), then went on to write the remake of 'Dawn of the Dead' in 2004, followed by directing 'Slither', 'Super', 'PG Porn', and now 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. Needless to say, it's an odd choice by Marvel, but none-the-less the perfect choice.'Guardians of the Galaxy' is about a rag-tag group of people (some aliens from other planets and one human), who decide to team up and fight evil across the galaxy. The team is lead by a human named Peter Quill who calls himself Star Lord (Chris Pratt), who spends his time working for an intergalactic thief Yondu (Michael Rooker), stealing objects of great value from different planets and selling them for a hearty bounty. Little does he know that one of the objects in his possession is sought after by the evil Thanos (Josh Brolin) and Ronan (Lee Pace), who plan on using the object to kill off entire planets. When a beautiful alien named Gamora (Zoe Saldana) tries to take the stolen object from Quill, they run into Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel), a raccoon that has been modified to walk, talk, shoot guns, and has a pension of danger, and a magical tree that can grow to any size and be a huge asset in a fight.The four of them are arrested and taken to prison where the meet Drax The Destoryer (WWE's Dave Bautista), where he informs them that he is after Ronan for killing his family. The five new "friends" all seem to have the same goal in common and escape prison to head out to stop Ronan, while figuring out that by sticking together, they can fight evil and save innocent lives. Gunn's script is truly satisfying, as he has enough time to dive into each character's psyche and make them vulnerable. This makes us take the journey and care about each character throughout. His unique humor in the script has perfect timing and is very different and more adult for a Marvel movie, which should satisfy a lot of people. Look out for the Jackson Pollock joke.And the visual effects are stunning. From the huge spaceship battles on different planets to the excellent practical makeup effects on the aliens, they all look flawless. Rocket the Raccoon and Groot look amazing and fluid and make Gollum from 'Lord of the Rings' look like chicken scratch. James Gunn did not disappoint with a $170 million dollar budget film. Chris Pratt just owns this film too and is the next big action star. His sincerity and humor are solid gold and you root for him every step of the way. You believe he is just a regular fun guy, but when he has to fight, you believe that he can indeed kick some serious ass. Zoe Saldana does and impressive job here too, as she always does. Dave Bautista does a magnificent job as the hulk of a species who is hell bent on revenge and takes everything literally, which plays to great comic effect through his delivery. Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel's voice work is amazing as Rocket and Groot with Lee Pace coming in nicely as the villain.Cameos from John C. Reilly, Djimon Hounsou, Glenn Close, and Benicio Del Toro are all excellent and am sure will have bigger parts in the next films. During the Benicio Del Toro scene, keep a look out for other heroes. Tyler Bates's score and the abundance of 80s and 90s rock music is superb here and might be the best soundtrack I have heard from a movie in a long time. You'll find yourself singing and swaying in your movie seats, and to end the film with a Jackson Five song is pure brilliance. Again, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is my favorite and dare I say it, Best Marvel movie to date. This is a MUST-SEE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best Marvel film ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-man 2 and Spider-man. Those were the only two Marvel films I thoroughly enjoyed and recommended to people both friend a foe. I now have my third and by extension top three with Guardians of the Galaxy taking the top spot. It is unlike anything I've seen from Marvel and to be honest, this 'test film' has been their most successful critically. I remember seeing the poster for it, a raccoon and a tree didn't really generate a positive reaction from me and shamefully, I waved it off. Five recommendations from my top film-going friends and i decided to watch it. I was in absolute awe when I watched it. First of all, in the opening scene with Quill and his mother I witnessed (finally) some real personal emotion and aspects where I could possibly relate to since Spider-man. Since Spider-man its been loss from gain i.e Iron Man - he gained so much and lost it, only to come back enlightened etc. However, in Spider-man and Guardians of the Galaxy the gain is from the loss, Peter Parker losing his uncle Ben spurred him on eventually to be a hero and Peter Quill losing his mother created the gain of going into space and also eventually becoming a hero. Something I also enjoyed about the film was its humour, yes at times it seemed a bit childish, but Chris Pratt seemingly convinces you that it's still funny no matter what age you are. Each character brought individual elements of humour to the film and it was incredible. I feel this was put in place for the next Avenger's film: 'Avengers: The Infinity Wars (Part 1 or 2)'. Their creation was to add some humour and more likely, some understanding as to how to defeat the super villain threatening the galaxy (probably Thanos). All in all I thought that Guardians of the Galaxy was absolutely incredible. My favourite Marvel film. One of my favourite superhero films. One of my all time favourite films. I can't wait for the Guardians next adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How does Marvel keep doing this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 'this' I mean taking Marvel properties that aren't mainstream even by comic book standards and turning them into massively successful films. As part of Marvel Studios boss, Kevin Feige's Marvel Cinematic Universe master-plan they've taken characters like Thor and made them work successfully on the big screen and have recently done it again with a man who shrinks to the size of an ant. Such bold adaptations should never have worked but credit to Marvel they've nailed it several times now. Few would argue that of Marvel's lesser properties that have been added to the MCU mixing pot, Guardians of the Galaxy is by far the most surprisingly successful adaptation. One of Marvel's more 'out there' (literally) properties, GotG was a big gamble and the lion's share of credit must go to director James Gunn who made the film very much his own. Colourful, subversively funny and achingly cool in equal measure, GotG blew cinema goers away with its infectious feel-good factor and brilliantly realised team of disparate losers. The script is the first and arguably most important thing that they got right. The consistently sharp and witty dialogue keeps your attention throughout and none of the main cast feel superficial or poorly written. Chris Pratt almost steals the show with his portrayal of Star Lord and walks a fine line between making the character his own and falling into shameless Han Solo parody. Even the non-human CGI characters like Rocket and Groot are given a satisfying depth and what makes everything gel is the emotional heft that pervades throughout, be it Star Lord's grief over the loss of his mother or Rocket lamenting his tortured creation. Even wrestler Dave Bautista delivers as the dryly serious Drax who takes every verbal witticism by its literal meaning providing many of the film's funniest moments. Yes, main villain Ronan the Accuser is somewhat thinly written with an almost generic genocidal drive to wipe out his people, The Kree's enemies but Lee Pace makes up for it somewhat with a commanding physical screen presence. Karen Gillian's strangely sexy, chameleon-like turn as Nebula is far stronger. Watch her express just enough mournful regret in her expression after seemingly killing her adopted sister Gamora to give the scene an added emotional layer. It's a beautiful moment in a film packed full of them. Indeed what Guardians does well is take time for those little moments of awe inspiring beauty like Groot's light spores and his moving "WE are Groot" heroic sacrifice. No review of Guardians would be complete without mention of the astonishing soundtrack. The song choices are both fitting and relevant to Quill and are actually being heard by our characters as the scenes play. This helps pull us into Guardians trippy space opera and coupled with a rousing musical score Guardians is a treat on the ears as well as the eyes. From the surprisingly emotional 1988 set prologue to the über cool opening through to the musical montage ending the film whips along at a satisfying pace and not a scene or line of dialogue is wasted. The action is stunningly well executed and avoids the confusing Transformers-esque level of incoherent mayhem that pollute many modern summer blockbusters. So 10/10, really? Well having watched it several times now I can't see where it puts a foot majorly wrong. It accomplishes all it sets out to do and more. It has enough depth to make repeat viewings rewarding and offers sufficient, technically flawless eye candy to never get boring. Indeed all of the $170 million budget is up there on screen plain to see and in terms of quality it's a film more than worthy of its financial success. And all this from a film that the majority of Marvel fans never really wanted or expected in the first place. Going back to both the soundtrack and the film's pervading feel good factor, it's these two things working in tandem that are arguably the most memorable aspect of Guardians. A great meal is only as good as the last mouthful and by the end of Guardians' veritable feast you've been thoroughly entertained and emotionally satisfied and what else can you ask of a space-themed Summer sci-fi blockbuster? The wait for their return to the big screen won't be an easy one and that's credit to what an amazing achievement James Gunn has made. He took what could've been seen as a Star Wars rip-off featuring a talking racoon, a man-tree and Han Solo and Malcolm Reynolds' love-child and somehow made it all work. Yeah, that gets a 10 in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy was so much more than a let-down, it's downright shameful. I did not like this film.Usually, within the crowd of praise that Superhero films get, there's one or two negative reviews calling them "uninspired" and "just capitalizing on the success of other films." I never had agreed with these statements, having LOVED The Dark Knight trilogy, The Avengers, and even Captain America.However, I now see where these few and far between reviewers are coming from on this film. It's horrible. The only good things it's got going for it are it's post intro scene, and the soundtrack! The actual opening is boring and stupid, the pacing is slow and uninteresting, and the ending isn't engaging. The film doesn't make me care about the characters, and thus, I would have rather seen them all end up dead! I know what I'm not going to do - watch this film, or it's sequel, ever again! Guardians of the Galaxy is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, period.</fullReview>

This was a cliché on top of a cliché parading on a freaking mountain of clichés.If anyone would be kind enough to explain what makes this an 8/10 I would be happy, it wasn't even THAT entertaining if we only take into account the enjoyment factor alone. One note characters with no chemistry or interesting group dynamics, flat and boring interactions combined with a dialog filled with one liners that weren't even funny. Cartoonish villains and all too generic and familiar plot,like in any other superhero movie ever, made this sh*t as predictable as it could be. Hell even the action and the overall execution of the storyline was textbook presentation.How did this bland,unoriginal,uncreative,uninspiring and too formulaic cash grabber managed to get in the 250 best movies ever? 8.1? 6/10 would be fairer and closer to the truth as the action might pass as entertainment. Personally for me it's a 4/10,I was actually bored by it as I expected something amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horribly Overrated and Unoriginal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a while since I've seen a Marvel movie that I genuinely liked, and Guardians of the Galaxy is no exception. From the moment it came out to now even, when its been out for a while, its held nothing but good reviews and ratings. I watched the movie with high hopes, but those hopes were completely shattered several times over by the end. The movie is extremely formulaic. Its the usual Hollywood set-up. There are good formula movies, but this one isn't one of those. Throughout the movie I could imagine the writers holding a checklist of typical events for a movie and checking them off as the scenes played out. The plot of the movie is cliché and unoriginal. Find something, oh no its dangerous, get rid of it. But wait! Our antagonist wants it, oh no! Speaking of the antagonist, he's the stupidest thing in the world. Of all the clichés in this movie, he's probably the most cliché. His character design is stupid, his objective is as unoriginal as the rest of the movie, and his character is underdeveloped. Speaking of character development, these ones have as much character as an peanut. I genuinely didn't care about what happened to them. As someone who believes that character development is extremely important to every story, this was immensely disappointing. If I don't care about the characters, why would I care how the story drives them forward? I felt like their relationships were extremely rushed. At first they all hated each other, then all of a sudden randomly they're best friends. Where that came from I have no idea, but that ruined it for me if it wasn't already ruined. The character designs are pretty dumb as well. "Just paint their skin a different color and BOOM!, entirely different species!" is probably what the character designers said when designing all the 'different' species. These 'aliens' are even less inspired than Star Wars VI's DJ blue elephant. At least that thing didn't resemble a human so stinking closely. Seriously guys, put some effort into this. On top of all that the characters are a copy-paste of the Avengers, except now they're in space. I understand that in the comic books that they were sometimes referred to a the Space Avengers, but then that's the Marvel comic books' fault. Its no excuse to be lazy with the characters. Step up your game Marvel. What did this movie do well though? It was genuinely funny. I found myself laughing a several various points throughout the film, mostly at the character Rocket. The only thing that eased the pain of watching this movie were the jokes. Copious amounts of CGI and flashy fights aren't enough to warrant a good rating, at least not in my eyes. I heard someone once say that this was the best movie of the decade, and that made me feel like eating his face off. Overall this movie did almost everything wrong. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Although with the very high ratings and high praise you'd probably still adore this movie and wonder why I didn't like it. But I hated it. This movie has destroyed any faith I had left for Marvel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awesome, the best movie ever... If you haven't seen it yet you are missing out. The whole layout and the end scene is the best. Good choice of songs used throughout, and the whole plot of it is just amazing. I was really sceptical about it when I saw t in cinemas think it was going to be a movie like the avengers, but even though they are both created by marvel and is both a " superhero gang" it is very different from the avengers. There is some use of language but it is not over used and being a 12 you can expect that. The character have their own back story and it is very well used in the plot. The whole story is explained well and how they came together is also explained well. It is a movie that I would definitely recommended to anyone. Dancing Groot is definitely something you need to look out for,mo believe it is one of the best parts of the movie. The songs are like retro 60s music, but are songs that everyone has heard of, you will be singing the song for 10 days straight. Really funny and an overall great movie. Definitely recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lesson Learned.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. It has a certain lesson through out the whole movie. It teaches us how we should all work together, no matter how much we may hate, and or dislike the person we are forced to work with. It also teaches us that we should never judge a book by its cover. Because sometimes you never know what someones past is like until you ask them and learn more about their past, and learn more about them as a person. Also, I think that this movie has excellent graphics, a wonderful story line, and I just love how adventurous it is. I think that this movie is a wonderful movie to watch with your family, VERY children friendly. If I had children, I'd make them watch this movie because they would learn a lesson from it, the lesson I stated above. I rate this movie a solid 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie WAS entertaining, I'll give it that. But it proves Hollywood is at a new low. Every single thing nowadays is either a sequel, superhero, a remake, or a rip off. Guardians of the Galaxy just supports this fact. Marvel uses their least selling comic book in a cash grab so appreciated it makes my head spin. Filled with lines so cheesy you need crackers, this movie is stealing your wallets one by one. James Gunn also should be mentioned. He attempts to help this cash grab by filling it with references to better movies. Half the people who've seen this only like it because of the soundtrack. I just wish people could see this is nothing new, it steals from the cult classic , short lived television series "Firefly". In conclusion, try not to pay too much to see this movie, you're only supporting them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was thoroughly looking forward to seeing this one by the good reviews I had heard, but in the end, it ended up being like all of the other action films out there. Boring and lacking. I couldn't believe this film had a 170 million dollar budget. I would have thought about a 10 million dollar budget by the looks of the movie. Vin Diesel probably only had to spend about 2 hours in the studio for his part. Easiest 100 grand he probably ever made. The writing was bad, the direction was bad, in part, a lot of the acting was bad because of the bad writing and direction. I like Chris Pratt, I think he's a great actor, but he wasn't so great in this one. I was very impressed by the voice over done by Bradley Cooper, it sounded nothing like him, and it was an impressive voice he did for that character. Honestly, the character that stole the show, and the reason I'm even giving this ridiculous film a 5 is because of Dave Bautista's performance. He was hilarious as his character, and he's the only reason one should see this film. He creates a character that steals every scene he is in, and he's the only one that actually creates a likable character. Yet, he's the only one who had some good lines too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A step down for Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' has everything one might expect from a MCU (Marvel's Cinematic Universe) film - a bunch of superheroes fighting iconic villains, special effects explosion in the climax, an after credit scene and some other scenes here and there to show linkage between films in the franchise. This one also has nice warmth and has its heart at its right place unlike the more dark 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' but it fails to reach its levels in terms of direction and execution. I just felt like this film was trying to be too simple not quite taking it self seriously which some people may like but the script is neither innovative nor interesting.Chris Pratt plays "Peter Quill"(aka Star-Lord) who is kind of professional thief. But when he steals an orb which we all later find out is much more than a normal orb all kinds of troubles step- in. On his adventures he is accompanied by Gamora(Zoe Saldana),Drax the Destroyer(Dave Batista) and two most-interesting characters; one called Rocket Raccoon (voiced-Bradley Cooper) who is genetically modified talking raccoon and another called Groot(voiced-Vin Diesel) a mysterious humanoid tree. Both groot and rocket are best friends and partners in bounty hunting, their pair is the best thing in the whole movie. Things get dangerous when our villain some Kree warrior Ronan pops up looking for the Orb and he is the weakest point of the movie. Ronan plans to destroy a planet Xandar and many other planets later using the orb in vengeance of death of as he says "my father and his father before that". Ronan just keeps repeating those lines whenever he is supposed to look dreadful which I just couldn't bear. His character was poorly developed which was setback for the whole film.Even though I was overall not happy and disappointed(as I high expectation looking at the reviews) still it has quite many positives going in favor. Special Effects, CGI wise very good but which film in these days doesn't satisfy that? Chris Pratt was quite cool as Star-Lord and his nostalgia for 80s music and dance was also pretty enjoyable. Gamora and Drax seemed a little bit odd but the make-up and styling for them was pretty good. Groot whose vocabulary is limited to "I am Groot" is lovable but its the Raccoon who steals the show with his witty and funny dialogues. Comedy wise the movie has lot to offer, I was laughing hard quite a lot many times thanks to rocket,groot,even the others sometime.The music and score was good. But all this was entangled in a weak plot and the story which follows. We have the same story where our heroes need to protect some dangerous item from falling into wrong hand,the bad guys then find it and just before use it for destruction they are stopped in a action-packed climax. I know most of marvel movies follow similar path but there is something new here and there but here I felt this was the weakest film of Phase 2.Another thing is the movie is being popularized by many as best sci- fi movie of all time and all. It was just a good action- adventure- comedy and the sci-fi elements in the film weren't properly developed thus I feel it barely falls into sci-fi genre. Many might enjoy it a lot, yes its nice popcorn flick it sit around and watch with friends or kids. For me, it was just one-time watch and slight disappointment looking at the hype of the movie. Still I would give it 6/10 (instead of 5/10) thanks Mr.Raccoon in there, he was one best characters I have seen this year.RATING:[3/5]</fullReview>

The storyline and dialogue are painfully predictable and seem forced. It's not original at all.The "bad guys" are so overly evil it's ridiculous. The intended humor didn't come across and the only times I laughed were when the situation was unintentionally funny.Acting was not great either, I was especially disappointed with Karen Gillan who I loved on Doctor Who but failed to convince as Nebula.I did like the CGI stuff, especially Groot. The music was beautifully chosen and the only thing that made an impression.It's not the worst sci-fi film I've seen but definitely doesn't live up to the hype.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this is a pleasant surprise - it's an excellent action comedy and I enjoyed it. Big as it is it may even be the Star Wars of the current cgi gamer generation, only shame that all the characters and maybe the stories were variously imagined decades ago in prehistory. Not forgetting the music; going by the sound quality I only wish my audio cassettes could have stood the test of time so well with such perfect stereo separation and stability after 26 years of constant playing.It starts by a deathbed on Earth in 1988 and swiftly moves onto somewhere else bleak and grimy in the Universe 26 years later. A disparate group of five weird criminals is forced together for their common good under the leadership of Star Lord in defeating a weird baddie Ronan (the barbarian) who will destroy the Universe if he's gets the chance with his new shiny toy, the Infinity Stone. It has been explained to me by a knowledgeable friend that it's supposed to be far more complicated than that and that all manner of gemstones are or will be involved next time. As well as mayhem. Amidst all the cgi cartoon conflagrations there's a generally delightful repartee between all of the main characters, most times hitting the mark but occasionally missing. It's all taken at such a (literally) breakneck speed that it's not surprising though. The proto-Guardians are Star Lord who is reliving Han Solo except that he likes '70's pop songs far more and even enough to die for, Gamora is playing a green Rihanna for the kids, Rocket Racoon is without Gideon's Bible, Drax is built like a power station, and Groot is most definitely playing himself! Or, at least I think he is, as I've never read any of stories or even know or want to know 1% of the tortuous histories. However, no matter how interesting or amusing it gets the indifferent approach to a gruesome and colossal loss of life is always annoying to me ? I mean, no one ever had to die horribly in Popeye cartoons and it still does nothing for me to see how many ingenious ways of painful annihilation can be sadistically portrayed by cgi. And must a family fun fantasy film have to open with emotionally fraught scenes of a boys' mother dying of cancer simply to provide the raison d'etre for a Walkman plot device? But as an even better old song goes I Guess I Just Wasn't Made For These Times. Although overall it's not too bad - I did laugh at Groot's violent method of despatching swathes of surprised baddies with a sweep of his arm, and his silly wooden look back over his shoulder afterwards. I wonder if Van Halen's Dance The Night Away was on director Gunn's hit list of olde tunes ? it was used very effectively in Mission To Mars but no one watching this would've remembered that very old film.With reservations it's the best Marvel Disney I've seen to date. Two hours whizzed by watching this colourful well-made hokum and I didn't reach for the internet once, always good yardsticks, so exceptional stuff for the kids, pretty good nonsense for us oldies too. My bottom-line advice is to watch it simply because there's a whole new complex franchise looming out there: one day every other film made anywhere will be of Marvel's Universe so better try to get up to speed as soon as you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over substance - space edition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right after his mother dies of cancer, a little boy is abducted by an alien spacecraft. And so begins the story of Peter Quill, or Star-Lord, who will travel to unimaginable places, will find the most unlikely friends in the most unlikely situations and will save the galaxy from the ruthless space maniac along the way.The humankind has always had a soft spot for the adventure movies. The far-and-away lands, hidden treasures, exotic beauties, deadly perils and of course the fearless heroes - what could be more fun to watch on screen? Add "space" to it - with multiple planets, crazy spaceships, bizarre alien creatures and literally limitless freedom - and the audience will simply be lying in orgasmic convulsions asking for more. It's actually funny that two of the most iconic and cult adventure franchises of the last 40 years, Indiana Jones and Star Wars, are created by the same person, and that Indy and his space cowboy twin brother Han Solo are portrayed by the same person. Now that duo probably knows everything that there is to know about the genre.Guardians of the Galaxy is probably the first movie i've seen that delivers that feeling of a space rodeo, something we first experienced thanks to the original Star Wars trilogy. And that really is something to value if you are into this sort of things. The locations, characters and names change with a speed of antelope stampede, plot twists and turns like a giant python around its victim, and the only good thing you can do to yourself is to stop trying to rationalize what you see and just enjoy the show. Pew-pew, ka-boom, yeehaw!Unfortunately, if you are older than 10 years, don't have ADHD or just have a brain that's not easily switched off, you'll notice, to some degree of regret, that the abundance of style this movie boasts covers a serious shortage of an actual substance. The whole idea of a mighty artifact being sought after by some of the baddest and meanest of the guys in the galaxy, only to be found by a small-time treasure hunter who doesn't even know what it is, just makes no sense. Exactly like the motives of the other characters, who switch from "shoot first, ask questions later" to "best buddies ever" in a split-second. The biggest and the most plot-important things happen mostly due to luck, stupidity, recklessness or a combination of those, as if you're simply not allowed to think straight in this world. For instance, two planets just signed an important peace treaty - but their leaders clearly don't give a damn about being friendly and respectful to each other, as if they are old buddies who can f**k with each other verbally with no consequence. And one of those leaders is an evil woman from 101 Dalmatians. Yeah, sure, give me a break.Treating GotG seriously would only inflict brain damage on you, so i can hardly analyze this movie as a whole. Probably, it doesn't even want to be treated that way. Instead of trying to give a solid impression, it breaks itself into a multitude of small episodes where the little things like a dude dancing around an abandoned planet listening to a cassette player and kicking alien lizards, a ship flying over some space station with the 80's pop hit playing on background, or a walking tree that probably escaped from the Lord of the Rings production pretending to be Eywa and launching some luminous spores, can do the trick.In these little moments and the crude but harmless banter that usually accompanies them lies the true power of this movie. The bad thing is that besides them, and some pretty decent CGI, GotG can hardly offer you anything else. The good thing is, it doesn't pretend to be anything more than it. So if this space adventure is your kind of game, do hop in!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally I saw Guardians of the Galaxy couple hours ago. Does it lived up to all the hype around? Hardly... But it brought something unexpected. What I didn't liked... 1. I am not familiar with graphic novel, so my expectations were based on last Marvel or DC hits. I was looking forward for another semi-dark adaptation with pretty deep character development. None of this was in here. 2. Obviously, the movie was orientated to younger crowd and family segment, I wasn't aware about. So you what you get in here is non-complex writing (I was 50/50 annoyed and amused by this through out the flick) and recently so liberal PG style bloodless violence. The movie felt to me as a mix between Star Wars franchise and Fantastic 4, with no potential to grow his own sequels (well if it will choose to grow with his audience, that could bring it to a new level). Visuals were top notch. Pacing was great. I won't be judging acting on this one. All in all great entertainment for any age, but most suitable for a family night out. I would rate it at 8.5 if I could, but no chance it could deserve 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This certainly looked like a different sort of superhero blockbuster. In that way, it's disappointing that it's really not that different from most of them. The performances are really fine, and Chris pratt makes for an instantly likable, instantly charming hero, one that doesn't try too hard or even at all to make us like him, and yet he does. That all really lies on Pratt. Saldana is strong, as she always is in these sort of roles (first blue, now green, we can just wait for her to portray a red and yellow character). So yeah, ultimately not as memorable or as great as I wanted, but still really good, fine work. Also, Bradley Cooper is a joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, I have nothing bad to say about the movie. The cast was amazing, the plot was awesome- even the little jokes and back stories were epic. The effects were, as in any Marvel movie, great. The fact that they used old classic rock songs as the soundtrack makes me love it even more. Chris Pratt is perfect for the role of Star Lord, even though I would have liked seeing Jenses Ackles. Really love Karen in the movie as well, and Lee- they were all perfect for their roles. Would have liked seeing more of Thanos, though. All in all, it was money well spent seeing the movie. Just sad that the ship didn't sail...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and extremely overrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other day I went to the cinema extremely excited for this film. I've always been the super-hero-comic fan; I love watching Batman, Spiderman and the X-Men, so you can understand that I went to see this film with a positive attitude. Having said that, not only did it not live up to my high expectations, but it achieved to bore me to the point I wanted to leave the cinema while constantly checking my clock to see how much time was left for this complete and utter crap of cinematography! The plot was cheap, if you do insist that it had one, because really it didn't, and if you at least tried to follow the nonexistent story, you just couldn't! It tried way too hard to be touching and it tried even harder to be funny. The "bad guys" were laughable and the "good ones" were annoying! And how come it has a rating of 8.6, is beyond me! If I wanted to be polite I would say it is average, dull, ridiculous and way too overrated, but I want to be honest so I'll just say, that it is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time! Cheap action, cheesy to the core and lame as it can get. A complete waste of time and so very disappointing if you are a Marvel fan like myself. Save yourself if you like decent films with a storyline and watch something that isn't so ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It won't blow you away, but Guardians was a great time at the movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a pleasant surprise and I actually enjoyed this quite a bit (a lot more than I expected). After not being particularly intrigued by the trailer, I decided to see it after the warm reception it's received. This ensemble cast of misfits actually works fairly well together and Chris Pratt (Parks and Recreation, The Lego Movie) is perfectly cast as Star-Lord, the reluctant and awkwardly funny hero.It follows the usual Marvel summer formula to a T: The plot is fairly straight forward (if not predictable), there's eye popping special effects, futuristic outer space battle sequences (the 3D version is actually worth seeing as it was well done) and of course, it wraps up neatly to set up the sequel. But I think what sets this apart is that there was *plenty of humour* (I found myself laughing quite a bit) as the dialogue is really cleverly written and loaded with well placed 80s pop culture references. I also really enjoyed the CGI characters Grott and Rocket (voiced by Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper respectively) as they were memorable, unique and at times, even endearing.I will say I wasn't blown away however and the plot didn't quite all make sense at some points. It doesn't reach the climactic heights of X- Men: Days of Future Past nor does it have the emotional impact of Dawn of The Planet of The Apes (the best film of the year). But it excels at what it was intended to be: a very entertaining, fun Marvel action film that doesn't take itself too seriously. I've seen enough to be interested in this series going forward and I did not expect that, so kudos to the director James Gunn. I think another part of it's appeal is that it provides one last fun summer blockbuster in a time of the season that's usually barren for enjoyable movies. So I say go in with reasonable expectations and you'll enjoy this end of summer treat!If you enjoyed my review, let's keep in touch!

		<shortDescription>A little too chaotic for its own good, but thoroughly charming.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you weren't sure by now, Marvel pretty much rule the roost of Hollywood and will most likely continue to do so for a little while longer. Their popularity is on a Spielbergian level of absurd. They're developing movies for kids that haven't even been born yet. Talk about a captive audience. I'm pretty mild on Marvel. While The Avengers was a jolly good (if throwaway) time, their movies aren't always as satisfying. Outside of the first Iron Man film, there's little else that sufficiently ticks enough boxes. Even at their most acclaimed with this year's Captain America followup The Winter Soldier it didn't break their mould of bad habits with misjudged melodrama, clunky humour, contrivances and dull villains. Now comes the seed of a new franchise, one admittedly more risky than the others that had brand awareness even for those who never read comic books. Maybe it works better because Guardians of the Galaxy is closest to J.J. Abrams' Star Trek than Thor, and not just because of Zoe Saldana.It is quite nice to see a film go old school with its effects. Yes, there are CGI backgrounds and CGI characters littered everywhere, but the majority of Guardians' production are real sets and real people under heavy makeup. I can see that being the charm for many people regarding this film, one that's only on Earth for a 5 minute prologue. Personally, and this goes for Star Wars and so on, I struggle to get lost in suspension of belief that everything resembles Earth and humans, it just seems overly limited to me. It's a minor distraction that just holds me back from sci-fi, even if it's as silly and camp as this. It's a real shame that Guardians is by the tales of MacGuffin city with a meaningless dry plot that propels characters into who cares and why not. If only it could've been sprinkled with a touch more its charm so this plot could've been secondary because, and everyone knows, the film is at its best when it showcases its sense of humour and camaraderie. You can tell the actors and director James Gunn, whose roots are in oddball comedies, just love riffing off each other, subverting odd clichés they're bored of conforming to.Outside of the irresistibly charming Starlord, played by rising star Chris Pratt who's found the uncanny ability to ground any movie no matter where it's set, be it the galaxy, the not-too- distance future or Legoland, I was pleasantly surprised as to which characters stuck out for me. Drax and Gamora, with their brute but sensitive personalities are much more interesting than the destined to be fan favourites CGI stars Rocket and Groot, who pander to the audience more than anything, leaving gaps for laughter like it's a sitcom. However, their losses and backstories are quite touching at times, but it's difficult to not feel like their forged friendships are forced by the obligation to have them antagonise each other then bond over common goals. It's not very convincing but they just want to slink into it regardless. Guardians can be an entertaining film and it's more or less as good as a Marvel movie can be with all its inevitable fill-in-the- blanks tedium and tonal imbalance to try to please all, but it's simply too chaotic and overzealous for its own good. I'm going to say I'm bowing out of Marvel now but I said that for the last two movies. At least its soundtrack will introduce a lot of young fans to great music.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel Studios reach a new level in superhero adventure movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The super awesome Star-Lord, sexy assassin Gamora, Drax The Destroyer, Groot the living tree and Rocket, the most badass Racoon in the universe are The Guardians of the Galaxy, a superhero team of space outlaws joining forces against an interplanetary terrorist and his attempt to destroy the entire world of Xandar using an ancient powerful gem.For casual movie goers, is a fantastic ride and a visual spectacle at the level of Avatar and a funny story with a lot of heart like Back to the Future. This movie is beautiful piece of Sci-Fi cinema. More hardcore sci-fi fans, will appreciate the tribute to classics like Star Wars and Star Trek, while comic book readers will love the constant Marvel Universe references, cameos and easter eggs, just the Collector's place is full of surprises.SFX are mind blowing, since the most likable characters are a 7ft. tree like creature and a talking Racoon. Other creatures, space ships, weapons and scenarios are outstanding examples of computer generated imagery. But not everything is digital, the Star-Lord's ship interiors, costumes and makeup are impressive as well, making this side of the galaxy a very real and believable place.The main cast is great, Chris Pratt made a fantastic Flash Gordon / Han Solo / Captain Kirk kind of guy, sci-fi veteran Zoe Saldana is perfect as the dangerous Gamora, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel do a wonderful job with his voices giving life to Groot and Rocket, but the most pleasant surprise is definitely Dave Bautista, his performance as the revenge driven maniac, Drax A.K.A. the destroyer, a big dangerous killer who is also a loyal friend and a very sweet guy. The villains are terrifying, mostly Drew Pace as Ronan The Acusser, a genocidal fanatic and Karen Gillan as Gamora's evil sister, the unstoppable Nebula. The supporting cast includes the guarantied talent of Glenn Close, Benicio Del Toro, John C. Reilly and Michael Rooker.The biggest effort of director James Gunn is a very exciting cosmic adventure and a solid action comedy, Guardians of the Galaxy is certified fun and a strong addition to Marvel catalog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failed to meet expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to criticize such an apparently loved film, but Guardians of the Galaxy failed to be the film it had the potential to become. For starters, the writing was a bit weak with a plot quite similar to that of The Avengers and therefore many parts of the story were way too familiar. The dialogue was a bit childish as well, and none of the jokes were really that clever. In fact, very rarely did anyone laugh in the theater while watching the movie. One of the weakest parts of the movie was the fact that many of the emotional attachments and bonds were not nearly developed enough; for example, the relationship between Peter Quill and his mother, Rocket and his friendship with Groot, the love connection between Peter Quill and Gamora, and some others. In addition, the characters themselves felt a bit underdeveloped. And finally, for a Marvel movie, none of the action sequences were particularly stunning. They felt for me a bit slow-paced and unexciting. Still, some strengths the movie had were great visuals, nice costumes, and a good variety of personalities. But in summary, this movie failed to justify all the hype that has formed for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i believe that everyone is entitled to their opinion when it comes to movies. after all movies are art and art is by its very nature subjective. but...if you didn't like this movie, your dead inside. this is by far my favorite Marvel movie to date, besides maybe Avengers. i'm not saying its better, i just happen to like it more then the other Marvel movies. it was funny, entertaining the visuals were stunning and the characters were extremely likable. if you have a chance to see it in 3D, do so. i am not a fan of 3D movies but this movies was made to be seen in 3D. the story revolves around 4 very different characters; starlord, a pirate/thief of sorts with a good heart but that ultimately has had only himself to look out for. Gamora, the green skinned assassin and daughter to the mad titan Thanos, whom she betrays; Drax the destroyer, a brute psychopath who wants revenge for the death of his wife and daughter in the hands of Ronan the Accuser; Rocket Raccoon, a psychopathic talking raccoon with sever anger issues and my favorite Groot, a giant tree who is Rockets bodyguard and companion who's entire vocabulary consists of "i...am....groot" in that order. together these 4 highly questionable and slightly disturbed individuals have to find a way to work together despite there differences in order to save the universe from a powerful,and i mean powerful , being known as Ronan the Accuser; a maniacal zealot who serves as judge, jury and specially executioner of whole planets and civilizations. throughout the story you are treated to the mythology and history of this new universe giving you glimpses of the mundane everyday "extraterrestrial" to the near god like celestial beings that exist or existed within the universe. in the end what gave this movie its charm was its humor, which i really enjoyed, i couldn't stop laughing throughout the entire movie...i literally smiled the whole way threw. this is good for the whole family despite the occasional curse word and sexual innuendo but besides that the movie was a very fun and delightful watch. highly recommend it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely a crowd pleaser. I saw the preview trailer and wasn't convinced that I wanted to see the movie but my kids dragged me along anyway, forcing me to sit through what turned out to be probably one of my favourite movies of all time. The perfect mix of action, comedy, drama and hint of romance saw me going back for a second time and even then it didn't get old. I wouldn't be surprised to see it turn into a cult flick in the future.Chris Pratt's performance was certainly one out of the bag and his charisma and ability to transform his loser character, Peter Quill, into a hero of the galaxy was entirely credible. Zoe Saldana (Gamora), true to her science fiction form of late, also showed a depth of character and emotion that gave a distinct sizzle to the chemistry between Gamora and Quill. Fellow guardians, Vin Diesel (Groot), Bradley Cooper (Rocket)and Dave Bautista (Drax) all showed great skill in their roles and were great additions to the movie. It was also a pleasant surprise to see Glenn Close in the movie.The special effects and plot were outstanding along with the performances of all the other cast members and I'm sure that nobody could fault the amazing '70's soundtrack, funny jokes and the pop culture references throughout the movie. What's great about the Marvel universe is that through watching all the movies, links start to build up between each film that really start your brain ticking over to figure out how each one fits into the jigsaw puzzle.Guardians is definitely worth a look especially if you've enjoyed the other Marvel installments and I, for one, loved it, even the second time around (hmm, thinking about the third time already :-) )! Only three more years to Guardians 2...oh, and don't forget to wait until the credits finish for another quick clip.</fullReview>

I watched this film in 3D which was tremendous and added a little bit of extra pizazz to the already polished look of the movie.The special effects are second to none as you would expect from any marvel movie and the cameos of actors in this is refreshing.I for one thoroughly enjoyed this sci-fi comedy and would recommend this to any fan of this genre.You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Entertainment!!! Typical Marvel..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, some of the lesser known heroes (and villains) of the marvel universe come together and the result is not all bad.It's an entertaining film. There is a lot of action and a lot happening in the film to keep you preoccupied and not focus on the larger scheme of things. It has many typical marvel characteristics like:1. The characters are simple. They are not introduced. They are just there.2. There is little or no character development. We are told that a certain character likes this or hates that without much reason or thought process3. Its fast paced. Leaving you occupied without focusing on the broader scheme of things and concentrated on the action at hand4. The characters are either good or evil (not otherwise)5. They hate each other in the beginning and combine together at the end (big surprise there..). They are selfish at first but a bigger cause unites them.6. They all are after a small tiny object which supposedly is key to unlimited power.The film is highly entertaining. The characters are funny. One liners are pulled off nicely. There are emotional moments. All in all, it felt like Avengers 2 with lesser known characters. And thats the good thing. Now, we have something other than watching the same old(ahem.. some young) marvel heroes and villains. But still, it feels commercial in making; designed to make money rather than appeal to the genuine movie-watching audience who feel the need to connect to a film before fully appreciating it. But its best for going with buddies on a Friday night. You will enjoy. You will have a sense of satisfaction and you will tell people about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a culture where the majority of films are nothing more than a cacophony of violent scenes riding on a loosely woven wanna-be story slapped together for the entertainment of adolescent hoodlums, Guardians of the Galaxy is a refreshing anomaly!The flick does have plenty of action, a film-industry stipend which neither I nor my family and friends are fond of, but the action scenes are bearable because there is sufficient plot to hold one's interest, and characters that are endearing ? even the cantankerous and wooden ones.Galaxy is visually enjoyable and the story is endearing right from the start. The cast is superb, especially the very charismatic main character, Peter Quill, played by Chris Pratt.What I like most of all is that this movie is FUNNY! A lot of movie reviews make claims about how funny the movie is, which invariably guarantees that you won't laugh at all. But this one does deliver some clever one-liners that I, and evidently the audience at large, found humorous.A couple of surprises at the end (I don't think these are spoilers because I don't give away any of the story): I saw some names in the credits, of known actors, that you would never have guessed were in the film . . also, stay in your seats through the credits. When I noticed that nobody got up out of their seats I decided to stay put too. I can't say the pay-off was worth it to me, but maybe it's worth it to you.There aren't half stars in the menu, or I would have given this an eight and a half instead of an eight. I can't give it a 9 or 10 because I reserve that for films such as epics, and my favorite favorites. Nevertheless, I can honestly say that this is one of the better ones to have come along in a while, and that I look forward to the next Guardians adventure!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe all of the hype. Marvel's newest blockbuster outing, Guardians of the Galaxy, delivers all that you should expect from it, which is a loud, flashy, explosive science fiction action movie with a wacky sense of screwball humor that anyone with a heart should be able to appreciate.After seeing James Gunn's darkly comedic superhero film Super, I had the bar set pretty high for Guardians of the Galaxy. Now that I've seen it I really have to commend Marvel for trusting the directors in whose hands they put these cherished stories. Nothing about this film suggests a compromised vision. It's as wacky as I expected from Gunn, and as visually tantalizing as I expected from Marvel Studios. It packs a sarcastic, crass, and explosive punch and I absolutely love that.Chris Pratt stars as Peter Quill, or Star-Lord as he would like to be known amongst his peers. Quill is an outlaw, a space cowboy, just looking to cause trouble and make money by stealing and selling galactic trinkets. But when he gets his hands on one of the coveted Infinity Stones, which I guess is becoming a major plot point for Marvel's universe, Quill gets caught up in far more trouble than he bargained for. He lands himself in prison, and then subsequently escapes with the help of a band of misfits that include talking trees and sassy raccoons. I say that in jest, but really this whole band of individuals are more than the caricatures you initially expect them to be. They're a rag-tag gang of characters who each have their own great nuances, allowing you to fall in love with all of them in a different way.Zoe Saldana plays Gamora, an orange haired, green skinned professional ass kicker who, even with that limey tint is still great to look at. Dave Bautista shines as Drax the Destroyer a menacing muscle head whose poor understanding of metaphors allows for some of Guardian's best laughs. Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel kill it in their own right as voice actors playing the parts of Rocket Raccoon and Groot, respectively. They are an unlikely duo whose on-screen loveability rivals that of duo's as classic as C-3PO and R2-D2. A bold claim, sure, but Groot is just too f***ing cool.By the 30 minute mark we've met all of these great characters, and in less time than that I could already tell how much I was going to love these goofballs. And love them I did. For two hours I was given a non- stop barrage of action, humor, and heart; none of which came without a side of cheese, but to any film of this magnitude that can have me in visual awe, have me laughing genuinely most of the way through, and also allow me to give a damn about these characters and their stories, I'll forgive some sappy eye rolling moments and some uninspired on the nose dialogue.I feel like Marvel gets a lot of backlash from the more- ahem- high brow crowd for being too silly or too cheesy or too light hearted. But to these naysayers I have to say get over yourselves. When your source material is the one introducing snappy talking raccoons and sentient trees with comically limited vocabulary, how can you possibly criticize this for being too silly? Wackiness is the heart and soul of these comics, and the film reflects that and lives up to that while having as much fun as possible. For me, the fun that must have been had creating this movie was translated and received by me with a wildly entertained heart. For others who think they are too good for the likes of Star-Lord and his team of weirdos, you're only missing out on all the fun I had with this wacky-ass space romp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all the hype, one is left out with disappointment. But here was the highlight of the movie for me: Half way through, I went out to get one corn salad with sweet corn dressing, tuna sandwich in baguette, a chocolate lazy cake and a non-alcoholic pineapple beer. The salad was good and the funny part was eating the sandwich then noticing that I dropped all of the tuna in the box. Beer was okay and so was the cake. Sadly I missed the Kevin Bacon joke reference (notice I didn't care about the movie).OK about the movie. Bad: I usually like to spot Stan Lee and try to find him. This time it was too soon and too easy. And the story was a typical good guy/bad guy thing with some hints to Terrorism. Good: we are introduced finally to Thanos (not sure how it is spelled) who was at the ending of either the Avengers or Thor movie so it links all the movies together and introduces us to the next Avengers movie which I hope will be more entertaining. The best part was the ending. Not the credits, but pre-credit (Baby Groot dancing) and post-credit mystery(Was that Howard the Duck??)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two ways to approach a film based on a comic book, as others have doubtless remarked. You're familiar with the source material or you're not; I'm in the latter camp where GOTG is concerned.I generally like comic book movies though, so I approached it willing to be entertained but accepting that I might not quite understand the full context for the story. Ready to judge the film and its story on its own merits, in other words.The plot, in outline: after learning the power of a precious artefact he has stolen, Peter Quill (played by Chris Pratt) pulls together a band of misfits to prevent it being used for evil, so saving the galaxy.The film is certainly entertaining. A witty script, intense action scenes, and pretty visual effects grab hold of your attention and keep it. The retro soundtrack is also undeniably great.I have two quibbles. Firstly, in the film's mid-point, the story lags a little in favour of action set pieces. I found myself thinking "This is very amusing, but what does it mean?" more than once. Secondly, the character of Gomora (Zoe Saldana), supposedly an extremely able and dangerous assassin, is in one situation unable to overpower a couple of mooks. It makes no sense, and I found it made Gomora to a less powerful, less active character--rather a shame.On the whole, however, the characters develop convincingly throughout the film. Add to that the action, the visual finery, and the 80s soundtrack and you've got yourself two hours of retro sci-fi fun.</fullReview>

I did not find it original. Dialogue was bland and not funny, although they tried to be funny, but were not successful. I was not happy with all of that.Acting was not so good either. They tried to invent something new with colorful types but I was not impressed.And once more, I left the theater without being happy. I felt I saw all that before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is many things all at once and it manages to succeed on every single one of them: it is one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made; it is one of the best comic book adaptations ever; and it appropriately combines special effects, narrative, interesting character design, action and humor, to a level we rarely see. Even the soundtrack (mainly comprised of classic pop songs of the 70-80's) and the way it is used to fuel the narrative structure, is both appealing and original. It doesn't matter if you hate sci-fi or if you despise comic book heroes, you owe it to yourself to check this one out, for what it is in its own right: one of the great cinematic experiences of the century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Lee Pace, Michael Rooker, John C. Reilly, Josh Brolin and Glenn Close star in this 2014 sci-fi film based on the Marvel comics. This begins with a young boy, Peter losing his mom to cancer and he gets abducted by a spaceship shortly after. Twenty six years later, Peter (Pratt) is a young man who finds a powerful orb somewhere in space. Soon, he meets female alien, Gamora, an assassin, Drax (Bautista), a fighter, Groot (Voiced by Diesel), a plant-like man and Rocket (Voiced by Cooper), a genetic Raccoon. They unite to protect the orb and the galaxy from ruthless Titan, Ronan (Pace). Rooker (The Walking Dead) place space pirate, Yondu, Reilly (Step Brothers) plays Corpsman, Dey, Brolin (The Goonies) provides the voice of evil Titan, Thanos, Close (Fatal Attraction) plays Nova, leader of the Nova Corps and creator, Stan Lee also makes an appearance as usual. This is a good sci-fi flick that has sort of a "Star Wars" vibe featuring a good cast, great score &amp; amazing effects. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When it comes to Marvel, rarely is anything over-hyped and with Guardians of the Galaxy they present a new franchise for movie fans to commit to.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly, the testament of what makes Marvel films good is that they combine summer blockbuster action, the type of comedy you would expect to come from professional comedians, and the type of moving performances that usually are held until winter's Oscar season. And with Guardians of the Galaxy, things are no different. For it truly shows why DC comic book adaptations, despite having the big names of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, have always found themselves following behind Marvel's lead. To learn why this film continues to keep Marvel on a high pedestal: read below.Characters &amp; StoryPeter Quill (Chris Pratt) on the day his mother dies is kidnapped by a group known as "The Ravagers" led by a man named Yondu (Michael Rooker) who somehow went from abductor to father figure. Which led Peter to become a smuggler like his surrogate father until he came across Kree representative Korath (Djimon Hounsou) who crosses paths with Peter when trying to obtain this spirit stone. Something which is of great power so when he evades Korath, the Kree send Gamora (Zoe Saldana) after Peter and the orb which contains the spirit stone. Though she isn't the only one looking for Peter. Due to Peter deciding to screw over Yondu, two mutants: Groot (Vin Diesel), a mutant tree, and Rocket (Bradley Cooper), a raccoon who seems to have been some sicko's science project, are after him because Yondu put a bounty on Peter.And together, upon first meeting, they all fight, quarrel, and then all land in prison. That is where they meet Drax (Dave Bautista) who, like the rest of the guardians, has lost a lot in his life. But with the threat of Ronan (Lee Pace) and Gamora's sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), as well as Thanos (Josh Brolin), this group finds themselves bonding together in order to seek revenge, redemption, and save the planet of Xandar from its doom. That is, unless Ronan and Thanos overwhelm them.PraiseIt is very weird for me to cry, laugh, and be on the edge of my seat while watching a film. Yet, between Peter, Drax, and Rocket, I found myself crying multiple times as we learn their back story. Then, with the same group, including Groot, a few scenes later I would be laughing either because of most of the guardians not getting Peter's jokes or symbols, the antics of Rocket, or just the sweet, simple nature of Groot which made him perhaps the most lovable out of all of them. Though when it comes to the action, I must admit it wasn't as good as the other aspects of the film, but between the hand to hand combat, space battles, and the futuristic technology wielded by both heroes and villains, it meets the standard you expect out of a Marvel film.Though, as a whole, the story is what really deserves praise, as well as the actors whose performances make it so good! For while I didn't know a damn thing about the Guardians of the Galaxy, I felt like it had the right balance for a novice, and would likely appease those of the fan base. For almost every character you get to know on an intimate level to the point where you aren't just laughing because they are funny, or sad because of them going into their back story, but you also sometimes tear up just because you think they may actually die or because you can see how much of a family they become to each other. One which may not replace the ones they lost, but are more than capable of taking up the time those who passed on would have occupied.CriticismAs someone who doesn't watch a huge amount of action movies, I must admit I didn't like how over the top, if not stiff some of the stunts were. Especially with Gamora who not only is given the short end of the stick when it comes to character development, but also her action scenes are subpart when compared to the guys. Then, on top of that, most of the fights aren't the type where you get a Game of Thrones type vibe where you think anyone can die. Which is only an issue for me because it makes every fight scene feel like you are watching an extreme WWE match.Though, refocusing on Gamora, and Saldana in extension, I must say in comparison to Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow there is a clear lack of investment in this character. For, out of everyone, she doesn't hardly get any jokes, kick ass fights, and if it wasn't for the fact she got a lukewarm back story and fought with the rest of the guardians, she would damn near be your usual action movie love interest who fell for the guy she found herself changing/ giving something to fight for. Overall: Worth SeeingLike most Marvel movies before it, you are presented with top quality action and effects, more laughs than you average comedy, and more reasons to cry than your Oscar winning drama. I mean, this film is so good it makes you want to do more than follow the series, but look into who wrote it so that you can see more of their style in the future. That to me is how good this film is, and why it is Worth Seeing. For while the action may not have been in my taste, and Gamora's development and fight scenes were sub-par compared to the guys, my issues with the film I'd say are solely about preference more than anything else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious but empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In perhaps Marvel's riskiest move, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was released this past weekend and found traction that few expected. Grossing in the 92-million dollar area over its first weekend, 'Guardians,' and the particularly talented marketers of the film, drew in many viewers and sent away many fans. This one included. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is an extremely fun film about a band of five misfits who come together through necessary circumstances to save the universe. With a little bit of a bumpy road along the way, we are allowed to enjoy, laugh at, and surprisingly care for these characters over the course of a fast-paced two hours. Chris Pratt, an actor well known for his comedic roles, headlines the cast of characters in this film, and does an excellent job of not being left behind in the story and by other, more interesting, characters. Pratt is able to hold his own in the film, and may walk away as many people's favorite character, which is a feat when he's standing alongside a sassy raccoon and a gentle, talking tree. Zoe Saldana played the apparently green-skinned Gamora, who's fairly realistic acting was an unfortunate misplace in this film. I'd personally like to see a standalone film for Gamora to see what it was Saldana was intending to do with her character, because in this film the director, or at least the producers, did not allow her to follow through. Sadly, because of this many people are going to walk away with dislike of her part in the movie.Also making up the five Guardians are WWE fighter Dave Bautista as the not-so-destructive Drax the Destroyer, and Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel lending their voices to the film's favorites Rocket Raccoon and Groot, respectively. I particularly liked what Cooper did, actually lending some effort to voicing the raccoon, and Vin Diesel's performance was extremely subtle and small, but excellent nonetheless. Lee Pace, Benicio Del Toro, Djimon Hounsou, Glenn Close, John C. Reilly, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, and a brief hint of Josh Brolin make up the impressive supporting cast in their various and hilarious roles. This movie was, in a whole, absolutely hysterical. This isn't the first time a Marvel movie has been that way (cue unpleasant flashback to 2011's Thor), thankfully this time around it was completely intentional. After getting through a very rough first ten minutes, I was laughing out loud until the very end. Director James Gunn took every opportunity he had to change any sort of suspense or drama that might sneak its way into our head into a moment of uncontrollable laughter. And it worked. That's the best thing, it absolutely worked. Here and there you'd run into a moment where you were ready to get on with the story, but in the end that didn't matter. This isn't a movie where afterwards you go and tell everyone about all the cool things the heroes did and how intricate the plot was, and it's not meant to be. This movie is meant to make you laugh, and it does.'Guardians of the Galaxy' had many imperfections. The visuals were amateurish for a film with such a large budget, the necessary storytelling dialogue was forced and predictable, and the fight cinematography left you dizzy with a bad feeling in your stomach. In the end though, it didn't make a difference. What director James Gunn and his co-writer Nicole Perlman decided to do from the start was allow just enough plot and action to make it a "superhero movie" with the final intention of making a laugh-out-loud comedy. They did, it was, and I laughed for two hours.But for just those two hours. I look back at the film now and realize that it left me with nothing. I laughed hysterically while I was watching it, but now all I have left to take with me from the movie is a couple funny lines to quote. For a movie to take the leap from good to great is that wish to watch it again because it found a good place in your heart. "Guardians of the Galaxy" wasn't able to do that for me. I can't say I disliked this movie, because I didn't: I was laughing harder than I have for a while, it just couldn't go that extra mile, and I don't think that in a couple years anybody will be remembering this film with any special fondness. So as I left the theater I was loving this movie; unfortunately, it stopped there. I give "Guardians of the Galaxy" a 7.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There isn't a single sympathetic character in this whole mess. It's like getting on a fairground ride while it's in motion after you've eaten too much. It's vaguely nauseous, meaningless, pretentious, expensive drivel.Beware the Bingety Bong of the Throob and the Doodly Squot of Broot. Made up names with made up personalities, if they have personalities at all. How anyone can relate to this tripe is beyond me.Sorry for venting. It just makes me angry that so much time and money went up in virtual smoke to put this on the screen. Oh - someone said it's supposed to be funny. Huh? There are jokes? I must have missed them while I was fast-forwarding through the action sequences.Painful waste of everything. Cinema is better than this. I actually like graphic novels, but please leave comics on pulped trees where they belong. 5/10 is generous.Edit: I just remembered that I saw "John Carter" (of Mars) on TV recently and enjoyed it much more than Guardians. Yeah - I'm surprised, too! But I could relate to the characters and follow the plot much better in Carter than in Guardians.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All style, no substance, but reasonably entertaining.This movie, like many of today, revolves almost entirely around CGI, and outdoing everything that came before it in that regard. Plot is basic, and quite unoriginal, borrowing a lot from previous well- known sci fi movies and series. Dialogue is clichéd and tailored to kids. So many dad jokes...Performances are so-so, probably due to the lame script and having a director who only knows how to direct graphic designers, rather than actors...No, it is really about the CGI and that is done really well. Plus, the pace is good, and despite the unoriginality, the story does keep you engaged most of the time.Certainly no Citizen Kane, but it's okay.</fullReview>

Before watching the film I saw the rating on IMDb which kept my mouth open. 8+ rating?? Are you kidding me? The film is OK (CGI wise), but not a milestone or extra ordinary or blah blah.. Nothing new, not much punches, nothing to remember and disappointing end. It might be a fun ride for kids but not for collegians and adults. Batista is wasted in the film, Bradley Cooper's voice can not save the film, Chris Pratt seems to be childish and Zoe Saldana appears to be adjusted in between. Anyways, I did enjoy the film but not fully. Really not up to the mark. Great disappointment by Marvel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Gunn was about the last person I'd expect to helm a Marvel film. His gory comedy Slither and the barely noticed Super were vulgar and anarchic pieces of anti-good taste and Slither is entirely successful all the more for it. For the first hour of Guardians of the Galaxy, it seemed like Gunn broke through the impenetrable micro managing force that is Marvel Studios. His directing voice is present, some of his goofy trademarks are there, some of his usual roster of actors show up and it remarkably doesn't feel like a piece of committee filmmaking. The vfx sequences seemed designed with a vision and as we are introduced to new worlds and characters it's a blast to watch a film where you're never sure where it goes or who or what you will meet along the way. Our group of odd balls, led by Chris Pratt are all cast well and even more amazingly Rocket and Groot don't feel like characters designed to sell toys. So it's a damn shame the last hour or so, the narrative stops dead in its tracks and treads water - serving us been there, done that action, character growth that feels forced and too much focus on a lame villain. Guardians feels like a third of the screenplay was thrown out and was replaced by an extended action sequence - the film was gaining momentum, pushing the story and the characters into crazed set pieces, when Gunn's voice disappears into something so formulaic, the wonder and excitement of the worlds that were created here become just another film that doesn't take any chances. I hope the success of the film awards Gunn the opportunity to have a more complete sequel and get some of his other projects off the ground.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy was a blast and my favorite movie of the year so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Earlier this year I saw the Captain America sequel and remarked that so far it was my favorite of the films released since The Avengers. However, I also remarked that Guardians of the Galaxy was coming out and it looked like it might be pretty good so it had a chance to be the best. Turns out, it is the best so far! I saw it a week after its release, usually I would have written a review by now, but been busy with a new house and all and I have limited access to the internet. Suffice to say, the numbers are pretty much making me think that others think this is the best one too as the only one that it probably will not outdo is the third installment of Iron Man as far as box office. This movie features a team of offbeat heroes that come together to utilize each others strengths and hide the weaknesses and is a very funny movie with good action as well. It has everything one looks for in a comic movie and I do believe one of the reasons it is a bit better is the fact we are all a bit less familiar with these particular heroes than say those on the X-men or say the Avengers.The story has a young boy visiting his mother one last time in the hospital. The woman dies and the boy runs out of the hospital and cries in the middle of a field where he is abducted by aliens. Years later this young boy is now a young man who calls himself Star Lord. He is after a strange artifact on a planet that appears in ruins. He is confronted and then escapes others after the strange artifact. Star Lord soon finds a bounty on him as the aliens who abducted him and are basically space pirates called Grievers want the artifact as well. Also, after this artifact is one of the most powerful villains in the galaxy, Thanos and he sends his daughter after it as well. Well Star Lord soon finds Thanos' daughter and a raccoon named Rocky and his partner, a tree alien named Groot are after them and after a scramble to get the artifact and get away, they all find themselves locked up in a prison where they meet another alien named Drax, that wishes Thanos' daughter dead. However, they soon will learn to work together and learn what the precious artifact is and how deadly it potentially is in the hands of someone dastardly or anyone for that matter! The film is really good, as I've said, and I believe it has to do with the characters. They are all very unique and they all have their quirks. From the womanizing Star Lord, the can't get a metaphor Drax, to the daughter of the evil Thanos, to the mechanical Rocky with a wicked sense of humor to Groot who can only say, "I am Groot", this group is very humorous to watch. I do believe it helps that not many people are familiar with this team, as all the members got to shine. Unlike say a film like X-men where there are so many casual fans so a character like Wolverine is always seemingly showcased and the team leader Cyclops gets portrayed as a wimp when anyone who reads the comics can attest he once fought all the X-men, including Wolverine to a standstill. That is the problem with having so many cartoons, people with limited knowledge draw conclusions and the movie studios cater to them. Like Spider-man. Anyone who has read the comics knows the villains that have been his biggest tormentors are Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus. Venom is all the casual fan wants to see, even though he was only a big time villain for like a five year stretch. Here, though, no one stands out as there is no Wolverine or to a lesser degree Iron Man and I think that is what helped this movie. People thought the fact this was a lesser known comic would hurt, but in actuality it may have helped it.So, this film is my favorite of the Marvel films released since The Avengers. In fact, it is almost on par with that film. I only give that one an edge because I do so love seeing the Hulk do his thing. Though I have heard rumors that the next Guardians film may do the planet Hulk storyline, which would be awesome. This film itself was awesome as it did have a lot of funny characters and good action. Also, Thanos looks great as it almost seems they took him straight off the pages of the comics. My only complaint about the film, which it is only a minor quibble, is that they never showed Thanos really do all that much. I would like to see him do something truly destructive so that the moviegoers not familiar with his power know what is in store when he is the primary villain in a Marvel movie. I was hoping he would be in Avengers 2, but they went with Ultron instead. Hopefully, we shall see him in the third, or heck let him take a more active role in the second film of this franchise, because I like where they are going with it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just not that good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a lot to like in this film, but ultimately it failed to connect with me... Which is a shame, because I really really really wanted to like it. It had some interesting characters, funny interactions, and sweet effects, but ultimately failed to bring everything together in a way which made the sum meaningful. After my wife and I left the theater I was almost embarrassed to ask her what she thought--because I was afraid she was going to say what I was already feeling myself... and that after I pushed her to see the movie when she was decidedly "meh" after seeing the trailer. Neither of us really cared for it, and both of us were disappointed. We both walked away thinking, so this is why it doesn't make sense to go see movies in the theater anymore. You drop a lot of money to see big budget extravaganza's which ultimately fail to satisfy. It just felt like a movie which only played lip service to the characters, and dwelled on the action. For me, a lot of action has no meaning without a lot of character substance. And it's a bad sign if I find myself more interested in the "bad guy" winning and destroying planets, and being generally evil, than I am in the "good guys" saving the day. This was totally the case here. I didn't really care if the good guys won or the bad guy won. I hear they're already making a sequel. My wife and I have been burned by the first one and have little interest in more of the same. There was so much good stuff here which was squandered that it really makes me sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was skeptical about Guardians Of The Galaxy to say the least. Starring professional wrester Dave Bautista, directed and co written by the man who wrote the live action Scooby Doo movies and directed a segment of Movie 43, and a very unusual movie trailer led me to the conclusion this wasn't going to be a good movie even before it was released. But then it came out and the feedback was nothing but amazing, so I found myself watching the movie despite my doubts, and man am I glad I did.Guardians Of The Galaxy IS Marvel's best movie. I can't tell you how many times I was left laughing out loud, cheering characters on, and grinning from ear to ear. The action might not be the greatest compared to other Marvel movies such as Captain America: The Winter Soldier or The Avengers and the direction may not be either, but the screenplay is nothing short of amazing and blows other Marvel movies out of the water. Still, the OK direction and sub par action didn't bother me to much as although Guardians Of The Galaxy is a superhero movie, it's definitely more of a comedy than an action movie, and it works great. Really the only big gripe I have on the movie is that the villain is a little weak. The best villains are the ones that you can connect to and understand and that isn't the case in the movie. Another small thing is the ending might bother some people although I thought it worked alright.Still, despite any complaints I've expressed about Guardians Of The Galaxy this is a must see. The chemistry between the characters is flawless and every single character is fleshed out. You care about them and want every single character to succeed. And although I've been raving about the comedy portion of Guardians Of The Galaxy don't think that the whole movie is riding on the comedy because emotion scenes are executed just as well.Overall, Guardians Of The Galaxy Is one of my favorite movies of the year as well as one of my favorite superhero movies of all time. I promise anyone that watches this movie will enjoy it and I implore anyone and everyone to stop what you're doing and go to your theater right now to watch it. I hope you appreciated my review of Guardians Of The Galaxy and I hope you enjoy it just as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film wasn't bad, but it has been overrated. 8.6??? Seriously? It should never be on the top 250.I think there are several moments that are inappropriate to an action/superhero film. Sometimes it becomes ridiculous. In my opinion, a superhero film may have comic moments, but it mustn't be a comedy, because action moments lose their purpose.Besides, the characters aren't very interesting and there isn't much story.For example, "The Avengers" and "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" are better.

		<fullReview>I must say, I was very very very very disappointed with this movie, however I am in no way saying it was that bad of a movie, honestly I have just become pretty tired of the marvel movies in general. I was really looking forward to this flick though. I think Chris Pratt is a great actor, who is really funny, but the jokes rarely were a hit for me with his character. They were just not funny, but that's just me. My main problem with this movie was Rocket. I really hated Rocket, and he ruined the movie for me. There, I said it, Rocket ruined the movie for me. I felt like he was supposed to be some tough guy, quick witted character, but came off as just some annoying rodent. I honestly feel like if Danny Mcbride could replace Bradley Cooper, and not do a bostonish type accent(thats what it seemed to me at least), and allow dialogue that would make the rating of the movie an R rating, the movie would have been much better. I know I am being picky, but rocket had that much of an effect on how I felt about this movie, which I feel rarely happens. Like I said, the movie started off great, then just fell off, maybe because I was really annoyed, but it ended really well. I will see the next one, hopefully Bradley Cooper will be replaced by Kenny Powers in the sequel :)</fullReview>

But would people who had never picked up a comic get it and want to see it? Pics was afraid the answer would be no. Boy was I wrong. I've seen it 4 times and it's passed the "no up front knowledge" test with my family seeing it and living it. And having a fun soundtrack didn't hurt at all.

It's just pure, unadulterated fun that utilizes the super-hero concept with surprisingly effective results. Unless you followed the comic book, the characters are refreshingly new, and coming together the way they do in the story, manage to iron out their differences with each other in order to form an effective team. The story itself we may have seen a dozen times before but it doesn't much matter. And in case you were wondering, no raccoons or tree creatures were harmed during the making of the picture. I don't think there's much more I could add to the other five hundred plus reviews for the movie posted on this board already, other than to express my approval for the inevitable sequel, and repeat what I heard from so many folks who stuck around for the after credits sequence:Howard the Duck?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first read about this Movie in one of those free Magazines you get in Theatres in Sweden and I remember thinking: "what the hell is this? A cartoon or perhaps a spoof on Avengers?" Then I saw the trailer and studied the cast, hmm...Dave Bautista...in a quite big part in a Movie like this...In the end I felt it is either going to be a downer or pretty good...Plot: oddballs and outcasts come together to save the galaxy, and so they must keep a ancient and powerful weapon from a bloodthirsty villain seeking revenge.Guardians of the Galaxy, a sci-fi action Comedy - yes, it tentacles into many genres and surprisingly it works. It is mostly a sci-fi and then split evenly between Comedy and action, a bit like Lethal Weapon (except the sci-fi part).It Clocks in at 121 minutes and it holds many different settings and stories, almost each one could be a separate Movie. One would like to Think that such a Movie cannot work, but it does. The different settings merge together just fine and do not become the least episodic like, say, Terminator 2, which I love but none the less is very episodic and just loosely connected by the characters "driving" to the next scene. Or why not the Da Vinci Code, where Hanks just seek out clues one after the other.The plot is very basic and is certainly not the strong Point of the Movie. No, instead it relies on scenographic detail, characters and the high quality of the acting. The surroundings/scenography are very good, and this is important in sci-fi Movies, especially those set in space/other type of World. The only really bad thing is the CGI work on Thanos, the CGI is really bad and very cartoonish.What surprised me the most was the solid acting, which does not include Chris Pratt. I would not say he was miscast nor being bad, just boring. Lucky for him, he is surrounded by more experienced actors like Zoe Zaldana, Benicio del Toro, Michael Rooker, Glenn Close, John C. Reilly. I have Always liked Rooker, especially in roles where the character is bit crazy, like in the 6th Day. In Guardians of the Galaxy he owns. But the one who surprised and impressed on me the most is Dave Bautista. I haven't seen all his work, but until now I have just liked him, but mostly seen him as a brute or a Sidekick. But here he manages to deliver his lines convincingly, after all he is a "Walking thesaurus". He also succeeds in showing off a comic side. After Riddick and Guardians of the Galaxy I can see him getting good roles, but perhaps not rise as high as Dwayne Johnson.You don't see this kind of Movie often so it is difficult to say who would like this Movie. But if you like sci-fi, space, Star Trek-esque, Comedy, action and is looking for something "easy" to Watch, meaning, something that does not require a lot of thinking, Guardians of the Galaxy is for you.I give it 7 out of 10 simply because it is entertaining, fun and well executed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Adult Kid's Movie or A Kiddy Adult's Movie? Just a BAD movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all the hoopla I took a risk and saw this movie, wow! so this is what Hollywood is doing these days?I gotta say this was literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The script was really poor and any parts that were semi-decent were immediately cut down with cheesy one liners and really BAD humor, seriously this movie script rivaled the one liners from Schwarzenegger in Batman and Robin.It really bothers me that movies like this with massive budgets and no thought get such a huge rating. Movies like the Babadook; (released the same year) a movie with relatively no budget but a very entertaining ride gets a mediocre IMDb score. I guess it is unfair to compare a family? movie with a horror but GOTG may as well have been a horror because it was uncomfortable to watch.New ideas are clearly not the way forward if cheese like this can score so highly, I'm sorry but in my opinion if a movie has a huge budget to begin with then there is no need to economize and the movie will just be thrown together. CG does NOT make a movie more watchable and the sooner Hollywood gets it, then I may consider going back to the Movies to watch another Blockbuster. I had the same problem with Avatar, I don't care how pretty the movie looks but a bad script/story will always show a movie for what it really is and this was a real turkey!The visuals and budget aside, trust me I'm just getting started; the character development is totally non-existent and the characters are extremely one dimensional. You will not care about any of them they are all stereotypical sci-fi fodder (colorful aliens with the same weapons you've seen over and over again and annoying comic relief characters). As well as the common sci-fi tropes ...travel through space ...aliens coming to Earth. ...a dystopia. ...superhuman abilities. ...a war against evil. ...visiting a world where you were never born.Each one is present in this movie in one form or another and it just goes to show how formulaic it really is. I honestly almost puked at the last line of this movie too, you'll know it when you hear it.Lastly the Music, nothing original here its all 70's and 80's pre- made tracks, spliced in with the usual dramatic sci-fi score, I don't buy the whole "it makes it more authentic" thing I also don't buy the fact that he has a seemingly endless supply of AA batteries for his tape player either! How convenient that they had a bank of old tracks to recycle for this movie, definitely not a cost-cutting strategy...After watching this I have had an epiphany; independent and art movies are obviously the way forward because they never have huge budgets and the result is a movie that has been a struggle from the word 'GO', adversity results in better art and this movie demonstrates another lazy cut and paste Hollywood fail to me. Seriously don't bother!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit right now that I did not expect much from GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. Never heard of the comic and didn't have hopes of any height. But they turned all that around with the trailer (they knew Chris Pratt's charisma would sell this). What's really cool is that every character had personality beyond just Pratt, and I really dig the movie's sense of humor; some really good one-liners here. And I love that Quill's Walkman played such as important role in the movie. It was a nice character touch. The fight (and dogfight) scenes were exciting, it didn't take itself too seriously and it made for a good time at the movies. Bring on the sequel.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing a lot of praise for this movie, and my friends encouraging me to watch it, I decided to give it a try. Seeing so many comic-based movies so far, I hoped this presented something different, however, I was left disappointed. To be honest, I slept throughout parts of the movie (the last case was the singing scene in the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey) and kept looking at my watch to see if there was any ending soon. I'm not saying the movie was downright bad, as it had some real cool action sequences, but at certain points I struggled to keep my eyes open. Before you say I will do better to watch other genres, I loved all X-Men installments and the Batman trilogy. Maybe it's just the case that I wasn't familiar with this subject. I hope the second part will be more interesting...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most overrated movie of 2014 hands down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel's biggest gamble features the world's weirdest heroes: A bunch of intergalactic criminals trying to stop a typical Marvel villain cliché from destroying the galaxy. There's a talking raccoon in there as well. It's bonkers. It's worked for most of the world, but not for me. The truth is I'm sick and tired of comic book movies being released 4 or 5 times a year. Marvel have done good in the past, but this along with Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 feel like factory products. This one is different, but it's just silly. It has its fun moments and some of the action sequences have a fun, out of this world feel to them. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista are all good. Bradley Cooper manages not to make the raccoon the new Jar Jar Binks. James Gunn's direction is OK and there is a pleasingly light hearted feel to the whole affair. The non stop flow of jokes, special effects and diversity will please many.I found the endlessly funny tone made it totally devoid of tension, and the jokes were decent but it wasn't that funny. The action sequences are nothing we haven't seen before and the visuals of the movie are so all over the place at times it feels like multiple people vomited onto a canvas. Guardians Of The Galaxy is just too many different things stuffed together and too many different conflicting elements. Subsequently, the film is the cinematic representation of an exploding turkey in the oven. It has plenty of fun elements and good performances, but there's no tension and it doesn't actually add up to anything. It's just a colourful science fiction monotone after a while and there are some half hearted attempts at emotional depth but they didn't really connect. Sadly the Marvel Cinematic Universe is entering its third phase next year and the formula will continue to be done to death. GOTG may be slightly different but it's nowhere near as fun as everyone says.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great sci-fi adventure, a marvelous piece of entertainment, a fantastic, sky-above-average summer movie, yet a mildly disappointing comic-book adaptation. Lets get one thing out of the way: there is no way in which I will judge this movie without thinking as the comic-book nerd I am, in particular the cosmic-comic-book nerd. I have been reading comic books ever since I had the ability to read, before that my dad would read them to me. For all my life I have loved Marvel Comics and loved the most the Marvel cosmic comics, they are some of the best fiction ever invented, so forgive me if I will complain about things that only 0.1% of the population cares about.Before going off and raving about how good the filmaking in this movie is, despite some minor flaws: uneven first act, 10 minutes too much in length and underwhelming villains, I want to address why this movie didn't make a higher grade for me. You see, looking at this movie as it is, it could have very, very easily been a 9 (or more) for me, but I was repeatedly taken out of it because of a problematic adaptation of the source material. I'm not saying that the film butchered 100% of the comics, what I'm saying is that it butchered a good 15-20% of the core mythology of the universe. And I would be perfectly OK with that! I have been time and time again in the past years because I understood the necessity of the changes. And that is the key point. The changes made were simply put, useless and foolish. This is the second time in my life I get angry because of comic book movie changes, so don't take me like the marvel fan-boy whining idiot, because I am a film-nerd too. The reason why these changes bothered me so much is because they could have been changed in a one hour re-write and made the movie excellent, but they are not there. But making Ronan the character he is was a mistake, totally changed who he truly is. The marvel cosmic array of villains is so vast no one can remember them all and out of all of them they changed one of the most iconic and complex ones and made him a throw-away idiot without clear motivations. The whole Ronan-Xandar thing was about of nowhere too. Don't even get me started on the Kree and Nova Corps representation that was so, so, so disappointing. I feel like all of the changes were made for pure fan service-name recognition, but still were totally unnecessary. If you want to use the nova corps, use them, but do them right, don't make them this bunch of throw away soldiers with John C.Reily in the middle in a totally useless and stupid role. It simply is a partial disappointment for a lifetime comic book fan like me.But enough of that. Still I am very happy with the movie and hope that with the future they will correct their few mistakes. They certainly establish enough ground for it. The cast is simply amazing. Chris Pratt is perfect and Zoe Saldana and Bautista are perfect for what they're given, there characters are a little under-represented, but amazingly performed and depicted on screen. Rocket and Groot are 100% successful in their transition and probably the best part of the movie, plus their CGI is totally flawless. The action scenes are breathtakingly stunning and the effects amazing. Moreover the movie is really, really funny and adds up to a massively entertaining time at the cinema. The production value is very satisfying, the pacing perfect, the score and the soundtrack are flattering, I thought the main theme of the score was brilliant. Plus, the fan service was really very good, yes it failed in a few things pointed above, but it succeeded in many others.Overall, I really, really liked the movie and I am looking forward to seeing it again in theaters and possibly change my mind over some things, but most of all I can't wait to see where they will take the story from here.</fullReview>

It stays very true to the source material, the acting is spectacular and you see them as real people (even the tree), the special effects are beautiful and the writing is very quick-witted and intelligent. I was not bored for one second and most of it is perfect. Maybe if we got a little more from the villain because he is a little bland. A little weak. I also wanted more from Thanos. The scene where Groot sacrifices himself for the good of the group, I admit it, I shed a tear. It is all very well done. Especially Dave Bautista, who was very funny but also emotional. I recommend this movie and it is my favored Marvel movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now this is a comic book movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When my wife and I returned home after seeing Guardians of the Galaxy, I logged into IMDb and gave it a 9 (there are only a handful of films that I've given a 10). It's a thoroughly entertaining film, and with an MPAA rating of PG-13, you could take your teenagers with you and not be embarrassed.It's a fun movie to watch, with a fine ensemble cast led by Chris Pratt as Peter Quill (aka Star Lord). It's all action, but there's plenty of humor too. Guardians owes its lineage to a long line of sci fi and action films, including Star Wars, Raiders, and LOTR, just to name a few. Peter Quill is another Han Solo, and the tree-like Groot is very reminiscent of the Ents in LOTR. And the whole movie revolves around a mysterious powerful object that everyone wants and some will kill for (the plot for all the Indiana Jones films). Partway into the movie, our group of misfits has gotten together: Peter Quill; Gamora, who's betrayed her boss Ronan, a Kree who is planning to use a mysterious sphere to destroy civilized planets in the galaxy; Rocket the genetically altered raccoon; Groot, a tree-like creature with a very limited vocabulary; and Drax, a convict in the prison that the group breaks out of. They proceed to battle the bad guys in a series of confrontations leading to the climactic showdown between Quill and Ronan.The action was pretty much nonstop for the two hours the film ran, and most scenes featured heavy CGI, but it was very well done. The score was also well done and included a number of hit songs from the 1970s and 1980s. In the movie, Quill's dying mother had given him a cassette tape with the songs, which were her favorites when she was younger.Sequels? Oh yeah, for sure. There were some unanswered questions to be explored, number one being: Who is Peter Quill's father? And what will happen with the powerful sphere that Quill has? And there are backstories on the other Guardians to be told. No, we haven't seen the last of our band of Guardians.Tip: Don't leave when the credits start to roll. Stick around for a mini-scene that comes after the credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another hit from the Marvel Universe! You know how sometimes, when you watch a film, and there are that many points where it just feels slow and a little boring? Well, none of that here! It's not like it just constant action either though! As with most of the other Marvel films up to now, it has the perfect balance of emotions; humour, sadness, a little romance and then a bit more action to keep you entertained. Let's face it, when you heard about the "talking raccoon", you thought, "oh! this is where Marvel finally goes crazy and loses the plot!" but no, all the outrageous characters combine superbly, to create this well rounded movie. And what more can I say? Other than... Zoe Saldana, WOW! hehe. Finally, while watching this film, you HAVE to listen out for the soundtrack too! Absolutely fantastic, and it just tops the whole thing off! Classic 70/80's hits set the mood for some of the more light- hearted scenes.SPOILER ALERT:When watching this film, you don't need to bother staying for the end-credits clip. It's totally not worth sitting through the 15 minutes of credits to see a lead-in for a possible remake of the 1986 film "Howard the Duck"! Rocket the Raccoon is quite enough!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Soon after losing his mother to cancer, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is transported from Earth by Yondu Udonta. (Michael Rocker) Twenty-six years later on the planet Morag, Peter steals an orb which is valued at 4 billion units and intends to sell it on the planet Xandar. Ronan (Lee Price) wants the orbs to threaten extinction to the planet Xandar. Ronan sends an assassin named Gamora (Zoe Saldana) to Xandar to retrieve the orb. Two bounty hunters named Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel) are sent by Yondu to capture Peter, and take the orb for himself. Drax (Dave Buatista) a prisoner on Xandar wants to kill Gamora, because Ronan killed his wife and daughter. Peter proposes to take the orb to the collector (Benicio Del Toro) and split the proceeds five ways. Does Peter keep the orb away from Yondu and Ronan? Do the others team up with Peter? Does Ronan get the orb and destroy Xandar?This could have been a really good movie but the story is too muddled, there are too many characters, too many worlds and outposts, which further adds to the confusion. Also, the movie can't decide if it wants to make the audience laugh or shed a tear. The opening scenes depict young Peter losing his mother to cancer, and then he's abducted for a laugh filled space adventure. This movie is trying to have it both ways, be a light-hearted action adventure, and a sentimental drama, but it can't do both, and it doesn't do both well. The characters are paper thin, and instead of using the 2 plus hours of the movie to develop the characters, Hollywood uses its favorite filler, fight scenes and explosions to fill in any slow spots in the movie. Ultimately the movie makes no sense , in 1988 humanoids are supposed to have mastered the extraordinary skills to achieve intergalactic space travel. In 26 years, space flight becomes as easy as taking a bus. Ludicrous. Somewhere Stan Lee is smiling, because even the comics that no one has heard of are making him tons of money.The acting and chemistry between the cast is just good enough to make some of this movie enjoyable, although if you're looking for great acting from the likes of Vin Diesel and ex-wrestler Dave Bautista, you're probably hoping for too much. Chris Pratt is good enough as an unlikely hero, he won't make anyone forget Harrison Ford, he was better in the Lego Movie. Bradley Cooper overdoes the non-distinct New York City mobster accent. He may not be as good an actor as I thought. Vin Diesel's one line of dialogue is both a godsend and a running gag that goes on too long. Dave Bautista is a good actor for a wrestler, or is he a good wrestler for an actor? It matters not. Zoe Saldana is funny as both foil and romantic interest for Pratt's character, and she handles the action scenes well. It's somewhat disconcerting to see a beautiful woman like Saldana covered in face and body paint, from the looks of the box office, she'll be making two more of these movies and two more Avatar movies where she's covered in blue paint for a change. If the Avatar movies ever come out, that is. Between this movie, Avatar and Star Trek, she risks being the poster girl for nerds worldwide. I just hope Saldana doesn't get typecast. This movie suffers from too much hype, both from fans and critics, it is not the funniest movie in the world, it is certainly not profound even when it tries a serious tone. It is an ordinary movie that somehow got great reviews and word of mouth. Take my word for it, don't believe the hype, if you must watch it, rent it. The 3D is not worth it, for the most part.If you want to guard against over-hyped fluff, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching 'Guardians of the Galaxy' there is a good chance that you too, will be hooked on a feeling. With good performances all around the board and some fantastic action sequences this had all the makings of a great sci-fi/comic book movie. However its the fantastically witty dialogue and well fleshed out characters that makes this the most enjoyable film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.This film demonstrates that superhero team-up movies don't require 2+ hour movies to serve as a back story for each character as each character's background is summed up in a few lines of dialogue here and there, with the exception of Peter Quill who gets more time to build up his back-story as he is essentially the main character.The film also has a much stronger villain than in most other Marvel movies as Ronan the Accuser's motives are well justified and he has just enough screen time to let the audience see just how bad-ass he really is. He has a sort of Darth Vader-esque feel to him as even though he is bad-ass the audience knows early in the film that there is a bigger, even more bad-ass villain lying in wait for his opportunity.Another high point of the film is the fantastic sound track. Featuring some classic pop tunes which will delight the older audience as well as encourage the younger audience to seek out some of the artists used in the soundtrack. The audience gets to hear this soundtrack through Peter Quill's music player. This music player serves almost as another character as it is there all throughout the film.All in all its a fantastically fun film for any age, except the youngest of children with great characters, a bad-ass villain, very nostalgic soundtrack, and most importantly heart, and a lot of it. Guardians of the Galaxy certainly feels like a Moon-age Day-dream</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Star Wars of this generation... the good one with Han Solo.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is when all stars, strange in shape they may be, align so neatly that one will be laughing gleefully, developing fondness for the characters and wondering what is that familiar song that fits so damn well with this scene. Incredibly witty yet scruffy with amazing style that doesn't follow any superhero formula, it is near impossible to dislike Guardians of the Galaxy. Classic soundtracks oddly fit the cosmic saga, giving it grounded and slightly nostalgic feeling. This may very well be the Star Wars of this generation.This adventure of ragged uncommon crew has a unique light tone, almost resembling morning children cartoon or video game. The humor is spot-on, cleverly written and personalized the characters better than dull gloomy distress most fantasy movies opt for. While the dysfunctional team has its issues, they are delivered with ease, discarding any cumbersome drama and replacing them with accessible comedy.Chris Pratt is an excellent choice for Peter Quill. He is a good example of ruffian with somewhat noble heart, and Chris Pratt hasn't been too fixed on a protagonist image. It works well since Pratt could be your usual hero, but more importantly he brings great unsuspected humor. His character serves as anchor for humanity, because even though the tale happens in gigantic other realm, Quill is often shown as mere human and this aspect will definitely resonate with the audience.Zoe Saldana as Gamora is now green skinned. After Avatar and Star Trek it's safe to say that she possesses the exotic alien look. As a veteran of sci-fi genre, she carries herself comfortably and quite believably as action persona. Her character is indeed a peculiar love interest for Quill, but deep down it's more a search for companionship rather than romance. Dave Bautista as Drak hasn't got much experience in acting yet, still this character suits him and with a compliment of good cast, he probably has the better role any pro wrestlers have had in recent time.Groot and Rocket are both CGI. Rocket, voiced by Bradley Cooper, is the heart of the movie. He's a strange mix of raccoon and mercenary, a bit broken and still eloquently funny. Vin Diesel voices Groot, ironic that most of his roles are tough guys but as a gullible and vocabulary challenged tree that he delivers his better work. Aside from these two, CGI also covers the vistas and expected laser shooting futuristic action.Design for the setting is great, often depicting places like those in video games. The splendor of debris and explosive accompanies the movie, it's undeniably a good spectacle and top tier for blockbuster. The director James Gunn delivers a good continuation of scenes, humorous line and constant pace. Soundtracks from classic 80s music is gold, the contrast works much better than any techno tune could possible do.Guardians of Galaxy is a rare movie that keeps its audience fully entertained, it doesn't let up, if fact it gets better as it progresses. It's a heartfelt and genuine effort to connect with audience. When it ends, it gives a warm fuzzy feeling as one leaves the cinema. It is no less than an utter cinematic achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, initially, but clichéd final act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I'm coming at this from the perspective of a geek that had yet to be introduced to this series. Only Rocket Raccoon had I run across beforehand, and that was as a cameo to some other comic. As such, if this is completely loyal to the source material, good on 'em, but they still fell short in the storytelling. It began strong, even if the blue daughter of Thanos was rather spastic in her acting, hammy even. Then the inevitable romance blossomed, which began its decline into clichéd plot lines. Yet I would have possibly given it an 8 or 9 had they found another way to build the suspense outside of the over over overused final battle aside with the women facing each other. It's a sad state of affairs that I got more entertainment out of Xena Warrior Princess's cheesy gender blind battles than this. Best things I can say for this is that the 3D was well done and some of the comedy wasn't too silly or slapstick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, after reading so many reviews saying how awesome and iconic this movie was, i was a bit disappointed. Yes, it is a great movie, with plenty of action and fighting scenes, but i do feel there is a lack of personality among the characters. If you compare this movie to some truly iconic sci-fi movies like star wars, star trek or alien you realize there is a lack of human emotion in how the characters develop along the movie. Maybe due to my high expectations i laid to believe this would be an iconic movie. Like.. a "New Hope" of this era. I need to watch it a couple more times. Is there something i missed, i wonder. Also, i felt there was something missing, like a plot twist. Something to keep us glued to the screen until the last minute. And was i the only one to feel that the story was a bit childish? Well for those who haven't watched it, please do. Perhaps i missed interpreted the whole thing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Guardians Of The Galaxy' most pure fun blockbuster since first 'Iron Man'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summer blockbusters haven't been much fun this year. Sure, we've had giant robots, action galore and some edge of our seat moments, but from the xenophobia of "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" to the daddy issues and nuclear nightmares of "Godzilla" the season's tent pole movies have been a bit gloomy."Guardians of the Galaxy," the new Marvel adventure, is a tonic for the troops. An old-fashioned space opera, it's a wild ride and the most pure fun blockbuster since the first "Iron Man" movie. It's filled with one-liners, sight gags and funny moments that play off the more standard blockbuster-style action and battle scenes. Pratt has an offhand delivery that recalls Harrison Ford in Han Solo mode, Cooper does wisecracks like a skilled Catskills comic and there's Baby Groot to up the cute factor. There are characters with funny names, warring cultures and treaties to be enforced and broken. The exposition gets in the way of the story sometimes, but only occasionally. Director James Gunn doles out the information with spoonfuls of humor and action to keep things interesting."Guardians of the Galaxy" is clearly expected to be the beginning of a franchise. Near the end of the film Star-Lord says, "What shall we do now? Something good? Something bad? Bit of both?" and while that kind of presumptuous writing usually annoys me, in this case I wouldn't mind seeing what they get up to next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this Marvel's best movie to date? It depends on your taste. You can't compare this to Iron Man or Captain America: The Winter Soldier for example, because in essences Guardians of the Galaxy is pure Sci-fi Fantasy while Iron Man and Captain America are more grounded to earth. This movie is in a class of its own. I don't think I would even try to compare it to Star Wars or Star Trek. Yes they are all set in space and distant galaxies but that's where the similarities end. To quote a certain raccoon "Ain't no thing like me, except me!" and that's true. I don't think I can recall seeing a stunning CGI performance amongst real human actors since Gollum. The other thing that sets Guardians of the Galaxy apart from other space adventures is it's humour. If I really had to make a comparison I think it would be with Firefly.Gaurdians of the Galaxy is enjoyable and re-watchable, but unfortunately falls short of great. Mainly due to the villain, Ronan the Accuser. Being a comic book reader and fan of Jonathan Hickman's run on Fantastic Four I felt the character wasn't done much justice. I'm sure a lot of other marvel fans might have felt a little sentimental over the depiction of the character. I think it's one of the worst marvel character adaptations since X-men Origins Wolverine's depiction of Deadpool. Comic books aside I'm sure the regular none marvel comic book enthusiast would also concur with my dissatisfaction of the villain simply because he came across as formulaic and monotone. Ronan is meant to be both a protagonist and antagonist. Instead of making Ronan full on bad, they should have approached him in a Magneto kinda way where he's hate for Xandarians is genuinely justified. By this I mean they should have set up a very strong emotional lose for a younger Ronan instead of voice overs. They should have also given him more feeling. The over done makeup and voice adjustments didn't help much either.With that said Guardians of the Galaxy is a good movie and I can't wait to see the next one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Space Adventure in Years (Raging Film Review)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like the the actual Guardians of the Galaxy in the film, moviegoers have been very skeptical about this new Marvel franchise (even though it's been around since the late 60s). It is one that has not gotten a whole lot of recognition; it doesn't have any of the Avengers, it takes place in space, and people aren't familiar with any of the characters. But just like in the movie, Guardians of the Galaxy is an astounding surprise, one that will surely have the neigh-sayers eating their moonboots.Featuring one of the most emotional moments in Marvel movie history, Guardians opens on Earth and then whisks us away across the galaxy to worlds filled with unique alien creatures, dangerous bounty hunters, ruthless scavengers, and a conflict between two alien races that could potentially have genocidal consequences. Peter "Star-Lord" Quillan comes into possession of a mystical orb within the first minutes of the movie, and in doing so, he becomes the target of everyone else who wants said orb. As a result of this, Peter finds himself wrapped up in the aforementioned intergalactic conflict along with a talking raccoon, a tree-like humanoid, a revenge-seeking killer with a large vocabulary, and a seductive alien who has ties to both Thanos (the alien seen during the post-credit scene of Avengers), and Ronan, who is trying to get the orb to Thanos so he will destroy his enemy, the Xandarians. At first it seems like a lot to gather, we are thrust into this galaxy without any real backstory to anyone and have to pick up on the dialogue to discover the ties and histories, but it is not as daunting as one might think. For such a ragtag cast, it certainly is very strong. Chris Pratt is an excellent lead. He is witty, sarcastic, and far more relatable than some other Marvel leads. He is essentially an orphan, raised in space by a group of scavengers, and now a bandit who really wants to be known as "Starlord." I really hope that Pratt gets some more leading roles. He has always played the dumb friend, so a change of pace would be really nice. Supporting him is a mix of voice-actors, brief cameos, and luckily no huge Marvel cameos. Zoe Saldana, who dons green instead of her famous blue from Avatar, kicks literal butt as an assassin who initially is trying to get the orb from Starlord, but then gets caught up in the mix. She and Pratt have good enough chemistry for a movie that doesn't focus too much on the romance. She may be an assassin, but she also is very grounded in the decisions she makes and actually cares about honor. Bradley Cooper. in a rather shocking role, does the voice for Rocket Raccoon, and you probably couldn't even tell if you just heard his voice. Rocket is a bounty hunter, he is an experiment who was torn apart and put back together, and he is longing for someone like him. He only cares about getting money, blowing stuff up, and his pal Groot. Groot, voiced with only three words ("I am Groot") by Vin Diesel, is one of the funniest aspects of the film. He is a lumbering figure, who can grow and transform his body if need be, and he is one of the most caring members of the Guardians. Rounding off the Guardians is Dave Bautista, some of you may recognize him from WWE, who plays Drax, the most viscous of the group. He has a thing for words?and revenge?but sucks at metaphors and uses his words to hurt people more than help.For a Marvel film, it certainly has a humorous script full of hilarious references to Kevin Bacon and Footloose, sad moments that are completely unexpected, and a tight story that spans years and planets. The movie is essentially a movie about orphans who need somewhere to fit. It is the "losers club" of the galaxy. They have nowhere else to go, so why not just learn to live with each other?The film, though it has ties to the upcoming Avengers sequel, is entirely its own vehicle. There are no "superheroes," but there are "super-villains." The film feels wholly different from the rest of the Marvel universe, and that is a very good thing. It is like the odd-cousin. It is filled with classic rock music, takes places in the far-reaches of space, and feels more like a weird sci-fi flick littered with raunchy humor and space battles as opposed to superheroes battling it out in the most recognizable cities in the world. The locales are no less memorable, though, ranging from a prison in outer-space, various spaceships that could be on the same level of coolness of other famous spaceships, and different planets that each have their own unique personality. The special effects and set design also stood out. From the colorful outfits, to the interiors of the spaceships, and the beautiful space- explosions, the movie is more than a feast for the eyes with its colors that almost pop out of the screen.In the end, Guardians of the Galaxy, though it was a huge underdog, is actually one of the best Marvel movies to date. It combines an entertaining and mix-bag cast with whip-smart dialogue, great action, and an intergalactic story that separates itself enough from the other Marvel films to not feel like a Marvel movie at all. It is definitely one of the best space films in years, and I will surely be anticipating the sequel which is currently slated for 2017. So, if you were on the fence about the new film, or are already excited to see it, you should probably get to it before your seats get filled. Guardians of the Galaxy is a stellar summer blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel has ushered in a new Golden Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. What a run Marvel is having with movies! I have been thinking how great it is to be a comic book geek right now. I have waited decades for the technology to reach the point we are at now.With this movie, I now believe Marvel is in the midst of creating a moment in time. People will possibly watch these movies as we now see the epics of the Golden Age of Hollywood. The quality of these movies are undeniable. They have humor, super great effects and sound, and superb plots. Of course some movies are better than others, some being made mostly to nudge the next part of the connected universe along (I'm looking at you Ironman 2).Peter Quill is a boy born of Earth but not wholly human. His Earth mother tells him about a mysterious father from beyond while other family members, you feel, think she is hallucinating. Then the story hits full gear and doesn't stop with the tongue firmly in cheek.It does an excellent job introducing the characters and assembling them uniquely. After united, and in a common bond to escape prison they get started on the action. With characters like Rocket and Groot proving to be solid real feel beings it makes for great fun. I greatly enjoyed this film. It not only lived up to the hype, but for me, it exceeded it. A rarity in any movie genre. If you are a fan of Star Wars or Firefly (I really had a feeling of kinship between GoG and the Firefly 'verse) you will most likely love this movie. If you haven't seen it yet...Go on out there and watch it already!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians entertaining the galaxy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what a great one, time for a review. This movie is fantastic! What is so good about it, you ask?Simply put, everything about it is just absolutely well made. Sounds like a bland comment? "It is well made, so what?" you say? Well I really can't find anything to complain about here, and when you think about it, that is not something you can say about many movies. It is quite an achievement. (Even in the fantastic "Gravity" for example you can find some illogical stuff to complain about such as the "unnecessary stupid sacrifice".) In "Guardians of the Galaxy" you will see characters caring for each other without it feeling fake and without the need of using implausible heroic sacrifices. (Do not want to compare this movie with "Gravity" though with respect to which was better, totally different types of movies and both great in their own way.) "Guardians of the Galaxy" is just a fun ride that you will enjoy from start to finish. You like gripping and fun action scenes, which don't seem ridiculous or illogical? Check. Awesome visuals? Check. Cool main characters? Check. They are original, interesting, hilarious and you may even find yourself caring for some of them. ;) The acting is top-notch and makes the characters absolutely believable. Humor? Check! The jokes worked very well for me, even better than in The Avengers and that movie had its funny moments. Emotional moments that do not feel cliché or overdone? Check! Solid script? Yep, no major plot-holes and entertaining dialogues and cool one-liners. The pacing? Awesome! The movie keeps you interested all the time, without making you feel overwhelmed by it at any moment. The soundtrack? Cool and original for this type of movie.Anything missing? Yes, something to complain about. Well if you want to find something I guess could argue that it tells quite a straightforward story which is not very unique. Alright, but the whole thing is presented in such a cool and original way, I don't think anybody will mind.So after all this excessive praise, could this become my all time favorite movie? Probably not, but having said that, there are not many movies that entertained me as much as this one and I can genuinely say that I enjoyed every single aspect of it.Do yourself a favor and go and see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first Marvel comedy movie I'd heard of, and I didn't know how they'd manage to pull it off. I went for the premiere on Thursday night, and I have to say that it was awesome. The movie is about an American man named Peter Quill, or Star-Lord, who finds an orb on an unknown planet. This orb is worth money which is what Quill wants. He doesn't realize that the orb contains a precious and rare gem and there are only 6 that exist. Quill gets involved with the hunt for the gem and meets many odd characters that eventually team up with him. The comedy was perfectly tied with the action in the film. Star-Lord's lines were amazingly witty and hilarious. Each character in the movie has their own unique personality which has its own type of humor. The thing that really amazed me the most was how the movie managed to put a little bit of each genre. Comedy, action, romance, adventure, and many more genres were included. This is definitely my all-time favorite movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Amazing Marvel Movie Yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy 10/102 Straight hours of pure perfection! Guardians of the Galaxy was, how to put his...the Greatest Marvel Movie Yet! It's definitely my favorite Marvel movie for sure!Characters - The Characters in this movie are absolutely lovable and great. Chris Pratt as Star Lord. Chris I swear is the next big Hollywood star I guarantee it. He was in the LEGO movie and now this. He's also going to be in Jurassic World. Chris plays a thief and he is flawless in the movie. Gamora was a good character to. She's a Assassin and a fierce warrior. Drax's character was OK but I liked him. He played a really fearsome warrior. Rocket! Oh my god Rocket stole the show. Rocket is so awesome on screen all the time and also sometimes so adorable. You can not hate Rocket, he is just pure awesome. Groot was a very lovable character too, he was very heart-warming and powerful in this movie. The only character I do have a bone to pick with is Ronan. He honestly was kind of a lame looking villain, but he really didn't bother me during this movie.Plot - The plot worked out pretty well. The length of this movie was perfect and everything that happens in this movie entertains you. There is no break from pure fun in this movie throughout the movie you are going to smile.Comedy - My god this movie was hilarious. This movie has humor shot through the movie at perfect times. You will laugh a lot in his movie and that's a really good thing.Emotional Stuff? - This movie actually had a lot of heart and emotional scenes on it. Like a lot. I didn't except it but it happen. And it's good emotion it's emotion that makes you feel good. I haven't seen a Marvel movie with so much emotion. This is what makes this movie so much more unique than other Marvel movies.Action Sequences - the movies action scenes were just fun. Just fun. You will watch this movie having the time of your life with these awesome action scenes. The movies fight scenes are really interesting and some of the violence and destruction that happens in the movie looks super cool.Effects - The movie's space effects are so cool. There's a lot of really good cgi that actually made the film look beautiful. Every shot from the movie is a poster you could hang on your wall. Fantastic effects!Pros -Great Cast Hilarious Humor Plotted Out Well Beautiful Effects Great Action Sequences The Good Tyoe of Emotional SequencesCons -None! Heck yah!Overall - so overall...go watch Guardians. N I'm serious get off of your laptop or whatever your using to read is review and just go buy tickets to see Guardians of the Galaxy, because Guardians of the Galaxy deserves a 10/10 from me and a (A+) Guardians of the Galaxy is the summer movie you'll be loving the most!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the worst movie I ever seen. I've just logged in to IMDb to write this review. I can't believe that this movie is on the top 250, 'top' 250 of worst movies probably is the right list for this. Not into fantasy movies in general, but there are some limits. I didn't realize that there was any plot at all, just some random scenes all around a galaxy. It's really sad that I can't vote 0 out of 10. Regarding visual effects, the picture was really nice and served in 3d. But this was the only plus side of the whole experience. Boring, trying hard to be fun (but wasn't really) and amuse a pop-corn audience. Well, hope we will not have a sequel for this. Nice wasted 2 hours of a Sunday evening, hope I will not see another ... 'artwork' like this in the near future. I can't understand why The Expendables are not on top of this movie, it's a crap title as well that should be popular...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Mix-Tapes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone forgot these losers are meant to be heroes.The Star Lord here has little in common with his comic book version; instead he is a cross between Indiana Jones and Han Solo, although rather more superficial than Harrison Ford in those films. For instance, as Jones obtains a valuable object at the start of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, so Star Lord does here. But in ROTLA there is a sense of real danger with some occasional wit to lighten things, here there is annoying one liners and a rather easy victory. It also matters that, while Jones is a serious archaeologist interested in gaining artifacts for the benefit of humanity, Star Lord is interested only in lining his own pockets. In other words, Star Lord, who is presented as the main hero here, is no better than the villains in ROTLA.So Star Lord is a self-serving thief, as well as an obnoxious big-mouth and a philanderer. But then wasn't Han Solo a shady character before finding his inner hero? However, Solo was surrounded by better, more idealistic people who shamed him into change. Star Lord has no such companions, each one is as self-serving as himself.Gamora, Rocket Raccoon and Groot are violent bounty hunters, prepared to use whatever methods to line their pockets. Rocket is an obnoxious big-mouth too and, of the group, only Groot emerges as any kind of nobility of spirit, even if his "I am Groot" shtick gets old very quickly. Yondu, who in the comics is the very definition of a "noble savage" is here yet another self-serving mercenary. They are later joined by Drax, a muscle-man with a grudge against Thanos, something that would normally mark him out as a cliché but, in the context of all these mercenaries, makes him a least a bit refreshing.Star Lord's thievery puts him in possession of an all-powerful gem stone, on which Mcguffin the feeble plot hangs. But the real cultural artifact here is Star Lord's Mix Tape, which has inappropriate 70s music introduced at odd moments always to an anti-climactic effect. I guess this will sell a lot of soundtrack albums as well as evoking a mood of cozy nostalgia among the baby-boomer parents watching this. It does speak volumes for the lack of ambition among modern films that such easy nostalgia is sought instead of anything more interesting. But the film itself is a sort of 'Mix Tape' - an assortment of favourite tropes stuck together without any great logic.Star Lord's Mix Tape performs its magic on Gamora. Despite not being from Earth, she mysteriously responds to 1970s pop music. Of course Star Lord's dancing, witty banter and references to Kevin Bacon help. Naturally, they immediately fall in love and Star Lord is prepared to sacrifice himself to save her.During the course of this film, when not engaging in annoying one-liners or embarrassing and inappropriate dance routines, the GOTG are meting out brutal violence, which often includes cold blooded murder. In a scene near the end Groot kills a group of "Space Nazis" by repeatedly smashing them against the walls. This scene lasts a good few seconds. He then turns and grins to his pals. And this is a superhero film pitched at kids.Rocket Raccoon crashes his ship into Ronan. This could have been a moment of heroic sacrifice, but not only does he survive completely unscathed (how?) but everybody in the same room as Ronan does too! Then apparently Groot sacrifices himself; we have the tears and the sad music but then we see him growing back in the end credits? The scene with Groot's sapling dancing to 70s music in the credits is truly embarrassing. But not quite as embarrassing as Star Lord's dance in front of Ronan. This is meant to the climax of the film and Star Lord is meant to be a super hero for goodness sake! Nor is there any sense that this band of mercenaries have grown and become better people by the end of the film. These "Guardians Of The Galaxy" do not vow to give up theft or violence. They do not vow to follow the good, but quite revealingly, Star Lord leads them to "somewhere in between" which I guess means more adolescent adventures in GOTG II.</fullReview>

October 28, 2014. Yes there are some cinemas still playing it. And GOD (I'm an atheist)... I was blown away. This is what movies are supposed to be. Guardians of the Galaxy is like the fooking Holy Grail of all movies.The perfect combination of everything you want to see in a movie. You can laugh (and at the perfect moment) and I laughed my a-s over a lot of scenes (Rocket explaining why he needed the prosthetic leg or Groot stabbing a bunch of enemies and smiling back), you feel sad (entering 2 minutes in the movie), get excited by the action (the whole movie)...WOW...JUST F--KING WOW... I've been a big fan of Mr. Gunn since the beginning... yes the beginning and now I've the answer.I know that my review is not going to change Hollywood or anything else, but at least I know the director to follow even more than I did before.I just saw the Fooking perfect movie ever made.

		<fullReview>After seeing the amazing reviews for Guardians of the Galaxy I was expecting a movie that would completely blow my mind. I went in with high expectations and left feeling less than impressed. Visuals and music were great, but everything else was only so so at best. Each character lacked development, especially the main villain, the jokes weren't clever (amusing but not clever), action was nothing new, the plot was predictable, and the ending was all so cheesy. I can see why the general audience would like it because it seems designed to cater to a wide variety of audiences, the Marvel method as it were. I'm not picking at it because it's Marvel, in fact I think Days of Future Past deserved much more critical acclaim than Guardians did. All I can say is, if you go see it or buy it, you will have a good time; does it deserve to be on IMDb 250? Probably not.</fullReview>

Even though i see myself as a bit of a critic when it comes to jokes in 'action movies' - had a blast during the whole 121 minutes - including the credits (yep!).

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed this movie so much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been anticipating this movie for some time. From the previews it looked fun, sci-fi, action, the good stuff. I'm happy to report that it was real sci-fi, had a lot of funny moments, and the action was great.The story isn't huge. It kinda reminded me of Star Wars with the face on the big screen partly veiled as the big evil guy, then him having an evil front man who does all the actual stuff. Then there was the usual personal tragedy bits, etc. I didn't expect the movie to invent the wheel though. The story itself was entertaining enough to keep me interested until the end. In fact, there was an episode I wasn't expecting, and the whole bit with the escape was really great. However, the "out in space" scene was very awkward and forced. It came out of left field, and felt like a clumsy solution to a problem in the story. I watched it in IMAX, so the 3D came in wonderfully. I enjoyed the different worlds and environments we got to see. By the way, I want to move to Xandar. That place looked gorgeous. The planets were different enough to make me want to explore them all. Okay, except for the one with all the men with makeshift knives. The spaceships looked unique too, and you could feel that there was more behind it. I want to read more of this world now, because it looks rich and exciting.The characters were interesting. They were a bit unlike the usual heroes that they were a makeshift group. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) obviously has some back story going on that will unfold in future editions. It seems obligatory to make trilogies nowadays, so we may be looking at something like that. Hey, I'll watch two more movies like this one any day! The acting itself was really good, Chris became Peter in a believable way. So much so, that I couldn't remember that I've seen the guy in Bride Wars, when I've watched that movie at least 6 times. It's my go-to movie for "girly, light-hearted fun with cocktails". Gamora (Zoe Saldana) was probably my least favourite one of the lead. She just didn't feel real enough. Sure, we got to know a bit about her backstory and all that, but it was very cliché. I wanted to know more about her connection to the big bad. Not that Zoe did a bad job with her. She seems to be the resident sci-fi girl now. She was really great. I just think the writing let her down. Like she was the female in the boys club who is obviously meant to be the romantic interest to the lead guy. I usually don't bring my feminism into the reviews, but they could have really done better by her. I can't even say that male writers didn't know what to do with a woman, because the movie had a female writer as well. I hope that in the future they'll do better. Rocket and Grot are also reminiscent of Star Wars. They are a lot like R2-D2 and C-3PO. The comic duo that has one that talks a lot, the other hardly ever does, one is crafty, the other one not so much. However, I did like Rocket, and Grot at the end was so cute. It helped that I happen to love that Jackson 5 song myself. Drax (Dave Bautista) I didn't really like. He was the source of some really great humour, but he was annoying sometimes in his idiocy. Though I did love the pattern on his skin. As a huge Doctor Who fan, I also have to mention Nebula (Karen Gillian). She's evil, but I liked her. She also looked pretty cool all blue like that. I thought her character wouldn't have much of a role. She really didn't, but more scenes than I thought she would. Therefore, other fans can relax.Overall, really great movie. A lot of fun, great sci-fi environments, promising main character. If you love sci-fi, you really have to watch it, even if you're not into superhero movies. This really is more like a sci-fi movie than a superhero movies. I gave it 10 stars, because I want the sequel to come out like... yesterday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun movie, but not the hit people claim it to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, the movie made the numbers. But is that the proof for a good movie? I don't think so. What we have here, is superhero movie number..... (lost count). Movies such as Spider-Man, X-Men etc. are for everybody, and especially people who read the comics 10...20 years ago. So it's not just about being good, but about recognizing things from a long time ago, pleased with wonderful cameo's and teasers for more to come.But especially this movie, it lost the touch we got with the first Spider-Man, Cap. America and Iron Man. Those movies, even with effects, were subtle to a point and had at least SOME character development. The people were interesting with AND without mask.But in GotG we don't get better effects, but more effects. We don't get better characters, but more characters. We certainly didn't get better acting. What do you expect when a lead part is given to a wrestler? The acting was bad. It was acceptable, because it came with humor and good timing. But humor in that way should be scarce. Instead, we now got it for 2 hours. Humor, shooting, yelling, laughing. So many characters that it felt rushed, at the cost of likable characters and development.I hope in time people will see this movie for what it is. Popcorn entertainment with above average effects and below average acting. Because if not, it means the end of good movies and the welcoming of more Transformer (kind of) movies thanks to people who vote 10 just for the sake of it.This movie should get a 6,5 or a 7. Nothing more, nothing less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical sci-fi fare. Nothing special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Guardians of the Galaxy" certainly does not warrant the 8.5 rating it currently enjoys on IMDb. The screenplay follows the same pattern we have seen a thousand times now.I was under the impression this was a sort of comedy, and looked forward to seeing an original concept. But unfortunately this movie isn't very funny at all. At least not any more so than other Marvel films.This movie relies very heavily on CGI. Some of the visuals are stunning. The style borrows from movies such as the Star Wars prequels and The Fifth Element.Frankly it was hard to understand exactly what was going on. Some dude with a two-syllable name has a beef with some other two-syllable dude. My overall impression is that of an average action-packed film without a lot of intelligence.As for the stellar ratings by other reviewers, I can only guess it's from a younger generation which has been brainwashed into mistaking Hollywood hand-fed consumerist horsesh1t for art.

		<fullReview>After the sickeningly sentimental start (probably meant to allow for settling in and munching time) the picture goes off on all cylinders for a straight two hours with barely a pause. I remember thinking at a couple of points: "Oh, a scene here," but it got cut off anyway. There's not a moment to think about anything, including the rocket designs, the enormous city that is portrayed, or any of the many wicked characters. Everything rushes by in a welter of images and fragmentary plot-lines until the brain spins. The mcguffin is this daft ball that looks exactly like a baseball made of wrought iron, which when twisted reveals a brilliant gem that can destroy the world. It doesn't matter, because our hero grabs it anyway and undergoes a lengthy traumatic experience only remedied by his friends grabbing onto him and taking some of the strain. A likely story, but no more far-fetched than the rest of this idiotic fantasy that almost made its giant budget back on its first weekend. Big earnings ahead for this 3- D special. Definitely worth seeing for sci-fi fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie I wanted to give this movie a 1 star rating but it does have its merits. The Pros: - Good visual effects - Good production design - The relationship between 'Groot' and 'Rocket' is amusing - Possibly iconic characters - Good ideas and well-established universe which makes me excited for, hopefully, better sequels. - Great soundtrack!The Cons: - I'm sorry but this film was nowhere near as funny as I thought it would be which is a shame because I felt like I was forcing myself to what I guess you could call a laugh but more of a 'tsss' noise. - Terribly fast-paced. - Visually unpleasing at some points like for example at the beginning of the movie where Star Lord's mum dies (which by the way is one of the worst scenes in the movie as it doesn't set the tone of the movie at all and it's poorly executed in everyway). - Really bad acting from Bautista and Saldana as Drax and Gamora which was really disappointing as they failed to deliver any funny lines. - Boring action and final battle. - Bland villain - Some bad make-up jobs - Stupid and goofy characters (not talking about main characters) - Rocket and Groot were nowhere near as good as they could have beenI don't recommend this watch but everyone else seems to think this movie is amazing and so does IMDb so maybe you should give it a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously as the ratings show the general consensus is that this is a good movie. But even so, this will not be everyones cup of tea. Some will not even be into the Star-Lord (or is written as one word?). When you have Bradley Cooper, but have him only in a talking role (he's the raccoon), then it shows you have real faith in the material. Actually the director of Slither shows off he can handle bigger stuff.There is a lot going for the movie (be it the cast, might be the best movie Bautista has done and will be in for a while) and if you love Science Fiction, this might not have sounded like a shoo-in, I myself never thought I'd like this movie so much. But how could I think Marvel could go wrong? I don't know, but of course they didn't. They choose their directors wisely and their cast wisely too. Chris Pratt is someone you might have seen in many comedies before, all with small budgets or him in a supporting role (as in Delivery Man, a remake of a french movie with Vince Vaughn being top billed) .. things are about to be changed! People will know his name (his real one ... maybe also Star-Lord).There are so many little jokes in here, that it's not possible to list them all. On another note: As with every Marvel movie there is a stinger (scene) at the end of the movie, involving a character I never expected to see. A real treat, even though I have no clue if this is foreshadowing or just a joke. Whatever the case, sit through it and watch! :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lifeless and Dull Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SummaryI have a bad relationship so far with Marvel-Disney. The best film they've made so far has been Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier (7/10). The other enjoyable film they've made is The Avengers (7/10). All their other films were not good films though. Same with Guardians of the Galaxy. If you like Marvel-Disney films, you'll probably like this movie. If you don't like them, you probably will not like this movie.ReviewGuardians of the Galaxy was pretty mediocre for me. Nothing was horrible or great. It had a few lines of funny dialogue. Most of jokes failed to hit. In fact, there seemed to be at least one joke every 30 seconds. This became annoying. The character, Rocket, was a knock-off of Timon from The Lion King. Imagine having Timon in every scene of a movie and mouthing off at any chance given. It really gets irritating. Though, I think the main problem with movie was its overuse of (mediocre) special effects. The recent Star Wars movies suffered from this same problem. The action scenes were lifeless and lacking any suspense. Plus, whenever the main characters are put in danger, some sort of magic bails them out.Overall, the movie tries too hard to be fun. It fails in my opinion. I know most of the people who saw the film disagree with this assessment. Side Note: there were like four or so lines of blatant objectification of women which I didn't appreciate. One main character calls the main female lead, "A stupid whore," when she has not acted sexually or promiscuous throughout the whole film. Even if she had, it is still wrong to call her that. This angers me as this film is meant for the whole family, and more specifically kids. This kind of behavior should not be shown as acceptable to young men or boys.</fullReview>

The film stars Chris Pratt as Quill, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Batista as Drax the destroyer, Vin Diesel as Groot and Bradley Cooper as Rocket. The five characters meet in prison, breakout then try to protect the Galaxy by stopping Ronan from using the orb to destroy it while forming a new fond friendship. The problem i had with the movie was that character development was weak and the only interesting characters were rocket and quill the rest were kinda useless. Secondly the plot was simplistic and unoriginal and just excuse to show off visual effects. So in all my option is guardians of the galaxy is an OK movie that is enjoyable.</fullReview>

My reaction after the last dance was: seriously?! Marvel made this shyt?! Let me put this simple, this movie steals like everything from the original Star Wars, mixes an evil Yonda (not Yoda) in it, together with PJ (the raccoon from Over the Hedge), an Ent (living tree) from Lord of the Rings and a little bit of Star Trek, also the real bad guy gets the Hammer of Thor, only a bigger one, but thats a Marvel studio idea already. It could be a weird but good mixture, but it ends up as a deadly cocktail, where only the CGI is better than Star Wars (and would actually deserve a better rating than 1). Seriously, this is a 'one to watch' if you want to see Marvels biggest blunder ever.Marvel isn't Marvel if there wont be a sequel, but i will skip that one on forehand. Leaves me to the question, how the **** did this movie get a 8,5?!</fullReview>

A star studded cast provides a secure balance to the entertainment, with acting you've come to expect from a handful of the very best in the business.If you love Sci Fi, adore the seemingly endless array of futuristic gadgets, weapons and beings, while firmly grasping a reality check with retro objects such as the ever prominent 'walkman' then this film will not disappoint.Another highlight is definitely the soundtrack, whereby a multitude of well known songs are used in, some a little odd at first, though they do grow on you and are totally fitting.If I could, I'd rate this 11 out of 10, enjoy...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring; Why the Hype?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billed as a funny sort of superhero movie. Unfortunately, it's superhero elements are not nearly as good as a normal Marvel movie, and it's not much funnier than a normal Marvel movie. That leaves it in no- man's land.It does have some funny moments, nearly all of which belong to Bautista or Bradley Cooper. In my opinion, though, the humor is trumped by the endlessssssss random scenes of things blowing up when you can't tell which side is which (and worse, you don't care). The humor also seemed about as frequent as a typical Iron Man flick -- that's not a bad thing, unless your movie depends on its humor to save it.I won't give plot details, but there are layers and layers of bad guys, and you will never understand what motivates them. Even worse, you can't figure out what motivates the good guys, other than they have to be the good guys because a bunch of other people are the bad guys. The dialog is worthy of a Hayden Christensen performance in a Star Wars film. Characters explaining what we can clearly see on screen (in a pitch black room "It's hard to see in here.") There's a montage explanation of how they are going to save the world -- a time saving trick done a million times before, except here you only want them to save the world QUICKLY so the movie will end. There are completely flat and useless performances from Glenn Close and Benicio del Toro (they'll make money, but they cannot be proud). Their characters could have been played by anyone.I will say that if you liked the Lego Movie, you MIGHT like this. I also thought the Lego Movie was over-hyped, but at least it was a movie like nothing that has been done before, so it was a visual spectacle. This is just clichéd dialog, a meaningless plot and characters you have no interest in. The only theory I can develop for the disconnect between what I thought and all the reviews is that this is this decade's version of camp, understood as such only by college-age folks and younger. If so, it almost certainly will seem to any woman over 30 and any man over 40 as simply a bad film that's trying to get away with something (and apparently will succeed).</fullReview>

The jokes are not funny and characters look bland while trying to be cool. Not much is explained for any character and motivations, just a small line here and there. This lead to me not rooting for anyone. The suspense never really builds even with such high stakes as future of a planet and subsequently the whole galaxy. In the course of events, an important character supposedly died and had no impact on me whatsoever.

		<fullReview>When I walked into my local movie theater to watch Guardians of the Galaxy I was sure Marvel Studios was incapable of making a bad film. How ever after leaving the film I am worried for Marvel's future projects. But now the good stuff: Chris Pratt leads a star- studded cast with charisma and style, Vin Diesel delivers a surprising emotional performance as Groot a tree with a three word vocabulary (I am Groot.). The rest of the guardians give good performances with Dave Bautista as the mumbly mound of muscle known as Drax giving the movie some of its best lines. IE: Bautista: when did we decide that? Pratt: Like 3 Seconds ago!!!. Bautista: I wasn't listening I was thinking of something else. Bradley Cooper and Zoe Saldana round out the Guardians and the last of the decent performances. The supporting cast is not strong with weak performances from Lee Pace as the Kree villain Ronan the accuser, Karen Gillian as his henchwoman Nebula, And John C. Reilly as a Nova Corps officer who's name I have forget ton already. Another problem is the internal logic. People should suffocate in space. Nope. Touching the marvel equivalent of a nuke should kill you. Nope. It feels like a standard space opera with a forgettable story and supporting characters. Unfortunate Indeed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awkward at Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew from seeing commercials that I wouldn't like Guardians. Right from the get go, I knew the humor would be awkward and cheesy. Deciding to give it a chance anyway based on the glowing reviews both on IMDb and from professional film critics, I thought what the heck. Maybe it's better than I initially thought.In short, no it was just as I expected. There are some moments that make this movie tolerable, such Groot, the comic relief (really? Vin Diesel got featured in this movie just say "I AM GROOT" about 50 times?) and the feisty, talking raccoon (whose cheesy Jackass one liners almost got the best of him). Also, the soundtrack to the film is amazing - can't beat upbeat 80's music. Some of the comic dialogue was also amusing.But what brings this film rating down for me is the overuse of clichés. In the deeper Marvel films, the villains are far better developed. Ronan was evil just for the sake of being evil - a 10 year old kid could come up with a better villain than him, just bluntly trying to destroy everything for no particular reason. True, one gets the feeling that the film doesn't take itself seriously - and although some may take that as a very positive point, for me it means I don't take this movie seriously either. Would not see again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Technical issues should not be a significant factor in watching a movie. They were when I watched a new copy of this film on DVD-it jammed there times in an otherwise functioning DVD player. The film is good-on the big screen-but its sometimes very dense visual field will not translate well onto the smaller screen unless of course someone has a very large TV at home. This also probably represents the best of what Marvel comics had to offer. When I was younger I was familiar with all the different comics and most of them were not very appealing-which would be most of the Marvel comics-since they were often drawn in an overly stylish way that was like using a visual language of 'artistic clichés' which was not very creative. For a decade at least there has been a massive amount of attention expended in turning Marvel comics into movies-and very little has been seen from the other comic book creator-DC comics-which was generally thought of as having the better artwork, compared to Marvel comics. This is a fun film but its success will probably only spur more adaptations of the other essentially repetitive and dull comics that Marvel churned out month after month for years on end. It is as if someone thinks that comic adaptations are always good for adult viewing also as if nurturing a never-ending childhood should be the goal of the entertainment industry. Since most of this subject matter is movies with a significant amount of violence in them that should concern adults. It should not be that kids are growing up with all violent movies and adults should not also be expected to always enjoy watching that kind of thing also-as if they were children as well, when they are not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun take on uninteresting characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I rate movies (and yes, this review contain spoilers) I usually have 4 main criteria; Visuals, Acting, plot/story and Entertainment. Each with around 2,5p each equal 10p in total.The visuals and cinematic feel of this movie is pretty good. It is the first Marvel movie set in space and generally the movie looks great, but perhaps slightly disappointing since we have seen just as good or better space depictions in movies 10y older.I give it a 1.8p. The acting is for the most part good and except for Ronan the Accuser, which has more to do with me disliking how they handled the character in general rather then the acting. I give this a 1.9p. The story and the plots of the movie is very good (except for Ronans'motivations) and it ties in nicely with other Marvel movies. Nothing amazing, it is the entertainment, the freshness and the acting that drives the movie, not really the actual story. I give this 1.5p. Entertainment-wise this is one of the best made in recent memory. There is always something going on,usually with a great sense of humor, and the movie feels very short because of it. A 2.3p. In total a strong 7 or a week 8. I would rate this the third best Marvel movie so far behind Winter Soldier and the first Iron Man. My objections with this movie is partly that it almost feels like they did not put enough money into it. There has been a few movies set in space which are just as nice or better looking, and most of those are 10, 15 or even 20y old by now. It does not make the movie feel cheap, it is just that you never feel like the heroes are in the wonderful vastness of space. Secondly the character of Ronan the Accuser, which is horrible mishandled. Ronan is one of my favorite characters from the comics and one of the reasons for that is that he is always logical, intelligent and (too) rational while loving his people and loving the empire. In this movie he is almost a parody of himself, only thinking revenge and too single minded. Also he dies (?), which is crappy in itself. The Kree is handled much better in the TV-show, which by the way they should have referred to along the way. This is very good entertainment, great fun, and a fresh movie with a fun take on, what I believe to be, pretty uninteresting characters. Never cared about them in the comics, but here they come to life in a great way. A few issues here and there and a bad Ronan together with Howard the F***ing duck brings the score down and I am generous with an 8, perhaps it should be a 7...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So here we go, my review of GOTG, broken down into parts: Plot: 6/10, while having some holes (plotholes), it was OK. Some of the problems with the plot that I can name are things like why was Peter abducted? What's with the awkward relationship between Peter and Yondu? Nonetheless, these holes didn't subtract too much from the film. BTW, while seeming to be separated from the rest of the Marvel films (at least from the perspective of those who've never picked up a comic book, like myself), this movie does deal with an Infinity Stone (Power Stone) and explains who Thanos is, which will come in handy when Avengers 3 comes out (Infinity Wars Pt. 1 &amp; 2 will most likely have Thanos as the villain, based on the mid-credit scene of Avengers: AoU). As far as predictability, this film is not predictable.Characters: 5/10, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is definitely a different type of superhero, while I personally dislike the character. Rocket Raccoon is my favorite. One problem with the characters is that too many have, uh, temper problems, and tend to try to kill anyone who insults them (I'm talking about Gamora, Rocket, and Drax). Peter doesn't get mad when insulted, but probably because he knows that the insults are true. Groot is the only character who seemingly has no attitude issues, but Groot can't talk (other than saying I/We are Groot).Special Effects: 9/10, the SfX were excellent and was what I was expecting from Marvel. Conclusion: GOTG, while certainly different, isn't necessarily different in a good way. Nonetheless, it's a good watch, and deserves the title of Marvel film.</fullReview>

It doesn't even explain why Peter Quill left earth after her mother died. Why did they capture him? Just because their parents had something special? That should be answered during the movie, and it was not. I believe that marvel fans know the reason, but in my case I don't and I believe many people that are going to watch the movie, will not get it as well. Second, I must say: TOO MUCH CGI ruins a movie. This was a good example. They used a lot of CGI and it was not that good. I saw people here talking about the CGI being flawless, but those people clearly haven't seen Christopher Nolan's movies. To end my review, I should say that I enjoyed the last scene where they hold hands together to become "immortal" while holding the infinite stone. It was a good scene, even though when Peter Quill starts dancing in front of the villain is kind of stupid.If you like Marvel and Action movies with a lot of CGI, you might consider watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its a fun movie, but not one of Marvel's best in my opinion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came in expecting a really good movie, considering on the day it came out it had a 9/10. I had seen some reviews on it, and it was getting a lot of love from so many people. I really wanted to like this movie, but it just wasn't what I anticipated. It was really corny, and pretty boring in some parts. The characters were pretty uninteresting, besides Rocket Raccoon, who I really like. Chris Pratt wasn't funny really at all in this movie, he had a couple funny scenes, though. and Zoe Saldana wasn't really all that great. Drax wasn't too bad, he was pretty funny. And Rocket was cool as well. But the villain was pretty generic. Really the best compliments I can give this movie is Rocket is pretty awesome, and that the movie is pretty funny. Other than that, it was a bit of a disappointment to me, but this is just my opinion. Overall, it is a fun movie, but not a great movie. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, but too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun science fiction comedy with an interesting cast of characters and great acting. The CIG is also very good for CGI. The film moves at a fast pace but the story is a bit muddled at times. It becomes a bit lost in itself.The comedy bits are great and the timing couldn't be better however, the film becomes a bit wearying after the hour and a half mark. During the last 30 minutes all I could think of is I want to get off this ride now, I'm finished. It was like being stuck on a carnival ride and knowing you were ready to for it to end.All in all it is very entertaining if a bit tongue in cheek. All of the actors did a great job and there are truly some unique characters here, especially the tree/humanoid who is wise but has a limited vocabulary.Fun for sure but just too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of fun, but misses being a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It had been awhile since I had such a good time seeing a movie. Maybe it was that I saw GOTG on a rainy day during a vacation, or maybe it was just that I was genuinely surprised that GOTG had some originality rather than being another over-rated, paint-by-numbers superhero movie. Regarding the latter, many of us have grown weary of The Dark Knight, Avengers, and other superhero films that get 8's or 9's here or 80 or 90 plus rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and repeatedly fail to live up to those expectations. Of course, GOTG IS over-rated (much less than the other superhero movies), but that's more of a statement about the flaw in the Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb ratings systems than anything. GOTG is more original than those other films because of witty dialogue and memorable/original characters. Chris Pratt's "Starlord", "Rocket Racoon" and "Groot" were my favorites and at least one of them will likely be yours as well. The other characters are more supportive and serve that role admirably. I did have a quibble about the 2 main bad guys - one of them needed to go because it just cluttered the field and storyline. While this probably made sense to the fanboys, I'd never heard of GOTG before this movie and it was likely made to appeal to a broader audience than just fanboys.The thing that prevents it from being a classic (or "A New Hope" - seriously?) is that the story is fairly run of the mill and not nearly as expansive or original as what you would see in a classic sci-fi film. The best sci-fi films introduce an original world that even after the credits roll still has huge potential to continue in a number of directions, with great depth and vision. GOTG has some unresolved story lines to give it a place to go, but it's world/idea is too small to have the breadth of possibilities that one would find in Star Wars, Alien, The Matrix, etc. However, not all of the sequels to these films succeeded (Matrix, recent Star Wars sequels/prequels), but this was due more to the failure of script and direction than lack of potential. Of course, that does give GOTG hope - with a well- written sequel that adds original story elements to the fun dialogue and characters we could have a series that rises above its solid, but limited beginnings.Maybe that's what all this "New Hope" talk is all about?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoiler/plot- Guardians of the Galaxy, 2014. After discovering a mysterious orb in another part of the galaxy, A human adventurer from Earth, is now the main target of a manhunt led by a genocidal maniac, Ronan The Accuser. The human with the orb is being hunted across the galaxy when he gets lumped together with a group of misfits that need to work together and accomplish common goals before they can become the "Guardians of the Galaxy".*Special Stars- Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Lee Pace, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Djimon Housou, Benicio Del TOro, Peter Godlewski.*Theme- People need to work together for a common good.*Trivia/location/goofs- Canadian. The Guardians of the Galaxy is primarily based on the 2008 comic team (Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket Raccoon and Groot), but features Yondu, a member of the original 1969 comic team. In Dutch, Afrikaans and Flemish "Groot" means big. "I am Groot" translates as "I am big". Howard The Duck can actually be spotted an additional time before his after-credits scene. When Quill and the rest of the team first arrive at The Collector's gallery, as The Collector turns around to face them, you can briefly see Howard sitting in his glass box in the background above and just to the right of The Collector's head. According to Vin Diesel, his performance as Groot helped him through a dark time in his life; he was dealing with the loss of his best friend and "Fast and Furious" co-star Paul Walker: "It was the first time I came back to dealing with human beings after dealing with death, so playing a character who celebrates life in the way Groot does was very nice." GOOF: As Star Lord is entering the temple to steal the orb he grabs and picks up one of the rat creatures. In the close up shot that follows he uses the rat as a microphone. In the next long shot he has no rat, next close up shot the rat is back. This repeats again.*Emotion- I visually rich film with many lead and supporting characters. New alien races and planets is somewhat confusing to keep straight in your viewer's head. This film's plot has so many 'bad guys' and some real big &amp; powerful 'bad guys'. I found that some of the anti-heros were supposed to be 'good-guys'....too confusing to understand, read, and have an opinion about. Very complex and confusing. That didn't help the film.*Based on- Marvel comic characters that started in 1969.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exceptional film that could've been a cluster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Marvel Cinematic Universe's focus on Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor has become routine or even a tad rote, but here comes a potent blast of fresh air in the form of the Guardians of the Galaxy. A type of pop space opera, the film pairs a Earth-born outlaw with four dysfunctional alien compatriots, including a machine-gun-wielding raccoon and a scene-stealing living tree (an adorable monster and my personal favourite). Together, they combat outer-space evil. It may build to an unsurprising?though still involving?sequence of race-to-save-the-world combat and pursuit, but there are so many exciting, hilarious, and/or riveting details and detours along the way. In fighting shape for the role which will forever change his promising career, Chris Pratt shines, exuding intense man-of-action confidence while also dispensing wry one-liners with an expert's ease. As one of the other guardians, a musclebound alien dead-set on avenging his slain family, martial artist and wrestler Dave Bautista is a pleasant surprise. His imposing physique is complemented by unexpectedly spot-on deadpan comic timing. The protagonists in general are wonderful; the tensions and bonds within the fresh-faced cosmic superhero team are not only introduced, but also deeply felt. Their worlds, too, are intriguing, overflowing with vivid colours and numerous retro art-direction flourishes.Spry and humorous, the film is simply a very pleasant way to spend two hours. Its enormous charms compensate for a few not-insignificant flaws, including a couple squandered side players, including Glenn Close and, sadly, Benicio Del Toro, whose absurd, yet quietly menacing intergalactic "Collector" I hope to see again in future films. The antagonist, Lee Pace's genocidal Ronan the Accuser, is also unmemorable, particularly compared to the instant-classic heroes. Pace is a gifted actor, and he tries to bolster the role with a catalogue of growls and scowls, but the macabre-generic design of the character leaves much to be desired, and the motives behind his destruction are barely explored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These days I'm just about sick of computer animation and special effects. It seems each new movie is just trying to out-do the last with more CGI, louder effects and packing the movie with more &amp; more action. Guardians of the Galaxy had all the ingredients to be another blockbuster Marvel movie yet somehow sidestepped (most) of those pitfalls. I have to be honest, I had never heard of the comic book and actually never even saw a trailer before seeing this. There was a TON of action and there were the clichés that make me want to throw-up (tough guy girls, bad guys that are just cartoonishly bad, unstoppable &amp; unknown powers being volleyed between the good guys and the bad guys),but here's what made this movie great: The plot was unpredictable, it was original and creative - except the main guy being kind of Rocket Man/Ironman-ish, the cast of heroes were unlike anything I've seen (especially from Marvel movies). Lastly, just when you think CGI has reached its peak, somehow some studio comes along and is still able to wow you with the visuals! This movie was visually stunning! PS Groot was easily my favorite character and probably won me over for the entire film. Stories need more characters like him who are slow, thoughtful, wise &amp; loving even while being the most of the team.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Great Ratings (SPOILERS!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched Guardians of the Galaxy, a little late but it's better than nothing. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), James Gunn, Chris Pratt, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana. Sci-Fi, Action. Let me tell you the story first. Peter Quill is a troubled boy. One day his mom died of an unknown cancer. We'll unknown to us, not the doctors in the movie (duh). Peter Quill lost control and ran outside and got abducted by aliens, aliens that look like zombie apocalypse survivors, by the way you will only get it if you watch The Walking Dead and this movie. Anyways 26 years later the Kree race is in a war with the Xandar planet. Peter Quill, also not very known as Starlord, steals an orb from an abandoned planet. When Peter finds the orb and takes, then is confronted by the Kree's soldiers. Quill narrowly escapes and heads to Xandar to sell the orb. After the buyer cancels Peter's offer he is confronted by Gamora, a Kree lieutenant. Quill tries to run but then is confronted by Rocket, a genetically mutated raccoon, and Groot, a humanoid tree. The Nova Corps, the police, takes them all to prison. We'll of course they break out with Drax the Destroyer, a guy kind of like Kratos from God of War (the back story, the makeup, the attitude.) Then Gamora take the group to the Nowhere, a planet on a head, literally. When they give it to him an incident happens and the building explodes and the group decides they need to make sure the orb doesn't end up with Ronan. Drax invites the Kree army to kill Ronan. Which causes the group to team up with Yondu, who strangely looks like a zombie apocalypse survivor. They go to Xander to stop Ronan from destroying the planet with the orb. Then they destroy the Kree ship and save the day and stuff. Sorry I got too lazy to describe the starship-plane fight. OK let's start with cons. The movie was great although it wasn't perfect. I could barely understand what Ronan was saying at times. He's just mumbling and stuff. Then they made Drax the Destroyer look kind of like a bad guy. Then why did they have the Nova Corps Fleet-giant starship air fight in the middle of the cities skies, like serious it should have been while they were in space so there couldn't be people on Xander wouldn't get hurt. And if you think about it it's kind of like the Avengers. Also the way Peter got abducted was pretty generic.Pros. Wow there are almost too much to state. OK first of all Chris Pratt was the perfect choice to play Peter Quill. In fact every casting choice was pretty great. The plot was very good. The comedy made the movie even better. In fact the acting was great too. James Gunn did a very great job on the script and directing. There was no bad acting. The special effects were spectacular, and the unforgettable story really topped it off with a cherry on top.Really good movie here, if you like marvel, sci-fi, space movies, you are sure to like this movie masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the first look this might seem to be just another movie from the Marvel franchise that would be high on action. But this movie has the right dosage of flavors such as Comedy, Action and suspense that makes it get the perfect mix. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) does a great job. His action sequences and the emotions rightly sync in with the movie and makes it pleasant to watch. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) plays her part to perfection. Drax (Dave Batista) has been provided good scope in the movie and he does a great job. Especially in the scenes where he encounters Ronan &amp; the final battle. This beast shows us that he is a good actor too. Groot(voice of Win diesel) keeps us entertained with just a single dialogue. His emotions are so natural and he will definitely leave the viewers moved, Saving the best for the last. Rocket steals the show with his one liners and out of the box humor sequences. The combination of Groot &amp; Rocket leaves us in tears due to the continuous stream of Laughter. The Visuals are rich and support the Story &amp; Cast towards creating a near perfect movie experience. To sum it up this movie definitely deserves a watch. A perfect entertainer for all the age groups. &#x202a;#&#x200e;GuardiansOfGalaxy&#x202c;, &#x202a;#&#x200e;Mustwatch&#x202c;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SO today i went to see Guardians of the Galaxy with a few friends of mine , our expectations were already quite high but this film well exceeded them, throughout the whole film we were laughing our asses off with the clever subtle jokes that this movie had every character at some point said some wise cracking joke that you couldn't help but laugh at even Groot whos only word during the film I am Groot were hilarious and didn't get old as you may think it might. The Characters are so memorable and so fun to watch that you struggle to choose a favourite character , Guardians of the Galaxy is a great space adventure with a star wars feel to it , if you had fears that Disneys would stuff up Star Wars going into this film after you come out you have full confidence in them. This Movie is one of the most enjoyable entertaining experiences i have felt in a Cinema all year and thats saying a lot considering the movies i've seen this year Cap 2,X-Men , Dawn of the Apes etc , i highly recommend you all go see it , it won't let you down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too short to be a review. The only thing you need to do is watch this bloody fantastic marvel film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, I've seen so many films and assorted anime to kinda expect what happens next especially in these superhero kinds and the like.But for the first time ever I went to the cinemas twice to watch this spectacle. I never like to watch movies twice but this is an exception. Coming in, expecting something predictable, this actually makes you entertained as hell and the the compelling characters, visuals, acting and storyline awes you the whole time captivating your gaze in the entire two hours of run time. My favourite scene? Too hard to choose. Action filled and hilarious moments at even the most sinister of times makes you realize what a classic this film will/is going to be. My favourite character? Too hard to choose. I love them all. They bring something special to the movie it even makes you wonder about their background and what worlds/stories have led them to their current predicament. Boy was the soundtrack classic too! I'm a 90's child and when I heard these songs it made me thought of how bloody fantastic music was in the 70s/80s. When do you ever hear a Jackson 5 song in a marvel film?Bizarre right? But it fits in so well!The A plus for me was walking into the theatre still without a clue with what to expect. Nowadays theatrical trailers literally give out the good parts/ reveal too much and give glimpses as to what to expect and only someone dumb wouldn't be able to predict what happens. But this case is different. It didn't even reveal the storyline or the 'bad guys' which is what I love. You walk into the theatre expecting something disappointing or something epic. In this very case I walked out of the cinemas knowing that what I had just saw was something epic and I can't wait for GoTG to come back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not better than the avengers. This movie is not better than Captain America 2. This is not the best Marvel movie. This may conflict with a lot of people's opinions, but its true. I wanted to adore this movie. I could picture it at the top of my top 10 movies of the year list. I was practicing what i'd say in my review video on YouTube. Then i saw the movie. Don't get me wrong, it was a great movie. Very enjoyable. But nothing that new or original, which is what i desperately wanted from this movie: to be something completely new that we'd never seen before. The best thing about this movie are the characters. While some, Gamora, are never really built upon as much as others and some, Drax, do become very dull at times, they are all interesting characters. Part of what people were complementing James Gunn about was setting up all these characters in one movie as opposed to Joss Whedon, who worked with characters that had already been established in several movies beforehand. At sometimes, the development is great: i especially liked a scene in which Rocket Raccoon had an emotional breakdown. However, Drax's obsession with finding Ronan eventually became a bore and i got sick of it pretty quickly. Rocket and Groot were great, although i thought that they weren't really shown as having that trademark friendship that they have in the comics. The relationship was there at some specific scenes, although most of the time Rocket thought that Groot was acting stupid, insulting him and using him solely for muscle. Chris Pratt as Star Lord was the best performance in the movie, and he brought a lot of charisma to the character. My main problem was the generic plot. This plot felt like it had been recycled from the Avengers, or any generic team based movie. There's that signature moment where all the team members are defeated and scattered (like in the avengers) only to have them spurred into action again. They start off hating each other and end up being best friends. There is literally a scene where Groot takes out a group of bad guys in a hallway that was basically the same as the Hulk/Loki scene in the Avengers. Don't fix something that isn't broken i guess, but i hoped for something more original. I also think the end credit scene was a massive kick in the balls for anyone expecting something epic to hold them over to Avengers 2. James Gunn hyped it up so much i was really looking forward to it, and it ended up just being a joke. Literally. While i have these complaints, i must say that this movie is enjoyable. Its a good first step into the Marvel cosmos universe, but i hope the issues can be improved upon in the future sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raccoons gone wild . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . is the main theme of GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. Anyone who lives in Raccoon Country can identify with the problems faced by Yondu Udonta, Korath, Ronan, and The Collector because of Rocket the Raccoon. Most zoologists consider the raccoon's Procyonid clan just half a twig away from the rodents on the mammalian family tree, which includes rats and Sciuridae (such as Rocky the Flying Squirrel). All these undesirable critters carry rabies, which may well account for Rocket's crazed expression throughout GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. Any group which numbers Procyonids among its members really cannot claim to be "guardians" of the school bus, let alone an entire galaxy. How would you like it if your little one got off the bus one day and said, "Pops, you need to take me into the doc's office every week for two months so I can get $4,500 of rabies vaccine injected into my butt because Rocket was having a bad hair day and nipped at me"? I think that Marvel and Disney are being highly irresponsible encouraging the spread of rabies through this unjustified promotion of raccoons as fictional role models or "guardians." (They also have a knack of getting into people's garbage cans and bins and tearing the stuffings out of neatly bagged refuse, as you'll see if you watch the otherwise passable GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Genuinely Enjoyable Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't about brands for me. I don't care about Marvel universe that much, and I don't read comics anymore. I loathe studio wars, and "expanding cinematic universe" is a phrase that nowadays makes me almost puke. I don't care about that stuff. But I do care about good movies, and after just seeing Guardians of the Galaxy for the fourth time, I wanted to share my thoughts on this film, because there might still be a few people on the fence.First off: you don't have to read any comics to get this movie. You don't have to watch 400 other movies in order to enjoy it. You can jump right in, just like I did. Guardians of the Galaxy is the closest thing to Star Wars (the originals and Force Awakens) without actually being Star Wars. Space is merely a setting, as the core of this story lies in the characters, surprisingly fresh sense of humor and good old-fashioned adventure. All of the characters are great fun. Not just average movie-fun, but genuinely fun. It's amazing how enjoyable the core group is to watch. It does remind you of the old adventure movies which knew exactly how seriously they should take themselves. How seriously does this film take itself? There is a talking raccoon. There is a walking tree. It's crazy, but just the right kind of crazy. It's not like the movie is cynically trying to get your attention with "look at me! aren't I random?" crap, because it actually seems like the people involved really cared about what they were doing. This was proved true when I got a little choked up in the end, when Dave Bautista was petting the head of a CGI raccoon (voiced well by Bradley Cooper). When you see it, you know what I'm talking about. It's a really hard balance and tone to strike here. We have these crazy characters that make you smile and laugh - and the few more dramatic moments manage to strike you hard. The best thing about all this is that they're not hammering these emotions to your head. It feels natural. It feels natural in this world which is just a weird fantasy land with no real weight to it. That's an accomplishment.All the actors are clearly having fun. Chris Pratt is good, Zoe Saldana as well, and Michael Rooker is a real treat. Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel lend their voices to some of the best CGI characters to date, and it works. The story itself is just...just a reason to make our heroes go from point A to B. It's not great. I didn't care about it, and thankfully I didn't even have to. There's a McGuffin, a bad guy and some stuff. Luckily, the focus is on our heroes almost the whole time, and you can easily forgive the mediocre story. Even some little bits that were obviously setting up other movies didn't bother me, because director James Gunn managed to blend it all in nicely.Talking about James Gunn, he was the right man for this job. I'm tempted to check out other movies he has done, because Guardians of the Galaxy feels almost like a B-movie in just the right way. There are plenty of scenes and gags which are so stupid that they become good. He even manages to make some of the clichés fun, letting the audience know that he knows how they feel. It's like the director is playing with you, but not on the opposing team. He is clearly having fun, and the soundtrack is just another proof of it. Plenty of oldies, David Bowie's Moonage Daydream being my favorite. Oh, and the blu-ray has Gunn's commentary track on it, and it's a pretty good one.To summarize: It's a fun movie with a childish heart that manages to wake up that kid inside you. And if you are indeed a kid, the happier you'll be when you see this weird flick. It's not tangled by the strings of Marvel's "cinematic universe" at all, it manages to be its own movie and even rewards you in the end. Some movies just please people and manage to make them happy, and this is one of them. Not a cinematic masterpiece, but certainly a genuine crowd-pleaser with some of that movie magic that's hard to come by anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simplicity in Superheros</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the GalaxyGuardians of the Galaxy, a Marvel production, is a science-fiction film that bans a group of misfit rebels together to fight evil. Peter Quill (Wyatt Oleff), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Rocket Raccoon (voice: Bradley Cooper), Groot (voice: Vin Diesel), and Drax the Destoryer (Dave Bautista) find they all have something in common and ban together in prison with the goal of stopping Ronan (Lee Pace), a dark warlord, from using a mysterious orb to destroy an entire race. Most superhero/comic book movies like the Avengers (another Marvel production) we find humanity and self-sacrifice to be the theme. Director James Gunn does a fantastic job of portraying this theme in a humorous but powerful manner. The director uses many viewpoints throughout the film, however the interpretive viewpoint is more dominant. In several scenes, James Gunn uses an interpretive viewpoint to make the scene more powerful. When Peter and his gang of misfits are getting ready for the mega battle at the end of the movie, interpretive viewpoints help get the viewer pumped up to save the world. Flash cuts of the crew strapping on gear increase the emotion of the scene and stress the sacrifice they are about to perform. The music used in this scene does not necessarily fit the typical superhero orchestra. The music is that of the 80's mixed tape that Peter has been listening to since he was a child. This tape reminds Peter Quill of his mother and becomes what "Eye of the Tiger" is to Rocky Balboa. In order to understand self-sacrifice, one most first feel the emotion. I feel that the director does a classic job in this scene.As with most modern day science-fiction films, the special effects are out of this world. Groot, the animated walking tree, is a prime example of just how impressive movies have become. The ban of misfit rebels find themselves trapped in attempt to retrieve the orb back from Ronan. With Groot's special power of growing his branches, he grows himself around the team and protects them from the inevitable explosion that will kill them all. This scene is shot in slow motion as Rocket Raccoon pleads with Groot to stop. By Groot protecting the group, he himself will die. The slow motion sequence of Groot's roots growing around the team of rebels enhances the emotion of the scene and further demonstrates what sacrifice is all about.Superhero and comic book themed movies are some of the best films out there. With modern day special effects, the aesthetics are sure to please the eye. The plot is generally not difficult to follow and the theme is rarely hard to interpret. The simplicity of these types of films is what makes them so enjoyable. Having hope for humanity through the sacrifices of a superhero always makes for a good ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy pleasantly surprised me. I had been waiting a long time for it to arrive on screen, and when it finally came I was rather happy and excited. The time had finally come, it was time to experience a new, unique team of superheroes - and let's just say I was not disappointed in the slightest. In fact, the movie was absolutely incredible and it was by far my favorite movie of 2014. It's also in my top five favorites movies list. There's so many wonderful things regarding this superhero space opera. It's got some pretty funny moments, and it's a very lighthearted film, yet I couldn't help but find some scenes were a little dark - but that's a great thing because it added tone and variety to the film, and gave it more depth. The unique characters are all very well-done as well, and they're just really great to watch on screen. Seeing Star- Lord on the big screen is fantastic, and Chris Pratt done an amazing job. And of course you have Rocket, Groot, Drax and Gamora, who are alongside Peter Quill (Star-Lord.) Ronan is the film's villain, and he too is fantastic. The movie as a whole is just visually outstanding, and it definitely surpassed my hyped-up expectations. So many things happen at once, it's almost unbelievable what you're watching. An incredible film. Part II has me very hyped up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five Word Review: Incredibly Entertaining; Effective Comedy Adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 10th film in Marvel's Cinematic Universe, Guardians of the Galaxy takes an unheard-of team of ragtag cosmic comic heroes and casts lovable Parks and Recreation idiot Chris Pratt as cocky human adventurer Peter Quill, who ends up leading an unlikely team of eclectic space rogues featuring Avatar's Zoë Saldana as green assassin Gamora, ex-WWE superstar Batista (now Dave Bautista) as the violent yet na?ve Drax, and the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel respectively as the sardonic experiment-gone-wrong Rocket, for all intents and purposes a murderous talking raccoon, and Groot, Rocket's personal houseplant/muscle, a dumb, peaceful yet very strong tree creature who has a vocabulary of 3 words. The Hobbit's Lee Pace plays villain Ronan the Accuser, whilst Karen Gillan (Doctor Who), Djimon Hounsou (Blood Diamond) and Michael Rooker (The Walking Dead) round out a huge cast. Using an ingenious advertising scheme which played on their new team's anonymity to a wide audience, Marvel's marketing for GotG paid off perfectly, as the end product comes out not just as a fun, forgettable superhero flick but as a hilariously scripted comedy which happens to be full of superhero action and is set as a space adventure. Basically the whole thing is a tongue-in-cheek retro adventure with an amazing soundtrack featuring ridiculously catchy and wonderfully cheesy 70s and 80s tunes which will be immediately downloaded, including the likes of Blue Swede, David Bowie and the Jackson 5. Chris Pratt effortlessly slides into the Indiana Jones- style lead protagonist role, whilst still imbuing his cocky character with the charm of Andy Dwyer, his Parks and Rec character. Saldana and Bautista's characters are both so serious that they allow for much comedy to ensue through their ignorance of earth customs ("The great hero Kevin Bacon") whilst Cooper's voice turn as the irreverent, acid-tongued raccoon would be the perfect match for Tony Stark. Not that this film is just light-hearted. An unexpected vein of true heart runs through Guardians of the Galaxy, especially towards the end where, without giving anything away, Quill opens a package. And the action is great too. It unfortunately falls to the Marvel curse of having a city-threatening climax, but the action sequences are well done and exciting throughout. It may be just a superhero flick, but Guardians of the Galaxy is easily the best of the MCU and I look forward to the sequels if they're even half as irreverent, witty and just plain fun as this. 86/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action-comedy at its very finest - but in a Marvel film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got Guardians of the Galaxy on Blu-Ray for my latest birthday, basically because everyone else said it was good, and I wanted to know if it was actually good. The thing is, I didn't think it was going to be actually good; the trailers, adverts and the character Rocket made it look annoying, and maybe even rubbish. But, I have to say: it was actually good. By that, I mean pretty damn good. By that, I mean pretty damn amazing.However, I was baffled after watching it that it was as good as it was. All the trailers and everything pointed towards it being annoying and crap, and another one of those random Marvel films to ignore. But it was good. No. It was amazing. Baffling. In fact, almost blasphemy towards my opinion.But I will tell you why it was good.Everything about it. It's gloriously understated and it doesn't take itself too seriously as a film, and in essence has a great sense of humour ? which is unlike many other super hero films nowadays, it is brilliantly acted and has a good feeling to it that can't quite be described.The first 20 minutes felt like the start of one of those fantastic 70's/80's classic films like Back to the Future: feel good, not concentrating on special effects and using the characters to their full effect through purely great acting and a fantastic script. And there was no concentration (or over use) on special effects or over the top action; it was just introducing you to the characters ? in a brilliant way. That is what films like Back to the Future did, and it is gloriously refreshing to see a modern film doing it again; not being without a fantastic and feel good soundtrack, which is essential for a film like this. Having a likable character dancing into the film through feel good 80's music, accompanied by huge opening credits and a great set: it's perfect to kick the film off.It introduces the characters in such a brilliant way that you instantly love them, and this is done through spot on acting with fantastic personality; particularly through Chris Pratt, who is fantastic throughout as Star-Lord, or Peter Quill, and is the perfect main character for a film like it is, bringing tonnes of personality into it. You know I said Rocket looked annoying earlier on: well, the fact that he wasn't was one of the most shocking things about the whole thing for me. He's actually a great character who adds a good layer of comedy and sarcasm to the film, and this is done through fantastic reciting ? by Bradley Cooper ? of a well- written script that is actually quite funny. Yep. The film is actually quite funny; but it doesn't concentrate on this aspect too much, and instead also concentrates on the development of the characters and, in essence, the story.Before I get onto the story, I just want to emphasise how brilliant and refreshing this film is, and how well the characters are developed, and how important each one is for the film's success. Rocket (Bradley Cooper) brings comedy, Groot (Vin Diesel) is, well? Groot. Everyone loves Groot. Drax (Dave Bautista) brings the story to crazy new places and brings a violent edge and a slice of good ol' comedy through ignorance, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) pretty much carries the story and brings a little bit of that much needed romance, Star-Lord, or Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), is the perfect main character/hero and Ronan (Lee Pace) is a great villain who brings a dark under-layer to the film. And I like Yondu, but I can't quite explain why I do. He's just good.The story, actually, is also great. It isn't predictable or over- the-top. And although it isn't predictable, it is quite a simple story that can be followed easily: and this is great and essential for a film you can sit down and enjoy. However, it did all go a bit mad towards the end; but who cares? A good blockbuster needs a good finale, and the finale of this film was fitting to the rest of the film: you don't want it not to be fitting, now do you?And some final points, the cinematography is great and there is some brilliant and satisfyingly fun action. It's also refreshingly not as long as a lot of films nowadays, at least, if it is, it doesn't feel like it. And, finally, instead of using CGI loads, it instead utilizes great costume design and make-up for all the aliens ? which is great.Verdict:Guardians of the Galaxy is a fantastic thrill ride filled with humour and brilliant and unique characters, which never goes too mad or over-the-top and feels just like one of those 70's/80's classics, being gloriously understated and refreshingly un-reliant on length or CGI. Refreshing, fun, brilliantly written and brilliantly acted, this is the best Marvel film I've seen and is pretty much the perfect blockbuster. Screw The Avengers when you've got this.Well done, James Gunn.So I give it: 93/100.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians Unite!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy (2014): Dir: James Gunn / Cast: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista / Voices: Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper: Creative and imaginative comic book fantasy about putting aside differences and uniting for the better good. Plot doesn't matter for it is just a series of spectacular action scenes in their most senseless manner. Chris Pratt plays Star Lord whose mother died when he was a boy then he is sucked into space. He grows to appreciate old music and just plainly tick off anyone within reach. Zoe Saldana plays a green skin woman who would be the envy of Captain Kirk. She flees the enemy in hopes of turning the tables. That would involve an orb that can blow them into orbit if they open it. Dave Bautista plays an inmate whom Pratt and Saldana meet in prison and he wants to avenge the death of his family. He initially targets Saldana since it is practically her blood but he will learn to form an alliance. Vin Diesel voices a tree creature of few words but constant surprise and pleasantness. His name is Groot and that is stated throughout the film. He also has the greatest climatic payoff in the film. Bradley Cooper voices Rocket Raccoon whose negative attitude shelters manic energy and resources. Director James Gunn is accompanied with a flimsy screenplay that pays off with hilarious dialogue and a constant array of special effects that bring life to a variety of odd characters. Its theme addresses those of us whose scars have turned us anti social and the connections and common grounds that can heal us together. That is where the true superhero power comes from. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel films has made me rethink the way I look at superheroes and comic books. Science Fiction is my favorite genre, but I've never been a fan of superheroes, and in fact, ten years ago I would never have even considered seeing a film like Guardians of The Galaxy. On the surface, this looks like a kids movie, but thanks to some fantastic writing and Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), as interesting a character as you will ever meet, Guardians of The Galaxy is Science Fiction at it's best. Quill is a thief, nothing more, nothing less. He is hired to steal something and does it the same way he's done hundreds of times before, only this time, there are a bunch of other people trying to take it from him. Quill will come to learn that the item is so very valuable because it is a nearly unstoppable weapon, that the worst men in the universe will stop at nothing to possess. Together with the other renegades, Quill decides the best thing to do is to stop these men and make sure the item is never able to be taken again. Chris Pratt stars and gives the performance of a lifetime. I remember first seeing Pratt in the show Everwood, and thinking that this guy has no personality, amazing how things have changed. Finally able to be himself, Pratt shows that his personality is larger than life itself, and twice now in his young career, he has turned that gift into two of the best characters I've seen in years. Paired with some of Hollywood's brightest young stars, an incredible team of writers, and special effects that are out of this world, Guardians of The Galaxy had all the tools it needed to become the companies biggest earner. This is a film that a lot of people are never going to think of as anything more than a comic book turned into a film for children, but it is so much more than that. From the music to the storyline, to the stars themselves, this film has something for everyone, it was my top film pick of 2014, a must see movie, and something that any true fan of cinema shouldn't miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Pratt steals the show in this movie, but the truth is, the excellent script makes it a little easier for him to do that. The movie is filled with hilarious one-liners, and Pratt's character Quill deliver's the magic ingeniously. Gamora's character also delivers. Both Quill and Gamora have a duality that really translates to the screen and adds to the complexity of the story. This isn't just another space movie. It's filled with humor and suspense...and it's really smart. In addition, Groot and Rocket are just downright fun. Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel lend their voices to these two quill sidekicks. The casting of the this movie is unbelievable. If you haven't seen it, you don't want to miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Galaxy better than "The Avengers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, I'm not saying that "The Avengers" is truly bad, I'm just saying that "Guardians of the Galaxy" is much more better. This tale of misfits who end up teaming up to defeat a powerful evil force is not that original, a bit of a cliché, actually, however, James Gunn and Company are able to give the concept a new and fresh take which overwhelmed me. I'm not going to spoil the plot, I'm just going to say that even before the logos show up, we are in 1988. Peter Quill is just a young boy who sees his mother dying. He his then abducted by an alien spacecraft. 26 years later he has become Star-Lord. I need to say, after watching Jurassic World and this one, I'm truly a fan of Chris Pratt. He has everything : the looks, the acting chops and the comic timing which takes this movie to another level. He is just great! And I think that working with such a extraordinary director really gives him more projection and freedom. But I can't just talk about Pratt because "Guardians of the Galaxy" shines due to its ensemble cast. Zoe Saldana is as competent and as sexy as ever portraying Gamora, Dave Bautista really impressed me as Drax (he even made me more excited towards his take as Mr.Hinx on Spectre),Bradley Cooper - who gives his voice to the daring raccoon Rocket - and Vin Diesel - who gives his voice to a super powered tree and delivers the line "I am Groot" throughout the whole movie - make quite a duo. Lee Pace is also quite remarkable as the villain, Ronan. Besides these actors, we also have more veteran ones like Benicio del Toro, Glenn Close and John C. Reilly giving secundary but still very competent performances.Despite taking place throughout the whole galaxy, the filmmakers made all of these different planets very credible and believable. Join your hands and clap to all the staff.From my point of view the Guardians are far better than the Avengers, not just in terms of enjoyability but also in what concerns to originality and creativity.Marvel understood with the success of this flick that the don't rely solely on Thor, Cap and Tony Stark to break box office and make profit. The have a all bunch of other characters who deserve the film treatment and I think that Guardians were just the first step.Quill, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and Groot, please come back soon doing a bit of good and a bit of bad things.The Galaxy awaits your return!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't know where to look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an impressive film, not just the visual effects but the intelligent screenplay that goes along with it.I am not familiar with the source material but fortunately director James Gunn sets up the universe nicely in about the first 30 minutes of the film (in more ways than one).Chris Pratt was a good choice for the lead and he obviously has comedic timing from his work on Parks &amp; Recreation. He must have worked extremely hard to get in shape so I'll give him a gold star for that.If there is a problem with the show, it's over-length and so many speaking roles, that you have to see the movie at least three times to get it fully. That's a minor fault, though and for the most part it is totally worth its running time. It borrows from a lot of different genres but the main one is oddly enough family drama.Here are my favorite moments/characters:1) The slave girl is hilarious. Pity she is taken out so quickly.2) Groot is an absolutely amazing character. He has so much personalty even though he can't really converse. The absolute favorite scene is when he kills 10 or more bad guys and gives the goofiest smile to the camera.3) The incredible space battle near the end. The visual effects in this sequence are absolutely stunning.There are a lot of other good moments but I just wanna list a few bad ones as well.1) Ronan is incredibly stupid. The way he just let the good guys get away with stuff is a little bit annoying and will of course lead to his defeat.2) Djimon Hounsou's eyes. This is the most annoying of the visual effects. It was probably how the character looked in the comic book, but it hurts "my" eyes to look at them. Also, his character is a little underdeveloped for people unfamiliar with the source material.Otherwise, I think it's the best Marvel movie so far, even outdoing Spiderman. The use of pop songs are also inspired and to tie it with the plot is unusual.Note: Watch Cinema Sins commentary on this flick. I laughed my lungs out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's Space Opera that I never knew I wanted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember back around the time Iron Man 3 was Marvel's newest film that we got new information about other upcoming films coming within the next couple years. I remember looking through the list and this is probably what was going through my head: "Thor: The Dark World, okay sounds good, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, neat I'll check that out when it comes out, Guardians of the Galaxy...wait, what?" Yes, at that time I was completely confused on what exactly that was. Because up to that point, we already had a good idea of who Iron Man was, who Thor was, who Captain America was and so on. But GOTG was something that seemed a bit more obscure and it sure was. I think Marvel made a really big risk because of that, but somehow it all actually worked out. The film became super successful in the box office and got great reviews, proving that any movie with Marvel's logo slapped on it will make lots of money. Now even though this film was largely successful, when I went to go see it at the movie theater I was actually a little disappointed. Maybe, I had my expectations too high or something but it wasn't exactly as good as I was hoping. But later on I saw it again when it was available to rent and my opinion skyrocketed! Here's my thoughts.First off, the characters. The main group themselves, the Guardians, are a fun bunch. You have Star Lord (Chris Pratt) who's this old- school type of guy. He says some pretty witty things and I liked that he listened to a bunch of older songs throughout the movie which was really a good contributing factor to this film's lighthearted feeling. Then there's Groot (Vin Diesel), a lovable but strong tree figure, Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper), an ill-tempered Raccoon who doesn't know he's a Raccoon, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), an anti-heroine with a dark past and Drax (Dave Bautista), a vengeful being who takes all metaphors literally (which leads to some very funny and quotable jokes). All of these characters are fun and they are pretty much the heart and soul of this film. I also really admired some of the locations these guardians traveled to, they were very well designed and they kind of gave me a "Star Wars" vibe. I don't mean that they copied Star Wars, I just think they took a lot inspiration from them. The story is cool, the humor is good, the soundtrack is fantastic, this film is just awesome! But it's still not perfect.As for bad things, the villain was pretty underwhelming. Sure, he wasn't quite as forgettable as the villain in Thor: The Dark World, but he still was not very special. I felt like he could've done more interesting things instead of just standing around and pretending to be all menacing even though we really don't see him do much. Also, this isn't a criticism but I would like to give a warning to anyone who's interested in seeing GOTG. Even though this film is funny, it's not exactly just a giant laugh-a- minute fest from beginning to end. I think that was one of the reasons my first viewing didn't go so well was because people made this film sound like it was just a riot in terms of humor, so I was expecting to go into this film laughing my head off throughout the entire thing. However, even though it's not a complete beginning to end laugh fest, the funny parts are still very entertaining and they complete this film.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of Marvel's best films! I think this along with the original Iron Man, both Avengers films and Captain America: The Winter Soldier are all up there in being my favorite Marvel films. Now I look forward to anything the Guardians will be in now, including the sequel and maybe a potential crossover with the Avengers, possibly? If you like space sci-fi films, if you like superhero films, If you like Marvel films, then you really should see Guardians of the Galaxy pronto!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard Marvel newest movie Guardians Of The Galaxy I didn't give it much thought at the time. I have some rules when it comes to a movie. While it was getting very positive reviews But when I heard that Chris Pratt visit a children's hospital to present toys from the movie with a special screening of Guardians Of The Galaxy that's when I made up my mind. I thought if Chris was cool enough to take time out of his day to make children happy he's cool enough for me to go watch Guardians Of The Galaxy.As a kid I never heard of Marvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy never read the comics but this movie made me a fan and I'm glad I went to see Guardians Of The Galaxy one of the coolest movies I seen in theaters.Guardians Of The Galaxy gives you everything you want in a movie and then some. It shows that Marvel Studios knows how to handle their movies, they took a chance with Guardians Of The Galaxy and they really hit a home run with this movie The plot of the movie centers around a group of criminals Peter Quill AKA Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax The Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Groot (Voiced by Vin Diesel) and Rocket Raccoon (Voiced by Bradley Cooper) as they are forced to worked an uneasy alliance to fight a common foe: Ronan The Accuser (Lee Pace) along with his hired help Nebula (Karen Gillan) and Korath (Djimon Hounsou) also making an appearance is Thanos who is voiced by Josh Brolin. Peter also has to deal with his mentor Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) and his men. Also casted in this film are Gleen Close as Nova Prime, John C.Really as Corpsman Dey, Benicio Del Toro as The Collector along with Stan Lee making a cameo.The story fits well in the film and helps introduce these characters to the movie goers and Marvel fans who haven't seen or read much about them.Director James Gunn did a brilliant job directing this film he and the rest of the crew gave us a movie that we would be happy to watch over and over also does a smart job with how the camera angle work each scene of the film.The writing staff gave us a well written film that balance action, comedy,drama, story telling all superb. I enjoy the cast of the film each one brought their characters to life in their own way, Marvel did a very smart job with each actor and actress they cast for the film.The Acting in the film is super good as again they brought out the best in each other in the film and the cast did a very strong performance for Guardians of the galaxy they made the characters believable and not that something you will see too often in movies and they made the movie fun from the start.The Special effects are phenomenal in the film and the action in the film will have you on the edge of your seat like a roller coaster Also the soundtrack for the movie is full of the classics it has songs like "Come And Get Your Love" By Redbone, "O-O-H Child" by the Five Stairsteps, "Hooked on a Feeling" by Blue Swede, "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" by Marvin Gaye &amp; Tammi Terrell, "Escape (Pina Colada Song) by Rupert Holmes "Cherry Bomb" by The Runaways so much so that I got the Soundtrack because the soundtrack matches the theme of the film that you will love to get the CDAlso Tyler Bates made a excellent score for the film the score he wrote and perform for the movie is super awesome and every piece of music he wrote matches every scene in the film that you have to watch to appreciate it just a superb score that he wrote for the film, I rank it as one of my favorite movie soundtracks ever.Guardians Of The Galaxy was a box office hit and it made me a fan of the characters along with being of the best movies I have seen in the movie theaters and glad to have on Blu ray Do yourself a favor and watch Guardians Of The Galaxy you will be glad you did With a phenomenal cast, superb acting, great score/music and a character driven story with special effects that will make you go wow, to the cast and crew you all deserve a round of applause Marvel you took a chance and made a new fan of Guardians Of The GalaxyI give Guardians Of The Galaxy an 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of The Galaxy.I'm nit a comic book reader (I do like graphic novels, i.e., Sandman, Alan Moore, etc), and, considering I work in this business, I rarely - if ever go see movies.I just heard about this (ok, a bit late), and saw the terrific reviews its got, so, I figured: "why not give it a try?I"m only about 30 minutes in, but, I'm having such fun watching it, I know already; I don't like this film, I LOVE this film!Not only is it well-acted, but, one of my big problems with American films, is they're really made for mass distribution, which means dialogue is not important - visuals, and action are, as it's the easiest to translate, and understand.What this means to me, is I can watch a film for only a very brief time, and tell you what the entire plot is, and - I can pretty much spout the dialogue without even having read it, or hearing it.That's why I rarely watch (modern American) films.Guardians of The Galaxy is such a wonderful breath of fresh air.Not only is it well-written, it,s got a great sense of humour, with many jokes being bandied about - some, being visual, and in the background, so, like the old, great Warner Brothers cartoons, viewers of all types - from kids, to teens, to adults can all watch it, but, pick up different strings of the multi-layers of humour.The characters all are well-defined (I love Rocket and Groot), and give a big applause to all the actors, both those who are on-screen, as well as those who acted with only their voice, and letting the terrific animation bring their characters - a frakkin' tree, and a raccoon (amongst others) - to life.I thank the reviewers, here, who made me a believer, and I highly recommend Guardians of The Galaxy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An angry, confused son attends his mother's deathbed. Fading fast, and heavily medicated, she babbles about angels and shafts of light. When she passes, the boy flees the hospital, and is abducted by aliens. Many years later, he is a seasoned space traveller, a kind of hunter of space salvage, and a complete loner. Through scavenging a mysterious orb, he forms an alliance with a green female assassin, a literal-minded hulk, a wily raccoon, and a simple-minded but deadly tree. Everyone needs a family, and this becomes his. Guardians of the Galaxy is a bombastic space opera that throws postmodern self-reflexive humour, and homage to 70s music, into the genre mash. It all blends perfectly. The action scenes are spectacular, the characterisations contrast superbly, and the humour is literally laugh out loud at times. Most of all, the film has heart in a way that most European art-house posers will be snotty about, when secretly they would give their right arm to have this much emotional bang. Shamelessly sets up the sequel, but that is forgivable when they get this much right in the first film. Kudos to the screenwriters whose work underpins everything that succeeds here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is a terrific film with fantastic performances from all lead roles mainly Chris Pratt. The film is a fresh new take for the marvel cinematic universe as it delivers the excitement and wonder Marvel have failed to deliver in their movies since 2012's The Avengers. With excellent humour throughout the film, especially during a great scene between the team themselves discussing a plan on how to defeat the main villain Ronann played by Lee Pace and the ending involving Pratt's dance scene which is guaranteed to have you fall off your chair. The movie's events are linear starting from the very beginning of Peter Quill's (Pratt) story. There is also a quite noticeable great on screen chemistry between Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana, the movie is sure to satisfy both the children and adults viewing the movie. The movie's lighthearted score might be the best thing about it because the use of classical music from the 70's surprisingly works and gives you that sense of how much the movie is going to be a treat, the visual effects and tone of the movie is splendid and glorious as well as a surprisingly solid performance from newcomer and former WWE superstar Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer. Overall Guardians of the Galaxy is a brilliant unique movie from Marvel and it might be one of their best yet and I recommend you do see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy has a great team up situation, Gamora is retrieving the orb from Star Lord, while Star Lord is trying to sell it, Rocket and Groot the humanoid tree are collecting a bounty put on Star Lord. Star Lord had a bounty on him because he return the orb that he retrieved to his master. Gamora plans to betray her master Ronan an outraged Kree warrior who works for Thanos who will eventually be the main villain throughout the new MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). He is after all the infinity stones for those who have watched previous Marvel movies the ether contains an infinity stone, the Power stone. The Stone contained within the orb is the Space stone. The stone in Loki's Sceptre is the mind stone. The tesseract also has an infinity stone inside. Thanos needs to play a more important part or people will just lose interest because in all Marvel movie to date he sits in a floating chair, except in Avengers Age of Ultron he is wearing his Infinity gauntlet which will hold all the Infinity stones. The final battle has great visual effects. Ronan is attacking Xandar the main planet of the system they live in. The Xandarian army form a blockade with their ships, Ronan's Kree warship eventually destroyed the Xandarian defense force. Gamora, Star Lord, Rocket and Groot were sent to prison earlier in the story line and that were the met Drax a strong fighter who wants to kill Ronan. They come together to defeat Ronan in his plan to destroy pretty much everything, and form the Guardians of the Galaxy. Unfortunately Groot sacrifices himself to save the rest of them. As Groot is a tree Rocket collected his remains and planted them in a pot and he can grow back, which is great they can use that to and advantage because he can't die. Guardians of the Galaxy is a great movie, I prefer Avengers, and I can't wait to see the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers team up to probably defeat Thanos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I highly recommend this movie to all movie watchers. It has a great storyline with great characters (and character development). The movie shined light on what would become of the marvel series in the future as there were many elements taken that are talked in other earth based marvel films/series. You might be concerned that it may be too childish and that is what I thought when seeing this movie for the first time but it isn't it has some minor mature content (not that that is good but because it is in there) and I know many adults that really enjoy this movie very much. Overall this movie is definitely worth it to watch for all reasons I mentioned and the sequels on the way. - Another Marvel Fan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start off by saying, an awesome soundtrack to one of the best superhero movies I have seen.As a kid, Ironman was my favorite superhero. So when that movie came out I had to see it. And I believe that movie was also a true work of art. But as I started to watch more Marvel movies along the way, I only noticed failures(Daredevil, X-men Origins Wolverine, Spider-Man 2 and 3, and don't get me started on Iron-man 2, etc). So going into theaters to see Guardians of the Galaxy, I won't lie, no idea who or what the comic/movie was about.Well by the end of the movie I was loving it. Knowing Marvel, they try to give it to you all from action to romance. Well I think director James Gunn did a supreme job on this film. Plenty of action to the funny remarks from a raccoon. The casting was well done, Christ Pratt pulled off an awesome Starlord, just as Robert Downey Jr. pulled off an awesome Ironman. You know its true. So going on, Marvel gave all decent comic flicks(Thor 2, Avengers 1 and 2, Captain America, Punisher, etc) that I can handle and enjoy. But Guardians? As I said in the summary, I believe its a masterpiece that I can't wait for the sequel. Yes, a sequel I'm excited for. Just hope they don't overdo it now. After seeing this movie, I'm sure you will want to check into the comics about the Guardians. I sure did.Soundtrack!! The music in the movie, man it fit so well. Wanted to dance along. I am not afraid to admit it, got the song Hooked on a Feeling as my ring-tone. If you're a fan of music, you won't be disappointed.I believe it deserves a 10/10 because of just how it all works together. I'm not a big movie critic, but I do notice things. And from what I saw, not a moment in this movie will you lose interest. All in all, you get it all within this movie. So for me reviewing this, I can surely say, this is by far the best superhero movie. Along side Ironman of course. A movie I did not regret seeing in theaters. Long live STARLORD!!!P.S. Also Yondu.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very funny and filled with good material and character development. I do not like the actress for Gamora, but besides that the movie passed my expectations by far. Most movies with WWE actors that I saw so far have really sucked box office and acting wise. At first I didn't want to see the movie until I heard from friends that the movie was actually pretty good. I had a nice time watching the movie and loved how Thanos was and how Rocket was so funny and enjoyable. I love the premise of Groot just being able to speak to Rocket through saying "I am Groot" and most things were hilarious. Batista as Drax actually turned out pretty well and funny with the strength, the literacy and the seriousness of his character. Gamora with self discipline. Peter Quill as the Starlord doing a whole bunch of funny, stupid and psychotic things had me laughing and enjoying the movie that much more. If I could see this movie again I would. So to Batista, maybe your acting skills lie within acting as fictional characters that have a total short tempered personality. Good luck and can't wait to see the second movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alright; No Laughing I Love This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:I have read Being and Nothingness ten times; I went into the first viewing and made myself hate it. As I found myself re-watching it many, many times I realized how much I loved the movie. Some films you just ask yourself: did this entertain me? did it keep me constantly laughing or interested? Was it well done? good dialogue, action, effects and comedy. Well, yes to all of the above. Many great reviewers before pointed out a great truth this is satire; do not take it seriously. Like those who hated 1979's Flash Gordon, did so because they took it seriously; it is supposed to be ironic. Guardians starts well with us feeling sorry for Tape Boy it then moves quickly to the present. The essence of the film is the opening with Tape Boy kicking hostile lifeforms in time with Come and Get Your Love. Bautista is really starting to impress me; he was one of the only bright lights in RIDDICK. His acting skills are growing every film he makes; Dwayne Johnson never grew at this pace.The ensemble, even the always annoying misandrist Zoe, is well put together. The movie is worth buying to see Michael Rooker's performance one of my favorite old character actors. He is so underrated and labored in obscurity for decades. He steals the movie and is drop dead funny. Ronan is a well done villain; he provides depth to the movie. I hear my readers laughing; he is a philosopher and he watches this?? Look, I tried to hate it I really did. I just found myself watching it over and over. I gave in yesterday and bought the blu ray. Some films are for the sole purpose of entertaining you; they are devoid of intellectual content. This is one of those films. It is non stop action, comedy and well written dialogue. There are flaws: Zoe Saldana, always her shrieking, kicking, yelling 80 pound tough woman. I like her better with just a voice in AVATAR. The scene with Tape Boy, dancing in front of Ronan, I could have lived without, yes it is satire but that was stupid. Turn off your brain, have a good time."A little nonsense now and then relished by the wisest men."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having never read any of the Guardians of the Galaxy comics when I was younger, I really didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie, but I can honestly say that Guardians of the Galaxy is an outstanding comic book movie with its great characters, awesome action scenes, hilarious dialog, and some very emotional moments.The film opens on a very upsetting scene where a young boy named Peter Quill is watching his mother pass away. As a parting gift, she gives him a present and tells him out to open it until she is gone. Overcome by grief, Quill runs out of the hospital, sobbing. All of a sudden, a group of space pirates called the Ravagers appear and abducts Peter. We then cut to a scene 26 years where Quill takes an orb from a planet and is pursued by an outranked agent of the evil Ronan. Upon learning about Quill's theft, his adopted father, Yondu Udonta puts a price on Quill's head, while, Ronan sends his personal assassin, Gamora to retrieve the orb. Following a scuffle with a talking raccoon named Rocket and a walking tree named Groot, the foursome find themselves in prison where they meet a powerful alien named Drax The Destroyer. Upon breaking out, the group must learn to stand together and save the universe from Ronan.Unlike other films that approach this kind of situation with a sense of pressure, the characters in Guardians of the Galaxy don't seem to care about the whole saving the world aspect that one looks for in every superhero film, but's that not to say that they don't care about what is happening or what's at risk, but it focuses more on the eccentric atmosphere that the film creates. Much like The Avengers, The characters in Guardians of the Galaxy work so well together and each actor plays their part perfectly. Chris Pratt is awesome as Peter Quill/Starlord, playing the Han Solo of Marvel as well as being an absolute bad-ass at everything he does, but at same time, being a likable character and incredibly hilarious. The scene of Quill dancing to Redbone's "Come and Get your Love" is one of the best character introductions I've ever seen in any movie. Zoe Saldana as Gamora is one of the best female action heroes in film, right up there with Black Widow and Princess Leia, kicks serious ass in the action scenes, is funny when she needs to be, and she looks incredibly hot in the film. Dave Bautista is also really good as Drax the Destroyer and usually, I don't care for wrestlers as actors, however, Bautista is an expectation. He is awesome in the battle scenes and has some pretty funny lines in the film, but it's Bradley Cooper as Rocket and Vin Diesel as Groot who steal the show in my opinion. Bradley completely nails the voice of this character and Rocket is hysterical, bad-ass, and really carries the emotional scenes well. He's the Marvel version of Yoda, but much more sarcastic and funny. Groot may just be the coolest talking tree in all of film and each time he says "I am Groot", which one might think would get annoying, becomes even funnier every time he says it, but when it comes to the emotional moments, he really shines. A lot of people didn't like Ronan the Accuser, saying that he wasn't menacing enough. I see him as a very menacing villain and Lee Price does a great job playing a tyrannical space dictator. We even got to see a little more of Thanos in this movie, and oh man, does he look awesome! The length of this movie is just right and I was thoroughly entertained throughout the whole film and with the stuff going on during the course of the film, you can't help but smile. Guardians of the Galaxy is the funniest Marvel film ever and I don't think there was a single time during this movie that I wasn't laughing my ass off at some kind of joke or one-liner that a character said. Some of the best humor comes from Chris Platt and Bradley Copper.Even with all this humor, the movie does have a fair amount of emotional scenes and they really do push the story along. I really don't think that I've ever seen a Marvel film with a ton of emotion and it makes this movie unique. The two scenes for me that stand out are the opening with Peter's mother dying because it reminds me of my own mother's passing and the scene where Groot sacrifices himself and the way Rocket responds to his sacrifice.Much like Star Wars, the action in Guardians of the Galaxy is just purely awesome. It seems to be just around the corner throughout this film and the battle scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat and there's never a dull moment during these scenes. The final battle on Xandar and the prison escape are the stand-out action sequences in this movie. The visual effects and the look of the movie are incredible and you actually feel like you're in space. Another reason I loved this movie is the soundtrack. The music is fantastic and this movie couldn't have been as good had songs like "Hooked on A Feeling" or "Come and Get your Love" not been there. The songs bring an air of cheerfulness to the movie and thus, make it more fun. Also, these songs allow us to take a closer look at Peter Quill's character and where he came from.I really don't have any issues with this movie. It's funny, it's engaging, it's emotional, it's got great action, great characters, great effects and a killer soundtrack. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie if you haven't already. You're in for a real treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved this film. I found this was very funny in places and the characters are extremely likable and very well developed. The special effects and action sequences are very well done and the whole aura of the film is very believable. My only negative comments about the film are that i found the storyline complicated at times and slightly hard to follow. Obviously in these types of sci-fi films the story can be quite compacted and complicated. I very rarely find a story complicated to follow but I must admit I did have trouble following what was going on etc. However I am prepared to give it a second chance due to my love of the characters portrayed and the humour of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the MCU baggage and enjoy this entertaining, fantastic looking sci-fi romp.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest in Marvel's Cinematic Universe? hold on, is it still the latest? I'm reviewing these things too late for even the DVD release. Anyway, yes, it is still the latest. Avengers: Age of Ultron isn't out until May, so I'd better get writing.So this is the film I eschewed last summer in favour of Inbetweeners 2. I didn't see Guardians of the Galaxy until it came out on DVD in December and quite honestly it's the better of the two. I didn't really know what to expect. I knew it was adapted from a lesser known Marvel title that's appeared in various incarnations since the '60s. I knew that I know next to nothing about comic books beyond the fact that Superman, Batman and Spiderman are a thing. The vast interconnected multimedia project known as Marvel's Cinematic Universe is a tangled web indeed, and Guardians of the Galaxy is only one small strand. People talk about these comic book movies as though they just couldn't wait for this beloved classic to hit the big screen, but this particular team of Guardians are only from 2008, so they're hardly cherished childhood companions.Forget about that. See Guardians of the Galaxy as a standalone sci-fi romp. See planet spanning empires, sprawling sci-fi cities, celestial worlds, fantastic alien races, spaceships, space prison-breaks, an atmosphere informed by the big leagues like Star Wars and Star Trek, but with none of those franchises' inherent baggage.Well almost; we do have Star Trek's Zoe Saldana and Doctor Who's Karen Gillan, suitably aliened-up in green and blue body paint as the duelling adopted 'daughters' of galactic arch-villain Thanos (Josh Brolin), a who employs a genocidal enforcer called Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) to do his dirty work.The story follows the Han Solo-esque Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), a scavenger, smuggler and all round space scoundrel who finds a MacGuffin while searching an ancient temple. It's a mysterious orb of unprecedented power, and soon everybody's after him. Along the way, he acquires a disparate crew of bounty hunters and outlaws, including deadly assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana), genetically experimented-on raccoon Rocket (Bradley Cooper), taciturn tree-being Groot (Vin Diesel) and vengeful warrior Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista).The cast is further padded by bit players including Glenn Close and John C. Reilly, although here we hit a slight snag in that the large cast of heroes and villains is almost too much for one film and many of them don't receive adequate focus.Under the titular moniker of the Guardians of the Galaxy, they are forced to put differences aside and team up against the much more despicable warmongers Thanos and Ronan. It might nominally be a superhero movie, but with such fantastic surroundings, it hardly feels like one. The characters too are not naturally noble, but outsiders and oddballs who have to really rally themselves to fight the good fight. Well, maybe that part's not too different from the internal struggles or your average gritty 21st Century superhero.A little like Futurama's man-out-of-time Philip J. Fry, Pratt's character Quill keeps it grounded with plenty of well timed 20th Century references (In fact the whole gang keep it light with plenty of well timed comedic interplay), as does the soundtrack which is all '70s and '80s rock pop and soul. In universe, it's the playlist from Quill's Walkman, a cassette tape labelled 'Awesome Mix, Vol. 1' which he listens to while speeding through the galaxy. Needless to say, I swiftly downloaded said playlist.It all looks fantastic and more importantly is great fun throughout, with plenty of light hearted comedy balanced with the action and a solid cast who work well together. I'm sad to have missed the spectacle on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy - Review by Arno Ramon - Entertaining, Slightly Comic, Cheeky &amp; Developed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is an entertaining movie. Fast paced, well-packed and full of SFX battle scenes, it makes it an enjoyable experience. The characters are well developed, which you would expect from a Marvel movie. The storyline is based on the retrieval of a mystical orb in far corners of the Universe. Different groups try to obtain this orb for various motives. Money, Power, Prestige or Greed are amongst them. If you're looking for deep philosophical insights, then you're in the wrong place. But the story is strong enough to keep you excited.Main actors Chris Pratt &amp; Zoe Saldana have a bit of an alien romance going on, and actor Michael Rooker convinces as a universal black market salesman. On top of that Benicio Del Toro plays "The Collector" who treasures intriguing objects from around the universe. It made me wonder if he owns a stash of vinyl records.It has a resemblance to the remake of Star Trek which was released in 2009, where the ongoing battle between good &amp; evil plays a central role and cheeky comedy makes you appreciate the characters.All factors considered, Guardians of the Galaxy is entertainment, and has a storyline that's not boring. But don't expect it to go under your skin, because it's not going to.Final Score : 7.2Thanks for watching,Arno Ramon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Marvel. Spider-Man, Wolverine, Hulk, you name it-I love them all. However, when I heard about Marvel making a movie called "Guardians Of The Galaxy", my reaction was: "What? Who are they?". When I went to see this movie, I had low expectations because I didn't know the characters(except Rocket Raccoon, I know him a bit) and I was not impressed with a few recent MCU movies(like Iron Man 2 and Thor: The Dark World). I actually loved it! There are plenty of tear-jerking scenes like the intro and a bar scene with Rocket. The comedy is genuinely funny with absolutely no farting or poop humor. However, if you aren't a fan of goofball jokes, you won't really like it, according to some negative comments on here. Also, I had a lot of fun with the characters and action scenes, especially in 3D. I had no problems with this movie whatsoever. This is up there with my best movies of all time, along with Jaws and The Matrix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildly fun set-piece space opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy tries hard to be good, and it almost succeeds! Its ultimate downfall is a lack of compelling villains for the heroes to battle, and no compelling goal for them to aspire to.The movie introduces a motley crew of characters. Among them, a smart-talking raccoon ( Bradley Cooper as "Rocket") and his talking tree (Vin Diesel) stand out as the ultimate comedian and straight man. After all, how much straighter can you get than utter the same three words? Stan Laurel saying nothing to Hardy's antics would be about it. The pairing works really well, and provides all the interesting characters and comedic sidelines in this movie. Zoe Saldana's green lady and Chris Pratt's overly self-conscious hero are much more lackluster. The rest of the movie is populated with equally one-dimensional stock characters, like the pirate ship captain who abducts Pratt as a little boy and then wants to kill his protégé, only to decide he's buddies, only to decide he's going to kill his protégé, only...The plot is not very exciting, and involves a string of unrelated episodes. The "rough bar at the edge of the galaxy episode;" the "rough prison episode;" the "thwart attack on innocent planet episode;" the "lab of mad scientist episode" (not necessarily in that order, but it makes no difference).The weakest point of the movie is its villains. They are among the least inspiring villains in a long while, with petty motives of destruction, guided by a device contrived to allow everyone to hunt it, although its purpose is unclear and its usage artificially tailored to the needs of the grand finale. Villains are much more interesting when they are as sharp as the sharpest good guys (here the raccoon), not when they are mumbling figures with vague motives of galactic destruction. Take in contrast Robert Redford in "Winter Soldier:" he wanted to knock off a few thousand of the worlds most useless bureaucrats and bad government honchos to make our planet a better place. I was rooting for him!So while Mr. Raccoon and his straight man get a 9/10 from me, the weak episodic plot and the lackluster villains take this film down to 6/10. Definitely not a new Star Wars or Raiders of the Lost Ark. But a nice try, worth one watch, and sure to spawn sequels, which might be better than the original, just like "Wrath of Khan" easily outstripped "Star Trek: The Motion Picture." I'll check out #2 in the hope my wish comes true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Space Opera Explodes with Action and Humor from Marvel Studios</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Guardians of the Galaxy" is the latest film from Marvel Studios, and is loosely based on characters that have existed largely in the fringes of Marvel Comics from the 1960s until the present day. The film is effectively Marvel's first stab at space opera-- ironically, Disney now also owns LucasFilm, making the "Star Wars" franchise a sister property-- in any case, this dark-horse film is approached like an indie epic with better special effects, and it works superbly.Directed by James Gunn (who also co-writes with Nicole Perlman), the film's plot concerns a ragtag band of malcontents, all thrown together by circumstance, none of whom guess that they are bound to become heroic renegades in a distant galaxy far from Earth. Chris Pratt is the self-described "star lord", Peter Quill: an Earth boy by birth (at least, his mother is an Earthling; his dad's origins are deliberately obscured for now). He spent about 10 years growing up in Missouri, only to see his mother die from cancer. In an emotional rage, he flees from the hospital and-- wait for it-- gets kidnapped by space pirates. Over 20 years later, Quill is a professional thief, seeking out various curiosities that will bring him big bucks (or credits or whatever money standards he deals with.) Getting captured on his latest caper, he finds himself forced to deal with the company of Gamora- (Zoe Saldana)-- a professional assassin sent by a galactic warlord; Drax (Dave Bautista), is a bruiser of ill-repute who openly vows to kill the space overlord Ronan (Lee Pace) for the death of his family; Rocket (voice of Cooper) is a dwarf-sized raccoon and a career thief/bounty hunter in his own right; Rocket's single-phrase-uttering best friend (and parallel character for Chewbacca) is Groot (voice of Diesel), an intelligent tree creature whose "I am groot" statement is his only dialogue.The MacGuffin that these criminals-turned-rebel heroes are seeking is an "Orb"- a baseball-shaped knick-knack containing a gem that spews purple energy when touched and has a tendency to blow things up.Ronan the Accuser is the main villain here.. He sends horde after horde of crazier bad folks after the Guardians, while occasionally standing off with Thanos (Josh Brolin.)The film has some other key cameos and bit parts, including Glenn Close and John C. Reilly as Xandarian executives of the Nova Corps- a peacekeeping army and a close analog to "Starfleet".The interplay between the characters is more dialogue driven than most of these films tend to be, and the actors inhabit the roles in a believable way, despite the obvious absurdity that defines the proceedings. Vintage top 40 pop music from the 1970s and 80s prominently figures into the plot throughout the film.The final battle is lengthier than you might think, but it has a satisfying-- and heartbreaking conclusion, with the sacrifice of a team member.The film ends on a note that signals more adventures are to come. Based on the execution by the filmmakers, a continuation of the Guardians' saga is very welcome.After the stark commercial failure of the Disney-backed "John Carter of Mars", this project could have been stillborn, especially considering that with the exception of Ms. Saldana, none of the human principals were major box office draws on their own, and the voice-acting contributions of Cooper and Diesel as a talking raccoon and tree, respectively, could have simply been written off as a cash-grab. The script is more intelligent than viewers likely expect it to be, and the pace is brisk without feeling rushed. All in all, the film is a solid good time from Marvel.</fullReview>

Not only are we introduced to the main character within seconds of the films, but we are also given a lime light into why hes called Star Lord. Chris Pratt brings, heartbreak, comedy, seriousness and romance into one giant bundle of science fiction galore. Vin deisal as the Groot and Bradley Cooper as Rocket brings warmth and comedy to the film. The dialogue is second to none and as from a viewing perspective, thinks both men brought something a little personal to the role as well, bringing their own personalities into the dialogue.

The way the movie uses music alone is enough to make it more creative than most movies you will see this year. The story, while nothing you haven't seen before, is told much better than other movies that have tried. It's similar to a "John Carter" that actually works, and the reason it works are it's amazing characters. Every actor in this movie nails it, and the characters they play are imaginative, and believable, at the same time. This is a movie that does an excellent job of making you happy, making you smile, and giving you hope. The truest complement to this movie is that it doesn't matter how much I hype it. I knew this movie would be great, and it was much better than I imagined.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Marvel gamble pays off more often than not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians Of The Galaxy is, without a doubt, the weakest Marvel Studios film yet. But it's also the most charming. It suffers because of its very simple origin story. The reasons why many people overlooked this are its likable characters, sweet retro soundtrack (the songs Come And Get Your Love by Redbone and Go All The Way by Raspberries are featured at the beginning), comedy, and impressive visuals. It's really like a colorful lollipop. Once you're done with it though there's not much to return to. Sure, people liked it when Footloose (1984) was mentioned. The whole audience laughed in the theater where I watched the film. The performances by the cast are all good. Even the supporting characters are played well, reminiscent of Maximiliano Hernandez's excellent part as Jasper Sitwell in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Among the heroes it's Dave Bautista who steals the show as the angry yet honorable Drax the Destroyer. The interesting minor touches that he brought to his performance reminded me of the way Dwayne Johnson acts in some of his roles. And Bautista's bits of comedy are some of the most effective and intelligent in the film. I think that Chris Pratt was chosen to play Star-Lord because of his looks. His performance is still good though and it's clear that he's trying, sometimes seeming forced but effective. Screenwriters James Gunn and Nicole Perlman attempted to give every character time to develop, so even Groot (Vin Diesel) gets to show that he's not just houseplant/muscle by the end of the film. The raccoon Rocket (Bradley Cooper) is another well-realized CGI creation. Rocket's uneasy life and his origin made him heartless and hard to get along with, though he is the technical wizard of the team. As Gamora, Zoe Saldana isn't really the tough female character that she says she is. But she did participate in most of the action, and her performance is one of the best in the film. Lee Pace plays the main villain, Ronan the Accuser, a character that I think was tragically underused. Along with Bautista and Saldana, Pace provides the best performance in the film. This doesn't mean much, however, because Ronan has little to do and little to say. He hardly participates in the action, something that's really unforgivable for a villain in a superhero summer blockbuster. And this brings me to another problem that I have with this film. There's a lack of thrilling action. Guardians Of The Galaxy delivers the comedy and the characterization but the action is a disappointment, comprising mostly of chases. Even the predictably big final battle offers few thrills. After the action-packed Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians Of The Galaxy seems tamed in comparison. Because of this I don't have an urge to see Guardians Of The Galaxy again. Despite the convoluted plot I commend director James Gunn for what he's done. It's definitely a film worth seeing because it brings something fresh to the scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a thrilling piece of creation!!! A great combination of conceptualization, direction, special effects and characterization with a simple but impact-full script. One of the best thing in the movie was the music score as well... a good collection of awesome Retro songs typically from the pop-era of late 70's-80's.1) Few characters in the movie are really good like that of raccoon. You are in sync with their humor. 2) The visualization is great. Depiction of galaxies and other art work. 3) a good pace oriented script. the movie does not go slow and low. It maintains the pace and delivers the thrill... 4) It's a good family movie as well... kids will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i went to this movie i thought i was going to see some other marvel heroes in a serious mission to save the galaxy with some jokes in the middle of that. But what i saw was completely the opposite. The movie is full of jokes with some action in the middle. This movie should be advertised as a comedy movie not action nor sci-fi. And don't get me wrong, i liked the movie a lot. It's full of humor and the acting is very professional and Vin diesel made a huge effort in that movie :). Chris Pratt is very convincing, i dunno where he was before Guardians of the Galaxy!. Overall, the movie is very enjoyable but it is not a standard Marvel movie. I recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

In the far reaches of space American pilot, Peter Quill, must team up with a ragtag group of misfits after he incurs the wrath of the dreaded Ronan after stealing an orb. Okay this has to be Marvels funniest movie yet. The visuals effect's in the film looked amazing and the movie made me laugh a lot. Rocket Raccoon is the best character in this movie, he was so awesome and Bradley Cooper did a great job voice the bad-ass raccoon, and the soundtrack in the movie was not only good but so amazing to listen. But they are some problems in the movie like the start I thought dragged a little bit and the villain in the movie I thought was weak just like Thor the dark world villain.</fullReview>

After seeing Guardians of the Galaxy for the first time I remembered the last scene in "Thor",(no spoiler here)This scene links the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy into different parts of a storyline that may or may not connect in the future yet lets you know that this new and exciting galaxy can be visited by at least one character that is a part of the avengers Marvel universe of super hero's.A very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not even close to what I expected. This is definitely not your standard superhero movie and it's not like any other Marvel flick.All of the main characters are misfits in one way or another and they're all likable. The humor is adult and it's extremely funny. First time in my life that anything other than a comedy made me laugh (loudly) all the way through. The film is strewn with killer one liners that had me wondering about the PG13 rating.The story line is the standard stop-the-bad-guy-save-the-world but it's not boring, the visuals are great and there's non-stop action. Zoe Saldana's fight choreography is noteworthy.If you're planning on seeing this film for the first time, wait out the credits for a little gem of visual comedy. You won't be sorry.I'm definitely going back to see this one again before it's gone from the theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Legitimate representative of the Popcorn cinema, "Guardians of the Galaxy" is the legitimate successor of movie icons strain of Indiana Jones, The Gonnies, and Back To The Future, among many others. With the foot on the accelerator stuck, Marvel makes its most perfect transposition of comics to film, and establishes itself as the largest producer of pop fiction today. Humor, adventure and fantasy make a perfect mix - and overwhelming for the eyes - the creation of a new super team of charismatic anti-heroes. That leaves sour jokes, flawless action sequences (which set a new standard of quality in the use of CGI) and an engaging and exciting environment in a way not seen such intensity, from "Iron Man" soared in theaters in 2008. Also noteworthy, the brilliant vintage soundtrack that is more than perfect in how packs such boldness, color and above all, FUN. (so even in capital letters!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comic Con is still fresh in a lot of folks minds with SOO much huge news.So much so I was worried that everyone was kind of pushing the upcoming Guardians release to the side.Thankfully this past weekend showed that Guardians is here to stay.We start on Earth with a young Peter Quill aka Star-Lord who just tragically lost his mother. Fast forward to adulthood and Star-Lord is a Pop loving,one lining,likable space scavenger.After picking up a mysterious orb and getting the attention of our other Guardians and some space Hun named Ronan the Accusor,we set off on what I can only describe is a action packed,space roller coaster with never before seen worlds,strange alien life,and Merle Dixon looking like a hillbilly version of Night Crawler in X2(Hes really awesome in this movie by the way).If you're a fan of anything sci-fi you're gonna have at least a minuscule attraction to this latest Marvel beast.Chris Pratt is great as Star-Lord.Zoe Saldana is another addition to this years amazing roster of awesome female characters.Rocket Raccoon is the big money here and STEALS THE SHOW!The villain of Ronan was decent I thought but felt like filler for Thanos.This is why i was all for Disney taking over Marvel Stud.No expense is spared here with GORGEOUS effects and action sequences.There were a lot of good use of makeup and practical effects which always reminds me of Star Wars and thats always a good thing.There were a lot of decently filmed fight sequences that really looked good.The story isn't the most original however.The whole McGuffin driven plot is used over and over again in super hero movies but thankfully the writing,the great character development and the direction really make this a unique and refreshing experience for me considering how many superhero movies I watch.While it gets all the superhero movie standards no problem,again its the humor and lets not forget the incredible soundtrack that reserves this movie a spot in my top movies of the year list.This is everything I wanted it to be.Fun,hilarious,breathtakingly sharp and I GIVE IT MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION. BUY THIS MOVIE! 9/10</fullReview>

First, no, of course, the movie doesn't re-invent anything. Yes, a lot of the happenings and events you could see in a lot of movies before. But... Yes, i was fully entertained, from the beginning 'til he end of the movie. We talked a lot of the movie, quoted a lot of jokes, laughed about them multiple times. Yes, i immediately took the intention to buy the Blu, when its out. (of course only if the BD does not completely go wrong). 3D was greatly used for that type of the movie, it was not exaggerated but still impressive and supporting for the Science Fiction plot. CGI, hmmm, yeah, of course there was a lot, its a SF movie. Some scenes are, let's say, close to the edge ( taking of the helmet in space...), but: FIRST: hey, remember, it's still SF!! SECOND: have you read some of the comics of the Guardians? The same.Summary: If you can overlook that physical Impossibilities, you will get a most exciting entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, but depends on preference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the outset I should say I love this movie. Being a MCU fan I expect a lot from Marvel, but initially on announcement of this movie I wasn't excited. It wasn't until after it was released and I was seeing the Marvel fandom getting excited about it, YouTube reviewers acclaiming it as one of the best Marvel movies, critic's loving it that I started to get excited. So I got my brother to come with me to go see it (he wanted to see Dave Bautista because he's a WWE fan) and as I've said already, I loved it. To the many, many people complaining it's overrated, calm down. It may be overrated, to you. Again opinions. Also try not to believe hype, hype is not the best judge of whether you'll like the movie or not.The plot overall was a bit weak, but I barely noticed this during the movie because of how entertaining the movie itself is. The comedy in this movie is gold, the acting spot on with a very good cast to make these characters come alive, and the soundtrack that played throughout just brought it all together. The thing about this movie for me is that it wasn't trying to be this big dark super-hero movie that had thought-provoking undertones, not that those movies aren't great but Guardian's was just a breath of fresh air in the Marvel universe. Winter Soldier was great because it had those dark undertones which I loved seeing, this isn't what Guardian's is. Guardian's is not that kind of movie, it's comical and it's almost not afraid to be cliché. It depends on personal preference but I liked the cliché moments, like they almost suit this movie in a way. It didn't take itself too seriously, because I mean come on guys they saved the planet by dancing and holding hands. But this movie did have quite big flaws. For me these flaws didn't matter as much but to some it's what ruined the movie for them. The plot for example as I've already mentioned is weak, with the Guardians being initially hostile towards each other but still wanting to defeat the villain and then they have something or someone that brings them together to fight said villain, they do and they win. Quite typical super-hero movie plot. Also a lot of the characters didn't have great development. Maybe Peter Quill, we got a twinge of backstory and a slight progression of character. I'm hoping they have a little more development in Guardian's 2 in 3 years time. The villain itself was also weak, the 'I'm evil because you know I can be' type of villain'. Then again Marvel isn't known for having great villains. A lot of user reviews I've read are quite mixed, with some being quite harsh and some calling it the best movie ever. I can see where the harsher reviewers are coming from. Just like with all movies it depends on the person, there are some movies that are just great and a majority of people like it, and though I originally thought this was the case for Guardian's it seemingly isn't. I know many people who loved this movie and many who didn't. Overall I was entertained, it was fun to watch and just an enjoyable experience for me. For anybody who hasn't seen it yet (depending on where you live you may be running out of time to see it in theater's) go in with an open mind. Don't take our point of views and turn them into high expectations. You may love it, you may not love it, either way don't be a bad sport about it.</fullReview>

Well its just the start of new trilogy so its a fair treat for a start. I was expecting it to be more fun from Bradly Cooper, More action from Van Diesel and Batista. And to be more touching. it lacks a a good story line , well who cares. Was good enough to spend two hours in the Cinema.

		<fullReview>I've read a lot of comments about the movie as a whole, however I went to the theater without reading them first, since I wanted a fresh look on the movie and be surprised by it. I went with no expectations, except for the fact that some friends had recommended it and that it was a Marvel movie, who in the past years have released some of the best blockbusters to date. I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed.The movie is a fun experience, full of great characters with a lot of charisma. Rocket Racoon and Groot were awesome in every scene they were in, and for me made for much of the movie great comedy and you couldn't get your eyes out of them. Chris Pratt, Batista and Zoe Saldana were also great in their roles, and though some times you felt some of the scenes a bit forced, the acting, the action and the plot let you pass over the minor faults. The easter eggs we are used to see in Marvel movies were also fun to watch and look for.As for the plot itself, many people criticize it, however, it's like they were looking for the next Star Wars, or even 2001 Space Odissey, and this movie's plot is very simple and straightforward, so you can get involved in the inner turmoil of the characters without having to think too much about other things which would have taken so much of the fun. The actions scenes were great and well paced, and the special effects were top notch. I recommend going to this movie to have fun, to enjoy a good time, and to discover a whole other part of the marvel universe, which is certain to bring a lot of more colorful characters and awesome stories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is more than a simple awesome movie. It delivers mixed feelings in a wonderful blend of drama, comedy, Sci- Fi and action.The characters are also very well crafted and entertaining. The dialogues flow delightfully while surprising main traits of each character, which you soon come to not only learn but also love.The plot is well thought, with no holes that I am aware of, at least. It's not difficult to follow, but still interesting and a bit mind challenging. There is no lack of questions you'll start putting yourself about many dramatic events. And you will certainly enjoy how events occur, without being cheesy at all.The ending... leaves you very satisfied.But the best part about this movie is the soundtrack. The reason I went to the cinema and saw it TWICE. It gives you goosebumps, especially if you recognize some of the songs. And it's not just background music to the film, it's actually a part of the plot!All in all, this IS a must see title for everyone who likes drama, action, comedy, romance, science fiction... in short, for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"So here we are: a thief, two thugs, an assassin and a maniac. But we're not going to stand by as evil wipes out the galaxy. I guess we're stuck together, partners." Peter Quill (Chris Pratt)Quill, the thief among the "Guardians" pretty much sums up the rag- tag heroes of the summer's entertaining sci-fi spoof?even if you don't take my word, believe that with several hundred million dollars of tickets, the box office champ is funny. With its tongue firmly placed in its cheek, Guardians of the Galaxy is an amusing, lighthearted take on just about any space opera you have seen, Star Wars being the touchstone for characters and laughs.It's the same-as-always wacky mission for these societal rejects? save the galaxy and they save their reputations and themselves from jail time. Quill leads four misfits: Gamora (Zoe Saldana?she is sinfully attractive!), Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper as a raccoon), Groot (Voice of Vin Diesel as a tree and sinfully underused), and Drax (Dave Bautista at his bulked best). The plot is so convoluted you'd need some of the computer power behind the graphics to make sense of it. But coherence is not the point? this is a summer fantasy better than most because it doesn't take itself seriously. The smart dialogue may be best expressed in this exchange:Gamora: "And Quill... Your ship is filthy."Peter Quill: "She has no idea. If I had a blacklight, this place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting."Does that mean it's superficial? Absolutely. Silly? You bet. Entertaining? Obi-Wan Kenobi would approve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I see a rating of near 9/10 I expect the best. It was fast, nonstop and edited well but the story had me in disbelief more than it should have, even for a sci-fi comedy. Like most movies made for American audiences scenes are 1-5 seconds long, stitched together into a 90 minute movie. Everything works out no matter how crazy the situation gets. It reminded me of the first Fantastic Four movies with better editing and a little better dialogue.While it's worth seeing I wouldn't give it "Ranked #52 in the top 250" here at IMDb. I feel like it got a boost from where it should be, closer to 7/10. Edge of Tomorrow was better and it only scored a more accurate 8.1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a comedy, not a drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is an OK to good movie and worth the money you spend on seeing it, especially in 3D: The visual effects are great for the most part and the visual art is next to perfect: Fantastic new worlds (especially Xander), great looking 3D and special effects and exciting camera moves would make for a world class movie.However -and to me that's a big letdown- the whole movie seems somewhat unrealized: After a fantastic start, the story becomes more and more predictable and uninteresting. It starts with the much too long and unneeded prison scene, which in particular holds up the whole movie and potential plot development. Tragically, from that moment on, the movie never really recovers, as we basically get to see one battle/action sequence after the other, with no meaningful, interesting or surprising story to unfold. Also, I felt that -although I had some very good laughs- sometimes the humor was used in an attempt to save the whole movie. Furthermore, we are bombarded with too many names of characters, especially by some that play little to no role in the movie, which left me confused and uneasy. Maybe, if you have seen all the MARVEL films or read the comics, this in fact does make sense, but to me, it does not. All in all I felt that the movie could/should have been so much better than it actually was. It had all the ingredients to be the absolute highlight of the year (or maybe even of all time), had it just had a better story, or -at least- would it have been a completely hilarious spoof. I cannot help but think that this must be one of the biggest opportunities missed in the whole movie history! Hence, I give it 6,5/10, -7/10 rounded up- as this is probably a great movie for kids and teenagers, but definitely not for adults. For a comedy, it tries a little bit too hard at times and the serious moments don't fit, and for a drama/serious film, it misses depth in story and characters. Also, I feel that there are too many main characters in order to give them enough screen time to develop, especially that wrestler was ridiculously one dimensional, although he had some funny lines.So, if you are up for a very, very light science fiction/action movie with stunning visuals and quite a bit of funny dialogue, then Guardians of the Galaxy is for you.However, if you are looking for the next Star Wars/Blade Runner/Fith Element (which was my expectation after reading some of the comments here), I cannot recommend this film, as the other movies are much, much better. GotG however can't decide what it wants to be and therefore falls short. What a pity!One final word: Please don't compare this movie to Star Wars folks, it just shows that you haven't got the slightest clue that Star Wars has a much deeper meaning that goes beyond a few battles and stunning visuals. So don't make a fool of yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most fun to be had all year, perhaps the decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the rights to Marvel's other vast array of T-shirt adorned superheroes, such as Spider-Man and the X-Men, firmly in the clutches of other studios (who are reaping in the gazillions), Marvel - now combined with the surprisingly un-meddling might of the House of Mouse - are finding themselves having to turn to some of their more left-field, obscure creations. They don't come as unfamiliar as the Guardians of the Galaxy, a group of rag-tag criminals and rogues who operate millions of miles away from Earth and the Avengers, a gang no doubt familiar to hardcore comic-book fans, but little more than a collection of strange looking aliens and one human to the rest of us.It's a massive surprise, then, that Guardians of the Galaxy may be Marvel's best movie to date, eclipsing the unexpected charm of Iron Man (2008), the easy-going chemistry of The Avengers (2012) and the formula- flipping breath of fresh air that was Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014). Director James Gunn, the man responsible for the fun Slither (2006) and the twisted Super (2010), knows that you probably don't know these people, but he makes sure you'll remember them. A combination of risky, but spot-on casting, a well-structured, incredibly witty script by Gunn and Nicole Perlman, and feast-for-your-eyes cinematography by Ben Davis, makes this the most fun to be had all year, perhaps even the decade.After being abducted as a child shortly after watching his mother die, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) now operates as a space bounty hunter, working for space-hillbilly Yondu (Michael Rooker) and trying to go by the name of Star-Lord. When he steals a mysterious orb and almost getting killed in the process, he betrays Yondu and tries to rake in the bounty for himself. This draws the attention of Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the green- skinned adopted daughter of space tyrant Thanos (glimpsed in the credits of The Avengers, and here played by Josh Brolin), who attempts to steal the orb for herself.Also in the vicinity and hoping to capture Quill for the reward money, are Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a foul-mouthed, gun-wielding raccoon, and his companion Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), a self regenerating tree. The four get into a scuffle and find themselves imprisoned by Nova Corps, where they come across tattooed man-mountain Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), a man with a serious grudge against Gamora's boss Ronan (Lee Pace), who killed his wife and children. Though the group clash due to ego-fuelled personalities, grudges and personal demons, they may be the only thing standing between Ronan and the orb, the latter of which holds almost infinite power which Ronan plans to use to fuel his own genocidal tendencies.The orb just may be the most obvious MacGuffin in cinema history (Quill even references The Maltese Falcon (1941), one of the most famous examples), and the plot sometimes whizzes by without giving you time to reflect or allow it all to sink in, but it's really hard to care when all you really want is to see these five characters in a room together, and if they happen to blow a lot of s**t up at the same time, then all the better for it. The real success is the casting. Han Solo comparisons are obvious, but to lump Chris Pratt's star-making performance into the same bubble as Harrison Ford's iconic space cowboy is lazy and unfair. Quill is a lovable idiot, tough enough to face up to a fight, intelligent enough to always carry tricks up his sleeve, and flawed enough to make us care.Racoon and Groot, one of the most adorable and effortlessly hilarious couplings in recent memory, will no doubt be the ones that the kids take away from the film, but it's Bautista, a WWE wrestler in his first major role, who truly stands out. He serves as the real emotional core in the film, initially fuelled by hatred and rage, but gradually learning the importance of friendship and camaraderie. Drax's failure to grasp sarcasm and metaphors also shows a deft comic timing, made even funnier by the man's imposing stature and gift of the scowl.The film trips up on Marvel's usual struggle to deliver a climatic action scene that truly thrills or even offer anything original, but it's the first time I found myself genuinely concerned about a superhero's fate, all five of them in fact. It's a thrilling, beautiful, hilarious, and just plain weird movie, all scored to some great funky tunes from the 1970's (usually blasted through Quill's 'Awesome Mix Tape #1', which he listens to on his retro walkman, one of the few things he has left from Earth). The two hour running-time will feel like barely half the film has gone by by the time the credits begin to roll, and the inevitable sequel (the film is now the highest-grossing of a summer that involved the fourth entry into Michael Bay's CGI-ejaculation Transformers franchise) can't come soon enough.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of a Cool Galaxy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel comics is the greatest comic books company of all time. They own the most famous characters (Spider-Man, Iron Man etc.) representing a pantheon of legends, most of them created by Stan Lee, who changed the history of comics forever. Good stories, characters with human features you could relate to, even though they were extremely powerful. All of this plus a good share of humor if possible (Spider-Man sarcasm is legendary) is the trademark of the Marvel empire. Now this empire has become a film empire, and given those treats, they have great material for decades. And I want to be there to see it... Abducted as a child in the late 80's, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is now a grown-up space pirate who calls himself "Star-Lord". When he steals an orb, he becomes a fugitive chased by demigods like Thanos, alien race Lords like Ronan and some other nice people around he will have to ally with. Chris Pratt is Quill, a not so cool captain as the Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) from Firefly (Joss Whedon, 2002-03), but with enough charisma to lead the party. Bradley Cooper is Rocket, a bad-ass raccoon with anger issues and Vin Diesel is Groot, a suave alien tree. The rest of the band is Zoe Saldana as Gamora, an assassin that deep down is a lovely lady and Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, a well-spoken goon. It is quite a fun cast to be honest. Like I said before, this is entertainment in Marvel fashion, action packed films, loads of fun, and as a bonus, an awesome soundtrack, which will cheer you up anytime. To be honest, mainstream tends to be vulgar, and abuse of CGI is a must nowadays, but not always. Sometimes, though, when you let go and just enjoy the ride, it's great, and much more if there is a good story, entertaining, not pretentious and impeccably made. That is pure entertainment, that is cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great western that is not a western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am thankful to the makers of this film for providing me with the emotions I thought were lost in the westerns of the past. Rio Bravo, Gunfight at the OK Corral and even Sergio Leone are present here. From the heartbreaking scene of the dying mother extending her hand, to the comradeship that is established between the main characters you are in for a fascinating fantastic trip. Chris Pratt is Quill, a cool, charismatic hero, slyer than an Indiana Jones. Zoe Saldana is a tough Gamora and it is enjoyable to see her become more human. The raccoon is amazing, he is the brains of the group, and the Tree is the heart. This film is deservedly becoming the top box office of the summer, and my advice is: rush to see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Marvel movie! Better than The Avengers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It simply does not get better than this! Believe the critics! It really is the Star Wars of this generation! Once the movie begins, you instantly get attached to these characters (Starlord, Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket). My favorite is Groot. This summer has been Marvel's high point. First, there was Cap 2. Second, there was Spidey 2. Third, there was X-Men. Fourth is Guardians. I went into this movie without high hopes. I certainly didn't expect to say it was my favorite Marvel movie. But, anyway. The character development is great in this movie. The characters are all very interesting. The villain, Ronan the Accuser, is probably the weakest link of the movie. He's really creepy and strange. I enjoyed his character, but he still wasn't that great. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely worth your time, whether or not if your a superhero movie buff. I don't think I've ever wanted a sequel for a movie so bad in my whole life!P.S. This movie has one of the happiest endings to a movie that I've ever seen. Also, stay after the credits!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It shouldn't work - but it does (and how)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It really shouldn't work: a sci-fi, super-hero movie with an utterly bizarre set of five characters - the guardians of the title. There's Quill (Chris Pratt), the only human, an Indiana Jones/Hans Solo type with a devil-may-care attitude to all danger; next up we have Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a green-skinned woman with special martial skills who seems to have wandered in from the set of "Avatar"; then there's Drax (Dave Bautista) with huge muscles, multi-coloured skin and a habit of taking comments literally; even more outrageously we have Groot (Vin Diesel in motion-capture), a tree - yes, a tree - with lots of branches but only a three-word vocabulary (remind you of Chewbacca?); and finally - my favourite - there's a talking raccoon with attitude called Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a little fella with some BIG guns.And yet, work it does - but how? Well, visually it's an absolute treat - different worlds, buildings, vehicles and weapons, the magic of deep space, and lots and lots of colour. I saw the film in 3D on an IMAX screen and it sucked me in. Plot-wise, it's all a bit confusing - lots of complicated names and something to do with a mysterious metal orb - but the whole thing zings along so speedily, it just doesn't matter. Perhaps, above all, it is quite simply fun - it is a rollicking escapade with lots of humorous one-liners and funny situations. At the end of the credits (as well as the usual extra clip in Marvel movies), we have an assurance that no trees were harmed in the making of the film as well as the promise that the guardians will be back (I'll be waiting).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Consensus: Once the movie gets going it is truly a fun ride for all generations. This is what a superhero movie should really be.Expectations: When I first saw the trailer I thought "Wow, this looks like a huge piece of crap. Just when I was thinking that there are too many superhero movies Marvel comes along with this." Even when they talked to the cast in the extended previews I thought it looked crap. The Good: One major thing I have with movies these days are that they are so overly pretentious. For instance while I loved Nolan's The Dark Knight I did think it took itself a little too seriously, this was even more of the issue in The Dark Knight Rises. Therefore I am happy to say that this one was not. It is lighthearted the whole way through with tons of jokes (for the young and old) to remind you that this is a superhero movie. Furthermore the biggest potential problems with the film (talking animals and shrubbery) are undoubtedly some of the most entertaining parts of the film. The action too, in small doses can be fun too. The Bad: Now while the movie is lighthearted and full of jokes, this does severely affect the plot which lead to numerous annoyances and a few clichés. For instance why does Starlord's mother have to die? They could have had him abducted in a far more entertaining way that fits the rest of the movie. Furthermore the gift that his mother gives on her deathbed, why couldn't it have just been a birthday gift or something? The "villain" is very stereotypical and unmemorable so much that I don't even remember his name (Ronin or something?). What the heck is Groot doing when he kills himself? Also how does it save the others? Additionally we KNOW that he is somehow going to come back to life. I am also not sure how the ball thing works as it is very inconsistent about how the power in it works. The action scenes sometimes feel blaring, over killed and tiring. You overall won't care very much about the plot and at no point believe there is any danger in them failing. Occasionally you may get a little bored and be waiting for the next joke thrown at you. Final Thoughts: Overall this movie was great and I highly recommend you see it if you haven't yet. It is funny, entertaining and has an overall lightheartedness that makes you never worry too much about the plot and it's errors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of 2014.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We went not knowing what to expect from Guardians of the Galaxy. In short, this may be the most fun and best directed film of 2014.The casting was great and the usual over-indulgence in sfx (Transformers/Iron Man 3 etc.) is kept to a minimum...or at least does not become the raison d'etre of the entire film.If you are concerned about Rocket Raccoon taking over the picture then let me assure you that he does steal a lot of scenes but the director has wisely had the other characters develop themselves instead of being props for the next raccoon witticism.The story moves at a good pace. Neither hurtling along at breakneck speed or languishing at the mid-section like some of its' Marvel cousins.Often funny, always absorbing, this is definitely one for the collection.</fullReview>

Awesome Soundtracks. 2.) Awesome actions. 3.) Awesome characters. 4.) Awesome Universe. 5.) Awesome Effects. 6.) Awesome Story. 7.) I am Groot... i mean, funny comedy.I'm not a 'pro-reviewer', so everything i wrote here was from my own experience after watching this movie.When the cinema is full of people who want to watch a movie, and they can get carried away with every scenes in the movie, then you can say the movie is "Great".Everyone in theater was laughing when Quill said his funny dialogs, or when Groot's talking. And cries when Rocket's crying. So, based on that and my personal judgment, i can say that this movie is the best since The Avengers (2012).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rollicking great space adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone has suggested that this film seemed to be a truncated version of Star Wars, but I must admit that I did not find it to be like that, but what this film does do is that it takes the Marvel Universe into space. Okay, while I would consider that pretty much all of the superhero orientated movies these days fall into the category of science-fiction, this film is also what one would consider to be a Space Opera, and a pretty good one at that.Don't expect this film to be deep in meaning, or have much in the way of any take away value because it doesn't, and it does not pretend to be. It is simply a really enjoyable ride with everything that you would expect from a science-fiction movie ? it has a plethora or strange aliens (though in many cases the aliens simply have different coloured skin, similar to the Star Trek aliens who all have funny protrusions on their face); massive space battles; journeys to strange and unusual planets; and of course the ubiquitous quest to save the galaxy.This film is the next in line for the Marvel universe series, and as I have suggested elsewhere, I like how they are creating this series in a sense that they are not really sequels per se but stand-alone films that can be watched without having watched the previous ones (though I must admit that Iron Man III fell down in that regard because there were numerous references to the Avengers so that if you had not seen that movie you would have been a little confused, and Thor: The Dark World was also like that as well). Guardians of the Galaxy takes a step back and while there are still a couple of elements that connect it with the previous movies (namely The Collector who was given an 'Infinity Stone' at the end of Thor: The Dark World) it is pretty much a stand alone film.What was also cool about this film is that it was a lot more light hearted that some of the other films in the series, especially with the introduction of Groot, who happens to be a not to bright sentient plant creature (played by Vin Diesel and only ever speaking the line 'I am Groot' ? though it comes out later that he is only ever able to communicate by saying 'I am Groot' and only his companion Rocket is able to understand him). Apparently in the comics there are a number of other members of the group known as 'The Guardians of the Galaxy' which appears to be headed up by the self styled 'Star Lord', aka Peter Quinn. So, when you have a bunch of not to bright nitwits thrown together who call themselves 'The Guardians of the Galaxy' you are likely to shake your head and grown with everybody else wondering how these people are going to finish up as heroes ? well, all I can say is that this is Hollywood, and as we can expect from Hollywood that all of these rag tag, not to great individuals will generally always end up saving the day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I frequently ask myself the question, If I could only watch one movie for the rest of my life, what would it be? Guardians of the Galaxy would definitely be up at the top of the list of movies for consideration. It's hard to tell you about all the good things about this movie. It's even harder to find any bad things about this movie. I experienced the time in which I laughed the hardest I have ever laughed in a movie theater while watching this movie. It is the best superhero movie since The Dark Knight. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for action, compelling characters, a great story, lovable characters, or even a laugh. There are moments of darker and more inappropriate humor that older audiences will appreciate and that younger audiences won't even notice. From Footloose references and a comical Stan Lee cameo to the spectacular characters and the great storytelling, I am anticipating the next installment of this series more than The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron.</fullReview>

Screw it. This film ticks all the boxes.

Not even The Raid Redemption did this. I mean I know this film won't exactly be a a well kept secret, but still. I HAVE TO SHOUT IT OUT. WATCH! THIS FILM! It's awesome. If you're somewhere between 25 and 45 it'll hit you right in the childhood, while featuring all the action and SFX from titles like Avengers Assemble, and while avoiding common mistakes that are being made in most action films (like boring 5 minutes fights before any villain kicks the bucket).

		<fullReview>There seems to be a lot of hype going for this movie. I personally thought it was a good movie, but also thought it was a bit overrated. Some even claim this is the best Marvel movie so far...I have to disagree with that one. However this combines well developed character for a movie of this sort, that is incorporated well into the comic book, story-wise. This movie actually give all the main character in the crew to shine, which just doesn't applies to a lot of movies of this sort *cough* "The Expendables". So when it comes down to it the build up of the main team and how they get together and become a team is done well and I actually was interested in all the members of the crew, especially when it came to Rocket and Peter Quill. The action sequences are done well, nothing that I found to be groundbreaking, but it didn't seem mindless like "Transformers: Age of Extinction". Overall this is entertaining flick that combines elements from other sci-fi movies that deals with crew members and it's done well. Overall this is a good popcorn flick that is worth checking out.7.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quickie Review:Peter Quill a.k.a. Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) comes into possession of a mysterious orb that the ruthless Ronan the Accuser is seeking out. A bounty is placed on Quill, resulting in him crossing paths with Gamora (Zoe Saldana) an assassin, Drax (Dave Bautista) a brute, Groot (Vin Diesel) a walking tree and Rocket (Bradley Cooper) a talking raccoon. Their adventures together strengthen the bonds amongst them and they go on to form the most bizarre team, Guardians of the Galaxy. The biggest risk Marvel Studios has taken since even conceptualizing their cinematic universe is helmed by the director James Gunn, who couldn't be more perfect for the job. This is by the far one of the most unique comic book movies that has ever graced the silver screens. With incredible visuals, soundtrack, comedy, and characters, this is a thrill ride that is relentlessly awesome and entertaining. An experience that should not be missed.Full Review:To call this movie a risk back in 2012 because of the non-existent popularity, is putting it lightly. Now it's finally released in 2014 and this risk has paid off big time thanks to its distinctive take on the comic book genre.The best thing about this movie is the Guardians team. Every single one of them is memorable, and relevant to the team and the story. They are not just likable, they are lovable! Star-Lord is bound to become to a classic cinematic hero in the future. The best way I could describe him is that he is the love child of Han Solo and Indiana Jones, and I mean that without exaggeration. Gamora is a great rich and complex character. You can tell there is lot more to her that we don't know, but enough information is given to us that she is fully fleshed out. Drax was a surprise to me because Dave Bautista is not exactly the best actor, but I thought he delivered on the physicality and the deadpan humor of the character effectively. Ah Groot, it is astonishing how this character is better-rounded than most other characters in Hollywood movies, even with his limited vocabulary rivaled only by Hodor of Game of Thrones. Still, the one that stole the show, Rocket Raccoon! Who knew so much badassery can be contained in a talking raccoon? More importantly there is actually an emotional depth behind this gun-toting, wisecracking creature.Beyond the characters, what made this movie work is the overall tone and atmosphere. Again if I used another analogy, Guardians of the Galaxy is like Star Wars on acid (don't do drugs kids). It's visually bright, colorful and absolutely stunning. The movie doesn't bog itself down with overly dramatic brooding moments. In fact, even during the direst of situations comedic moments would sneak through and catch you off-guard, but you'll be genuinely laughing out loud. I think I may have missed some jokes because I was still laughing at something funny that happened previously. The soundtrack, wow, I loved the use of retro classics. It gave the movie its own character and flair.The only problem I have is with Ronan. Once again Guardians of the Galaxy has fell into the Marvel trap of weak villains (excluding Loki and Winter Soldier of course). He is just means to give the story a conflict. There is nothing more beyond the fact that he is evil because well? he is evil.So if you can't tell already, I thoroughly enjoyed Guardians of the Galaxy. It surpassed all my high expectations. This has already been an amazing year for blockbusters and Marvel delivered us on yet another gem (yes horrible pun intended). So don't miss out on the most unique comic book movie ever that is also one of Marvel Studio's best.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

I don't know who I would say be my favorite character.The actors did a great job in this movie. I love some of the hilarious one-liners delivered by the characters, especially from the raccoon. One of my favorites was the repeated line from the "tree" character "I am groot", aside from the raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) the tree was probably the funniest character of the five. This is the best movie I've seen this summer and probably not one that's worth missing (10/10).</fullReview>

But I think it is one of Marvel's worst. It had a lot of potential and I really loved the characters. But for me, there was no character development or plot development. It was basically a story of... a bad guy wants to blow up the galaxy and he EASILY can by the way... but because of 5 people that are much weaker than him, stop him. I don't know, if it didn't have a 9 on here. I may have appreciated it more. But it definitely wasn't better than any other Marvel movie I can think of. But I enjoyed the comedy and the actors. and I also enjoyed the villain. And the special effects were amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somehow, the hype train didn't roll straight over this one. It's just as good as advertised. With so many chiseled jaws and grim, determined brows crowding the superhero scene over the last ten years, I think we really needed a film like this to remind us of how much great, loose fun the genre can still be. In fact, even calling it a superhero movie may be something of a stretch - it spans a number of different classes, plucking fitting elements from each and packing them down into a beautifully odd, curious, colorful bouquet. It's as much Star Wars or Indiana Jones as it is Thor, a glowing hunk of sci-fi and adventure with no taste for restraint and a ticklish funny bone that really sets it apart. Having read comics for most of my life, I know how uncommon it is to see a filmed adaptation that even nears the kind of boundless imagination possible on the printed page. In this, too, Guardians of the Galaxy is a gust of fresh air - at all times, the screen brims with rich detail, superior dashes of inconsequential world-building and oodles of hints and winks. It's as close as I think Hollywood has ever come to flashing the sense of joy and wonder inherent in that medium to a broader audience, a real treat to drink in and enjoy. I can't help but admire the balls it took to go this far into left field, to create something so wholly different from the present status quo. Admire, that is, and appreciate. What a ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i am not much of superhero fan i like Marvel movies, DC Comics Movies i loved this movie so much with great characters perfect Main Character was (Chris Pratt)Peter Quill / Star-Lord was awesome ! playing character like Han Solo flying ship but without Chewbacca, who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil warlord Ronan. when he find Assassin his top assassin, the green- skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana) was awesome as Character i always loved Zoe Saldana because she was always great best actor from Avatar (2010), Losers (2010) Colombia (2012) was awesome next kick ass action girl star plays as An orphan from an alien world who was trained by Thanos to be his personal assassin and seeks redemption from her past crimes She betrayed Ronan. she is not Villain but she is on Team on Guardians of Galaxy to recover the artifact, the pair find themselves locked up, In Prison along with the galaxy's most unlikely bounty hunters ? a gun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper)was awesome to have he was funny in scenes he was so good with the dialog in movie (Rocket) has a lot of laughs, with the best dialogues sidekick (Vin Diesel) who just happens to be a tree like humanoid saying i am GROOT i thought he was going to say something different but Vin Diesel one of My Favorite Actors has a very easy script just saying i am Groot because he is not human he is a Humanoid Tree he don't know talking good like people talk so his Vocabulistics is limited to 'I' and 'am' and 'Groot,' exclusively in that order.Diesel was playing with another actor from Riddick (2013)(Dave Batista) Drax the Destroyer Before Dave become actor he was a Wrestler, MMA Fighter appeared in several direct-to-video films since 2009 to Big Budget movies like Man With Iron Fists, Riddick 3rd Movie, Guardians of Galaxy he was a A warrior in search of vengeance against Ronan after his family was killed. he was fighting again with Vin Diesel like in Riddick was good but it didn't go long good to see these 2 actors playing in movie again he is my favorite character in movie he was best the best Action Fight scenes were awesome with him kicking ass expect he did a lot more then Riddick (2013)because he wanted to do more in this movie apart form Riddick it wasn't bad idea because he wasn't part of it i love Drax Dialong has a lot of laughs, witty dialogue, characters The characters are really well presented were interesting and easy to like All of them have great moments and keep us wanting for more and more. you feel sorry for characters a lot movie is a bit sad including that what makes characters good and interesting their emotional core is stronger and back stories The film doesn't take itself very seriously, which was refreshing to see after also great yet darker Picture of film themes of Thor and Captain America. the characters were based on Avengers and Thor: Dark world the The Collector was in movie so this movie is based to another Marvel movies i hopefully to see Guardians of Galaxy Meet Avengers that would be a BIG Movie entertaining, non-stop adventure but which i was thank full for this movie when i am big fan of Vin Diesel,Dave Batista, Zoe Saldana is still Beautiful as character playing as Avatar to Alien in Guardians of Galaxy my top movie in (2014) with great Dialogue, lots of humor, soundtrack was nice, story exciting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians: clash of cultures?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy gives a three way clash of cultures between civilized folks of Xandar, "Guardians of the Galaxy" and Ronan the Accuser (Kree religion fanatic). The Guardians of the Galaxy are outcasts &amp; criminals and yet possess what it takes to win the fight to protect Xandarian civilization when Ronan declares war on the Xandarian culture. Peter Quill, code name 'Star-Lord' presents as a rogue, crazy and struggling treasure thief that laughs at carnivorous lizards and holds them like a microphone. Yet, Quill has a 'Raison d'etre' in his soundtrack. Ronan the Accuser racketeers with Thanos and his daughters in secret pacts, whereas Xandarians are seen as Egalitarians who oppress and incarcerate the Guardians of the Galaxy at the Kyln Prison.When Ronan attacks Xandar, Nova Prime sends the troops up in a blockade without much firepower and declares, "Our priority is to get out people away from battle." In other words, to heck with fighting, that's for barbarians and beneath the Xandarians. Ronan, however, thinks a former peace treaty is "tinder on which you burn." The savior of the day turns out to be Groot, who seems to have none of the Xandarian's intellect and yet performs miracles and usually says, "I am Groot," and eventually "We are Groot." By the end of the movie we see Quill is on an unintentional voyage of self discovery and finds he is half human and half ancient being, complete with a hybrid nervous system in his chest. In closing scenes, the Xandarians display redemption by expunging the criminal records of the Guardians. Drax and Rocket elucidate on deep philosophy of how they naturally think 'stealing might be OK if you want it more', or why would murder be illegal? Drax and Rocket are clearly not ready for civilization, and in fact think some aspects of civilization are silly, but not like Ronan who actually hated the Xandarian culture. Nevertheless, the policeman Dorian Day tries to explain the laws of society, almost acknowledging the laws are for a greater strength of society. Yet the Guardians continue to pick and choose their laws in the final scenes, deciding if they should next do something good or bad or a little of both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing story, amazing characters. 10 of 10 really deserved.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easy to follow story about 5 amazing characters, not at all like SF Chronicle reviewer. The different places the group visits are detailed and can supply movie stories of their own, being so incredible detailed. By now as this review is a week late, you have heard of the 5 heroes, and please believe they are amazing. The pair of Rocket and Groot are the best, supplying the humor, but also deep caring for each other and strangers.I hope after seeing this story you will agree.Not many 10 of 10 movies made but this is one I highly recommend.P.S. More details for upcoming Avengers movie, and a great cameo of an old Marvel character - that floored so many people.The credits are also amazing - and that is something I never have said! The credits! "No raccoon or tree was hurt in the making of this movie" Amazing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk through the Space Park</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't one of those movies which makes you feel like an exclusive species throughout while watching it or a movie where you keep 'wowing' on numerous twists and turns, anticipating what happens next, only to get it wrong. However this is a movie which has a 'Weirdness Quotient' in it. The 1st 15 odd minutes do not appear to be heading in any particular direction. Certain things remain unexplained but later on, the pieces move into one direction, the script builds and catches up beautifully. This movie has lot of good stuff: action, emotions, Comedy (yes a lot of comedy) but there is a sense of incompleteness. The movie is nothing like The Dark Knight or the Avengers as i read in many of the reviews before going to watch the movie. The script is fairly predictable and there are few surprise elements in the movie. The movie has a good presentation. I am calling the movie weird not because of the characters but because of the story. I would not specify any examples and ruin by giving any spoilers. Overall not a great movie for sure, but definitely a good watchable movie. And if you plan to watch, make sure you do so in Imax (in Normal 3D theaters, the visuals; which consist mostly of space scenes; were a bit subdued)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious comedy with spectacular action and a whole lot of heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ciaran's Review:I remember when i first saw GotG open with a nine, with positive reviews and then opening with 160 million dollars worldwide i was amazed and it was at this point that i made the decision to go watch this movie. Did i make the right decision? Yes. Guardians of the Galaxy's story line is one that is intriguing, it follows quite an ordinary structure (in terms of a bunch of outcasts come to form a powerful team), but it is what happens in this structure that is so intriguing. The film doesn't waste anytime building character, and they really nailed building characters, throughout the whole film you feel connected to the characters, which is what film is all about, feeling connected to the story and characters who experience it and GotG managed to do this so well, and that is one reason why it is one of the best films of this year. Now, when i saw that James Gunn the writer of the Scooby-Doo films was writing and directing i was worried, but when i saw the film apparently i had nothing to worry about, as the directing was smooth and enjoyable to watch, he didn't have any weird camera angles, at times you did notice the odd camera angle but for the most part you forgot who the director was, i personally think that Guardians of the Galaxy is James Gunn's best film and i think he will overtime become known for it. Onto acting, when i saw the cast for GotG, i thought it could work, and it really did work, Chris Pratt was the best fit, he had humor and he played his character well, Zoe Saldana was the only person who could play Gamora, she was fast and witty, Dave Bautista is perhaps the best wrestler to movie star to hit our screens since the rock, he aced his performance as Drax, Vin Disel's voice suited Groot, and Bradley Cooper as Rocket, i really think Cooper stole the show, when Rocket was on screen you watched him and listened to him, even when he wasn't on screen you wanted to see Rocket, i really believe he stole the show. Now there is one thing i had a problem with and that is Ronan the Accuser, as a villain his motives were quite average, and i think if he had been written to have a bit more comedy, he would have worked as a character, other than that, Lee Pace really made the character his own. Onto CGI and let me tell you, at no point in this movie did the CGI look cheap, the whole way through the CGI was convincing, so well done to GotG's effects department for pulling off these great results. Now the soundtrack in this movie i have one word for it 'awesome', every song suited the situation, it tied the whole movie together, i think if you removed the soundtrack from this movie and replaced it, i think the whole movie would just not have the same emotional feel because the soundtrack is so important in this film. To sum it all up, Guardians of the Galaxy is a hilarious comedy with spectacular action and a whole lot of heart, and that is why Guardians of the Galaxy is getting a 9/10 from me.Jacob: The trailers to this movie made it appear that it was something different and possibly more quirky than any of the other previous installments to the Marvel cinematic universe. The trailer gave me hope although I was not heavily anticipating the release. The reviews came in with overwhelming positive reaction with people already quoting the movie and a tremendous U.S box office result. With all honesty, I loved every moment of this movie, even the tired Marvel tropes. How so? The movie glorifies familiarity and the odd, outlandish characters and scenarios. The villain is a generic megalomaniac but is somewhat comedic because he is so power hungry and silly in his motivation. The McGuffin plot was to be expected and it is a generic super-powerful object but it did little to annoy me when it came to triteness. The film is incredibly self aware, funny and surprisingly engaging. The movie has a sweet centre, a real emotional core which invests you with every character. I gained a sort of outlook on this movie: this is a mixture of everything that fan-boys and fan-girls will love. It has a Star Wars, Star Trek, Avengers, Indiana Jones, Uncharted feel to it. Chris Pratt was so likable just as well as the remaining cast members. I have little more to say but 9/10. I AM GROOT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Outcasts Got It Right!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Guardians of the Galaxy" is a series of comics from Marvel that since its inception, have had a vast series of characters and featured the more obscure species and locations of their universe. When creating something so ambitious, that will pretty much carry Marvel forward all the way to their inevitable "Phase 3" series of movies. A lot of film-makers could buckle under such pressure, especially when the movie does not feature such well known characters. James Gunn has done a fantastic job in taking these outcasts, and thrusting them into the light through sly comedic timing and taking these misfits who shouldn't work together, work together.Peter Quill (Chris Pine) is abducted as a child by aliens and 26 years later, he roams the universe as self proclaimed outlaw "Star-Lord". Upon plundering a mysterious orb, there are many people who want it for their own means be it profit or destruction. This attracts the attention of Gamora (Zoe Saldana), adoptive daughter of the mad titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) and both Groot (Vin Diesel) &amp; Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper), who want Quill's bounty. All of them end up in prison where they come across Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), and from then on all five of them escape and try to find out the secrets of the orb. Hopefully before the pursuing villains Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) &amp; Nebula (Karen Gillan) seize control of it.It's wonderfully casted, and all out fun from beginning to end. My only complaint with the story is that Peter's origin with his mother is entirely different from the original source material, and it really isn't all that interesting or compelling when it's reincorporated later. Thankfully it doesn't hinder the story much, or underwhelm any of the solid acting, hilarious pop culture and great music choices that build up the movies soundtrack. The visual effects are fantastic, and the lack of mentioning Earth really helps build upon how far away they are from where all other Marvel movies are set. Bradley Cooper pretty much steals the show with his voice performance as Rocket, but my fan boy moment would have to be that they casted one of my favourite cowboy actors Josh Brolin as the voice of one of Marvel's greatest villains Thanos. The delivery was impeccable, and if the rumours are true that he will be the villain in "Avengers 3" I very much look forward to see what they do.In conclusion, whereas most comic book movies have spent the last couple of years trying to be dark and gritty, I love how laid back this one is. Confidence shows, and the ride is all the more sweeter because of it. There are plenty of great cameos and Easter eggs to enjoy and by the end, I feel this is the best comic book team movie done yet (Stay through the credits).Final Verdict: I look forward to becoming more familiar with the series after this, as James Gunn has crafted a wonderful movie. Had he not have to work in the confines of the rating system, we probably would have got his zaniest and the best Marvel movie to date. But the results nevertheless are a fun and quirky adventure, that comic book movies need more of. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that can't really be hated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is one of those movies that is incredibly smart compared to most Marvel movies for a couple reasons:1. It has A LOT of style. 2. The movie is fully engrossed in itself 3. There are MULTIPLE new characters in a new world 4. The movie has legitimate humour that isn't in the form of "one- liners" but actual funny dialogueA couple of years ago no one would've assumed "Guardians of the Galaxy" would be one of the greatest Marvel movies but it is. The movie is able to establish a very strong and awesome atmosphere that most movies have trouble establishing. A lot of movies that try for a "throwback" style generally mess up by either having the throwback style being irrelevant to the plot or either it doesn't fit the movie at all. Guardians of the Galaxy's style fits perfectly with the plot. The visuals, the soundtrack, the dialogue, the lighting, and everything fits to form a very cohesive world. None of its style feels "forced" or thrown in for "nostalgic" purposes. That is one of the greatest things about the movie is that it is able to use nostalgia without the nostalgia being central. The movie isn't a 60s-80s throwback, the movie just naturally has the feeling of that era. It is hard to explain, but the movie is entirely engrossed in how good it is at doing this.The characters are easily some of the strongest seen in the Marvel universe. Without getting too much into their back story, all of the characters have a distinct, normal, realistic feel. Even the powerful, blood-thirsty, Drax the Destroyer will say some very natural dialogue. All of the characters seem to fit well, and the timing on the dialogue is great. Some of the previous Marvel movies suffer from forced "one- liners" that are too heavily emphasized upon. However, in this movie some of the most hilarious dialogue is muttered or heard in a very rapid-fire manner. While the plot in Guardians of the Galaxy is good, I would be lying if I said it was incredibly original or ingenious. It follows a similar mood to a lot of blockbuster films: Big bad enemy has an army and wants to destroy. The villain isn't nearly as interesting as I would've liked. However, the movie intentionally doesn't focus too much on the villain, because the main purpose of the movie is to see the characters interact and develop bonds. Thankfully, all of the acting is great and hilarious. I will note (after taking some time to think about it) the villain does provide a very good... counter... to our heroes. Initially I thought the villain's dialogue was accidentally cheesy and "super- serious" but the more I think about it, the more I realize how clever the villain is. The villain literally thinks he is the most powerful BA person in the universe which makes it all the more hilarious in contrast with our heroes.Guardians of the Galaxy is a great film that will be hard for Marvel to live up to. As of late, Marvel movies seem to be "action in cities that are all white and fairly colorless" but this movie drastically changes the visual appeal and is unlike pretty much any sci-fi movie in recent years.All in all: go watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Marvel formula brews magic yet again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoyed 'The Avengers', 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier', or any of the numerous Marvel Cinematic Universe productions, inquire no further. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' maintains Marvel Studios' solid winning streak with its vibrant mix of action, humor and heart. Out of the five titular protagonists, it's Rocket, a hyper-intelligent, hyper-cocky raccoon, and Groot, a sentient humanoid tree, that steal the show, however all of these misfits receive their time in the spotlight, with their unique personalities and traits. This is countered by the film's overly one-dimensional, archetypal villains. The special effects are fantastic, the screenplay is witty and pop- culture savvy and the fight scenes are inventive and well-choreographed. As opposed to a largely orchestra-driven soundtrack, 'Guardians' makes a bold choice of using '70's pop music, which ultimately fits in well with the film's happy-go-lucky tone. Certain actors, such as Benicio Del Toro and Glenn Close, don't receive nearly enough screen time that they deserve, but work well with what they're given. In terms of the MCU, 'Guardians' introduces concepts (and refers to devices present in other installments) that will obviously make a greater impact further down the road, such as out first decent look at the MCU's Big Bad. This is what the Star Wars prequel trilogy could have (and should have) been like. Recommended viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy is another winner for Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, people can't say Marvel doesn't take chances, as they merit credit for pushing the envelope past the boundaries of safe footing of using A-List characters like Cap, Thor, Hulk and Iron man, and instead taking a leap of fate with a bunch of unknown loser characters who happen to be criminals to top that off. That's risk taking. The result? One of the most fun 2 hours you can have at the movies.I will leave the usual recap of the plot to others, let's look instead into why this movie is going to be seen as fundamentally genre changer in the future.As with most successful summer movies, they ensured there's good entertainment via a serviceable story, provided lots of action and laughs, got the right actors together and gambled it all by hiring James Gunn, a director that's graduated out of the TROMA school of filmmaking (as in Toxic Avenger people!). I guess if you look hard enough you could find holes in the story and sometimes origins are told instead of seen but that can't be helped when you have 5 heroes and 3 villains to deal with and no previous movies to explain them all!) but so what? This movie has the most important ingredient, it's big-time fun, it knows it's a comic book movie and runs with it and there is entertainment for the entire family... Though be warned that there is quite a bit mature language in the movie (but nothing that's a big deal IMHO)I think GotG has earned a few specific compliments that separates it from the usual summer fare, such as:- best integration of pop music into a movie, ever. Naturally to appreciate it, one probably needs to be fan of said pop music but the director really merits credit for having found a unique and compelling way to integrate all of these tracks into the movie. I was born in the 60's so I am sure that goes some way to reinforcing my appreciation of the music used, but that doesn't negate the fact the music is a core part of the story and this is an original concept as far as I know.- Wow, finally someone gets it into their heads that superhero movies aren't all about using a grey pallet or ensuring the movie is dark and foreboding. Don't get me wrong there's a time and place for tanks but the use of colours in this movie knock it out of the park, bringing some appreciated pizazz to the typical "space fantasy" genre while somehow still having many scenes look gritty. I hope we see more of this in the future.- Best use of humour I have seen in a while... Saying more would fall into spoiler territory me thinks- Before the release of GotG, numerous questions were brought up by the fan base such as "can Chris Pratt work in a leading role?", "Can the 2 main cgi characters that are based on a walking tree and a talking raccoon work on the screen or will it turn out as ridiculous as it sounds?" And my favourite "they hired Batista???". After the release, it's almost a unanimous response from everyone: the casting choices were perfect with the end result each of the 5 main IS a character and not just there to read lines.- many reviews have praised the main cast but I think additional kudos is deserved towards Gunn's use of lower tiered characters, where even a few of them have a "moment" that although may be seconds in length had me smiling after the movie thinking about them. Oh how I am jealous of these awesome actors!- part of what they did with the ending showed great intestinal fortitude galore and when you think about it, was fitting of the character and was an awesome continuation of a theme used throughout the movie.- hands down the most "heart" I have seen in a Marvel movie.The movie isn't perfect villains are 2 dimensional but it didn't hurt the movie as one would think. I believe this is because the movie had tremendous focus on the 5 main characters which could be seen by having all of them have key "moments" in the movieRemember when you see the movie to stick through the credits for the eventual post-credit scene. It worked for me, didn't work for about 1/3 of the theatre according to the groans I heard lolI have now seen the movie 3 times, I think I need help! Who would have thought the "You're welcome" tag used on posters was going to be so well earned?Loaf</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel film so far??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film guardians of the galaxy was made by the Marvel Studios and is probably the best marvel film they have made so far from all the marvel films. The film is set in space and I really enjoyed the settings of the film because all the Marvel films I have seen have been set on earth, except for a little bit during The Avengers film. The film has some of the best actors such as Chris Pratt who plays as Peter Quill aka Starlord, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax The Destroyer, Bradley Cooper voiced as Rocket Raccoon and Vin Diesel as the voice of Groot. For all the fans of Thanos who are reading this right now, let me tell you that you do see Thanos in the film and he looks amazing, also the character Ronan who is the villain of the film looks awesome as hell. The soundtrack used in the film is also very good. The Comedy in the film is great from the rude comments by Rocket Raccoon to Groot and his funny facial expressions. The only down side was the after credits scene which really made me mad, I will not say what it is because you can find out what it is, but I warn you it's terrible. Overall I think this film was just amazing, for all the fans of Marvel that have read this and haven't seen the film, please go see it, NOW!.Thank you for reading, by Henry Agnew</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of this World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2014 has been a huge years for 'movies that have surprised me'. The Lego Movie and How to Train Your Dragon 2 are right up there in my top favorite movies this year pushing the envelope in charming story telling, animation, and mastering 3D on the big screen. On the other hand, Captain America 2: Winter Soldier and X-men: Days of Future Past have quickly become two of my favorite super-hero blockbusters that combine fan-gushing paranormal action with an expert level of engaging story telling. Somehow combining all my favorite traits (and more) from these class act hits, Guardians of the Galaxy (GotG) manages to take relatively unknown Marvel characters and creates an excitingly bold, confident, fast-paced space adventure that truly makes it feel 'out of this world' (nailed it).The story revolves around Peter Quill (aka Star Lord, Chris Pratt), a Terran (Earthling) adult who got captured by an alien mercenary gang lead by the scummy interstellar bandit Yondu (Michael Rooker). After stealing a mysterious artifact known as the "orb", Quill almost immediately gets himself into deep sh** with the wrong crowd of the Galaxy and is lead into a manhunt by the terrifying Kree, Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace); who simply is a pawn working under Marvel's final big baddie and effectively the Emperor Palpatine of this universe, Thanos (Josh Brolin).Out of extraordinary circumstances and misfortune, Quill teams up with the green-skinned sexy assassin and adopted daughter of Thanos, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the deadly literal maniac Drax (Dave Bautista), the sarcastic anthropomorphic raccoon Rocket, and the lovable sentient tree Groot. And while the galaxy and worlds within it are largely at stake, this movie is less about that and more of how these 5 irreverent rag tag team of goons band together, form bonds with one another, and try to be something they never dreamed of being: heroes.Guardians also boasts incredibly well acted performances by everyone in the cast. In fact, instead of gushing long paragraphs of word-porn of how much I enjoyed it I'll sum it up like this. The heroes have spot on comedic timing, know when to pull on the audience's heart strings, and are Groot. The villains are ruthless, cold, command a sense of terror, and are also Groot. Most of all, Rocket and Groot are the most fun odd-ball duo that has come along since Han Solo and Chewbacca and are (you guessed it) mother fu***** GROOT! One of the best things about Guardians is that it doesn't require you to know anything about the Marvel movies that came before it; although it certainly doesn't hurt. Recently, I made a point that in order to see GoTG I had to watch every single Marvel movie that came before it . Earlier this summer, I also finished up the 'just good enough' first season of the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Again, there is no barrier to entry to go see Guardians but if you are like me and have watched your fair of share of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), then you will be rewarded with some subtle nods and Easter Eggs (particularly for those who watched Thor: Dark World and S.H.I.E.L.D). Even the final post credit scene is entirely geared towards comic readers, which will leave the general audience going "wut" ? - an ingenious move to have everyone immediately go home and Google a bunch of stuff about the MCU.Ushering in the Cosmic era could have been a huge mistake for Marvel Studios but James Gunn has done such a good job that he's gotten a sea of internet ejaculation for all his talented work, so much that he's gotten some crowds to hate on Joss Whedon and the Russo brothers (although grow up people there can be more than one good director in the world). It's incredible how Gunn somehow captured the magic of the original Star Wars films and created something so wondrous, eccentrically zany, and flat out fun that by the end of the movie, you are inception-ed to think "Take my money, I want to see that again".Now for the visuals, that mouth-watering, juicy eye candy CG that is only made better by the 3D IMAX experience. To an extent, it was suspected that this space romp would be packed with laser-beam dog fighting, big action set pieces, cosmic wonder, and so on, but that doesn't make it any less impressive. The CG on characters like Groot/Rocket are seamless, the special FX and lighting are top notch, and you can clearly see the vision of the original concept art brought to life. The cosmic cherry on top is the attention to detail on some great character design and costumes (i.e Nebula, Karen Gillan).So what better way to end this review than to talk about what could be the best part, the kicker that makes this whole thing come together. That soundtrack. Oh that perfect playlist of 80&#x2032;s pop songs that establishes such great character moments and gives Guardians it's charismatic charm. So awesome that it's basically a Jedi's Lightsaber , the whip of Indiana Jones, the shield of Captain America, the blowing into an old Nintendo cartridge. It's a total game changer. It just goes to show that a good soundtrack can make anything exponentially better.As soon as I saw the opening title card with Star-Lord grooving to "Come get Your Love", I knew that this movie was going to be special. Guardians of the Galaxy may have started out as being a 'risk', but luckily, instead, turned into one of the most flippant and charming films that has got the entire world "Hooked on a Feeling" (see what I did there?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie I've seen this year!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is proportionately perfect with the amount of laughter, action, and even emotional content. The film's mischievous misfits presented great chemistry along with its dynamic supporting cast. With plenty of CGI/special effects to be captivated by it also makes a strong case in being in its own realm separate from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's heroes and heroines and makes for a very promising film to close out the summer. My expectations were high and yet it not only met them it exceeded them. The tone throughout is pitch perfect. It is amazing to see how efficiently we were introduced to so many layered characters and yet the movie never lags. The visuals were stunning and by the end, I felt something I hadn't felt in years, the desire to get in line and see it all over again. I can't wait to know more about their adventures that I even went right to the source material and began reading. Bravo. Rather than the comparisons to the Avengers as some have made, I saw the story more closely related to the arc in Star Wars. 30-40 years from now the kids in the theater today will likely have the warm fuzzy I get when recalling SW when they think of GOTG.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite possible the best Marvel movie that has been made, so far.The visuals are great and pleasing to the eye. Nothing too impressive though, but that is beside the point. The movie as a whole is put together so good. Everything blends together nicely, the jokes (poking fun at the hero clichés and working of the characters, which is really driven home by both Pratt and Cooper), story (a bunch of lonely misfits thrown together by fate, that pushes them to go against their normal way of handling situations) and characters (all portrayed by very good casted actors that seem to have a great time with the movie and the script circling around it.I feel like I can go on and on about why this movie deserves to be watched, but that wouldn't do it justice. But it really is a great summer blockbuster that both lives up my hype and far exceeds it at the same time. So why are you still reading this? GO! Go out and see it, join the legion of satisfied people who have watched a great piece of action cinema come to life!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Balance between action, comedy, story and character development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is a perfect movie for anyone of any age to see. Though the movie does begin with a scene not expected to be seen after viewing all the commercials and trailers, it does give you a better understanding toward one of the characters in particular. Then, after that moment, you are brought right into the galaxy, and the plot will immediately being from that moment on. With this being the first movie to enter Marvel's cosmic universe, I really couldn't have many expectations for this movie. However, the characters are so lovable and interesting that you cannot take your eyes off the screen for even a second. Their humor is also unique to each of their characters, from Peter's references to his past life, or Drax's unintended humor about catching metaphors over his head, that's what makes them all special. They each also have their own contribution to their forming team, and show their unique skills through the film when the action beings rolling.With the exception for Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper, the rest of the cast is fairly unknown to the average viewer. With the added talent of Chris Pratt, (Peter) Zoe Saldana, (Gamora) Lee Pace, (Ronan) and to me, the most surprisingly, Dave Butista (Drax) all gave a superb performance in this movie, showing true dedication to their characters to make the movie very enjoyable to watch. This movie gets an easy 10, only because it is an addictive and fun movie throughout, and an overall good time. Watching this movie will make your day better once you get out of the theater, GUARANTEED! With this being the last movie in Marvel's cinematic universe before the next Avengers, I now hope that the next set of movie to be released by Marvel will be able to match to Guardians of the Galaxy. If you haven't seen it, I don't know what you're waiting for! I highly recommend this movie to anyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the most entertaining movies I had the pleasure to sit through. I can safely say it's the best money I have ever spent. The time and effort put into this movie is obvious, the characters are likable, the story is easy to follow and flows nicely. The music is nostalgic but classic, and always knows what mood to put you in. With an exception of a few characters, it's easy to get into each and every one. Some felt like they were just there and didn't provide much to the story... but in the big scheme of it all, you don't really care so much about that. Truth is, they keep it entertaining from beginning to end, it's a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, and allows us to enjoy how campy and lighthearted it really is. Although some of the subject material is very serious, the feel of it is just fun and easy to watch.All in all, if you want a movie that will entertain you from beginning to end, this is your movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent!I went in to this movie with crazy high expectations, which I always try to avoid doing. However, it didn't ruin the movie! I read a ton of reviews beforehand and probably watched each trailer 20 times or more. This movie surpassed all of my expectations. The movie was fun, exciting, and hilarious. I dragged my girlfriend to this one and she loved it also. She likes the latest Marvel movies but didn't seem too thrilled about this Star Wars-esque installment. ALL that changed though :).When you watch the opening scene you'll know you're in for a good movie. Once the end credits rolled everyone clapped. It's been a while since I had a movie-going experience like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's biggest gamble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this was a huge gamble for Marvel I can guarantee that if you walked up to 20 random people on the sidewalk and asked them to name a guardian of the galaxy they wouldn't know what to say but after this no one will forget who they are. This was a the first Marvel movie that focus's on the more interstellar side of the Marvel universe. The most difficult thing that this movie had to do is fit five characters back stories into one two hour movie and they did a great job, their is a lot of humour in this film and he characters are all so colourful and honestly Rocket Raccoon was my favourite by far.But the real scene stealer was the scene that included the man with the soon to be complete infinity gauntlet Thanos he was terrifying and looked like a bad ass. But thing that kept this from being a ten was Ronan the Accuser because I knew that Thanos was in this universe I didn't care bout this guy but hey still a great movie. Go see it in a cinema near you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Star Wars of this age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie with my father, and he said that he hasn't been this happy seeing a movie since he was a kid himself watching Star Wars in the cinema for the first time. This movie does just about everything right. There is amazing character development in the movie's short 2 hour run. Chris Pratt is the perfect actor to be Starlord, as he is very funny when the movie needs him to be yet also able to be the hero delivering the big speech or defeating the villain when needed. Zoe Saldana plays a great Gamora, she is the complete opposite of Starlord: cunning, sly, and yet still kick-ass in her own way. Because opposites attract, these two are a perfect fit for each other, and complement each other well. Rocket is hilarious and awesome, I mean who doesn't love a furry little creature with a huge gun? Groot is one of the movies funniest characters despite saying only three words over and over: "I am Groot." Drax is surprisingly funny, I defiantly wasn't expecting him to deliver one of the movie's funniest performances. All in all, the movie has beautiful visuals, a great dialogue, good jokes, and a great soundtrack to boot. In my opinion, this is the best movie Marvel has released yet. It is the perfect blend of action and comedy. Guardians of the Galaxy is just a feel good movie; my face hurt at the end of the movie because I was smiling so much throughout it. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie, it is surely one of the better movies of 2014.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Firefly meets Star Wars with Indiana Jones added in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Guardians of the Galaxy,' or 'Weird Avengers' as I heard a kid in my theater describe it, is Marvel's first big adventure into the weird, (but it won't be the last if the end credits scene pays off). Now this movie could've been a hilariously awful flop, i.e. 'After Earth', but where other recent Star Wars wannabes, i.e. 'John Carter', have failed, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is a fresh new adventure series that takes the best elements of Star Wars, Firefly, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and surprisingly even Howard the Duck. Now, it's no 'Avengers' and it's certainly weird as heck, but under all that weirdness is a charm. A charm missing in recent flops, i.e. John Carter or After Earth. It's that charm that helps me forgive some of the 'Phantom Menace'-esque dialogue about peace treaties and other stuff I couldn't care less about. Much of that charm is provided by Chris Pratt as Jason Quill, or Star- Lord. Jason Quill is to 'GotG' what Tony Stark is to 'Iron Man.' Star-Lord could've been a completely boring piece of wood, i.e. Thor, but he takes all the charm of Chris Pratt and adds in that Iron Man sass. But the real stars of this film are Rocket Raccoon and Groot. Oh. My. God. These two may be the best Marvel movie characters ever. I would watch an entire trilogy of just them. Rocket is almost like Joe Pesci in 'Goodfellas' and Groot is just one big puppy dog (who violently murders people). They are the Han and Chewie of this movie, only that they are a talking raccoon and a weird tree. Everyone else was just fine. Bautista has gotten flack for being a 'bad actor,' but he's perfectly fine and has several of the movie's funniest scenes. Zoe Saldana is okay, but she's really just playing Zoe Saldana. The villain, Ronan, has been getting flack for being weak, but Marvel movies never have great villains, apart from Loki. He works in the movie and I at least remember his name unlike whoever the villain was in Thor 2. Overall, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is a really fun mix of sci-fi and adventure that doesn't take itself too seriously, which is much needed in these dark days of 'Man of Steel.' Rating: Best Movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Movie is good, but not a masterpiece like some critics are giving it. Chris Pratt is really good in this movie and steals the show, but between the too much Eagerness, for the film, this movie is not as great as some people make it out to be. Bradley Cooper as Rocket Raccoon, and Vin Diesel as Groot the movie is very well done, just like Iron Man this movie is good, just not a master piece. Like other films are like The Dark Knight (2008) or Ben-Hur (1959) is those are 10/10, so i'm surprised that this movie critics are giving 9/10, 10/10. The Length of the movie, is a little too long, for this sci-fi comic book adventure, but that is not much of a problem. Zoe Saldana, is OK in this movie though, but that is not much of a Problem for this movie. Acting 7/10, Special Effects 9/10, Length 5/10, Accuracy 9/10Total 7/10 GOOD!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best Marvel film ever, but still a decent superhero film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun, entertaining, spectacular sci-fi action comedy adventure. However, despite the rave reviews from the critics and mainstream audience, I just don't think the film actually lives up to the hype and expectations to be a great one. Let me explain why.The story is mainly about a band of interstellar thieves, thugs and assassins - Star lord, Gamora, Rocket, Groot and Drax, got caught up in a huge galactic threat when one of them retrieved a highly-desired mysterious orb from a desolated planet. These individuals eventually decided to work together as a team and become heroes along the way to stop the threat.Before this, the Guardians Of The Galaxy consists of characters not known by many, even among the Marvel fan base. It's officially the first Marvel film that ventures into space, introducing the general audience to the expansive intergalactic worlds in the Marvel Cinematic Universe...with an entirely new team and not the previously established Avengers. It brings the audience to a whole new unseen world, featuring a multitude of alien species with distinctive personalities and abilities, with addition of exciting spaceship battles and chases as well.The visuals are spectacular and the action scenes were great. Many of the 1960s/1970s pop classics that forms the soundtrack blends in quite nicely with the film. Each Guardian have their own kick-ass, cool or funny character moments in the film. The action scenes between Drax and Ronan or Korath, Gamora and Nebula, Star Lord and the Sakaaran army are really well done. But, among the Guardians, it is actually a giant walking tree and a talking raccoon that stole the spotlight compared with the others! When Groot extends his arm and pierces through a few Sakaaran army soldiers and repeatedly slams them against the walls is both shocking and awesome.The 'We are Groot' scene or Rocket's expression when Drax tries to comfort him by gently petting his head are beautifully done and emotional at the same time.All the Marvel films, since Iron Man, did a great job of making fun at itself by injecting decent amount of humour and witty lines into the story, keeping the audience laughing along the way. This worked out fine...the engaging sense of humour actually helps to balance out the drama and action to make the films fun and entertaining to watch. But this time, they went overboard with it. Guardians of the Galaxy is so overly playful with itself that it has gotten too self-absorbed with its humour. It felt cartoony at times and lacks the seriousness it needs to be an epic film. It's been shown that billions of lives are at stake and even the galaxy is under serious threat. How do you even care what's at stake when the film doesn't take itself seriously when it should? (Moreover, some of the jokes presented in the film didn't work for me at all)The film has too many new characters and most of them only make brief appearances...there's a lot of new unfamiliar places or locations which are previously unheard of without proper explanation. There's no character depth for each of the Guardians, you don't feel like you know them much by the end of the film as their backstories were only briefly touched upon. Gamora, also known as the galaxy's deadliest assassin or the Deadliest Woman in the Galaxy, trained by Thanos, gets easily beaten by others? The romance of Gamora with Star lord feels forced as well. I was also slightly disappointed that Thanos only make a brief cameo appearance...I expected more of his involvement in the film. It didn't create any strong lasting impression for the characters, much like Captain America: The First Avenger and Iron Man did for their main characters. The pacing doesn't flow well as the story never slows down and there's too many things to cover in the film.There's so many small fine details that the general audience (those who are unfamiliar with the Marvel Universe) most likely won't know or understand: No one knows who Tivan/The Collector actually is or the Yaka arrow that Yondu carries around with him...the film didn't clearly explains what the infinity stones represents (mind, power, reality, space, soul, time), no mention of the Infinity Gauntlet, who is the giant figure that uses the Power stone, etc. Most of these details should be explained in this film instead of relying on the next sequel to do the job.Like all the previous Marvel films (except Thor, who has Loki), Guardians of the Galaxy lacks a memorable and compelling villain for the story. There's a lack of character development for Ronan The Accuser. Ronan's lieutenants, Korath and Nebula (also Thanos' adopted daughter), bring nothing to the table...we don't know them much at all. For those who are expecting a great epic teamwork battle in the finale will be disappointed. Why would a villain who hates an entire race and planet, tries to avenge his father's and ancestor's deaths could be easily distracted? 'What are you doing?' I find myself having the same response as Ronan, questioning the director's decision for making Star lord pulling such a ridiculous act on screen. Come on, you have a villain who's in possession of the Power stone and this is what you can do with the character?Like I mentioned earlier in the review, the film was fun and entertaining, but it was too much that nothing feels serious anymore. It's certainly not the best Marvel film ever. In my opinion, X-Men: Days of Future Past still remains as the best Marvel film of the year.Rating: 7.5/10Note: The post-credit scene was quite disappointing and not worth the wait. They supposed to add something that raises the expectations for future films but they didn't. That sucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marvel is back at it with another film for their Cinematic Universe. Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun joyride for the whole family with some great action and fantastic music from decades ago. While not as good as the April release for the MCU(Marvel Cinematic Universe) Captain America: The Winter Solider, this film holds its own as being something different. This is my review of Guardians of the Galaxy.The film was written by James Gunn and Nicole Perlman. While this is a first film for Perlman, Gunn has been around for some time now and generally has an okay track record. This film however beats everything he has done in the past. While this is a different type of film for the MCU, Gunn is still able to bring in the fun that previous film have brought. The characters are nicely written, but things at times can fall apart. Nothing major that brings down the film though. The villain of the film, Ronan the Accuser, is about on par with previous villains from the MCU, in that he brings nothing special. I will not be giving out any spoilers in this review, but I overall felt Ronan was fairly weak. The group of five heroes, Starlord, Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket are fabulous in this film. They are written nicely(although the backstory for Starlord is weak, but that could be meant for future films). Thanks to great casting these characters are an even better joy on the screen. So, Gunn gets the job done in this department with flying colors.James Gunn directed this film as well. Gunn had a lot to live up to with all the great action scenes the previous MCU films have had, and in my opinion he does a great job. The type of action scenes seen in this film are different from the previous MCU films, but they stay intact nicely. With a lot of scenes consisting of flying around in a spaceship, CG was needed. The CG was done amazingly, and never felt funny or fake from any of it. The actors that Gunn was able to line up like Chris Pratt(Starlord), Zoe Saldana(Gamora), Vin Diesel(voice over for Groot), Bradley Cooper(voice over for Rocket, and even Dave Bautista(Drax) was great in this film. While it may be easy to say Rocket is the stand out in this film, or even Groot, I think Bautista as Drax is the one who steals the show. Bautista until now has been a WWE wrestling superstar and did a couple direct to video action films. He really plays up his part of the story very nicely, and of course he can fight. His action scenes were great, and Gunn deserves a lot of credit for taking a chance on him. Pratt is hilarious at times and plays a great leading role in this film. Until now he has mainly done comedy films, but he nails this role for its action. So, once again Gunn deserves a lot of credit for his great work, this time in the directing department.Tyler Bates handles the score for this film, and I must say he does a fine job. While he hasn't done a lot of popular films recently, he has done work in the past on films like Watchmen, Halloween(remake from 2007), and even worked with James Gunn on Super. In the bigger action scenes the score composed by Bates hits the nail right on the head. I love film scores, and those like me will really enjoy the work he did here as well. There is also a lot of older music in this film from decades ago. These songs are edited in nicely over the course of the film, and it adds a nice depth to the film.In closing, this film is a must see film for us big time MCU fans. Fans like myself will be going to see this film no matter what my review said. For those who aren't fans of the MCU just yet, this is a great place to start. And remember fans, stay until the credits have finished rolling.On a side not I want to add some comments on the IMAX 3D version of the film. As always the IMAX side of things is a blessing to see. With amazing visuals and thunderous surround sound, you cannot miss this version of the film. Also, director James Gunn converted some of the footage into full screen IMAX, and those scenes are breathtaking to see. The 3D mostly just adds some nice depth to this film, and not much in the way of things popping out towards the screen. With the IMAX portion being great to watch, watching this in IMAX 3D is well worth the price of admission.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upfront I admit I am a huge Marvel fan. I was really looking forward to this movie, and it exceeded my expectations.Guardians of the Galaxy was visually fantastic with Gunn at the helm. He had a clear direction with the film and executed it precisely. The film is also very good at delivering laughs. Almost every joke hit, with each of the Guardians contributing. Speaking of the Guardians themselves, they were all very deep characters that you actually care about. Whether its their back stories, or particular motivations, you really get behind them individually and as a group. Just to speak on a few individually, Batista as Drax was very surprising with how great his comedic timing was. I thought Bradley Cooper as Rocket's voice would be distracting, but you can barely even tell its him. Cooper did a great job, and you can tell he had a great time with the role. The action was also great in the film mixing CGI and practical effects. The Soundtrack was fantastic with many catchy songs from the 70s and 80s. The few gripes I had with the film were there were some cheesy dialogue moments that were near cringe worthy. The villains Ronan and Nebula were just not as interesting as the heros themselves which kind of took away from the film. Also, like I alluded to it above, most jokes hit, but there are those few that do not. Overall, it was a great film that is one of my favorite action films of the year and is definitely a must-see in the theater.</fullReview>

Also CGI is very good with some 3D effects.Expecting same manner of sequel for the Guardians /....Grooting to Rocket in Galaxy...I thoroughly recommend this for any with a borderline sci-fi/superhero love, and advise you to remain for the tantalising post-credits scene, although many of the non-comic fans might not get the references</fullReview>

Guardians is a glimpse into the endless possibilities that the Marvel Cinematic Universe holds in store, and there is ALWAYS room for improvement.I had moderately high expectations walking into the theater. I figured at least it would be a mildly entertaining sci-fi action movie: forgettable, yet enjoyable. To say that my expectations were blown out of the water would be putting it mildly. It amazed me with stunning visuals, great action, and the best film ensemble of recent memory.Let me put this out there: I'm not a Marvel fan-boy. I didn't enjoy most of the Phase One films, with the exception of Iron Man and The Avengers. This film has converted me.Without going into spoilers too much, Guardians is the best action flick out right now, and definitely worth seeing in theaters!</fullReview>

They are truly the underdog group that really has no business being at the Marvel party table, but gosh-darnit they are just impertinent enough to crash the party and take it over with style.The 3D in this was stellar. A lot of movies aren't worth the extra price of a 3D ticket, but this one is definitely worth your time. The 3D is very well-done. Finally I have to give kudos to the one-liners. There are some great, great one-liners here that are setup well and hit home with authority. This could very well be the best movie of the Summer. Who would've guessed it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure entertainment, Marvel can't miss a beat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you're making a film set in an enormous, ever-growing series, like the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), there are high expectations for the movie to be just as good if not better than the last, as well as expectations of how the movie will be structured. In Guardians of the Galaxy (GotG), Marvel's first true attempt at bringing their lesser known characters to the MCU, the expectations are most definitely met if not exceeded and the final product is one of the most entertaining superhero movies of recent time.As a new property in the juggernaut MCU, GotG had to carve out its own identity and boy did it ever. Unlike the films before it, 'Guardians' drops almost all of the seriousness that superhero fans have come to expect in favor of a much quirkier and humor-filled take. Expecting long, epic and emotional speeches? Well, there are, but they get interrupted by hilarious dialogue over and over again. There is, without a doubt, a large catalog of thrilling action sequences, but it's the way that the humor and wit mix into the action that sets Guardians apart from their predecessors. There is an immediate contrast to the Guardians and The Avengers. The Avengers are like the New York Yankees; the seasoned, proved winners while the Guardians are the scrappy, loser team that comes out of nowhere to surprise everyone. And in reality, the addition of the hilarity and ruggedness that the Guardians bring is a much welcomed style for the MCU, and it shows that Marvel is willing to change the game in order to keep the game going for a long time.While the super entertaining humor is a new step in the MCU, the action feels right at home. It's intense, it's varied and it's a whole lot of fun to watch. The dynamics and different traits of each character adds a unique flavor to the action and it's a blast to watch. The weapons are cool, aerial combat is awesome and the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, with each new planet and area that is shown off more beautiful than the last. Not to mention the phenomenal CGI characters of Rocket and Groot, who feel just as real as the live action characters. The immediate story isn't anything too special, but it's the incredible sci-fi setting, amazing characters and the connected MCU story that keep your eyes glued to the screen for the entire 2 hour run time.It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the likes of Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket Racoon and Groot don't come close to the mega-stardom surrounding Iron Man, Captain America and co. when it comes to sheer popularity. However, I have a wonderful feeling that this new set of heroes are going to make their names known across the superhero world. The extensive and expanding well of acting talent continues to pile up for Marvel. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel join the Marvel family and play their respective roles to near perfection. Star-Lord is cocky, daring and skilled and his constant humor blends with his awesome combat skills to make into a Tony Stark-like character. Gamora is a lethal assassin with a heart of gold, while Drax is a ruthless killing machine with little tolerance for anyone who gets in his way. Then there is the fantastic duo of Rocket and Groot; both animated characters, but brought to life with outstanding CGI and tremendous voice acting. Rocket is easily the most talkative of the group, with a high temper, hilarious sense of humor and expert tactical and mechanical skills. Bradley Cooper's voice is like a match made in heaven for Rocket and all of the dialogue he has proves that. On the other side of the mic, you have Groot, who may just go down as being the most underrated and lovable character in the entire MCU. His vocabulary may be limited to "I and am and Groot, exclusively in that order" but his actions more than make up for his lack of words. Groot is the soft-hearted one, and his character, voiced by Vin Diesel himself, easily reminds me of another animated character Diesel voiced, in the Iron Giant. He's selfless, more than friendly and will risk his life for others. But when he has to be, is a deadly warrior. There is a Han Solo/Chewbacca feeling to this duo and while they may be a talking raccoon and tree, their presence will undoubtedly be felt throughout the MCU.On the villainous side of things, main bad guy Ronan the Accuser is a vicious, if at times underwhelming character. His power is far superior than any one Guardian, but this power is quite limited during the film. Other than the nerd-gastic reveal of Josh Brolin as the overlord Thanos, the evil side of the movie is largely untapped potential, yet still entertaining. There was a small lack of character development and back story for most of the characters, but with an ensemble cast of new characters, there's only so much room to dive into back story.When all is said and done, Guardians of the Galaxy can be summed up into one word; fun. Walking out of the theater I wasn't over-thinking the overall MCU plot, I wasn't thinking about small details that could've been better, I was thinking about how much fun I had, and having fun while watching a movie is something that doesn't come along too often. Guardians of the Galaxy has proved to me that Marvel can do anything they want and succeed, and that even applies to the surprising after- credits scene. It's been 6 years since the launch of the MCU, and even with something as fun, wacky and new as this, Marvel still reigns as king of superhero movies.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best from Marvel so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"So here we are: a thief, two thugs, an assassin and a maniac. But we're not going to stand by as evil wipes out the galaxy."Before I actually get into the review of this film I want to get me emotions out of the way first. All the wait and the hype for Guardians of the Galaxy was finally over and I was not disappointed for one second. This was exactly what I was looking forward to and what all Summer blockbusters should feel like. It was a fantastic experience with great action sequences, interesting characters, and hilarious dialogues with plenty of pop cultural references. I actually enjoyed the comedy more than the fantastic action scenes and found this to be the funniest film of the year. It kind of builds on what Whedon did with The Avengers, but I think James Gunn took it to another level and delivered a rare superhero film that I actually wouldn't mind revisiting over and over again. Although more than a superhero film this seemed like it belonged to the Star Wars franchise, and I felt like a geek all over again. I was blown away by this despite some minor issues and I would rank this as the best Marvel film to date. It was fresh, witty, cool, and despite having many characters they all get sufficient screen time and a distinct personality of their own. Seven months into 2014 I can say this is my favorite film of the year so far just ahead of X-Men Days of Future Past. This was purely entertaining and had some wonderful performances as well.Before this film I had no prior knowledge of this comic so you can imagine how pleased I was with the way each character was introduced and how easy the story was to follow. The film has a lot of heart as well and each one of the characters have flaws which give them a more humane aspect. Chris Pratt has always been an actor that stands out in his secondary roles, but here he is given a lead role which he absolutely nails. Just like Robert Downey Jr. personified Tony Stark with incredible charisma, Pratt does the same with Peter Quill (aka Star Lord). He is irreverent and full of energy. The supporting cast is also strong. Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper do fantastic voice work with their CGI created characters, Rocket and Groot. Vin Diesel really didn't have to say much, but the way he delivers the same line over and over again made for some funny moments. Dave Bautista really impressed me as Drax because I thought he would basically be the muscle of the film and focus on the action scenes, but his character is funny mostly because he takes things literally all the time. He was great. Zoe Saldana as Gamora was also a stand out as she had some great action scenes and wasn't just in the film to be the girl that needs saving all the time. The way these characters came together was part of the unique experience this film provided. The villains may have been weak, but I didn't really care much because my attention was on the interaction between the heroes and seeing them come together. I also want to give a shut out to John C. Reilly and Michael Rooker who provided for even more funny scenes. I wasn't really a fan of director, James Gunn's previous superhero film, Super, but I did appreciate his unique sense of humor and how different that film felt from other superhero films. Guardians of the Galaxy is a huge step forward and he really delivered the entertainment here. The soundtrack was amazing and I enjoyed how he combined that music from the 70's with this modern action film because it's not something you usually see in a movie like this. It was just such a fun experience all together and can't wait to revisit it again. It had the type of humor I enjoy and each one of the characters delivered perfect notes. The two hours fly by thanks to an excellent paced film and a well written script. It was charming and if you haven't seen it than please do!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Summer Blockbuster from my childhood has returned...Finally!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've said it before SPACE is made for 3D. This film was a good time. I read the PARENTAL ADVISORY before taking my 6 year old who has seen her fair share of films. And documentaries. And she loved it. She said it was better then another Disney film which songs were way over played. That says a lot. This might be her best film ever. My wife also liked it a lot. I heard her laugh several times. And that says a lot.Everything about this film was so entertaining to watch. I plan on seeing it again. I think it's been decades since I wanted to stay, or get back in line to watch the film again.The fun I had just listening to the dialogue of this film alone is worth the ticket. But add action, the best special effects around, amazing sound, 3D at its best. Well it's the summer blockbuster I've waited for at least the past 10 years. Maybe more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Extremely Fun Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So before I get into this review I just want to say that I didn't see any of the guardians of the galaxy comic books so this means that I cannot give any credit to the movie for staying true to the source material or I can not take off points because its not true to the comics. This movie is a really fun action packed space adventure movie . Before I got into this movie I was kind of being skeptical about how funny this movie will be or how good will it will be and I have got to tell you that this movie is really really awesome it definitely lived up to my expectations and its definitely delivered what it wanted to.This is a comic book movie , superhero movie that you have never seen before,you have never seen anything like it.Every character is well established as far as the casting and the persona of the characters go. Every actor does their part well in the movie but star lord is the one we relate the most and who is the main character and i would like to know more about gamora and the others but they're still built well just not as good as star lord. The jokes never fell flat and all of the characters had their moments.But as i was saying star lord is the main dude. Rocket and Groot are awesome and they stole the show as likability goes for me. This movie also had heart throughout the entire movie filled with amazing special effects and stunning images of outer space stuff.So a very good job on the technical aspect. The soundtrack does not include a "good "song. Every song is well put in to the movie and all of them are awesome. My only gripe about the movie is it kinda feels just a little bit too long in the end and the villain is kinda simple. But the main characters completely make the movie and put the focus on themselves so perfectly it didn't bother em that much. The heart filled moments like the scenes with peter about his mom and rocket and his past also his friendship about Groot are really moving and touching so in the end this movie steps out between the marvel movies as the funniest and weirdest movie and one of the best movies that marvel has ever made.This is close to the avengers as far as fun goes. A really amazing movie that i cannot praise enough. We can't say it'a classic or a artsy film but it's still a really fun awesome movie. Without the minor things i talked about this is the perfect blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy don't take itself too seriously, and that's good. It imitates pitilessly 80's B scifi movies avoiding to mock them too much. Big production budget guarantee, that the movie looks great and there is visual for at least for two movies. 70's and 80's soundtrack brings suitably nostalgic. Guardians of the Galaxy is fresh breeze against all current comic filming. There is enough of good humor and stunning visuality. 3D works well, but as so many times before it won't use enough. Guardians of the Galaxy is eye candy to all who enjoys space action movies. At the end of the movie there is a promise of the sequel. I hope they honor this movie and avoid too cliché humor, good script is needed. Guardians of the Galaxy is entertaining, visually stunning and truly funny comic adaption, which won't let you down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A roller coaster ride from start to finish.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is pure popcorn entertainment. I loved this film, it's probably my second favorite film, behind Captain America: The Winter Soldier in the Phase 2 of the MCU. Chris Pratt leads the film with great comedic timing and snappy one-liners in the role of Peter Quill/Star-Lord. He's a very likable jerk/noble/con-man. He is the leader of these unusual bunch, and does a commendable job of bringing this group together and united to fight for whats right. Zoe Saldana is great portraying Gamora, showcasing she's somewhat conflicted, also she's not as cold and heartless like her sister Nebula, greatly portrayed by Karen Gillian. Dave Bautista brings out the best of Drax, full of honor and also full of ego. Now the two stars in this film are Rocket Raccoon and Groot, respectively voiced by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. I guarantee that everyone(mostly everyone) will fall in love with these characters. They are basically Han Solo and Chewbacca. They're very lovable and have the most memorable moments. Both actors bring such life within their vocal talents. Action sequences dazzle and are pure eye candy, as well as the visual effects. The film is paced very well and very fast, but at times it can get overwhelming, and a couple of action sequences can be dragged out a little. I absolutely ate up Lee Pace's performance as Ronan. It was over the top, corny, and deliciously evil. He held nothing back, he was aggressive and he knew what he wanted. The only problem is that I wish he was just a little more fleshed out. I wanted more of Ronan, he is by far one of my favorite villains so far in the MCU. I was disappointed to see him "die," but I have hope that someday he'll make his return. Djimon Hounsou has a relatively small role as Korath. I would have also liked to see more of him as well. He was kind of a throw away character. Glenn Close, John C. Reilly, and Benicio Del Toro both have a small supporting role, but their roles do serve a purpose for the plot, where as Hounsou does not, especially if he plays a supporting character along the lead villain Ronan and Nebula's side. What James Gunn does very well is managing humor and providing real moments for all the characters. The core five are fleshed out more than I expected and are not two dimensional, therefore as an audience member you're able to go on a personal journey with them. It's not overdone, but there is just enough for you to care about all these characters. Again, I just wish there could have been more Ronan. This is Marvel's Star Wars. That may be an overstatement, but it truly is. It's filled with fun humor, fun action, and dazzling visuals. Also with some nice tender character moments. Can I also mention the awesome appearance of Thanos voiced by Josh Brolin. It was worth the wait and I can't wait to see more of him in the future. What Kevin Feige and the rest of the amazing crew at Marvel are doing are so impressive. They took a property like Guardians of the Galaxy, cream of the crop C or D-Listers, and speared them into an A or B-List territory. Props to them, these guys care for the source material(except Iron Man 3 lol) and really know what they're doing. I attended San Diego Comic-Con for the seventh straight year and their presentation at Comic-Con as always is great, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man footage both looked incredible. I truly believe, for anyone who is a Marvel fan, we have been spoiled by them. Anyways go see this film. IMAX 3D is also very good, if it's not the fake IMAX like in some AMC theaters. As always stay after the credits, there's a humorous scene involving a certain duck. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MARVEL Entertainment Presents its First Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, sort of. Although it is very humorous, "Guardians of the Galaxy" is still, in fact, a superhero film. Thus, no matter how funny it may be, fans are going to expect certain elements out of it. Said elements include a decent story, a certain degree of action, character development, and, perhaps most important of all, a special post credits scene to show how the latest film fits into the expanded universe. This film, thankfully, meets most of these requirements and puts a unique spin on some of them.This movie does have a decent story, and it develops its characters surprisingly well. It also uses an extraordinary amount of CGI. I actually found it a little overwhelming at first, but once a person settles into the film, it makes much more sense. And while this CGI universe does better befit the movie's atmosphere, I personally wished that there had been a few more "normal" settings. I attest this to the fact that, subconsciously, I was still half hoping for a normal superhero film. Because of this, I will say that if one goes into this movie expecting something more akin to "Star Wars," the movie will feel less odd. After the first half hour, I completely bought the film. As this is a comedy, the re-watch ability of this movie rides heavily on how effective its humor is. Thankfully, the comedy works and it does not overshadow the action. In fact, it actually helps the action at some points, giving a fresh look on the superhero genre. But like all comedies, I would not recommend watching this film over and over again, or else the laughs will become ineffective. I'm not saying this film cannot be watched multiple times, but I am saying that watching this film in moderation will certainly allow it to remain fun throughout the years.While this movie can be downright funny and has interesting characters, I will admit that the villain came across as very?throwaway. Once again, MARVEL manages to concoct a great cast of heroes and even manages to flesh out the side characters well, but for some reason they just cannot seem to make their villains come across as threatening or unique in this post "Avengers" universe. This is a problem that could be VERY easily remedied, but for some reason MARVEL cannot figure it out. I cannot really give my opinion on how to fix the villain without spoiling anything, so I will simply say this. When someone goes to see this movie and compares "Ronan the Accuser" to most of the villains in the MARVEL Cinematic Universe, one will understand what I am talking about. For example, the villain needs more reason for his or her dastardly plot. These MARVEL villains just do not feel believable AS villains anymore; they do not have enough depth and eventually all come across as the same character. Ultimately, I see the "Guardians of the Galaxy" like this: it is worth going to see in theaters and it is probably worth seeing out of theaters a handful of times. But after that, I don't see this movie having as long of a lasting appeal as, say, the original Iron-Man. "Guardians of the Galaxy" is very funny, and can certainly be enjoyed by mass audiences, but the fact remains that this is a superhero film that may be a little too out there for some people. I can understand why some people will find this film disappointing, but I personally enjoyed the film, despite expecting it to be bad.Here are my ratings for this film. Comedy: 9/10. Action: 9/10. Story: 7/10. Unique take on the Superhero genre: 10/10. Overall Rating: 8.75/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read the comics I am proud to say the movie did it some justice. A few minor flaws here and there, but overall a respectful nod to a relatively unknown comic. Chris Pratt as Peter Quill a.k.a.(Star Lord) stole the show. This character is bound to blow up in popularity. Rocket Racoon was also an amazing sight throughout the film. Congrats to Bradley Cooper for bringing the character to life. I know I know Hollywood must make likable characters, but having Drax and Gamora be so friendly was an obvious let down. As well as Drax the destroyer getting his butt kicked by everyone! Ronan the Accuser was also annoying to me for some reason. I don't know if it was Lee Paces facial expressions throughout the movie, but it ended up being adequate due to the film being about the group development rather than the Villains. Another flaw, which was also minor was the unidentifiable character Korath, which looked nothing like the comics.In summary the film is full of excellent humor and action unlike the crap called Iron Man 3; and Easter Eggs for all the comic book fans. It did not take on a serious tone like in the Winter Soldier, but it was better for it. The film helped you learn who the characters were, as well as,left you wanting more. Star Lord! Star Lord!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel Has Changed Superhero Movies Forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to start, I went into this movie with above average expectations, this movie completely exceeded my expectations!!! First off, casting for this movie was pretty much perfect. Chris Pratt was perfect for Peter Quill, Zoe Saldana was great as Gamora, Vin Diesel only said three words and he was one of the best characters, Bautista was probably the weakest character as in personality but he was still great, Rocket Raccoon played by Bradley Cooper stole every scene he was in. Everyone coming out of that movie will be a Rocket Raccoon fan. As the movie it was the best Marvel film by far, Avengers doesn't compare to the greatness of this movie!!! The story of how they all got together in the first place was probably my favorite part of the whole movie, hearing their back stories and seeing how they became the Guardians Of The Galaxy was amazing!!! Also, not spoiling the after credits scene, it was funny and had a cameo that some people might not get. Overall I haven't walked out of the theater the way I did in a long time. I will probably see it again, and I will definitely buy it on blu-ray the second I can. I recommend this movie to any and all human beings that like enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Movie from Start to Finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Marvel Studios latest movie, they have gone to the bench to highlight some of the lesser known corners of their comic book universe. In many ways, you could almost say that Guardians of the Galaxy is Marvel Studios throwing down the gauntlet, proving that when it comes to their movies at least, their distinguished competition is completely in the dust. Guardians of the Galaxy is not so much a superhero movie, but is more a space opera/sci-fi western in the vein of Star Wars, or more accurately, Firefly. The story follows Earth born Peter Quill, who was abducted by aliens as a child, and has spent his life since, traversing alien worlds as the outlaw Star-Lord. Following an opening sequence a little reminiscent of a sci-fi Raiders of the Lost Ark, Quill discovers a mysterious orb that just about everyone in the galaxy seems to be after, but why? The answer to that question leads Quill to team up with a ragtag group of quirky misfit outlaws, including a gun-toting raccoon, named Rocket, and a talking tree man, who all work together to save the galaxy from the villainous warlord, Ronan the Accuser.If the above description does not tickle your interests, then don't go to see this movie, but if it does, then you'll enjoy just about everything that this movie has to offer. Without traipsing into too much spoiler-filled territory, this is a fun movie from start to finish. You will be laughing almost non-stop. This is quite possibly the funniest Marvel movie to date, and perhaps the funniest movie of the year, period. Rocket Raccoon is almost certain to become one of the new favorite Marvel heroes, because let's face it, when you have a talking raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper, who also happens to have short man syndrome, magic happens.There is just a lot that is charming about Guardians of the Galaxy. There is a nice dose of action, a ton of laughs, and a little dash of emotion there to tie everything together. Of course, the main thing people always want to know is if this is the best Marvel movie ever? I don't know if I would go that far, partly because this movie doesn't have the added benefit that The Avengers had, having had five movies prior to set up all of the characters, rather than having to set them up and then bring them together in the course of two hours, but when Guardians works, it soars. Plus, I have a feeling that when we finally reach The Avengers 3, this particular chapter in the Marvel saga will be one of the most crucial in understanding what's at stake in that particular adventure for Earth's Mightiest Heroes.I give Guardians of the Galaxy a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would you think if you saw a raccoon, a walking tree, a scarred wrestler, a green skinned woman, and a lazy intergalactic thief? To the general public, you would probably think this was the stupidest and most ridiculous idea to be put into your head. However, to those that are fans of comic book lore, it sets you on a path to excitement as Marvel's latest creation is released into the theaters. Yet this late in the summer does the superhero flick still have the same spark, or have we been served a lackluster filler until the next Avengers film releases next year? Read on to find out. Let us start this review with saying that Guardians of the Galaxy will not disappoint. The incredibly fictional team of anthropomorphic aliens brings a lot of diverse aspects to a series that has been rather consistent over the last few years. Stepping away from the heroic images of rock hard abs and blaring percussion music, the protagonists in this film are your run of the mill vagabonds of the galaxy. This fresh hero image is hilarious, and sets the stage for the humor that fills this movie. That's right you heard me, Guardians is filled to the brim with laughs of all kinds using the ridiculous character designs as a foundation to make you scream out in delight. In particular is the raccoon Rocket (Bradley Cooper), whose wild, enigmatic edge comes out in full force. Rocket is a feisty little cyborg animal, whose pent up rage leaves him with a short fuse that leads to explosions of cursing and well timed insults that are so amusing coming out of a little animal. Cooper does a great job with his voice acting, using the right balance of emotions to give us laughs and yet not overdo it to get annoying. This may also be because of the character design, but the casting made the right call getting the talented man the role of the raccoon. Yet the furry little rodent isn't the only source of humor in this movie, but the rest of the cast provides some other quips and treats. Chris Pratt is the same egotistical idiot he plays so well, though this time trades his mindless, dribbling shouting for some well-written dialog. Zoe Saldana is the femme fatale, whose gorgeous looks guide the group along the adventure. While not the funniest of the bunch, Saldana's acting is spot on, and her character plays off the others to provide some awkward relationships and a few zings that had me chuckle. The large and in charge assassin Drax (Dave Bautista) is surprisingly funny, mostly due to his literal take on every single thing the rest of the crew say. Combine that with well timed execution of his lines and you have a good mixture of fun, though his action scenes are surprisingly lacking and simple. Even Vin Diesel's animated avatar Groot has some laughs, despite saying five words the entire movie. Like an infant, Groot tends to put himself in situations that are harmful, often relying on others to bail him out and apologize with his catch phrase "I am Groot" that while simple, is again delivered at just the right times. Yet as the adventure continues, the lovable tree alien does many other things that will have you laughing, many of which I don't wish to reveal to avoid ruining the movie. My preceding paragraphs state that this movie has a lot of humor, but what about the action. In truth, Guardians of the Galaxy is not as much hard hitting, fist slamming, mystic weapon slinging that we've seen in the past. No Guardians instead puts a bit less slashing and more laser blasting explosions into the mix, allowing for an adventure that feels like part Marvel, part Star Wars, and part Independence Day. Many movie fans will be picking up references from Star Wars over the course of the movie, with tweaks to the scenes here and there to avoid copyright infringement. While this may lack some originality, the creation team did a nice job balancing the action with the comedy, giving us just enough fighting to quench our thirst before an exciting conclusion. Well exciting for the most part anyway, the ship-to- ship battles were my particular favorite, and the infiltration scene was rather good. Unfortunately some of the epic build up fails and becomes anticlimactic fighting that was merely an attempt to get their money's worth. In particular, the villain Ronan (Lee Pace) was not that threatening, but more so a pompous windbag who merely spoke loud and carried a big stick. Sure he had a menacing glare, but he spoke more than he acted and had little skills in the art of fighting, especially when you compare the size of him to Drax. Maybe that was the point; maybe the lack of edge was to go with the comedic theme of this film. Yet it was still a little disappointing to me, though the ending did make up for it. Despite the lack of seriously threatening villains, Guardians of the Galaxy was well worth the wait. The blend of comedy with action is incredibly entertaining, and the cast of characters bounces their styles off one another to keep you laughing with a well-written dialog. Add in the nostalgia of geeky science fiction and retro movies and you have a fun adventure to fill the superhero gap from this summer. Of course there is some dark and mature themes in this movie, especially with some of the cursing, but this movie should be okay for kids as well. So go have some laughs, enjoy the special effects and make sure to stay after the credits for another classic scene. My scores for this flick are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a most unexpected difference type of movie. The story telling aspect was pretty good. I was a bit worried that the comical parts of this movie would water it down. This was not the case here. Oh yea I found music type to be interesting. It had that old school feeling to it. I like stuff like this. Of course these elements show up in other parts of the film. As from what i can see they fit nicely into the surroundings. It brings some thing familiar to me.It held its own very well with the cast and the way the characters played out their roles. It kind of had that Avengers Type feel but with less restriction. I like wildcards cause you never know what they will do. It was moving,interesting,very funny and exciting over all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Guardians of the Galaxy' is a Must Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(No spoilers Yet)Marvels Cinematic Universe over the past 6 years has given us plenty of great quality films. However, none can compare to the brilliance of James Gunn's 'Guardians of the Galaxy'.Where do I start. The cast is amazing. Chris Pratt plays the 'legendary' Star-Lord/Peter Quill to perfection. His performance coupled with that of Zoe Saldana's role of Gamora, give on-screen chemistry like no other action adventure film. The characters of Rocket (raccoon), Drax and Groot (played by Bradley Cooper, Dave Bautista and Vin Diesel respectively) are played/voiced flawlessly, showing all elements of the comic book heroes. The villains are just as great, Lee Pace brings Ronan the Accuser to life brilliantly.(Spoilers from here down... potentially)The film isn't just fantastic actors/actresses, the story and script is perfect. If your unfamiliar with the basic idea, well a group of good guys are the only thing standing between a bad guy and the destruction of the universe.The whole film is filled with hilarious jokes and plenty of arguments which result in the team making fun of each other. The cinema was filled with laughter throughout the film, especially with Groot's signature line (only line) 'I am Groot'.(No more potential spoilers from here)Another major aspect of the film is the unique soundtrack, utilizing songs from the 70s and 80s (from the time Quill left earth) these songs add to the films comedic value and just makes the film so much fun. Thanks to Guardians of the Galaxy, i am loving the songs 'Cherry Bomb' and 'Hooked on a feeling'.In Summary, Amazing film, amazing directing and script. Story line and humor is perfect. Soundtrack is the best. Best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date. Guardians of the Galaxy is a must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Up there with Avengers and Winter Soldier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're like me you were surprised by the great reviews for this movie...for about a second. Sure it was an unfamiliar Marvel property but then again, it's Marvel Studios. They haven't had a critical flop since their start in 2008. I knew I would enjoy this before seeing the movie. It felt like it was directed by Joss Whedon.First of all, there's nothing to worry about as far as action and special effects go, so let me get that out of the way. The CGI is fantastic. I didn't expect much going in, but given that 90% of the characters in this are either motion captured or CGI completely (i.e. Rocket Raccoon) there should've been obvious blemishes or shortcuts taken with the visuals. I didn't spot one. Groot looks completely lifelike and none of the CGI work obscures his facial expressions.Yes, it is sad in the beginning and towards the end. This is a comedy, sure, but there are plenty of laughs as well. I was in a full theater and the audience was laughing hysterically, even at some of the corny humor. I expected the Rocket Raccoon to be annoying as hell but even he cracked me up with his cruel, dark humor. He was such a guilty pleasure, the farthest thing from a Jar Jar Binks. The story gets told as adequately as it needs to when it needs to. Without spoiling anything, a group of space thugs just needs to get a hold of a certain object before a sea of galactic goons retrieve it for an evil sorcerer. That sorcerer, by the way is nearly immortal and far too powerful for the Avengers to handle. The Guardians have got this one. Stuff gets complicated, and plenty of battles and personal scores to settle ensue. This is another standard Marvel formula with the plenty of room for originality and imagination, which it takes full advantage of. There is plenty of character development, for each Guardian. This is done first and foremost and is established firsthand to the action, which there's already a plethora of. But the movie never skips a beat in its emotional resonance. There's always some personal stake going on for each character with every action sequence, and this happens for EACH character. It's impossible not to feel for them as they each deal with their epic fight or collective battle or bar brawl. For them it's always personal, and you always feel it.Anyway I like to keep these short, and I've already failed at that, so I'll end here. Basically, just go see this movie. If you've seen Avengers (I mean who hasn't) then you know exactly what to expect. James Gunn follows Joss Whedon's style at every turn, and if something were to somehow happen that prevents Whedon from directing The Avengers 3, Gunn would be the man for the job. Marvel has hit another home run.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars : Marvel Style, A Nostalgic Space Opera Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy (GOTG) is an enjoyable, nostalgic Space Opera Comedy from Marvel Studios based on the comic of the same name.Peter Quill,the hero of the story, comes across as sort of a more vulnerable man-child hybrid of Han Solo and Indiana Jones. The film is full of epic space dogfights, brawls and chase scenes and the pacing of the film never "lets up". When the movie does slow down the comic relief is sharp and entertaining. Not jaw-achingly hilarious- but definitely chuckle-worthy and light.My expectations going into the theater were high with this flick, as they always are with any Marvel Studios property, so I have to admit that I was hoping for a little more from GOTG.That's why I gave it a score of 8/10. Very enjoyable, good soundtrack, plenty of laughs but just missing that 'x' factor to take it to 9/10 and above my 2 favourite films of the year so far : "The Grand Budapest Hotel" and "The Edge of Tomorrow".</fullReview>

Quill gathers a team known as The Guardians of the Galaxy to fight Ronan and save the day.The Guardians: Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Rocket (the Racoon and voice of Bradley Cooper), and Groot (voice of Vin Diesel), and, of course, Peter Qulll.There is so much CGI in here with battles, battles, battles that I fell asleep for 20-minutes 2-times and woke up and missed nothing. This is like a pin ball machine gone berserk with 5-ball bearings going all over the place (I take it you didn't like it?). Yes, a CGI Tekkie's dream, I suppose. The CGI and the Editing should win some awards. They were very good. It's just that they went on for waaaaaaaayyyy too looooooooong, The dialogues at times, when I was awake, bordered on juvenile utterances. It was like the movie was made for 7-year olds.

		<fullReview>Action and comedy do not go hand in hand. The theme of the movie is much darker and reducing it to a comedy does not do justice to the plot. I am not saying that every movie must be as dark and thought provoking as Nolan's Batman trilogy. However, there should be a certain sense of seriousness when you are dealing with a plot as dark and sinister as this one. The movie had the potential to be great, with an excellent soundtrack and awesome special effects to go with it. Marvel has really disappointed us with this one. Hopefully it will be their only weak link in their otherwise magnificent cinematic universe series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ummm...maybe I missed something?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie...I really did! I'd seen enough ads, enjoy space opera (e.g., The Fifth Element), and have a decent tolerance for questionable plot points if the action, fun, and humor are there. So I went into it prepared to suspend disbelief and have a good time.There were (potentially) a lot of things to like. I mean, come on: a talking raccoon with a bad attitude and a penchant for blowing things up? Sounds like fun. Zoe Saldana doing ballistic fight scenes in tight leatherette and green makeup? Sure, why not? Crazed intergalactic psychopaths whose desire to destroy the civilized galaxy for reasons too convoluted to grasp provides the center for an over-the-top plot that makes Star Wars look like Pulitzer material? I can live with that.The thing is...it didn't come together for me. Maybe I needed to know the comics. However, I enjoyed "Serenity" without being familiar with the Firefly TV series (of which I became a big fan afterward - too late, alas), and no movie should rely solely on an audience that knows the back story in order to enjoy it.No, I think it was a combination of things. First of all, the special effects were uneven. In some places, the animation was great - Rocket and Groot were pretty consistently convincing, for instance. However, there were lots of moments when sets or effects seemed, frankly, kind of chintzy. There were times when it felt like this was part of the humor of the movie - "See? This is space opera, and we're not taking ourselves too seriously here." - but there were other times when it just seemed like the movie makers just weren't worried about production quality and went cheap. That was disappointing. And it seemed like they filmed the whole thing on videotape.And then there was the acting, which I also found inconsistent. John C. Reilly is one of those guys who can really turn it in...but he mailed it in. And why did Glenn Close agree to play Nova Prime? I assume she thought it would be fun...to collect the paycheck. No demands on her acting chops there! As for Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana, it seemed like there were moments when they were really into it, and others when it felt like they were just passing through the scene, spouting lines. It seemed like there was no agreement among the actors and director about when to play it straight, and when to play for laughs. There were times when the acting felt incredibly self-conscious, and that killed the fun for me. If you want to make jokes, go ahead. If you want to look into the camera and wink at the audience to let them know that, yeah, we know this is just a movie, but we're having fun - great! I can live with that too. But establish the tone and maintain it throughout - don't jump back and forth. In the end, the attempts at developing the characters' emotional lives didn't add a whole lot of depth either, particularly when half of it occurs in a drunken info-dump.Bottom line? I'm glad I rented it rather than paying full price at the multiplex, and even then I had trouble sticking with it to the end. It had potential: if the people who made it took the production values and acting more to heart, it could have been a whole lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was the movie to watch this summer; I was laughing at almost every scene. It clearly was just a way for Marvel to make more money, but it was well deserved money. Although the franchise hyped up Vin Diesel too much when he really only said 5 separate, distinct words, Rocket the Raccoon made up for it. Kudos to you Bradley Cooper, because Rocket was hilarious and stole the show. The only problem I had was taking Chris Pratt seriously only because I had a hard time separating Peter Quill from Andy Dwyer, but nonetheless he made me laugh. This movie was light, easy, fun, and entertaining while also captivating audiences enough to make them overlook the space jargon that no one but the writers understand. Definitely a movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.. so much as a series of observations I had while watching this.-This movie works because it's framed as a modern day Star Wars (with surprisingly similar major plot points as well). I'm not saying it's a copy, it's actually a compliment! The reason most sci-fi's aren't successful at reaching large audiences, don't work, or can't live up to their old glory, is not because their world isn't detailed enough, but because there was nothing exciting enough to connect it to the audience. GOTG creates builds up characters you want to root for, walking the fine balance between too serious and too wacky. Sometimes though, trying to gage a reaction or an emotion becomes too transparent here as is the case with most insecure blockbusters of late trying to secure a hit. If you're trying too hard, it shows and to some extent lessens the story. But overall, it's an enjoyable family romp.-Chris Pratt for some reason looks like Dean Cain to me in this movie, from when he played Superman in the '90s. I don't know why, but it's definitely there.-Casting Peter Serafinowicz for a SERIOUS role in a comedy of this magnitude?!?! Blasphemy!! Opportunity missed, GOTG!</fullReview>

Top it all off with a kick ass sound track, and it is by far among THE best films made in the genre, and among the best put out this year.Far too often these days, films are released that are just not enjoyable due to the formulaic approach used by Hollywood. Well, there IS some "formula" involved in the film, and they try to exploit the whole "grrll power!!" scene where females are fighting....which just looks ridiculous, but the film more than makes up for any minor flaws by simply being more fun to watch than to pick at.

		<fullReview>After the very excellent Captain America: The winter Soldier this year and the very ambitious X-Men: Days of future past and the commercial success of The Amazing Spider Man 2, if not nearly as good as the before mentioned in my personal opinion, still have grossed a lot of money in the Box Office (That's a success in Hollywood), it's Guardians of the Galaxy that delivers the grand finale for a year full of good MARVEL movies and what a Blast it was to put it in a simpler sentence i'd say take all the movies done by MARVEL before, combine them together and it's still nowhere near as good as this one. it had top notch acting from all the leads who are by the way a bunch of unknowns except for a few famous actors lending their voices to some animated characters and the appearance of such thespians as Benicio Del Toro, John C Riley and Glenn Close. the cast did an excellent job they had great chemistry, they delivered some very good punchlines and each and every lead character was as well developed as the other all thanks to a brilliant screenplay and good direction from James Gunn (i'll never forget this name) who managed to give enough screen time for every character to pull off some of the greatest ensemble casts in years. not that alone he made the movie have such an atmosphere never experienced before on the big screen with sets that look a bit like FIREFLY and a great soundtrack (James Gunn have such a great taste in music i'll give him that) and last but not least i think he was very inspired by the Japenese anime COWBOY BEBOP which has the same feel to it as this one, i'm not saying he ripped it off but i'm sure it was his source of inspiration while working on this Movie.to summon this all i'd say this is a near perfect movie so get prepared for the ride of your lives, it's worth every penny you spent to buy the ticket and every second of it's 2 hour runtime so enjoy.I give it a rating of 10/10 .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Movie and one of the highlights of 2014</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was one of the non-believers. I couldn't see how Marvel was going to pull this movie off with a bunch of secondary characters who I really didn't know much about. After all, in the comic adaptation world we've been used to seeing the major players turned into big budget spectacles and the more minor and fringe characters being released by secondary studios...I have never been so happy to be wrong. When I say I was a non-believer, I was going into this movie fully expecting to see the first Marvel flop in recent times. That said, this wasn't just a movie, it was an event. I honestly believe it launched the long term platform Marvel recently announced and enabled less mainstream characters such as Dr. Strange and Ant Man to get full blown big budget productions.Much of the movie's success comes from Chris Pratt's portrayal as Peter Quill/Star Lord. He was born to play this character and is a bona fide star and leading man. It's one of those moments when a star is born and it just so happens the platform he did it on was one the best films of the year.Another thing that makes this movie so great, and what Disney/Marvel are masters at, is making it accessible to everyone. I think everyone form Junior to Granny would have a ton of fun watching this movie. The mix of humour/action/effects/story make it a truly unique experience. It's like they took what they had learnt from all of the previous Marvel movies and combined it into this one. Every detail was put into the production most likely because of people with opinions like mine where we were not sold on this concept.Something else that stood out for me was that this didn't feel like your typical 'super hero(es) save the earth' story because of the space element. It seemed larger scale and a fresh direction. It was one of the more original story lines because these are aliens and not typical super heroes like The Avengers. All of this combined to create a more unique and refreshing experience. That and the heroes weren't cut and dry good guys, they were definitely more of a grey area.In the end, if you haven't already, get down to that theatre before it's too late. You don't want to be the person who didn't the full experience of this theatrical event. After that is done, stream it on Amazon so Disney knows how much this movie was loved. This was definitely my movie of the year...there were some other good ones, but none in the league of 'GoG' as it is now known. Flixer Approved!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering it took 4 separate films to lay the foundation for the Avengers, what Guardians was able to pull off is quite remarkable. While I thoroughly enjoyed the Avengers what that film lacked was drama - you KNEW the Avengers were going to come out on top. With Guardians, all bets were off because none of the main super heroes are really Marvel mainstays like Iron Man, Hulk, et. al. This lead to a much more suspenseful film.While the film does an excellent job developing characters that the audience is emotionally invested in where Guardians truly shines is as a comedy. Chris Pratt does a great job being a lovable goofball super hero. Add to all this beautiful visuals - the Nova Corps battle scenes are sensational and you basically have a perfect family film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film in 3D at the Sony Metreon in San Francisco.... 3D certainly enhances the visual aspects of the film, which already manage to evoke Star Wars/Star Trek while remaining unique and appealing. There are also a host of solid performances in the film, especially from perennial oddballs and villains like Benicio Del Toro and Michael Rooker. The story is engaging enough, though not particularly original.There are certain aspects of the film that are disconcerting to me.... the main character's chauvinism, to some extent, but mainly the feminized villain and the sadism present in some action scenes. The film follows the trend from bad films like "300" of presenting a villain who is practically a Gothic drag queen. He's neither memorable nor scary. More disturbing still is the sadism in a couple scenes, especially a cantina scene that features a gruesome game involving large aliens devouring smaller aliens (surely the film would have been banned if it had featured a cockfight, but this is the sci-fi equivalent). There's also the scene where somebody tosses the raccoon a gun and the whole movie slows down and pauses to accentuate his "Oh yeah" before he indiscriminately opens fire on a crowd of prisoners and guards. I've never been big on the gun worship in this culture and I wished it hadn't been transferred to this sci-fi film. One of the cool aspects of "Star Wars" was the fact that the good guys fought with "elegant weapons from a more civilized age." But hell, the movie's fun..... right from the first moments with Chris Pratt's "Star-Lord" performing a karaoke version of Redbone's classic "Come and Get Your Love" using a rat as the microphone, you know that this film is going to be goofy and weird. Which makes sense, since it's director, James Gunn, started out in Troma Films. This film does a nice job of balancing the characterization with the sometimes corny jokes, and makes you want to feel positive about everybody. Also, it has a really excellent femme fatale in Karen Gillan. While a lot of the jokes seem pretty obvious, some are more visual and subtle (for example, the little decorative collector's items that Michael Rooker's character installs in his spaceship).All in all, it's a big budget re-imagining of the sort of sexualized and campy vibe that permeated Roger Corman's "Battle Beyond the Stars" -- some of these films in the Trek and SW franchises really take themselves too seriously, and this film has a lot more freedom and spirit. It's not a great movie by any means, but it stands by itself as a solid achievement while stretching the boundaries of the "big comic book movie" in a way that, perhaps, George Lucas only dreamed of doing with his "Howard the Duck" film. Which, fittingly, this film refers to. While the references stretch far beyond expectations ("Footloose", really?) they rarely enter into the domain of the outré. This makes the film an offbeat, but accessible, summer blockbuster that should spawn a series of its own sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Fooled Around and Fell in Love with this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Featuring a small-screen actor playing an unfamiliar character from a relatively obscure comic series, Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun, smart movie that proves that superhumans aren't necessarily the driving force behind the immense success of the comic book movie phenomenon. The storyline is as simple as could be: Chris Pratt's Peter Quill has a thing, everyone else wants the thing, hijinks ensue. This structural simplicity allows breakout director James Gunn to stuff Guardians full of crowd-pleasing characters, new and fantastic locations, and the promise of a successful new Marvel franchise.Marvel certainly took a risk in making this movie; the obscure source comic provides nowhere near the amount of draw as successors such as Iron Man and Captain America. The company also stepped away from the somber tones of its recent movies; the lighthearted film is carried by a goofy, irreverent main character, who at one point refers to the main antagonist as a "turd blossom." Unlike many of his comic-book protagonist peers, Peter Quill is extremely believable, in large part because he is so undeniably human. With no super serum or super-computer enabled suit of armor, the character has nothing to hide behind. This human vulnerability makes him extremely attractive to audiences who are used to a sea of superhuman protagonists; Quill is no different than we are, and we love him for it. As endearing as Quill's humanity is, Guardians makes sure that its nonhuman protagonists find their way into the audience's heart as well. This movie bravely takes on the challenge of introducing an entirely new cast of characters, and succeeds tremendously. All five Guardians are superbly casted, written, and acted; all members of the ensemble are given sufficient backstory and characterization to save them from relegation to sidekick status. In this movie, the ever-popular "band of misfits" concept manages to come across as a group of equals, rather than a group of misfits walking in the shadow of the protagonist. Digital effects are used to their highest potential, with two of the most lovable characters created out of CGI and motion-capture techniques. Guardians of the Galaxy shies away from heavy social commentary, preferring instead to remain a lighthearted, entertaining summer blockbuster. There is no ambiguity as to who is the villain, or whether the protagonists motives are truly good. Guardians is a movie about a bunch of dorks saving the earth from a really bad guy. The main conflict is simple and easily digested, which actually works in the movie's favor. That is not to say that this film is brainless fluff; Guardians features characters who are relatable, likable, and most important, interesting. Unfortunately, several of the villains were underutilized. Karen Gillan's Nebula has mountains of unrealized potential, while Thanos, the most interesting villain, has the least screen time. This underutilization most likely results from the filmmakers' focus on making audiences fall in love with the characters who will make it into later movies. Despite that small setback, Guardians of the Galaxy absolutely achieves what it sets out to do: introduce a new franchise with lovable protagonists, a fun and simple storyline, and a whole galaxy ready for exploration. The old-school soundtrack is superb; integrated into the storyline as a mixtape given to Peter Quill by his mother, it brings levity when needed while constantly reminding the audience of Quill's humanity. The CGI is well- executed, as are the post-production 3D effects. Most importantly, it is the likable characters and their chemistry as the Guardians that leave me hooked on a feeling, high on believing that this franchise is destined for great things.Rating: 9/10 stars (Tenth star pending better utilization of the fantastic villains the filmmakers have at their disposal)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since it was my birthday recently and I had collected 4 pairs of Harkins movie passes, I decided to go see Guardians of the Galaxy. Guardians is the story of Peter Quill (played by Chris Pratt), a good-hearted rogue who has spent most of his life as a 'junker' - finding and selling items throughout the galaxy. His life takes a sudden turn when he happens upon an immensely powerful object sought by Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace), an egocentric maniac with a chip on his shoulder. As Ronan seeks to use this object to conquer the galaxy, a rag-tag group of criminals and misfits - led by Peter Quill - band together to fight their common enemy.Guardians stars a cast as eclectic as the roles they are playing. We certainly have a few recognizable names with Chris Pratt as Peter Quill (a.k.a. Star Lord), Zoe Saldana playing the green-skinned assassin Gamora, and even Glenn Close as the leader of one of the many planets visited during the film. In some superb supporting roles, we have Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, Bradley Cooper voicing the trigger-happy Rocket Raccoon and none other than Vin Diesel providing exciting dialogue ("I am Groot" - repeated throughout the movie) for the sentient tree Groot.I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this film given it is such a departure from previous Marvel movies. While there are definitely humorous elements throughout previous Marvel films (such as Iron Man, The Avengers, etc.), I wouldn't qualify them as Action Comedies. Guardians, on the other hand, could almost be considered a superbly entertaining (while occasionally irreverent) comedy that happens to be stuffed full of action. Don't get me wrong, if you want to see lots of explosions, fist fights, starships and shootouts, you'll be pleased with this film, but there is also plenty of clever humor and character development. I tip my hat to James Gunn and team who managed to not take themselves too seriously (I mean, honestly, we're dealing with a talking raccoon and a sentient tree), but still produce a film with believable, lovable characters. There are definitely serious moments but, rather than feel out of place, they help to balance the film out in a way that feels natural and necessary. It's hard to say what the highlight of the film is for me but, if I have to choose, I'll say Chris Pratt as Star Lord. His comedic, normal guy approach to the character makes him exceptionally relatable and plays to his strengths as both an actor and a person. The running joke about how he wants to be called 'Star Lord' is a great example of how the filmmakers aren't afraid to poke fun at their own character. Rather than critique the movie for being "unrealistic" or "too silly," we were laughing along with them and left the theater quoting jokes and checking IMDb for the sequel's release date.If you're looking for an entertaining, well-developed sci-fi action comedy, then check out Guardians of the Galaxy. I highly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves most of its praise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvels latest action movie seems to have surprised everyone with its freshness, and all i'm going to add is, that it deserves most of its praise.I don't know if its maybe because these characters have a no doubt smaller fan-base than anything else Marvel has brought to the screen before. But its hard to imagine anyone being disappointed with this one. As long as you know the movie features the most bizarre line-up of heroic characters ever collected together (Which you've probably already seen in the trailer) you should be happy with its sci-fi action, as it practically pokes fun at itself for what it is the whole way through.There are a couple of cheesy moments, but overall this risky comic book adaption is made enjoyable by its stupid humour, unique atmosphere, and most of its special effects. Though they haven't quite mastered that distracting talking raccoon thing thats in the movie yet. But maybe the sequel will use more modern motion capture or something to pull that off eh?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall I thought this film was a great feel good movie that I watched with the whole family. The greatest thing about it was the police line up which I and my family though was absolutely hysterical. What I thought was really unexpected though was when I found out that Vin Diesel played Groot, as this was hard to figure out from what he says in the film. I also thought that the soundtrack to the whole film was amazing with some really great songs that I haven't heard in ages. The thing that I didn't enjoy about the film was the ending, I though it was to rushed and a little bit more time and effort could have been taken to think of a better ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as Star Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is a more obscure comic from the ranks of Marvel. Its movie adaptation however, turns out to be an enormous hit. And it deserves to be.The plot is a MacGuffin chase, strongly relying on heavy action and colorful characters. And in that, 'Guardians' succeeds gloriously; in many respects it does it better then 'Avengers'.A bunch of anti-heroes from space is forced by circumstances to work together and stop evil. Not getting along, they stumble themselves and each other in trouble; time and again. However action-packed, all the action stems from characterization. It is not simply an action-adventure movie that has characters in it; it's a character movie that plunges itself into action.It is different from other Marvel movies that have come out so far, but the point is: it works. It works good. Who would have thought that a movie adaptation of an obscure comic could be as good as Star Wars? I wouldn't, but having seen it I must admit it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utter morons comparing this motion picture with star wars as if its an institution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am writing this review after being disappointed by the idiocy of some Moronic sheep who think one creative story-telling effort should be compared with another. And then deducting point based on what they think this motion picture does not have in comparison to star wars. And what's disturbing is that they deducted points on story elements that were part of the star wars story, obviously it wouldn't have that, its a different story. Sure there are similarities but that might be only because of one key character Groot i believe have people confused with Chewbacca from star wars. This is not an inspiration from star wars. This motion picture is an adaptation of several characters and stories published in over forty years of print. It could be debated that when marvel decided to put these old characters into a team (that was in 2007 annihilation:conquest) they might have put in Groot as a replacement for chewy in the team. as far as star- lord is concerned he has always been depicted in that aspect, a bit rough around the edges, outlaw-ish. The film had a few flaws to how simplistically the conflict between Ronan and Xandar was explained and how did Ronan amass such resources and why didn't Kree penalize Ronan for disobeying Kree law. One very smart approach the writers took was to represent nova-corp. as a Xandarian police force stripped of powered suits in contrast to the published source material. Pacing was pitch perfect, certain generic elements were written and directed differently. A lot of the characters' team efforts were represented with the feel from the source material. Character evolution and redemption was also hinted at. Star wars is not an institution morons, its just a story, its not even its own genre, there are several films in this genre. Far-scape could be compared to star-wars. Rocket raccoon, star-lord, Drax, Gamora, moon-dragon, quasar, nova are very old characters and stories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came into this movie thinking i would love it, like every other Marvel movie I've seen before it, I did love it in fact, however it brought some mixed feelings. This movie is great it has the humor and action i expect from Marvel. However, i feel like it under-performed for me. I possibly was too hyped up, maybe the dialogue didn't really deliver at times, But after seeing it a second time it really showed its true colors, Bottom line is this movie is as great as all the other Marvel movies i've watched. Not what i expected though. Definitely a great movie and worth watching over and over. See it multiple times, You will not regret it, if you like marvel movies that is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Parents need to know that Guardians of the Galaxy is a Marvel Comics- based sci-fi action adventure about a group of misfit outlaws who band together to defend the universe against a murderous villain. There's violence, but it's mostly hand-to-hand combat and a few deaths (or near deaths) that are heartbreaking for other characters and viewers alike, in addition to grand-scale action violence with explosions and weapons. There are references to Peter's reputation as a ladies' man and jokes about his past conquests; Peter and Gamora also have a lot of chemistry and almost kiss a couple of times. Language isn't frequent but includes "s--t," "bulls--t," "bitch," "ass," "bastard," and "d--k"; at one point, the Guardians also drink an unidentified liquid that makes them drunk. With a little less edge than Iron Man or The Avengers, this adventure is a good fit for a slightly younger crowd than some other superhero movies, especially since it encourages teamwork and friendship.</fullReview>

The dialogue was intelligent, just the right side of funny (not too much and perfectly balanced) and powerful. The effects were some of the best I have seen (and I've seen ALL the big blockbusters at IMAX). The story line was deep and intricate.And the best of all - the acting (and directing) was PERFECT.I seriously cannot fault this film. 48 hours after watching it I am still smiling with amazement.I AM GROOT!

		<shortDescription>5 points for the clichés + 1 point for dialog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll try to make this quick, although I kinda enjoyed myself, you fan boys have got to calm down. This is not the "BEST MOVIE EVER OMG".The good parts : the dialog : it's not EXTRAORDINARY, but at the very least it's still a lot better than the average earache you get honored with in contemporary blockbusters. It's a lot wittier and funnier than the usual downpour of clichéd overused mindless lines you so commonly endure. It also sounds quite real and spontaneous, surprisingly refreshing and practically makes the film worthwhile (the main cast is OK to meh; dunno why everyone is raving about Chris Pratt though). The main characters are visually pretty interesting and go along well, unfortunately they are poorly fleshed out and rather generic. The goof-ball antihero, the mindless brute, the female assassin, the innocuous terror-critter etc etc etc etc...but a wide array of alien species (SW style) and awesome secondary parts played by actors that have more acting experience and skills than the main cast (!?!) save the day; always nice to see Michael Rooker, John C Reily or Glenn Close (!?!), and cheers to them. This film also (kinda) works because it doesn't takes itself too seriously, so you're a lot less inclined to bitch about the usual truckloads of stupid and juvenile nonsense mandatory to superhero movies (and superhero movie it is not, it's a space-opera); it's got a hint of a hardcore attitude to it, but sadly that gets annihilated pretty quick by the overwhelming Disney vibe, so let's stop talking about that, and start talking about what sucks.THE BAD PARTS : get ready to be stumped : most of the flick is VFX ridden, indecipherable, seen a thousand times looooong-lasting action scenes, just for the sake of it. The story? The plot is three sentences long. Hey, let's ramp up screen time with the eye-shattering spaceship dogfight, the pointless pursuit, the confusing brawl and voila : you end up with a mind-numbing film that is a jumble of situations that we've all scene far too many times before and that have practically no links with one another (should I rewrite this sentence? naah, f*** it, it illustrates the film pretty well). I'm starting to think the average Hollywood writer has a box with a hole and bits of paper inside it on his desk. He has to pick twelve (without watching), sort'em out in a crescendo kinda a way and BAM : here's your script. If you have no ending, just copy the end of Return of the Jedi, so all the geek boys around the planet will spray they 30 something shorts when they "get" the "tribute" (did YOU get it? the final three-scenes-in-one, part sword fight, part dogfight, part team fight?? MAN THAT WAS SUBTLE). So this is what drags this movie to the near-average : Hollywood thinks "space opera", does "Attack of the Clones" all over again. I know it must be hard nowadays with video games, movies coming out at an exceeding rate, the sheer amount of competition coming from every possible media from every possible country to do something FRESH.But c'mon, it's Hollywood, they have LOADS OF MONEYZ. James Gunn IS a good writer(he's from Troma and wrote Dawn of the Dead, blessed be him). Give him time to polish an original script, or if he can't do it hire another writer to help him out. Use less cash in VFX and more cash in writing, there is no need to see a thousand spaceships on screen every 5 minutes. Just stop throwing the same old same old scripts and situations over and over and over again, ad nauseam, until every movie just looks the same. I find most modern blockbusters today are HUGE PILES OF BORING SH*T (excuse my french) and I have generally given up, and that's what p***** me off the most with Guardians of the Galaxy : I was ready to give it a shot, it had soooo much potential and a real chance at doing something fresh and new in terms of tone and approach, but thanks to Hollywood it f**ked up : 3/4th of the film is riddled with all the usual clichés and shortcomings that make today's blockbusters so appallingly dull and repetitious.So no, it's clearly not the movie of the year IMO, but thanks to the humor, the dialog scenes, the characters and the second degree tone, I won't have completely forgotten about it in six months and will maybe even recommend it.PS : If it had actual swearing I would have given it 6.5. Thx Disney. Yeah I know there's no 0.5 rating on IMDb, but I can't give it 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good comic book movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie follows Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) and a band of various characters--green-skinned vicious Gamora (Zoe Saldana), muscle-bound angry Drax (Dave Bautista), Groot a talking tree (voice of Vin Diesel)and an angry raccoon named Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper). They're trying to keep an orb out of the hands of a bad guy determined to rule and destroy the universe with it.OK--I liked this but I didn't love it. It moves quickly, the special effects are incredible (especially in 3-D), there's plenty of action and fights and Rocket is LOTS of fun. However there are gaps in plot and story (I'm assuming they're saving them for the sequel), it gets way too sentimental at times (they keep cramming the message that friends are good down your throat) and I didn't think Pratt was all that good. He's all handsome and muscular but I thought his acting was pretty bad. I didn't find him endearing or that interesting. Actually none of the acting was that impressive. Rocket comes across as the most engaging character in the film (seriously--how often do you get to see a raccoon with an attitude?). Also I didn't find it that funny. There were plenty of amusing lines but that's all they were--amusing. I didn't laugh once. Still it was a fun summer movie. Worth catching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess seeing 'Boyhood' (a masterpiece, by the way) before I went to see 'Guardians' had me kind of bias against a third act full of explosions in this film. 'Guardians' story wasn't as clever or smart as I had hoped it would be, and I think it tried to make up for that with heavy action sequences. Also, there were small inconsistencies with the script that weren't large enough to open a hole in the plot, but just didn't make sense in context with character or scene. No biggie. One of the things I liked about this movie, and would have liked to see more of, was the loose sub-plot, sister rivalry thing between Gamora and Nebula. Nebula was one of the most interesting characters in the film, I would have loved to see her story unravel more. Step up for James Gun as a director though! Overall, a nice Marvel movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your typical Marvel Movie, likable characters and great soundtrack.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost, I'm an 70s and 80s music fan and to think that they incorporate such soundtrack in this Marvel film is just a piece of art. Not a typical explosions-laser shooting-spaceship fighting movie. The variety of physical and mental attributes of the main characters gave Gunn (director/writer) lots of opportunities to avoid simplistic and typical fight scenes. I like the balance of profanity in this film such that adults won't feel like they're watching a film entirely made for kids. The humor might at times is worthy only for a smile but some scenes never fail to crack me up. I like how they incorporate Quill's earthly tethers and belongings so as to remind viewers that he's still a human being like us on a great galactic adventure. As a marvel movie, it may not have some epic shots like Hulk punching a large-ass spaceship or Iron Man in a process of wearing his suit, but this film has it's own VFX magic spread in bits throughout the movie like a peanut butter and jelly evenly spread on bread. GotG does not have dead ends and it just starts on rolling since the beginning of the movie and you're going to walk out of that cinema without having a single thought that you've wasted money and time for this movie. I had high expectations before I watched the movie and those expectations were met.This movie is a great addition to the Marvel arc and they showed us something we never knew we wanted to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like someone else already said - "A New Hope"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a strange history with the Guardians of the Galaxy, that rag-tag team of intergalactic mercenaries (and more or less, superheroes) most famous for their appearances in comic books published by Marvel Comics.The first I heard of Guardians of the Galaxy, was in 2008, when Marvel Comics debuted a new line-up, which was a reboot of the first Guardians of the Galaxy team that first appeared in 1969. For one reason or another, I skipped over it. Then last year, a friend of mine who owns a comic book store sold me a copy of "Guardians of the Galaxy #1" for $45, at a discount from its original price of $50. I read through the book quickly to get an idea of what it was about, but I didn't absorb the details then like I should have.Fast-forward to tonight: I just got done watching James Gunn's big-budget 2014 adaptation of the comics, "Guardians of the Galaxy." I have to say that "Guardians of the Galaxy" has a chance to be A New Hope (hint, hint) for superhero movies.You see, since 2004, I've grown increasingly disappointed in the state of superhero movies. Readers familiar with my posts on here, know that "Spider-Man 2" (2004), is, in my opinion, the greatest superhero movie ever made. I say this because, not just because Spider-Man is my all-time favorite superhero, but because "Spider-Man 2" captured on film EXACTLY what made the comics so revolutionary when they first appeared on the scene in 1962: it was the perfect cinematic update for Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man because it made us all realize that being a superhero is not an easy task, and was not something that Peter Parker (played there excellently by Tobey Maguire) was not entirely willing to bear - exactly as it happened in the original comics. Ever since "Spider-Man 2," I've waited for another superhero film to capture that same pathos, genuine emotion, and being able to make a genuine connection to our version of the ancient Greek gods, but alas, I've been continually disappointed.That's not to say that superhero films made since then have been bad - quite the opposite - but I've just been looking for something with more feeling, and meaning, attached to it.Or something just different altogether. "Chronicle" in 2012 represented a breath of fresh air to what at that time, I felt, was an ailing genre. Now, with "Guardians of the Galaxy," I see a novel, off-beat property get a lively, big-budget adaptation for the 2014 superhero craze."Guardians of the Galaxy" is all of "Star Wars," Indiana Jones, and superheroes all rolled into one. (A New Hope for superheroes movies that combines so many different elements from so many different properties into one.) Though I know very little off-hand about the series, I came out of this film definitely more informed than going in. The film begins in 1988, with young Peter Quill losing his dying mother to cancer (thus representing the film's most - and only real - sincere and heartfelt moment, which coincidentally brings up painful memories for me, being that I lost my mother earlier this year to cancer in much the same fashion young Peter does). Immediately afterward, he's abducted by aliens and then we're catapulted 26 years into the future and into another galaxy, Far, Far, Away from our own.Peter Quill/Star-Lord (now played by Chris Pratt), is a mercenary, wannabe Indiana Jones going around the galaxy trying to retrieve priceless artifacts for his handler (emphasis on the wannabe, because he tries, and fails, to live up to his "Star-Lord" moniker, often with hilarious results), infamous blue-skinned space pirate Yondu Udonta (Gunn regular Michael Rooker). A wanted man by intergalactic authorities, Quill's travels bring him together with several other hard-luck losers, freaks, and outcasts (and all-around bad-asses): the green-skinned assassin Gamora ("Avatar" Zoe Saldana); hulking, vengeance-seeking Drax (professional wrestler Dave Bautista); the wise-cracking gun-slinger - and my personal favorite and break-out character to hopefully rival the popularity of the X-Men's Wolverine - Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper); and Rocket Raccoon's mindless muscle, a walking tree stump known only as Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). Together, these five unlikely anti-heroes must come together to save the universe from Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace), who wishes to lay waste to a nearby planet full of billions of innocent people using a newly discovered orb of mysterious and deadly power.It must be said that Troma graduate James Gunn (who also wrote Zack Snyder's 2004 breakthrough hit "Dawn of the Dead") has fashioned himself a different - not necessarily new - superhero film. Screen-time is evenly divided up amongst the five leads, who all turn in wry, slightly self-knowing performances. "Guardians of the Galaxy" plays well throughout its 121-minute running time. Bradley Cooper's Rocket Raccoon oozes slyness, coolness, and general bad-a**ery. Quite frankly, in the theater his character seemed to get the best response from everyone. And in true Marvel Comics fashion, beneath his hard-edged exterior lies an unwanted mutant freak of nature with no mission or purpose in life and no real connections to anyone else in the universe (except for Groot, that is)."Guardians of the Galaxy" looks to be A New Hope for the superhero movie genre - a superhero movie that combines "Star Wars," Indiana Jones, and superheroes all into one. Let's wait and see what they can do with this one.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's Big Gamble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is important to note that this could have been the be all and end all for the Marvel Cinematic Universe; if Guardians of the Galaxy flopped, then Marvel's prospects for the future would not look too bright to say the least. What was considered a huge gamble on Marvel's part actually pays off. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is a bold and brave new step in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and an unexpected delight of 2014. This is extremely surprising given that this is the first Marvel film to take part almost entirely in another galaxy, feature a talking animal and protagonists that do not possess super powers; they are all mercenaries, bounty hunters and rogues.The characters are new to us (unless you are familiar with the source material); all of the protagonists are fun characters to watch on screen and it is refreshing to see a new batch of superheroes fight forces of evil rather than the usual members of The Avengers. There is Peter Quill, a mercenary played by Chris Pratt, he is able to infuse energy to the film that makes him stand out whenever he is on screen. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) who oozes charm and sexiness, Drax (Dave Bautista) a character that takes every comment a bit too literally, Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) a walking, talking tree is limited to a three word vocabulary and Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper). Rocket could have easily been the character that drags the film down, but this is not at all the truth here. Cooper gives him wit and some of the biggest laughs in the film are attributable to him.It is a shame then when the villain turns up and has to spoil some of the fun. Ronan (Lee Pace) poses little of a threat for the team of misfits and his depth as a character is limited to "I am the bad guy, I do evil things". Maybe it is because I am spoilt by Loki that I crave a villain that is as witty, smart and deadly as him. To be fair to Pace he does have a physical presence, the director; James Gunn just does not know what to do with him. He is on the side-lines; his screen time is diminished in favour of beefing up the roles for the protagonists.The central plot revolves around the Guardians of the Galaxy and Ronan wanting to claim an object known as the orb for themselves. This would normally be business as usual for people familiar with previous entries in the series like 'The Avengers' and 'Thor: The Dark World'. But, what Guardians does different from those films is it turns them upside down. It acknowledges when it is silly and stupid, ensuring that we are always laughing with it, not at it. It never takes itself too seriously and when you think it will, the scene ends on a completely different note. It is the funniest comic book film thus far and I would go as far to say that it has more laughs than 75% of films claiming to be "comedies". The film is made even more enjoyable from the vibrant direction by James Gunn and the sensational cinematography, which will have your jaw dropping repeatedly.Special mention has to go to the music that is used throughout the film. The director manages to get away with using songs from the 70s, this is because Quill has his own mix tape from when he was a child, playing his music throughout the film. 'Hooked on a Feeling' by Blue Swede works with the frenetic, oddball nature of the film and is sure to have you smiling as to the ingenuity and daring of including it.The set pieces are incredible and it puts the ones shown in 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' to shame. A particular fun and clever sequence is a jail break that is attempted by our five heroes. The visuals are stellar and it is a nice showcase for the characters abilities and how they work together as a team. Through sheer luck, they manage to survive and it highlights that these characters never have a plan; they just improvise and rarely seem to know what at all they are doing.'Guardians of the Galaxy' proves that comic book films sometimes can be just witty, hilarious and light hearted fun. It is fair to say this is the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since 'The Avengers'. James Gunn does what I would have thought impossible; he creates not only a great comic book film, but an incredible sci-fi film as well. I just can't wait to see where the characters venture to next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is recommended.Finally a comic book blockbuster that doesn't take itself so seriously and never gets bogged down with all of its mythological narratives and sci-fi claptrap as so many do. Here is a film which also gives itself time to establish interesting characters and situations before all the CGI kicks in, with full doses of humor and wit to spare. Such is this unexpected surprise called Guardians of the Galaxy. Yes, one can easily see the Marvel franchise concocting sequel after sequel of this motley crew and their fool-hardy adventures in future installments, but just sit back and enjoy this original source while you can.This film is a fine send-up to the 1977 granddaddy of them all, George Lucas' Star Wars. It even follows its characters and plot somewhat. Just substitute Hans Solo, Luke, Princess Leia, Chewbecca, and the droids for this new group of space age crusaders: Peter Quill (Chris Pratt, totally buff, confidently sexy, and channeling a young Harrison Ford), a handsome daredevil of a pilot, Gamora , a Xena-like warrior princess (played by Zoe Saldona a.k.a. the reigning Sci- Fi Queen, thanks to an impressive resume that includes Avatar and the Star Trek films), and, as comic relief, a trio of cohorts including Drax (overly muscled WWF wrestler Dave Bautista), Groot (a walking talking stick figure voiced by Vin Diesel) and a CGI wise-cracking gun-toting raccoon named Rocket, who gets most of the best comic one-liners (superbly delivered by Bradley Cooper). Yes, a new generation of misfit heroes for a new generation has arrived.The far-too-convoluted yet simple-minded plot revolves around a missing and most powerful orb that can destroy the universe. (Shades of The Green Lantern!) Of course, there are an onslaught of villains, far too many, to serve as obstacles for our gang of heroes: Nebula (Karen Gillan), Korath (Djimon Hounsou), and as our modern day Darth Vader, a black hooded figure named Ronan (Lee Pace). Also aboard for the ride are: Glenn Close, Benicio Del Toro, and John C. Reilly in small and seemingly insignificant parts (at least in this first chapter). But none of that really matters. It's the exciting action sequences and the interrelationship between the film's characters that are the important elements for this film to succeed, and succeed it does! While much of the battle sequences lack visual focus with invasive upfront close- ups and shaky camera-work, the essence of comic book pandemonium is still up there on the screen.Solidly directed by James Gunn, with a clever screenplay by Nicole Perlman and Gunn himself, Guardians of the Galaxy is a nostalgic throwback to more innocent times. Its purposeful 70's pop music score helps bask in the glory of a happier era, when science fiction was once king, so long before all the gore and violence seeped into its core. But that was a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun, solid effort - but not without its flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, with trepidation, I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy on Saturday night. It actually turned out pretty well. I thought the humor was going to be overdone, and indeed by the end of the film several jokes were falling flat. On the plus side, the pace was very fast, the soundtrack was? "ahem"? awesome, the FX were top notch and it featured the best filthy Jackson Pollock joke ever.Chris Pratt as Star-Lord is OK with the humorous scenes, but when that wore thin there wasn't much left to expect from him. He's just not a very good actor when you're looking for depth.The Drax character was performed very well by Dave Bautista (better known as Batista from the WWE). The writing could have been better though, as the dialogue sometimes felt forced in an attempt to define his race's particular mode of expression. It reminded me at times of the Star Trek: TNG episode "Darmok." But again, Bautista did a fine job.Gamora was the biggest disappointment. Her character was ruined by non- committal, lazy writing. She's one of the biggest bad-asses in the Galaxy, and yet she is often portrayed as a damsel in distress ? then suddenly an unstoppable fighter, then a damaged girl with daddy issues, then a victim, then a poor waif who must resist Star-Lord's advances ? when in fact (if we were being faithful to the character) she would have screwed his brains out, injuring him in the process. You DO NOT F%$K with Gamora!Rocket was great. They didn't over-think it, and just let Rocket be Rocket. Bradley Cooper did a great voice-over job.Groot is Groot. Like Rocket, they just went with it. Thankfully they didn't overdo the "I am Groot" shtick. It was just enough to balance the annoying with the funny.Ronan the Accuser was done well. He's even more severe than he is in the book, playing him up like a religious zealot. There are plenty of Easter eggs to look for, especially in The Collector's base of operations. There's an absolutely fantastic appearance by Thanos, and as usual make sure you stay through the credits for a surprise cameo from an obscure and subversive Marvel character!Even with its faults, GOTG is a fun ride and I am relieved to be able to recommend it wholeheartedly!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY': Five Stars (Out of Five)Sci-Fi superhero flick based on the popular Marvel Comics team, of the same name. It was directed by James Gunn and written by Gunn and first time film writer Nicole Perlman. Gunn is mostly well known for directing and or writing (or co-writing) popular indie cult classics like 'SLITHER', 'SUPER' and 'TROMEO AND JULIET'; this is his first big budget blockbuster (and it was produced with a $170 million budget). It stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Lee Pace, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan and the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. John C. Reilly, Djimon Hounsou, Glen Close, Benecio Del Toro and others also play parts in the film. The story revolves around a group of misfit outlaws who attempt to keep a powerful orb out of the hands of a monstrous villain named Ronan. It's my favorite movie so far this year.Pratt plays a thief named Peter Quill. He goes by Star-Lord and travels around space hooking up with hot young alien women and stealing valuable artifacts. He was abducted from Missouri as a child, shortly after his mother died, and raised by smugglers called Ravagers. When Quill betrays Yondu Udonta (Rooker), the leader of the Ravagers, Yondu puts a bounty on him. Quill stole a valuable orb for him but doesn't deliver it. The price on his head attracts the attention of a genetically modified raccoon, named Rocket (Cooper), and his tree-like friend, named Groot (Diesel). Quill also runs into an alien assassin, named Gamora (Saldana), who wants the orb so she can keep it out of the hands of her employers, Thanos (Josh Brolin) and Ronan (Pace). When the four outlaws are captured and imprisoned, by the Nova Corps, they decide to team up to escape. They also join forces with a warrior named Drax the Destroyer (Bautista), who wants revenge on Ronan for killing his family.I found this film to be immensely entertaining; it's the type of movie I grew up on and became fascinated by filmmaking because of. It reminds me of a classic 80's sci-fi flick, in the same league as 'STAR WARS' or 'STAR TREK', and the characters are all really enjoyable. The performances are all great (especially Cooper in my opinion) and Gunn did an amazing job directing and co-writing the script. The soundtrack is perfect and it's a beautiful movie to look at too. I laughed, I cried, I was really thrilled and entertained by it; it has a little bit of everything in my opinion. I couldn't praise the movie more; it's a near perfect film. I can't wait for the sequel!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/UUizoy5DkRo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This risk paid off!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to making choices there is no studio willing to take risks than Marvel. Their track record of casting ex-addicts (Robert Downey Jnr) and indie directors (Kenneth Branagh (Thor) John Favreau (Iron Man) and the Russo Brothers (Captain America 2) have paid off immensely. But to date all the movies they have skilfully crafted have been mainstream heroes. Guardians of the Galaxy is their biggest risk yet. Based on an obscure comic without the advantage of 50+ years of history behind it and no direct connection to The Avengers, some considered Guardians to be a step too far. However Marvel have again proved their worth and come out on top. The prologue begins on Earth in the 1980s as a young Peter Quill flees a hospital after witnessing his mother pass away and is swiftly kidnapped by an alien ship. Cut to 26 years later and Quill (given himself the title Star Lord and still listening to music on his cassette playing Walkman) is on the hunt for a mysterious alien orb that will make him rich. After narrowly escaping an attack from another group of hunters, he is arrested and locked up with a group of misfits ? green assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (ex-wrestler Dave Bautista), Rocket (a brilliantly CGI raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper) and Groot (an alien tree-humanoid also CGI brought to life by Vin Diesel). Cue one of the most enjoyable prison breaks in recent memory. Each member of the Guardians has their own motive: Gamora works for her father Thanos (THE big bad of the Marvel universe, only glimpsed here but will play a key role in Avengers 3 when it eventually happens) who is after the powerful orb to help him accomplish his task of ruling the universe. Rocket and Groot are working together as Bounty Hunters and wish to arrest Quill for a huge reward and Drax is on a revenge mission to hunt down Ronan The Accuser (the bad guy pulling the strings) who murdered his wife and daughter. Together the Guardians have fantastic chemistry and is laugh out loud funny in a number of places. Although the focus is on Quill as Star Lord (played out well by comic actor Chris Pratt), the two CGI creations Rocket and Groot steal the show, especially with Groot's limited vocabulary ? he only says I Am Groot but it actually makes sense! Although the story is nothing new ? huge source of power, characters team up and save the day in a big action finale, Guardians feels fresh as it expands the Marvel Universe into outa space ? Earth doesn't get another mention. The special effects are excellent but the focus is always on the characters as they team up to thwart Ronan and his army. All in all, Guardians is a very enjoyable and recommended addition to the Marvel Universe. As usual stay till after the credits for a funny surprise. This risk has definitely paid off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Marvel Space Opera That's Hilarious, Action-Packed and Goes There!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Marvel Cinematic Universe is perhaps the best superhero franchise to watch on both the big screen and on any home entertainment format, with its epic story lines, heroic characters, big-scaled action and even funny humour in its core. Guardians of the Galaxy take this further than any other comic, and prove it to be driven on what the audience wants; laughs, action, emotion and sci-fi excitement.Performances here are truly taken to be serious, with the entire cast looking to have a blast to play their role in the film. Chris Pratt at first is an actor that we don't think is action hero material, but seeing him in the leading role as Star Lord was something to remember. He gives not only a personality that we can understand but the humour he delivers is great and his connection with the cast is truly strong in presence. Zoe Saldana as Gamora is a role that not only she plays an green-skinned alien assassin, but seems to be enjoying it further than Avatar. A definite highlight for the film was Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, having played in only a few small roles with little acting experience he has improved heaps here and gives us one of the comic's best characters to life with humour, emotion and muscle. Bradley Cooper (Rocket Raccoon) and Vin Diesel (Groot) act like the ultimate best friends as CGI created creatures, Cooper is perfect as the voice of the temperamental, funny and weapon welding raccoon, it's a role that he fits perfectly in terms of voice, emotion and character while Diesel's Groot is both awesome and fun, and is possibly his 2nd best role in film. The supporting cast includes the talented Lee Pace (Ronan the Accuser), Karen Gillan (Nebula), Michael Rooker (Yondu), Benicio del Toro (The Collector), Josh Brolin (Thanos), John C. Reilly, Glenn Close and a few more all play their roles with pitch perfect condition and the overall casting itself is amazing!Direction by James Gunn (director of Slither and Super, and screen writing credits) is great, he delivers not only an eye for detail for what we see and hear on screen but he does manage to drive the humour all the way to the end credits, which is something totally different for a Marvel film. Humour used particularly here is the quotes the characters say, an example can be the Earth lifestyle and culture of Star Lord (coming from an 80's generation) it confronts with the characters in hilarious ways as they have no idea or clue what it means or sounds like. Emotion too is played along the storyline, especially in the opening scene and the revelation of how the heroes are meant to be together. In terms of production, visual effects and sound, it is given a great amount to detail to make the page of the original comics come to life.Gunn looks like he's had a lot of research and inspiration from not only the original comic source, but elements of science-fiction in films, particularly with Star Wars for its characters, spaceship battles and story. For example, Peter Quill/Star Lord is a resemblance in personality of Han Solo, Gamora resembles Princess Leia and Groot resembles Chewbacca. The storyline itself is interesting and entertaining for its 2 ? hour running time, packing in a big dose in humour that will leave the audiences in stitches and quoting the lines that make the film most popular for. The villain is well delivered and there's no shortage of chaos from his army, but it's the heroes that give all the best moments to laugh, cheer and care for. Guardians of the Galaxy is not only the best film in Phase 2 (alongside Captain America: The Winter Soldier, for its superhero take on the 'Political-Thriller' genre) but one of this year's unexpectedly entertaining films that takes audiences worldwide by surprise, and it has guaranteed a spot on my Top 10 films for 2014. Bring on the sequel in 2017, I hope the universe is taken further.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A breathe of fresh air into an already thriving Marvel Cinematic Universe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Guardians of the Galaxy" is the movie we've all been waiting for. It combines a pleasant mix of comedy and action to give us what many believe, including I, that this is Marvel studios best film to date. From the perfect cast to the engrossing story, this film is one of the best and should go down as one of the best superhero movies to hit the big screen. Chris Pratt is perfect as Star-Lord, a brash young adventurer, born on Earth, but taken as a young boy when his mother passed away. He sees himself at odds with an evil ruler known as Ronan the Accuser when he tries to steal an orb containing an infinity stone, yes that's right, an infinity stone. Fate then leads him to meet up with the daughter of Thanos, Gamora, two thugs trying to collect their due, Groot and Rocket, and finally a revenge driven maniac known as Drax, who is in my opinion one of the brightest surprises of the film. They then must put aside their differences and team up to stop Ronan and his army from using the infinity stone to wipe out the galaxy. Now if I was forced to point out a negative I would say that the villains are a bit under developed but that's about it. Now all i can is bring on Age of Ultron!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite all the high appraisal or hype for GotG, I never fully accepted it to be that great. Marvel has produced quite a few entertaining movies recently and I'd group this one closely together with Captain America 2 or Iron Man. Although it's not purely comedy or action, GotG combines these two genres beautifully making the entire watch entertaining. The comedic scenes went along very well with this movie--funnily lifting spirits after dark(er) moments. Not expecting it to be dramatic, it was fairly deep (though easy to follow along). Not extremely thought-provoking but emotional. GotG was a pleasant surprise for me. With previously subpar expectations, I will admit that I was either smiling, laughing or somewhat intrigued at any one frame in the movie. A classic from Marvel that I greatly enjoyed.</fullReview>

I must say that Chris Pratt was unknown to me as an actor but he was perfect for this role as Peter Quill/Star Lord,Zoe Saldana awesome as always,Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer is really bad-ass,Rocket Racoon and Groot are freaking awesome and hilarious, especially Rocket. All Marvel's movies like Thor,Iron Man, Captain America,Avengers are great but Guardians of the galaxy surpassed them. This is so far one of the best comic superheroes movies ever.

		<fullReview>This movie was really good. What was cool was that it was able to be funny and serious at the right times and it felt like it knew what it was doing. It was cool to see all these different kinds of people get together to fight 1 ultimate enemy. The movie was fast paced which was really awesome and kept you into it. 3/4 of the jokes made me laugh which was really good since at first I thought they were going cheesy jokes. Rocket was hilarious but the character himself was actually a dumb idea. Gamora was a cool character but i liked the others better. drax also was an epic character. Groot was funny since the only words he could say were I am Groot and it never really got old. Sometimes the movie was funny in dumb ways like Rocket beating up grass. The action was surprisingly good. I didn't like the fact that sometimes the action scenes felt like star wars. It was kind of dumb. It was really awesome how the infinity stone and the collector were connected to Thor the dark world. The connection to the post credit scene of the avengers was good. Peter Quill was an hilarious and well thought of character. The comic relief of the movie was good since it always seemed to be in the right places. It was awesome that the trailers didn't spoil as many jokes as I thought it would. Ronin's death with the infinity stone orb really made sense unlike the deaths of many marvel movie villains. the scene with his mom at the beginning was kind of unnecessary and its connection to the end but it didn't push its way into the spot light too much so it was acceptable. i didn't quite like Peter's blue friend he was an extremely dumb character. The aerial/ inside the ship fight at the end was awesome except for the part when the government tried to net the giant ship. The chase scene at the beginning was awesome since you got to meet 4/5 guardians and see their motives. Groot reviving was unnecessary. Drax was kind of under developed but we still got to see some funny and awesome scenes with him. All issues listed above are minor and it would give this movie 9 if it weren't for THE POST CREDIT SCENE! Yeah that's right let's bring back HOWARD THE DUCK. There's a reason we haven't seen him in 28 years. IT'S BECAUSE HE'S THE WORST MARVEL CHARACTER. I sure hope they don't bring him back for more even though they probably will. Why did they have to ruin the ending. It was great until then. Guardians of the Galaxy is great except for a few minor faults and a failed ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like lead character Quill/Starlord's many Kirk-esque alien-female conquests, 'GotG' charms our pants off but doesn't just coast along on a lot of that charm and humour. That's not to say that the charisma and quirkiness of the movie are not sincere and artful but that the humanity of one character (Pratt's Quill) is more deeply explored than previous Earth- to-fantasy heroes, including Harry Potter. He is Alice in Wonderland with a cool leather jacket and guns while the myriad creatures and characters around him are enticingly eccentric, have their moments of humour and pathos and become wondrous in director Janes Gunn's hands.Gunn is a great conductor of an audience - which is a modern rarity in blockbuster effects films - if you look at Michael Bay movies shows what happens when the heart dissolves from a project.Rather than just tip the toys out onto the playmat, Gunn gives them voice and emotional resonance. However, more than any other director in the cycle of "Geek revolution" comic book movies and TV shows, Gunn has tapped into why many "geeks" retreated into or embraced sci-fi and cult pop culture in the first place. Here is the group of toys or comics that listened when you were bullied. Here are the records mom or dad played in the den while you immersed in kenner playsets or Marvel one-shots. Here are the matte vistas of 'Heavy Metal' magazine with the frenetic edits and dynamics of cartoons like 'He-Man', 'Thundercats' or 'Galaxy Trio' yet couched in human roots (or Groot's) so deftly, it reawakens why you loved such "kid's stuff" in the first place. A love letter from kids of the 70s and 80s.</fullReview>

On top of that its very funny, there are many laugh out loud moments. From the opening scene to the closing you will wish it never ends. The great thing is they wrapped up the current storyline but left it wide open for what I hope are many sequels to come. One little hint, don't leave until the credits are complete.

		<fullReview>You must have read the reviews by now. You don't need to read mine to know that this is the one you have been waiting for. We had "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" this Spring. Now we have the late Summer flick to add to Phase 2 for Marvel. This movie delivers the hilarity of comedy of Chris Pratt and Bradley Cooper, but you also see the dramatic sides to each of the five main characters and this is what brings them together. This movie as we all know will have a sequel. There is excess footage after the credits roll, so stay for a few minutes. You will love the soundtrack. It's from the 1970-1980's. Peter's mother made him the mix tapes. There are some secrets you need to watch for and some surprises that are revealed. This movie will tie into "Avengers: Age of Ultron" and "Avengers 3" (rumored) You know how Kevin Feige is with his work. James Gunn did an amazing job with writing and directing this film and this blended cast is perfect. With some foreshadowing that writers love doing, I believe "Thanos" voiced by Josh Brolin, has some darkness appealing to his character and there is some heaviness playing in the Marvel Universe literally when it comes to Phase 3. Watch this movie, so you are kept in the loop. Agents of SHIELD will probably do the work of leading you to "Avengers:Age of Ultron" and possibly drop hints to everyone. Remember, it's all connected...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Pixar made a live action film, this would be it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back when it was announced that Guardians of the Galaxy would be an upcoming Marvel film, me, as well as many other fans asked the same thing: why? These are characters that people, outside of the comic book community, don't know at all. So pretty much for me the days leading up to the films release I was excited to see this film but due to my lack of prior knowledge of these characters I wasn't so sure if the film will hit well with me. I'm glad I've been proved wrong! At this point we shouldn't doubt producer and head honcho of the Marvel Cinematic Universe Kevin Feige and his abilities of gathering the best talent to develop movies for him. James Gunn is without a doubt an amazing choice for the directors chair. Gunn clearly knows that many people have no clue who the f##k this clan of misfits are yet he makes sure that each member had their moments of fame. It's pretty obvious that Gunn has drawn inspiration from Star Wars and Indiana Jones. I also saw a little hint of Back to the Future, The Goonies, and even many Pixar films as well. From it's opening scene alone has Indiana Jones written all over it. As Peter Quill enters the dark tombs he knows for certain that any misstep can be failure for him. This plays just like how the opening for Raiders of the Lost Ark as we first meet Indy. However, I don't recall Indy dancing through the caves and traps. Chris Pratt is without a doubt the perfect casting choice for Peter Quill/Star Lord. His charismatic energy embodies the character and gives us all a good look on what a likable hero should look like. Pratt reminds me of a classic 1950's actor: He is an entertainer, period, and he has achieved that he has (Yoda voice). The rest of the casting all around were perfect. Zoe Saldana as Gamora, the Guardians answer to Black Widow. Dave Bautista as Drax, who ended up surprising me. The biggest standouts to me however were the voices of Bradley Cooper as Rocket Raccoon and Vin Diesel as Groot, and let me say I never got tired by his only line "I AM GROOT". It was risky for Marvel to roll the dice on a property very unknown to general audiences, let alone the fact that two of the characters are a CGI animated talking raccoon that shoots guns and a talking tree. And to think we got this before a live action Wonder Woman. But in the end Gunn has successfully made this weird duo work. The fact that I find myself caring for a gun holding raccoon and a talking tree says a lot and Gunn made it believable and lovable. Out of all the MCU films released, so far Guardians of the Galaxy had the most heart. I found myself nearly tearing up within the first five minutes just like how Pixar's Up got me. It's without a doubt my third favorite film in the MCU series (after The Avengers and Captain America: The Winter Soldier). 9/10-Gerry T</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Get ready for a new brand of Marvel movie heroes. You surely know Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk, but it's high time you are introduced to Peter Quill, Rocket Raccoon, Gamora, Groot and Drax. Instead of dark, gloomy and super-serious, these guys aren't just funny ... they are actually FUN! The plot is admittedly a bit simple. Everyone involved is basically chasing a ball (the orb) around the galaxy. Instead of good guys vs bad guys, it's actually kinda bad guys vs really bad guys. See, the heroes of our story are for the most part criminals themselves. The main difference is, they aren't after intergalactic super power and mega destruction like Ronan (Lee Pace). Ronan makes for a pretty menacing villain, especially with a voice that shook the theatre! The band of misfits thrown together by circumstance actually provide much entertainment. Chris Pratt ("Parks and Recreation") is the self-nicknamed Star-Lord, better known as Peter Quill. The film begins in 1988 as Quill's mother dies and he is abducted by aliens. His criminal activity has him crossing paths with Gamora, a green assassin played by Zoe Saldana; Rocket, a brilliant, wise-cracking raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper; Rocket's bodyguard Groot, an unusually mobile and talented tree voiced by Vin Diesel; and the hulking, knife-wielding Drax the Destroyer who is bent on revenge, and played by WWE star Dave "The Animal" Bautista. It's a rag-tag group of heroes unlike anything you have seen before.Despite the lack of familiarity with these characters most viewers will bring, writer/director James Gunn (Slither) works wonders in having us quickly connect and even groot ... err, I mean ... root for these guys. Quill's possession of a Sony Walkman to play his mother's mix tape from the 1970's and 80's gives the film a very different flavor, as the familiar songs pop up at just the right time.Pratt does an admirable job in the lead, and though compared to the GQ Tony Stark/Iron Man he is more Mad Magazine, his Quill is funny and easy to like. The best comparison I have for Quill is Han Solo, and for the film I would say it hearkens back to 1978's Superman ... both very high compliments. It's also the first time I have been completely caught off guard and laughed outloud at a Jackson Pollock reference.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Pratt stars as a Peter Quill a.k.a. Star Lord, kidnapped by aliens when he was a child he has become a ravager who seeks out treasures in order to sell them to collectors or interested parties, kind of like a paid thief. Along the way he "recovers" a mysterious Orb that everyone in the galaxy wants to posses, from mercenaries, to The Collector, to a dark figure called Ronan the Accuser and even the mysterious Thanos. By circumstance he is joined by a team of Rogues determined to protect the Orb from evil hands once they discover its awesome powers.The movie is incredibly entertaining, it has an amazing soundtrack, great special effects, amazing performances, well written, well-cast, it is truly one of the funnest movies I have ever seen, it is very enjoyable and it helps set up the next phases in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.But whether you are a Marvel fan, or have never even heard of Guardians of The galaxy, this movie is for everyone who enjoys adventure, comedy and thrills.A thrill ride with an awesome 80s soundtrack, so come and get your love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine that you are watching the 'Avengers' without watching Thor, Captain America, Ironman, and Hulk. You'll always think "who are they and where they are come from?" while watching movie. The storyline was not enough to introduce themselves. Marvel should launch this movie after building each hero's background movie like Avengers. Good to watch. - but it could be kinda B-grade time killing movie if you have no idea of background. :) - bunch of visual effects and slap-sticks that makes you laugh :) - Wordless character Groot, but he's funny enough like Brown(LINE character) Well made B grade movie, but not an A class.(At least for me, who has no background of Guardians of the galaxy)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will say that the guardians of a film that delivers on the humor and actions. The guardians include Peter quill aka starlord which was kidnapped by aliens as a child after his mother died from cancer. Zoe Saldana plays the assassin gamora who ends up switching sides as a way of bringing down Ronan played by lee pace. Bradley cooper provides the comedic relief as rocket a genetically engineered raccoon. Vin diesel does the voice and the motion capture of groot a humanoid looking tree. Dave Bautista plays drac who wants revenge against Ronan for the death of his daughter and wife. Even though the guardians seem like an unlikely bunch to save the world, but it turns out that their differences is what makes them unique and coming together to be the superheroes that is expected of. I can't wait for the sequel to be released in 2017.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel Continues Its Excellence in Filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, just wow! Marvel Studios keeps churning these films that keep making superhero movies to be among my favorite types of films. Marvel has now added to that again here with one that I had a blast watching, Guardians of the Galaxy.In 1988, young Peter Quill is living on Earth and his mother passes away. He runs off but is abducted and then raised by Yondu (Michael Rooker) and his Ravagers. 26 years later, Peter (Chris Pratt) is now traveling around the galaxy, stealing things, living life, and prefers to be called Star Lord, until he steals an artifact and is stopped by Korath (Djimon Hounsou). Although he escapes, Korath calls on Gamora (Zoe Saldana) to retrieve the device. When Star Lord, tries to sell it, he is ambushed by Gamora and a fight ensues. This attract a pair of bounty hunters, Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and a tree-like humanoid named Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). However, they are all stopped and imprisoned together. While in prison, the four meet Drax (Dave Bautista), who first wants to kill Gamora for her association with Ronan (Lee Pace), who killed his family. Star Lord convinces Drax that is not the case as Gamora has betrayed Ronan. The five all team up as they are wanted for the orb they have.James Gunn direct and co-wrote this film and has done a spectacular job. Gunn has done a great job of telling us a story, showing us who these characters are, and keeping us interested in what is going to happen next. Gunn and his co-writer Nicole Perlman have done some great work at giving us this story of a group of heroes, but different from The Avengers.Chris Pratt hugely stands out in this film as Peter Quill/Star Lord. While I have highly enjoyed his roles from Parks and Recreation, The Five Year Engagement, and Delivery Man, he shows a completely new side to his acting with this role. Here, we are not seeing the hilarious slacker or best friend like those other roles. With this part, Pratt shows that he can carry a film and shows that he can have a dramatic side too. The next standout surprisingly to me was Dave Bautista as Drax, the big muscular prisoner who joins the Guardians to first avenge his family, but becomes a respected member. Zoe Saldana is great as Gamora, who antagonizes at first, but joins Peter's Side. Bradley Cooper is a riot in his part voicing Rocket Raccoon. I also enjoyed Michael Rooker as Yondu, who seems to want to murder Peter. I also enjoyed seeing Benicio Del Toro, John C. Reilly, and Glenn Close in each of their brief roles.On the technical side, there are so many spectacular things to praise. First to stand out is the visual effects in this film. Next is the production design as it shows a lot of creativity and many interesting set pieces. The makeup is very well done. I also enjoyed the cinematography by Ben Davis, and the music by Tyler Bates.I had a fun time watching this film, and would be happy to see it in theaters again. Marvel continues to show their excellence not just in superhero films, but films overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never read a comic about these guys, and the only character i recognized was Thanos, still im happy to say that this has become one of my favorite Marvel movies so far, it was a intense, funny, heartwarming, gutclinching roller-coaster with amazing attention to detail. I don't wanna spoil it for anyone so im just gonna say it was as close to a perfect score 9/10 a movie of this type can get, I don't even know what to compare it to, nothing i'v seen in the past comes close to what this was, it felt fresh new and innovative! I loved it! If im gonna give it some critique, I would have to say that there was one scene in the middle of the movie that didn't really make sense to me, something about a gravity controller making guns not work, oh and the clip after the end credits kinds got me worried, will we soon see ducks in space? ;) hehehe Howard? but whatever, it might be epic in its own right, Rocket sure was a gritty raccoon and "WE ARE GROOT!"!.THINGS WILL GET EASIER!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into guardians with pretty low expectations. Marvel has been hitting its stride in bringing its comics to the big screen, but Guardians faced several hurdles. First and foremost, the Guardians and their villains rely on more 'cosmic' threats and are less well known than their counterparts. Your average person on the street likely knew who (at least generally) Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor were before the movies. That's less likely to be true about the larger cosmic universe unless you grew up on Silver Surfer or Captain Marvel. Its second problem rested on bringing a larger universe to the audience in a well received method. Marvel tested its chops in the Thor movies, but even there we were on a 'subway' system of planets with fixed tracks, rather than just an all-encompassing universe. Given these concerns, I was hesitant about guardians. But Marvel nailed it. Guardians is unlikely to bring home any major awards, but it is a pointedly FUN movie, and its more than just a popcorn view. It produces some real laughs, and some real emotions from the audience as you follow its story. It also ties into the rest of the Marvel movies and helps develop their over-arching plot. Ultimately, the weakest elements of Guardians is the main antagonist, its villain. While all of the actors deliver great performances (Quill and Rocket in particular), the villain feels either over-exposed or under-developed. In other words, we see him often enough that we should be learning more about him, but never do. If your villain is going to be an embodiment of evil, it needs to be treated like Jaws and limited in its screen time. If, on the other hand, you want a developed villain like Loki, we need to learn more about him. The main villain is stuck in the middle, and while it's not his fault, it is noticeable. Guardians is good enough that when you walk out, you'll be looking forward to the next one. And more than that, its a breath of fresh air from what are beginning to feel like the "safer" marvel franchise. It explores new areas, and new characters, and it does it well.</fullReview>

It is the best of all the Marvel films they have done. I state that not owning one comic book or reading anything at all about this characters.I hope they start working on the sequel as soon as possible...and that they keep the same writers and the same director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Marvel Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel's blockbuster formula has time and time again proved to generate massive mounds of money, so why change it? This is my primary problem with Guardians of the Galaxy. It follows the same formula of others in the Marvel cinematic universe but it fails to add it's own distinctive personality to the trade. While a lot of elements in 'Guardians' feel very polished; from the well-crafted action sequences to the witty dialog it cannot shake the overwhelming stale feeling left by the films the proceeded it. 'Guardians' just doesn't feel original.The story of Peter Quill and the formation of the other Guardians is predictable and full of typical blockbuster cliché's but this is not to say that it isn't fun. At times, the tale can be thrilling, and almost engrossing, but it all amounts to feel like I've seen this before. Many of the scenes feel directly ripped out of other films it resembles, and this results in the overwhelming feeling of deja vu.With all this said, Guardians of the Galaxy can be a lot of fun, just don't go in expecting something spectacularly original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember being one of the select few of being a bit overly excited hearing that Guardians was about to get their big screen debut. Yes, I knew it was a huge gamble. Honestly, it was a win-win situation for them. (If it was good, then MCU could bring ANY character to life. If it was bad, it was a lesson learned; pair them up with The Avengers, like in the comics, and continue on). A lot of people weren't thrilled about this, but I kept my hopes high.Last night, I was able to catch the movie on the night of July 31st. HOLY CRAP THIS MOVIE DELIVERED!! I loved everything about this film! It had everything. It was hard for me to dislike any one on the team (though Rocket and Groot were the stars of these "losers"), Star-Lord, Gamora, and Drax...hell even Yondu was nice. One thing I REALLY liked that had a bit of an advantage over The Avengers was that they all sacrificed for each other. They grew into a family the more and more the film developed. The ONLY gripe I had about the movie was I wish Thanos was just a TAD bit more in here. Ronan was cool, but just didn't hit a home run (maybe got to 3rd base, but nothing past that). What more can I say about this? Easily the first 10 giving out from me in a LONG time. You will laugh, you will cry/have that tear in your eye (never thought I would say that for a Marvel film, but...), you will even find yourself dancing! Stay for the end credits (duh), sit back and enjoy the nostalgia!! I wish I could have given this higher than a 10....</fullReview>

The characters are great, the plot works, the CGI is well done, the 3D is tasteful, and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing.It is an all around entertaining movie, and that's supposed to be the point. It also ties in with the Marvel universe, so that is a nice bonus for anyone who has been enjoying watching comics come to the silver screen of late.Obviously, not all movies are for everyone, but this one has very few flaws, as far as I can tell. I (and most people) are avidly waiting for the next one. This movie could easily spawn several sequels at this pace, and I'd be quite content for a long time.Better than Star Wars? ... No weed is that good. Just stop. Star Wars will remain untouched, simply because of it's originality. Everyone knows what lightsabers and X-Wings are. And MOST of the cast. Nothing will ever be better than Star Wars.Back to this one. Hell yes. If you haven't seen it. Do so. It's good alone, and great for a date.</fullReview>

Direct, yes, and very well; But write, definitely not. In preproduction Gunn took the script out of the hands of better qualified writers and screwed it up. He is not qualified to write like Lucas, Spielberg, or Besson, but he thinks he is and, unfortunately, so did the ignorant producers. Continuity between scenes and even (cartoon/comic book) science was completely screwed up.I rated this at just 4 because of the horrible script Gunn stuck his fingers into.

		<shortDescription>Typical Marvel action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited at the news that the movie hit the DVD shelves and went directly to rent it. I was urged by the need to see it, even if I lost faith in all movies produced from Marvel, after reading so many comments on the internet about it. I must say I was definitely disappointed once again. The characters are poorly drawn, I mean by this that beside the main character all the other ones have no background and therefore cannot raise any emotion as hard as they try. Some good actors, in my opinion, like Benicio Del Toro and Glenn Close have merely but a cameo appearance, which cannot be taken serious. This looks a lot like a modern Star Wars movie, but with all the new special effects where acting is really not important. It is a movie which impresses probably because of the 3D, the new generation of teenagers, and all the sound effects, but I would not like to see it again. It is a movie to spend time eating popcorn and trying to figure out why a certain character is acting in a certain way but you won't get to any conclusions. Without all the special effects, high explosions, the movie remains but a ghost forgotten in time. If this movie would have been released in the 80's it would have made it only to VHS tape. Without the money spent on publicity they wouldn't have probably got their money back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They call themselves the Guardians of the Galaxy...this might not be the best idea...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy are a team of superheroes that is currently published by Marvel Comics. The superhero team made their first official appearance in Marvel Super-Heroes #18 in January 1969; the Guardians are active in the 31st century in an alternative timeline of the Earth-691 Marvel Universe and the original team comprise of Vance Astro, a founding member of the team and an astronaut from the 20th Century Earth who spends a thousand years travelling to Alpha Centauri. Other original teams include Martinex, Captain Charlie-27 and Yondu Udonta. Each is the last of their kind and they are 'forced' to unite as a team against the actions of Badoon, an alien race which strives to conquer the Earth's solar system.So what did I think of the most anticipated Marvel Films to date? I think that Guardians of the Galaxy is a thrill to watch and will most certainly appeal to the general audience? Comic book fans? Well, first let's discuss the movie in general. First onto some flaws. Gamora portrayed by Zoe Saldana, I am not judging the actress, I thought she did a satisfactory job at playing the comic book character even though she looked like she was sleep walking throughout, however her make up didn't really impress me if I am honest. I didn't admire on how they import prosthetic cheekbones as if you read the comic books, you'll notice that their appearance is like a regular human being and has dark circles around her eyes. I wish they could've stayed with that character design as it was more basic in that aspect. Not to mention, she was totally unlike the character I know in the comic books. I guess they wanted a more sympathetic and softer character to counter balance all the rough 'n tumble ones on the team, but for someone who's read some of the Guardians of the Galaxy series and knows Gamora as a character, it was something I just couldn't get used to.Furthermore, the helmets of the Nova Crops in this circumstance looked differentiated when comparable to the Nova Crops in the comic book. Also, I do have a grudge towards Rocket Racoon. I didn't particularly find this voice amusing as it needs to sound louder and angrier and he didn't really maintain a considerable amount of screen time in this film as much as the other Guardians. But these flaws/nit-picks are down to personal preferences which don't bring the movie down as a whole.Now onto the good points. The action sequences obviously were a joy to observe as the film conserved a witty and gritty tone simultaneously which as a result makes the violence dark and disturbing and the action is contained with plenty of variety.There's real emotional depth to the members of Guardians of the Galaxy. Examples being towards the end of the film where I got really teary-eyed at Groot as he attempts makes a tree barrier around the other guardians, causing him to explode into bits of tree and ultimately die. However, he is re spawned when Rocket place one of his twigs in a pot and Groot comes back as a baby. The comedy scenes is what stood out for me the most as this movie maintain some genuine funny moments and Groot and Rocket Racoon is what stood out the most for me in terms of amusement. An interesting fact is that the Guardians of the Galaxy comic book series preserved comic relief scenes throughout each individual issue and seeing that theme come to life on this adaptation really puts a smile on me and comic book fans. The cast in this movie is additionally brilliant. Chris Pratt provides his performance as Star Lord or his alter ego Peter Jason Quill magnificently; he maintains the charm of the specified character and various charisma. The best scene for him in my opinion is when he is dancing throughout with 80s soundtrack, distracting the villains from more destruction. Zoe Saldana was satisfactory as Gamora; she conserves an intriguing backstory that will shape the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. After her family was killed by Thanos when she was a young girl, she was tortured and raised as an assassin, only to rebel against him when she learned of his plans to destroy an entire planet. Dave Bautista supplies reasonable and miscellaneous rage feelings as the vengeful Drax The Destroyer. However the most satisfying character arcs in my personal opinion was Groot and Rocket Racoon in particular. These duos have been the main concern on the building of this movie, but they tried to make them look bad-ass and surprisingly affecting on how they become as what they become right now.The direction was additionally creative as James Gunn imported his unique tone, balance of comedy moments, action scenes, spectacular various environments and emotional and heart hitting sequences which blended in perfectly with this comic book adaptation. With Thor: The Dark World and Captain America: The Winter Soldier attempting to conserve dark themes in most circumstances, Guardians of the Galaxy is the opposite of that considering that it has witty dialogue and it is a non-stop adventure while also know when to balance with dramatic scenes in the appropriate time.So in conclusion, despite some comic book accuracy errors, a particularly undeveloped villain known as Ronan The Accuser, slightly disturbing character designs and voice performances, Guardians of the Galaxy nevertheless is a very good film! If you wish to see a Marvel Studios Film with more comic reliefs while also attempting to be dramatic at the same time, then I think you'll find this movie amusing in those aspects! I recommend that you do see it especially since it's a authentic setup to Avengers: Age of Ultron! I give Guardians of the Galaxy a 7.5/10!</fullReview>

One of them even said it was better then "The Avengers" which quite frankly is a huge call in my book.Like the title of my review says, yes I laughed in places. Yes I figuratively drooled when Chris Pratt took off his shirt. And yes I liked the characters of Rocket and Groot. But that's it. I wasn't particularly attached to any of the characters personally (the character I felt most for was a tree with a vocabulary of 4 words. Work that one out.) The bad guys (there were two and right now I can only remember one of their names and I saw the movie 2 hrs ago) were one dimensional and felt evil just for the sake of being evil.Let me make one thing abundantly clear. Killing a main character's mum right at the start is not enough to make me emotionally invested in what happens to him. Almost every superhero has at least one dead parent. There has to be more. Oh and sibling rivalry? Yawn. A popcorn movie that is entertaining but nothing ground breaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) is without doubt a fun movie. The characters are entertaining, the blend of action and comedy is good, the use of 70s pop music on the soundtrack is brilliant, and there is enough story to keep you involved in what's going on. However, the Indiana Jones and Star Wars comparisons? I don't fully buy into those after actually watching the movie.For me, GOTG was a more entertaining version of The Avengers (2012), but it's still your run-of-the-mill comic book blockbuster. It's all banter and overblown action moving at terrible speed. The villain Ronin was bland and the plot was all based around an all-powerful MacGuffin orb. It takes visuals from Star Wars and has some of the fun action you would see in an older Indiana Jones movie, but I would not put any of it in the same league. The movie starts losing steam about an hour and a half in.In conclusion, this is like any other comic book movie from the past five years. It's fun for one watch, but I have no desire to go back to it or see the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was excited about seeing this movie, and expected a little more than I got. I think that will be the experience of a lot of people who have heard rave reviews, but aren't especially into comic book movies. The movie is entertaining, and funny, but rather hollow. It opens with a scene that is sort of a cheap, manipulative trick to garner sympathy for a character, but doesn't really earn that level of emotional investment. It goes on to throw together an ad hoc collection of characters that are in essence bad guys, and somehow they set aside their self-interests to team up, and become the closest of friends remarkably fast. Once again, the writing doesn't earn this progression, it just asks us to accept it. I didn't. I had the same issue with Star Wars. Those characters didn't know each other long enough to have the feelings they developed in microwave fashion. None of this will matter to you for the most part. But it does take those shortcuts, and uses those manipulations to substitute for character and story development. I did like two of these characters more than the others, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot, because I did buy their symbiotic relationship. The others I didn't. The laughs are there. Big laughs. The soundtrack was goofy. On several occasions they seem to stop the movie altogether so they can play a tired 70's easy listening song that doesn't fit, move the story forward, or make any damn sense. The songs aren't even particularly well-chosen. Other than that, this is fantastic fare for those seeking what it offers. It will be frustrating for others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8.8 really ??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is OK, 6.5- 7 should have been OK but 8.8 rating is really to high. When I went to see the movie my expectation was too high because IMDb has given 8.8 rating but now I have lose faith on IMDb rating. First half was not that good but second half was better. It looks like the director was trying to pack everything under 2 hours, their were lots of character but not much time on screen for them. The comic scenes were good but it looks like some laughter scenes were forcefully put which anyone can observe. The character of Rocket was awesome as it was the only thing that was holding the movie together. And nowadays it is a trend in Hollywood to leave a option for a sequel. Overall the movie is a good one time watch but not a 8.8 !!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie made for the general public</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you consider your self a medium or hard core Sci-fi films enthusiast, this is not the movie for you, many reviewers praise the movie as a very exciting and interesting one, and that resulted in me having high expectations for the film, however after watching the film and reading many reviews I am on the side of the reviewers that criticize the movie for being so purely commercial with really low substance. The story and acting is flawed, that's more fundamental than having Vin Diesel's voice in a character, a better effort in these 2 departments would have made the movie more memorable but it's really a bit mediocre. I found it is a light flick with a couple enjoyable special effects and a story that mostly teens and kids will really enjoy, for sure it is not an 8 film, it is more a 7 or a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who says Superhero Movies Can't Be Fun?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the past few years, superhero movies have been dark. What with movies (mostly from DC) like the Dark Knight Trilogy, Watchmen, and Man of Steel. And while Marvels recent movies have been fun, and up-lifting, most people haven't seen a movie from them that hit the mark for them. (An exception for the Avengers.)This movie however, is not like other marvel movies. Okay scratch that, its not like any other superhero movie!This movie is the exact definition for what a blockbuster movie should be. Fun, inventive, hilarious, dumb, original, and have the feel of an exciting Roller Coaster! I've never been this excited to see a summer movie since The Avengers. So going to the theater, I had high hopes for this movie. So how did the film hold up? Well lets just say that it was EVEN better then I ever thought it would be.This is one of those movies that is perfect, beyond perfect! This may be Marvel's best films to date. And its officially been brought into my list of my favorite movies ever. The plot is pretty simple. A band of thugs/losers/misfits are forced to work together to stop an unstoppable evil, they do, and they all live happily ever after. So its a pretty easy to follow clichéd story. Well in this kind of movie, the plot isn't whats important. What makes this movie strong? Well, the humor, the relationship between the characters, the acting, and the visuals. Chris Pratt plays lead as the smug thief known as Star Lord. Who gives his best performance ever! He fits the role perfectly, and every line he says is always hilarious. Watching the film you'll notice that he'll usually make 70's and 80s pop culture references though. And then there's Rocket and Groot. Who are played by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. And I'm not joking when I say that these two steal the show! Every scene with them always seems to make me smile, or laugh my freaking brains out. You just can't leave these characters away from each other, they work so well together. And while this movie defenitley has a smorgasbord of humor, it also throws in some good drama in the mix too. But they only do it at the times when its needed. Yet they don't try and shove it down your throats.Many have already mentioned this, but this in my mind may also be considered Marvel's most beautiful movie ever. The cinematography is just incredible, and the designs for some of the planets are just breathtaking (especially the planet Nowhere). And the visual effects are like nothing you've ever seen before.Bottom line is, if you haven't seen this movie, do. You won't regret seeing this new sci-fi flick that will become timeless with this generation, and the next one to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>6 August 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Guardians of The Galaxy. Marvellous Marvel at their very best. This film brought together the biggest bunch of misfits you could possibly imagine and made them gel as a team. Against the backdrop of special effects amongst whole new worlds these characters, who didn't really fit in anywhere, were fighting to save the entire Galaxy, and a more mismatched group you could not imagine, but it worked right down to the Raccoon with attitude and the vocally challenged tree. Full of one liners and visual jokes, the audience were chuckling throughout and I came away from this film with a smile on my face. Absolutely awesome in 3D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly best movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many I was not very familiar with the character or the story line of guardians. However going into the movie I was very excited. From the opening scene until the end credits I could not take my eyes off the screen. Not only was the action terrific but the genius placement of comedy and drama throughout was absolutely outstanding. Chris Pratt delivers an amazing performance, Zoe Saldana is great as gamora, and Bradley cooper vin diesel and Dave Bautista did a marvelous job of creating chemistry between the characters and drawing the audience in. The only thing I was missing from this movie is the villain, in my opinion, was not very fleshed out. Although it was a great arc and the actor did a great job with what he was given I would have liked to see more from the villain. I knew this movie was great when my girlfriend (who is not a big comic person) said "that was a great friggin movie". If you haven't yet please check out Guardians Of The Galaxy, YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun in spite of itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen a summer popcorn flick in ages, let alone written a review of one in some time. However, if an excuse to see a gun totting raccoon with a rag tag bunch of misfits doesn't get me interested, then I'll consider this a lifetime opportunity missed.Guardians of the Galaxy at first seems to start off like any sci-fi block bluster but quickly separates itself from the rest of the pack upon first viewing. The hero (Peter Quill) is a goofy, smart ass, unintentionally funny character as he sets on collecting an artifact for ransom. In the end, his goods are stripped and a bizarre bunch of misfits just like him set to get it back. The artifact's "the orb" importance becomes more clear, as we learn if it falls into the wrong hands it can unleash unparalleled destruction on the planets and galaxies.Films like this suggest for you to suspend your disbelief, the bad guys never shoot straight, the heroes dodge all the bullets, the evil guys never time their powers right. We never take these things seriously, and more so the film takes these to more moronic highs. A walking plant and raccoon make an interesting pair, spitting off dialogue that isn't cliché. Quill has an affection for cheesy music, and it's discussion and genre in significant moments amongst other characters who just want to save the world, makes much for much moronic viewing. After all the aliens have no idea of this foreign concept that makes no sense to them. The female character is all green, giving a nod almost to Star Trek and an interest of Captain Kirk that Quill must conquest, but takes a much more realistic turn.Aside from the fact that a brute character doesn't understand the concept of metaphors, the filmmakers have also bathed this picture in a fascinating light. Giant reams of purple blue and green bathe the screen with interstellar light, creating a universe that doesn't look like anything we have seen before on screen. Even the characters and aliens look like... aliens, with the exception that some are still bi-pedal, many skin tones are represented, never mind a blue bounty hunter who kidnapped Quill as boy, seems to wield the most dangerous knitting needle known to man. His presence and somewhat Texas?Alabama accent (which adds to even bigger irony) seem just the perfect fit as the absurdity grows larger when Quill and him cross paths. Each opportunity is an excuse for him to remind Quill he's lucky he wasn't eaten alive by him and his henchmen when he was first captured.In reality the film mocks itself and its own ideas for telling us that this is all ridiculous and just dumb fun so come along for the ride. The whole thing knows it's absurd, and it's dialed up to 11 by the film-makers giving us a thrill that is the perfect escape for summer.It's not brilliant or amazing, it's quite stupid, but if it was perfect it would ironically be a heck of a lot less interesting and enjoyable. It's the self mockery and stupidity that makes the film work ingeniously. If anything it's the perfect movie to not take things seriously, and bathe yourself in the wild characters and colors on screen. In the end it's a great interstellar trip and escape unlike any you have been on before, and that's really all it needs to be.</fullReview>

All that being said, Rejoice young people of today. You have a chance to witness a Sci Fi work of Art. I recommend watching this masterpiece on IMAX 3D, you will not be disappointed.I am not Siskel and Ebert so I will not waste your time vomiting a bunch of bloated descriptions explaining as to why why I gave this flick 10 stars. This movie fully exceeded my expectations, and for an added bonus the sound track was amazing. I will finish by saying that this is the BEST Sci Fi movie I have ever seen!!!

		<shortDescription>Good Movie, but these 8.9 ratings are INSANE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look, this movie is a good movie, there is no doubt about it. But an 8.9? It's not close. I'm horribly confused at why this movie is getting an 8.9/10. It's a mix between action and comedy. The action is good but not amazing, the comedy is funny at times but isn't really great. The plot is about a bunch of guys trying to save a crystal ball (i.e. story is okay but nothing ground breaking). In sum= it's a kinda funny/kinda cool action movie with an average plot. That's it, this isn't an AMAZING movie, it just isn't. I'm kind of left scratching my head at the reviews on this one. If you want to go see a good movie that isn't great, go see it....but I really wouldn't be expecting near perfection like people on here seem to think it is. It's not, it's not perfect- not even close to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just the best movie of the summer, quite possibly the best movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first time I've written a review in my 15 years of being a member on here, but this is the movie that has inspired me to write my first user review.I will admit, I had little interest in seeing this movie when it was first announced. I thought that it would just be a B-level Marvel movie that Disney was making in order to milk the Marvel cash cow for all it was worth. Boy was I wrong. I tend to be very hard to please when it comes to movies but this one had me smiling the whole 2 hours and wanting more.James Gunn has accomplished with this film what many comic book movie directors and to a lesser extent all directors fail at---He made a fun and entertaining movie for everyone and isn't that what it's supposed to be about? No brooding superheroes and unnecessary melodrama here. He made a movie that is fun and entertaining all the way through. Zach Snyder take note.I've watched and read everyone talking about how the box office is down this summer, but let this movie be a lesson to all filmmakers. If you make a movie that is fun and entertaining for all, they will come, and come back again. This movie will easily make $450 million plus at the box office on the strength of word of mouth and repeat attendance.The casting is superb, and this is the film that has transformed Chris Pratt into an instant movie star. The rest of the cast have excellent chemistry and you get the impression that they must have had a blast making this film. Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel and even Dave Bautista are excellent in their respective parts. Michael Rooker and Benicio Del Toro are especially noteworthy in small supporting roles. The music also plays a major role in the film, the song choices and their placement in the film by James Gunn are perfect for the tone of this movie. The opening sequence showing Peter Quill as a child, that merges into Quill as an adult singing and dancing to "Come and Get Your Love" has you hooked and doesn't let go.This is quite possibly the best superhero movie ever made, and I can't wait to see what James Gunn has in store for the sequel in 2017.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a blast!It had everything I want from a Hollywood Blockbuster Movie. It follows a basic formula/recipe for a adventure movie, but it does it amazingly well. You can tell how things are going to pan out, but you're so in love with the characters, the interactions between them and the awesome special effects, so it's not a bad thing that the story is easy to follow, since the characters are so good!It had the humor, it nailed the emotional aspects and it never got slow or boring. The villain could be better, but I actually sort of liked him. He was a scary bad ass who wanted to end Xandar, and I would rather have great, funny and interesting heroes, than a great villain and a boring hero (I'm looking at you The Dark Knight!!).I give this movie 10/10.</fullReview>

It is joyful because it deserves to be part of the Marvel universe and it respect the Marvel universe and it's source material.Can people that are unfamiliar with the Marvel universe enjoy this film? I presume so, however the more important question is how can anyone not be familiar with the Marvel universe, give the parade of pure-awesome films that Marvel has created since Iron Man?If you want to see a film, go and watch this one.

		<shortDescription>Marvel Has Fun With/ For The Audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While you get more engaged with this film if you have read the comic books so you would know the characters more, this movie more than holds it's own with humor, and has some well done action and special effects too boot. It looks like this is the Marvel Hit for the Summer of 2014, and that's a good thing. There is some very nice tail telling here.The cast definitely helps as besides the special effects the cast brings off a good script. There is too much happening to describe here and that is because the movie is pretty long. It kind of has to be in order to get in everything. It's not boring by any means. Guardians is an exciting thrill ride without going to the amusement park. When he movie ends, make sure you stay through the credits as there is a funny bit after them that caps the good humor in the film with a wink of the eye. If you like Marvel Comics and read them a lot, your going to love this film.</fullReview>

In particular being around in the 70's and 80's and a lover of cinema, I loved all the music and little movie references.For the first time in a while I was lost in a movie, loosing sense of time, just enjoying it for what it was.Everything about it excellent, from the story to production, etc. Well done for all those that were involved with it's production!Go see it ASAP!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best entry in Marvel's Phase Two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel likes to take risks hiring fresh directors for its big projects. James Gunn, who has only directed two movies and written a few movies including Scooby-Doo, was tasked to bring bunch of misfits to life. The risks are James Gunn, who does not have a lot of credits, and the source material, which is not very well-known to general audience. Fortunately, James has proved people wrong, he could indeed direct a fast-paced entertaining and witty action thrill ride.The story: By now, general audience and fans should know the formula of every Marvel movie. Guardians of the Galaxy does not change much in that aspect. But what makes it stand out from the others is that these heroes are almost like anti-heroes. In the start, they are not heroic or morally right. They are sort of selfish and only think for their own good. However, further in the movie, they begin to help each other and form a team know as Guardians of the Galaxy. It could draw comparison with The Avengers. In The Avengers, the heroes have to learn how to work with each other. James Gunn does not bother to add long dramatic speeches or poetic dialogues to develop the characters. Instead, he blows things up to let the characters bond with each other. There are lots of action. In fact, it is one of Marvel's most action-packed movies. Right from the start, it is packed with fast-paced explosive action. The CGI works with the action scenes. Rocket and Groot are two neatly animated characters. The rest of the characters are just as entertaining. The villains may not have a lot of things to do except growling in their heavy make-ups and showing bits of their powers. Music by Tyler Bates is good especially in some tender moments.Overall: Guardians of the Galaxy may have a formulaic story but it has heart. Surprisingly it is touching at times. It has all what a blockbuster should have; thrilling action, great CGI, epic music. Marvel is confident that this will do well that it has announced a sequel. With this just as the first adventure, I would surely like to see more adventures as they face more challenges.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awesome songs from the 70s and 80s?Five losers who you quickly grow to love?A gun-toting raccoon and an inarticulate tree who grows on you in may ways?Join the ride, because with "Charm +42" beaming from all angles, Star Lord (or Peter Quill) is easily the most likable anti-hero since Han Solo, although the fashionable comparison is unfair as there is actually very little in common with that character. Rocket the Raccoon is the real Han Solo in this film and Groot the Tree is his Chewbacca: Rocket just hasn't met his Leia yet...I have no qualms putting this in the 10 category (the top 10% of movies I have ever seen). There is an emotional journey for all five characters that feels truly earned, and far surpasses any such attempt in previous Marvel films.It isn't perfect, the music score (beyond the picked songs) is tuneless and so-so (no John William's class here). The enemies are truly cardboard and dull (although there is an excellent pay-off for this). Karen Gillan is the most poorly short-changed by the family-movie rating as her psychopathic character isn't seen killing a single person removing all fear from her implied awesomeness. Glen Close's Nova Prime is flat and John C Reilly's cop's important character arc is seriously underdeveloped. The antagonists or the hero's don't even have the most awesome kill scene, you'll have to whistle for that!But don't let any of that put you off. The five protagonists are what this film is about, the plot is a distraction, you will just want to spend time with these people: again and again. I love it. I hope you do too.I want more, and more and more. I want Star Lord and team to meet Loki - there's an antagonist who just might dance back!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, someone who has never read a comic book may know who Captain America is and what Iron Man's real name happens to be but how many know who Peter Quill is or why there is a raccoon hanging out with something you are pretty sure was in The Lord of the Rings films? Guys like me do because we read "Guardians of the Galaxy" but what about those who think comic books are for kids? Marvel Studios took a huge risk adapting one of their more obscure titles and bringing the Marvel movieverse further into the cosmos with "Guardians of the Galaxy" but the gambit paid off and paid off extremely well! Since Marvel knows exactly how to find the right men for the job, they hit gold by having director James Gunn bring the pages to life and he made a film that had not only a great story but was action-packed and funny all at the same time.The cast is perfect and everyone?Chris Pratt as Star-Lord, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer and Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper doing the voices of Groot and Rocket?were the perfect choices. Even if their characters were altered slightly from comic book pages counterparts, they all nailed what was needed to make their character work. Whether it be Pratt channeling a little bit of Han Solo or Bautista capturing Drax's insanity, Zoe nailing the badass nature of Gamora or Bradley getting the essence of Rocket or Vin Diesel able to make Groot come to life (which is a challenge since all Groot says is "I am Groot"), they all made the Guardians great characters to watch and get invested in and have a blast with. But the cast didn't stop there, literally all players?Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Lee Pace, Benicio Del Toro, Djimon Hounsou?they were all captivating and all brought the rich cosmic world of the Guardians and made it something to really enjoy."The Avengers" is still my favorite Marvel Studios film but there is no doubt that "Guardians of the Galaxy" is a ridiculously close second. With all its Easter Eggs to try and find, it's outrageous and never-ending humor, the fantastic cast, the great characters brought to life from the pages, and some very exciting action, this film will definitely have a permanent rotation in my favorite movie list and I will be watching it repeatedly for a long time!</fullReview>

I even think that the effects surpass Dawn of the Apes...I mean, I now love that Raccoon more than Batman!!!CONS: I think that the action - close combat scenes could have been better, they weren't bad, but I didn't see Gamora as "deadly" as she should have been. Besides this, its a flawless movie, thats the reason for the 10, its difficult to do something just this perfect!To close it up, THANKS to everyone involved in doing this masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the new benchmark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is the point of continuing to make films when you have made an action packed extravaganza like the Avengers already? The answer is so that you can produce a film like Guardians of the galaxy! Essentially, Guardians is everything that was right about the Avengers, minus what was wrong with it (not that there was much wrong with it).The story is extremely well paced, with no time to get bored between the action scenes as these are separated with essential plot details and very amusing comedy lines. The villain does not get to do much, but this film has to introduce so very many characters, locales, items and ideas that the lack of development for the bad guy can be expected and not judged to badly.Rocket and Groot steal so many of the scenes that it automatically makes them the easiest characters to love, but Pratt's Star Lord is still a great character perfectly cast. Gamora was not as lethal as I would have liked, but was still well played and Dave Bautista As Drax is the best performance i have seen from a wrestler, being better than even Dwane Johnson.The special effects are visually stunning, with lots of colour and detail in the environments. Rocket and Groot look amazing and the first proper look at Thanos was also pleasing. Even the make-up effects look good, when added to the performance of Micheal Rooker, you get even better supporting characters to compliment the main cast.If the success of Avengers gave Marvel the confidence to make this relatively obscure comic into a film, then i hope that this film brings in the kind of money that proves it was the right choice so that more brilliant characters can be shown to the general public. Marvel, Please keep making films of this quality!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Guardians of the Galaxy" is easily the most exciting and pleasant surprise of the year. Personally, I was hooked the minute I saw the preview which gave us hints of the fun coming our way. Fighting over a walkman, mocking the superhero's name, and that irreverent raccoon. Of course, there's no way to dislike anything Zoe Saldana does, and there is much, much more to love here.This movie appears to be paying homage to a few science fiction classics, particularly the original freshness and humor that made "Star Wars" such a legendary title. Star Lord joins forces with some impulsive characters and try to stop the evil forces from grabbing this magical and powerful sphere that can alter the universe.It's hard to describe the film. It suffices to say that it's an exciting ride from beginning to end because it has action, some sensational special effects, killer funny lines, introduces terrific characters that come across as sensitive, human, and heroic. There are beautiful spaceships, and everyone is literally and figuratively having a blast.You will laugh, be moved, root for the various heroes, never get tired of the "one-line" tree man. The voice work by Bradley Cooper is as good as Robin Williams' deranged Genie in "Aladdin", and can anyone complain about having Glenn Close and John C. Reiley in the same movie? And to be top everything there is the terrific scene at the end of the credits.</fullReview>

Every joke by him was always on point and very funny.Another plus was the soundtrack.Every song was just so good.It fit the story. I think everyone can enjoy this movie.it says it's pg-13 but do be careful if you bring your children because there is a lot of bad language.There is a post-credit scence so stay for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brief overview of Guardian of the Galaxies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the summer I had seen the advertisements and commercials for the movie, Guardians of the Galaxy. When I first saw the commercial, all I could think was this looks silly and then I saw the fact it was part of the Marvel series and I was torn whether or not to go watch it while it was still in theaters. It did not look good but maybe it would play a big role in the Marvel movie series but I did end of going to see it for the heck of it and absolutely loved it. Overall, the movie was humorous, very entertaining, and in my opinion, a great addition to the Marvel series and even gained a rating of 92% on the movie critic website rotten tomatoes. Throughout the movie, the thing that stood out the most was the humor part of the movie. There were parts of the movie I just could not stop laughing because it was so silly and just so amusing to watch and enjoyable. I mean, the way you know it is a humorous movie is when you come out of the theater repeating lines and talking about parts of the movie and still just laughing as much as you did when you saw the movie and this is a movie that passes that test. Another killer part of the movie that made it so good was the soundtrack that went through the movie. The biggest role the soundtrack has to a movie is to provide the noise for times where there is not dialog and just brings a smile to your face. In the movie, the main leader of the Guardian of the Galaxies, Star-Lord, he plays a tape his mother gave him that brings back the classic musical hits that you just cannot help but sing along to and just smile while remembering the good old days. Overall the acting was pretty superb and each actor brought their own flare and became the character very well even just in the voice overs for characters such as Rocket and Groot. Apart of the movie that I really enjoyed was the way each actor had their chance to make their character shine and make them seem important and walking away you realize that each character had importance to the group and the actors all came together to form a pretty solid team called the Guardians of the Galaxies. Probably the most controversial aspect of the movie is the whole Marvel aspect. Marvel over the years has made a killing in suckering viewers to come see their latest hits and leave us at the end wanting another Marvel movie to come to theaters to continue the story. I know many people saw the commercials thought the same thing I did, "Who on earth are the Guardians of the Galaxies?" Most people know who Spiderman, Ironman, or even the incredible hulk are but unless you read the comic books, you would most likely have no clue who the Guardians of the Galaxies are. Throughout the movie though, I believe the writer did a good job in tying in the Marvel universe and made a point by using characters most people would have no idea how they were connected to the story line that viewers have come to know through all other Marvel movies and the big hitter that brings them all together, The Avengers. Going off the MPAA rating of the movie, PG-13, seems somewhat appropriate due to little bit of foul language and a couple of references to alcohol and gambling. However, I do think the movie can still be considered a family because it does bring a humorous aspect and nothing to raunchy is presented and besides, what kid does not love a talking raccoon or even a tree that can only say, "I am Groot". Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and would definitely watch it over again. Marvel has done a very good job in adding a new addition to the movie series through the all the humor, the acting, the action, the soundtrack and in the end, I walked away from the movie hoping to see more of the Guardians of the Galaxies in future Marvel movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy-A Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is a well-written cinematic, futuristic ride! The plot of the movie held me captive, including the movement of the script. The costumes and expressions of the actors were well received by the audience. I also enjoyed the incorporation of songs of the seventies and eighties as theme songs for this movie. The battle between the protagonist and antagonist was well received. I also enjoyed the sense of multiculturalism incorporated in the film. There is a need for the use of ALL races and nationalities in film today, and it looks like Hollywood is moving in this 'positive' direction, sharing the wealth. With this movie, there was never a dull moment from start to finish. Background imagery was superb, placing the viewer directly in each scene. All of it was believable. Guardians of the Galaxy was worth every dime that I paid to see it. A thumbs up to the producers and actors! Ethridge</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you love Avengers, you will, at least, love this one too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thing about Guardians of the Galaxy is that it is played in a universe that is the same as the one that the recent Thor, Iron man, Avengers etc movies and I think they will connect all the characters somehow.The thing is, I have no fricking idea how. I mean, it seems like Thanos will be the bad guy as he was also spotted in the earlier movies from Marvel and he has a major role in this too.But I don't know for the life of me how they will connect this movies with the Avengers. They are so different from each other.At the least, the movie was really entertaining, there was good character development (could be more).The only thing that irritated me was that Marvels ad campaign for this movie revealed that Groot will survive after sacrificing himself, so i Never actually got emotionally affected by that part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can anyone please pull the plug on this one? The constant high ratings of Guardian of the Galaxy is such a hoax.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although, seeing the trailer and from overall idea about comic series about Guardians of the Galaxy, I realised the film will not be worth watching. But the clowns here in the form of critics giving raving ratings to this franchise is just grossly misleading. I am from India and our film industry is undergoing serious "Rot" with mind numbingly moronic movies raking moolah on the box office motivating hack of the directors to continue their charades. Same pattern seem to be applying now to Hollywood as well.Last over-hyped movie which almost dragged me to theater was latest CGI megamovie and before that, Godzilla redefined which got good ratings despite being a complete lowdown which I had to walk out post interval.I went inside theater with heavy expectations on my head to watch Guardians of the Galaxy deemed by reviewers here as "One of the greatest superheroes movies of all time". Some of the reviewers went ahead and even compared it with Avengers and Dark Knight franchise. For those people, I must comment their shallow wisdom in movie nuances if they compare this franchise with the TDK trilogy. This film turned out to be a torrid dampener from 20 mins into the movie. Too much Sci-Fi, comedic scenes peppered in regular intervals, racoon turning out to be saving grace finally became the most stupid of the characters with Emotional Overdose about a tasteless tree character and a host of other flaws movie had.One glimmer of light came in the film with cinematography when Quills saves Saldana in the space. Apart from that moment, rest was pretty predictable, clichéd, covered mostly in trailers so nothing surprising and overall a highly childish drama on the lines of Frozen which it seems has been rated on IMDb mostly by toddlers. An 8.5+ ranking for such films is ridiculously hilarious and a trap zone for wasting time on riding high expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Objectively a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all. All the love this movie is getting is ridiculous. You should think that it was as groundbreaking as the Star Wars movies when they first came out. Star Wars, Serenity and GOTG have the same anti hero flying a spaceship saving the planet one good deed at a time evolving from a player to a monogamous man. A man transforming from an egoistical womanizer into a regular good and nice guy. Star Wars and Serenity has some similar plot lines but are better movies. Not since Titanic and Avatar have I seen so much hype over a movie. The newest Batman movies come close. And what all these movies have in common is that they are okay or fine movies but nothing spectacular. They don't deserve the fame they have received. They are not catering so much to the audience as the blockbusters Transformers but they are not masterpieces either. Twilight would not even have the worst storyline among all these movies. I am not saying that GOTG is an awful movie. I gave it 5/10. But I still feel like it was a waste of money and here is why: The acting was great. The story was a good comic book story. This is how they are supposed to be - nothing overly fancy. Just as Avengers had a perfect comic book story and was a perfect superhero movie. Avengers is not Godfather but for its genre it is perfect just like Die Hard is perfect for its genre. The special effects were amazing. All actors were great the acting was great. It was one of the best things in this movie if not the best thing. But, you ask, what did the movie do wrong if the acting, special effects, story and etc. were good or great? The problem is huge. The problem is the production. The cutting of the movie. How they put it together on the computers after the filming was done. Remember how bad Elysium was? You could not follow the fight scenes as the shaky-cam was overused. And the scenes changed so fast that you never felt comfortable watching the movie. Elysium could have been a good "guilty pleasure" movie with a weak plot but entertaining structure. Instead we got a weak plot and some awful production and camera work. Search for the fight scenes from the movie. People who liked the movie refuse to believe that the fighting scenes are not manipulated by the youtubers. They see the faults in them when they only watch the fighting scenes. And they refuse to believe that they actually would like something like that in a movie. Does something seem wrong with Elysium? Did the shaky-cam ruin it? Shaky-cam is a great way to save money by filming action scenes without "wasting" time on Matrix like choreography and perfect camera work. It's the telling of an action scene without showing it. GOTG did not have this problem. It did have shaky-cam but it was not unwatchable bad as in Elysium. Now, what did GOTG do wrong? Go search for a MTV music video of a random pop song without any meaning in it. You know, one of these flashy lights, getting drunk, party, dancing and short scenes of hot girls music video. Do you observe the effects they use to make the video? Can you spot how the structure is made in post production? It has more in common with a slideshow than a movie. The scene shift is so fast that that the story seems unstructured. The effect is that you get a certain feeling but don't get a certain storyline conveyed. A storyline needs you to feel the people on the screen. A MTV music video only conveys = party, dance and get wild. This is fine for teenagers watching the screen with one eye while sitting at the computer. But it is awful for focused adults in search of a structured, well focused video that conveys a story and has a structured storyline too. GOTG had exactly the same fast changing scenes but with a well structured storyline. Frozen had a similar problem but in a smaller degree. Frozen was also a bad movie. Let's count the different clips an average movie has for 1 minute of screen time. Now compare it to GOTG. I am sure that the number for GOTG would be incredible high - reaching the max for human perception. The regular human brain can only perceive a concrete number of different scenes per minute before it gets confused - GOTG took it to an extreme. The Postman had the worst post production I have ever seen. It could have been an okay movie if it had even an okay post production. And GOTG is a would be fantastic movie with a similar terrible post production. Watch Avengers instead it is everything GOTG wishes it was.It is objectively a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We are Groot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Quill, less commonly known as Star-Lord, finds himself in the middle of a Universe-wide conflict trying to gain control of a sacred orb that has the power to obliterate organic life and planets. Quill, almost a Han Solo style pilot, must team with a group of remarkably different outlaws in a bid to stop it from falling into the wrong hands.Clocking in at a refreshing two hours, Guardians' is heart-warming, fun and probably Marvel's best film to date. Starring; Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, Bradley Cooper as Rocket Racoon, Zoe Salanda as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax and Vin Diesel as Groot (his easiest role yet, probably).Pulling on emotions followed shortly by laughter, Guardians' has enough to keep you engaged and wanting more. Reeling in the references to other Marvel features (Thor 2 and The Avengers), Guardians' manages to put into perspective the scale of the Marvel Universe and how they all link. Containing one of the greatest 80's soundtracks of all time, the film is a massive outer space adventure? dare we say it in the realms of Star Wars/Trek combined with superheroes - needless to say we were impressed.Finally introducing us the Thanos (voiced by Josh Brolin ? likely to voice in the upcoming Avengers: Age of Ultron also), Co-starring the all-star ensemble of Lee Pace, Michael Rooker; Karen Gillan, Djimon Hounsou, Glenn Close, John C. Reilly and Benicio Del Toro. Guardians of the Galaxy arrives in UK cinemas 31st July, and world-wide 1st August.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DC Should Just Give Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the GalaxyWhen it comes to comics and superheroes, DC comics and Marvel comics are the biggest contenders. Lately, however, Marvel has been dominating the industry, especially in the film department. I'm pretty sure DC comics wet themselves after the release of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. After this movie, and with the Avengers 2: Age of Ultron coming out next summer, DC should just give up now.StoryThis movie doesn't feel like a Marvel movie. It does feel like an epic sci-fi adventure that holds the promise of sequels to follow. In case you don't already know, Guardians of the Galaxy is about a group of outlaws who unite during a prison escape and continue on to, well, guard the galaxy of course! The average movie goer will probably not recognize most of the characters from the film, but this doesn't make the story any less engaging. However, if you are a die-hard Marvel fan like me, you will also find joy in references to your favorite Marvel franchises. Each character is really unique and charming in their own way. Star-Lord/Peter Quill is played by Chris Patt and is what you could consider the "main" character and the leader of the group. Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), the giant human-tree is surprisingly funny and cute throughout the film. Gamora is a green, alien, warrior, assassin and also the adopted daughter of Thanos. Drax the Destroyer (played by Dave Bautista) is an angry and oddly eloquent alien who does not understand sarcasm or metaphors. Finally, there is Rocket the Raccoon. Voiced by Bradley Cooper, this spunky and furry mutant with a love of big guns is my personal favorite character. All together, the team has great chemistry and is a joy to watch. The story (which I won't spoil anymore than I have) is interesting and serves as a brilliant way to expand the Marvel cinematic universe. It's fantastic.Acting/DialogueAll the actors fill their shoes well but a select few performances stand out more than the rest. The Best Actor award goes to Star-Lord himself, Chris Patt. Second place, however, goes to Dave Battista (Drax). Battista exceeded all of my expectations and delivered some of the best lines in the movie.With the movie containing two voice acted characters, the award for Best Voice Actor goes to Bradley Cooper who did a great job of bringing Rocket to life and made me really car about the fuzzy fella.The dialogue is spot-on. It's funny, witty, and appealing to all ages. Seriously, the movie will have you roaring with laughter and grab the attention of every viewer.SFX/ActionWhile a lot of this movie is CG, it all looks incredibly realistic. Especially impressive are the spaceships and flying vehicles. You can see reflections in all the windshields, and every spacecraft moves/animates fluidly. The final fight has a ridiculous number of enemy ships flying around and exploding everywhere, yet you can see every single one in detail.Guardians of the Galaxy has the perfect number of fight scenes. I never once felt as if the action overpowered the story or vice-versa. I really like how every character has a different fighting style, which makes for some interesting combinations.ConclusionI think Guardians of the Galaxy is the best Marvel movie to date. Oh, and did I mention that its a perfect movie? That's right, I give Guardians of the Galaxy a 10/10. The string that DC comics has been clinging onto for the past few years just got thinner. Go see this movie now. It's bound to be the best flick of the summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Marvel Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best marvel movies to date. On the same level with captain American: The winter solider and the first Iron Man. if you watch this, WATCH IT IN 3D! you will not regret it. The story is unique and original, It gives a nice refresher from the avengers characters. The direction from James Gunn is flawless, It has a perfect balance of comedy and action. James Gunn balances out each character on the same level Joss Whedon Balanced out the characters in The Avengers. Chris Pratt also surprises with brilliant acting. The cast was perfect. But Groot stole the show with his cuteness and the fact that he has so much character, but can only say 3 English words. Also, stay for the middle and end credit scenes like all Marvel films</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is hands down Marvel's early surprise Christmas gift. This movie had a spark and potential to be a one of a kind, yet once again Marvel handled it wonderfully.It starts off with Peter Quill as his journey to steal a certain orb for the bounty, this leads to him meeting a ragtag of misfits, they team up to prevent the orb getting in to the wrong hands.It seemed like a very ordinary story and I felt divided about this movie at first. I tried reading a couple Guardians comics and they had wonderful story lines, although these did not stop me from worrying about what the movie may turn out to. It turns out I was very, very wrong.Guardians of the Galaxy is special, it's one of a kind and a very fun movie. Just like the previous Marvel movie (Captain America 2). This one had a simple plot, but a great execution. The specialness of this movie starts with the heroes. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel and even Batista!! Were perfectly cast for their roles. They were very enjoyable to see on screen even when some of them are all CGI. For me Christ Pratt and Bradley Cooper and even Vin Diesel as a talking tree all stole the show! And since this is a Marvel movie, I have to mention how the action was very very excellent. The action scenes reminded me a lot about Star Wars and Star Trek. The action was very exciting and thrilling as well, it will be sure to bring the inner childishness of anyone who'll watch it. Another great thing about this movie is that it is NOT SERIOUS in a very good way. A technique Marvel has been using through out the years and proved to be successful. Although, other people have been saying that the villains are the low parts of this movie. However, this I do not all agree with. Ronan was a good villain. He was menacing, formidable and frightening. As for Nebula, she was only quite good. The main focus of this movie was the heroes, so the villains were put secondary and for that I did not mind. If I were asked where I would place this in the ranking of all the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, I would put this on #2. Following the Avengers at #3 and Captian America 2 at #1.With a special and one of a kind team, extremely funny humor and great emotional moments, great visuals filled with thrilling and exciting action, a fun and enjoyable 2 hours. And did I mention the awesome 70s - 80s soundtrack?Guardians of the Galaxy is Marvel's huge and hilarious big middle finger to DC's "serious" tone and proves that superhero movies do not need to be "serious" to be good.So, your move DC.Verdict: 8.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved every second of this movie. Basically: ? It was so well-directed. Everything seemed to fit in place. ? The amount of action and comedy was equal. Like, when you were watching the movie, you could tell that an action scene was serious, but at the same time (usually because of Rocket or "Star-Lord") it was also funny. ? All the people who voiced or played the characters were just PERFECT and spot on. Especially Chris Pratt, that guy is just so friggin' adorable and endearing. And Rocket? Don't even get me started on him; he is just downright AWESOME. His sarcasm and bluntness literally made my day!!! ? My most favorite thing about this movie: it didn't relate to superheroes. I mean, maybe it did a bit, but it's not about the superheroes, ya know what I mean? If I'd known how awesome GotG was gonna be, I probably wouldn't have watched all those other Marvel movies that were released this year in theaters. I would have just rented them, but hey, because I watched them in theaters, I know which movie is the best (hint: I AM GROOT). The post-credits scene though? lemme just say, What the duck?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came in to watch this movie and had some expectations. But this movie is just a below average.I was so much bored in between that eyes were closing. Special effects were looking all fake. Characters jumping, you could make out the ropes tied. The background was all bright colourful giving a fake effect nothing looks like feel of original. I don't know what special effects they have used.Many times it looked like shooting has been done at home with normal camera. just could find 3-4 good scenes and nothing else. Same old boring romance, emotion which didn't add up. Acting wise i found the Tree and the animal only good. I really don't understand the high ratings of people. This is not even a time pass movie.Lots of dragging story. One scene where space carft bursts in air but people will be safe and no scratches lol, lame. Would say watch and see yourself, not a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel finally made a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel has a reputation for being the best of the best at summer blockbusters. This film is no exception. It's going to make A LOT of money. And for the first time in quite a few years, a Marvel film actually deserves it. Following Peter Quill or Star Lord played by Chris Pratt. The not so notorious outlaw. As he is sent to retrieve a odd orb from a desolate planet. Turns out quite a few others are also after the orb. This leads to the meeting of the other guardians of the galaxy. Rocket played by Bradly cooper a genetically modified raccoon meant to be comedy relief , Gamora Zoe Saldana a vicious warrior, Drax Dave Bautista a deranged killer, and Groot Vin Diesel a practically invisible tree. The visuals are unmatched just like any marvel movie. As they should be since 2 of the leads are completely CGI. Besides the jaw dropping visuals the characters here are equally well done. We learn deep and engaging things about each one which will make you fall in love with them. Usually a film with this many main characters some are forgotten or the bonds between them and the others are thin. But Gaurdians does a brilliant job of developing strong bonds between each character individually. While the leads are extremely well done the villain is once again forgotten. Marvel has a tough time making a villain that is unforgettable. While Locke is the closest they've gotten its just not enough. Ronan played by Lee pace was under done. Although he had more motive then most of marvels villains he is still quite forgettable. Another forgettable aspect is the story. All though intriguing and mysterious. It is quite predictable right from the start. The orb that everyone is after seems stupid and useless. But you cant help but think of why everyone wants it. Once you figure out what is and does THEN the story falls prey to Marvels usual ridiculousness and predictability. Even tho the over the top ending feels more coherent then any other Marvel flick. All in all Guardians of the Galaxy is a well crafted summer blockbuster filled with heart, great characters, amazing VFX, and an ending that wraps things up nicely. Even tho it has a predictable story the only real weak link is the under done villain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disclaimer: I am a HUGE Marvel fan! Guardians of the Galaxy straight up delivers in more categories than any Marvel movie yet. Not only does it hit deliver great CGI, story, and comedy, but it provides more CGI, story and comedy than any Marvel Studios movie yet. While many can claim that the movie had "childish" jokes or terrible villains. I will just say that consider the risk that Marvel Studios took by putting out this movie that really is unlike any superhero movie yet, and look how they have made household names out of a practically unknown comic book. Guardians of the Galaxy appeals to a diverse set of interest, and that is why I say it is a must see for anyone and I mean anyone.</fullReview>

Although I am not a fan of movies based on comics, but we have seen some great super heroes and comics movies that were really entertaining and had great visual effects . but from what I saw, this movie did not reach a level to give it this much rating. Story it self was really predictable and boring, effects were OK but not amazing, it didn't reach other comics movie level, nor was it interesting or funny.

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Guardians of the Galaxy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my forty years of existence, I've seen plenty of films based on Marvel Comics. I've seen the good (Spider-Man 2, Blade, Iron Man), the bad (Hulk, Ghost Rider), and the flat-out ugly (Howard the Duck). Guardians of the Galaxy (the flick I'm now reviewing) falls somewhere in between. And at just over two hours, it plays like this: bang, bang, punch, kick, punch, tell a joke, blurt out a zinger, shoot, shoot, kill, knife, throw up against a wall, strangle, tell more jokes, etc..etc. It's safe to say that this thing never lets up. It's dark and dangerous with nasty characters and even nastier creatures. And there's an opening scene (which involves the quietness of death and dying) that might make you forget that "Guardians" even has plenty of tongue-in- cheek overtones to boot.With non-stop action, plenty of sturdy violence (think lots of martial arts and assaults with space age stun guns), and writing that permeates at times to be lazy, Guardians of the Galaxy takes place in present day 2014 (just in a completely different realm or you know, terrestrial realm as Charlie Sheen would say). Four space criminals consisting of a thief (Star-lord), a trained killer (Gamora), a warrior (Drax), a humanoid (Groot), and a genetic animal (Rocket), join forces to save the universe from an evil ruler named Ronan the accuser. They steal a sphere-like artifact from this blue, pigmented maniac that if activated, can kill millions of people.Now from what I observed, the look of "Guardians" feels like Star Trek meets Stargate. It has characters that reminded me of the ones from Star Wars and even The Wizard of Oz (Chris Pratt as "Star-lord" is a modern day Han Solo while Groot somehow gives off the whole Chewbacca vibe). They are differing personalities and they come together as journeymen looking for one common purpose."Guardians" also has a top notch cast bringing these characters to life. They are comprised of actors/actresses that are known and not so known. The best performance, well it belongs to Bradley Cooper. He doesn't appear on screen but he's perfect as the voice of the talking raccoon named Rocket. Vin Diesel does voice work as well and he plays the branchlike Groot. I've heard how much money Vin demands per movie. If he got paid handsomely for uttering just one line (all he says is, "I'm Grrroooott!"), I'm insanely jealous.What drove me nuts however, was how military peacekeepers played by Glen Close and John C. Reilly only appear in maybe two scenes total. Was their material left on the cutting room floor? Who knows. But here's the thing: solid and well established movie moguls like Close and Reilly deserve a more respectable level of screen time. Then we have Zoe Saldana channeling her earlier stint in 2011's Columbiana. She handles as usual, a lot of the butt kicking here playing hungry assassin Gamora. That leaves quirky lead Chris Pratt as Peter Quill (aka Star-lord). Based on "Guardians" ginormous box office take, it seems like he might emerge as a huge star one day. He's not bad but despite getting physically fit for this role, he still sort of goes through the motions. If you wanna see his true comedic gifts, check him out in 2013's Delivery Man. He's the best thing in it (and the only good thing in it).Finally, there's the clunky, musical soundtrack which seems like the film's main selling point. As a young boy, Chris Pratt's character (spoiler alert) gets abducted by aliens and has his walkman with him during said abduction. The songs in the background are heard through his obsolete relic and are fully comprised of ditties from the 1970's (even though they are recorded on a tape labeled "awesome mix volume 1"). Hey, I like bell bottom induced music just as much as anybody else. But with the exception of the song "Cherry Bomb" by The Runaways, most of the playlist featured, is comprised of material that has been sledgehammered (or overplayed) on radio stations everywhere. Personally, I'd rather hear a hidden gem like Jethro Tull's "Look Into the Sun" as opposed to "Hooked On a Feeling" for the umpteenth time.In conclusion, I tried hard to embrace a film that critics and audience members (all over the world) have been salivating over with glee. Sadly, I consider this to be familiar stuff. I couldn't help but be reminded of the space operas of George Lucas and many of the other imitations that took place previously in a galaxy far far away. Guardians of the Galaxy left me feeling empty while yearning for a sense of mystery and aura that I didn't receive. Its one hook, is that it provided humor (very mild humor consisting of a few chuckles) in places where so many other Marvel Comic movies tended to pile on the seriousness. Here though, it's uneven and the obviousness by director James Gunn in terms of distributing a certain brand of funny, is purely noted (the villains are hideous and caddy while the heroes are the class clowns). To the chagrin of most moviegoers, I'll probably avoid a second or (gulp) third viewing of Guardians of the Galaxy. It may be hailed as an entertaining, exhausting sci-fier with status as a critical darling. But in my humbled opinion, it's just another excuse for me to pop in my DVD of Episode IV one last time.Of note: I had a feeling that during the film's ending, I'd see some kind of closing credit titles stating that all the characters in "Guardians" would be back for more giddy fun in the franchise's next installment. I was right and the effect which seemed completely lifted from the Star Wars movies, didn't feel as earned as it first did back in 77'. Nice try guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, and a letdown, and i'll explain why:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was okay. It wasn't terrible, but neither was it great. It felt more like a letdown than anything else, not being angry or joyful about it, just disappointed, because I really wanted to like it and tried hard to like it. I'll explain why it was disappointing:The movie tried very hard to be funny, and at times it was. But me and most of the audience laughed at only 50% of it, the rest felt forced and unnatural. With the funny moments, they were forgettable. I mean with Transformers 4, there was one moment that will always be remembered. The moment when they are in the hall with the old Chinese ladies and Stanly Tucci says "How do you say get the *beep* out of the way in Chinese?" that was worth remembering, the middle finger thing and the blacklight joke was like, meh.This movie was forgettable, unlike Captain America: The Winter Soldier and The Dark Knight. There was nothing that stood out like those two. With CA:TWS, it had my heart racing with emotion about whether Cap was going to succeed in getting the third Carrier locked, or he would fall and HYDRA would succeed. And the Carrier's being destroyed had been so powerful. The final action scene was very predictable, and you knew Ronan would lose in the end. And the other predictable part was the switching with the Blue guy in the end.The characters also gave me no reason to cheer for them either. What makes Cap 2 so great was that I was rooting for him to take down HYDRA, but this was difficult to like them.Peter was interesting and funny at times, but wasn't really likable. Gamora was just there and don't ask questions. Drax was okay, Groot I liked a bit but just felt weird with only "I am Groot." Coming out of his mouth. Raccoon was okay, but not great or impressive. The action was also not impressive because I have been there and done that many times earlier in the year (Edge of Tomorrow and Captain America: The Winter Soldier.) Vin Diesel was a complete waste. I'm actually starting to think they just used him as a marketing tool (Slick Disney.), I mean come on he only said like 5 words the entire movie. I wished his voice was used more other than "I am Groot." Lajohn was right about this probably having no legs in the long run, because when we left, no one really cared about it in the end. I could hear people around us and there mood was just, meh. There was not any clapping at the end either unlike some places.I wish and I was hoping that it would be groundbreaking like Critics and everybody here on the forums said. But once again, I have been duped by Disney.This was most definitely overrated by critics and audiences alike, the same way MOS, TDKR, T:TDW, IM3, IM2, were overrated.And it's not like I'm trying to hate on this movie. I don't hate it, but neither do I love it. When I left, I was just sad. I didn't hate the movie, but neither did I love it. it just felt like a letdown from Marvel, and a disappointment.The final rating I would give it is about: 5, maybe 6/10.This movie though does make me appreciate the fact that Avengers: Age of Ultron is coming very soon! Which I can't wait for! And its ties to MCU weren't spectacular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The good:1) Amazing visual effects. 2) Brilliant use of color/world building. 3) Interesting characters, nice balance of screen time 4) Enjoyable action, not too long. 5) Generally good acting from main cast, although Zoe sleepwalks through.The frustrating (AKA What Hollywood will never stop doing)1) Painting humans various colors does not make a believable space alien, especially when put next to visual marvels (pun not intended) like Groot and the amazing technology. This is not the 60's &amp; I don't care if this is based on a comic book, please stop painting people and adding metal mohawks, expecting us to take it any more serious than Swamp Thing. 2) English is still the preferred language in the universe? Really? Nearly a 200 million dollar budget and you can't make up some different languages? Oh but they are using British accents so it's believable. 3) Cliché alley. How many times are we going to see the bad guy literally explode into a bunch of pieces at the end? How many times will we be served a macguffin that destroys planets? Did we not already do this with all the previous Avenger films? 4) Over stuffed. We did not need all the characters besides the main cast and villains, and the sidekick bad girl is terrible. 5) The villains. Seriously? These races of evil villains (mostly comprised of males apparently) all happen to look evil, have little to no color, and spend their times waltzing around primitive looking spaceship decks, being evil just...because they are evil? Do these people have any dimensions? They speak of being angry but have no wives, no interests, no motives. It is getting old. 6) Stuffing nostalgic music and movie references does not make your film classic or original, it is quite the opposite. Tarantino is good and forcing his taste of music on you...gradually and indeed charmingly, but in this film it is just contrived..just there to say "hey this stuff was cool" ...so what? Seriously...I love Pac Man...so can you throw some pac man stickers on Star Lord and get an extra million in box office? I guess so.In Summary:A Fun Ride But Still Just More of the Same. Not original, but definitely an interesting watch. I accept now that what passes as a masterpiece is what copies from the past few decades of great cinema....so I will have to get used to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is 'Guardians of the Galaxy' as amazing as the IMDb rating (which this reviewer learned long ago is not something that should be taken to heart) and ecstatic reviews suggest? To me, not quite. Is 'Guardians of the Galaxy' well made and entertaining? Absolutely.'Guardians of the Galaxy' boasts spectacular special effects, gorgeously psychedelic colours, slick-yet-with-enough-visual-depth cinematography (nothing cartoonish or plastic here) and very colourful and atmospheric sets that more than effectively makes one think they are immersed in this galaxy. Costumes and make-up are also of very good quality. The 70s soundtrack and score is rousing and touchingly nostalgic. The action is beautifully edited, choreographed with lots of entertainment value and thrills and is at best exhilarating, there's plenty of it without feeling too much.James Gunn directs with style and a sure hand, always seeming as if he knew what tone he was going for and who he was aiming at ('Guardians of the Galaxy' is far and above anything else he's done and his best overall direction is here as well. Personally really enjoyed the way that 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was written too, the jokes are enormously entertaining and the film also has heart with a genuinely emotional opening. The story is non-stop energy and compelling, with a nice balance of comedy, drama and section. It is not perfect, and is one of the film's weaker points, with a been-there-done-that feel, a couple of overly-sentimental moments and a couple of randomly placed moments that were not needed at all and just took away from the flow and tone of the scene (Chris Pratt's dance).The characters are on the most part incredibly colourful and engaging, with a great chemistry throughout. Peter is a likable lead character and Groot is quite adorable and amusing, but Rocket the Racoon doesn't just threaten to steal the show, to me Rocket actually does steal the show. The one exception really is the very bland and barely developed villain Ronan. Chris Pratt is highly charismatic, Zoe Saldana is suitably fiery, Karen Gillan is imposingly formidable, Dave Bautista induces lots of laughs and charm while showing a very intensely played vengeful side (though that was a little too hastily introduced) and a surprisingly well-cast Vin Diesel does a great job as Groot. Bradley Cooper stands out, being a sheer delight as Rocky. Lee Pace tries but struggles to bring any menace or dimension to Ronan, can't say I blame him as anybody given the role if written in the way it was here would have struggled to bring believability to it.All in all, not perfect and not quite as great as all that but exciting, well-made and lots of fun, really enjoyed it. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is an amazing movie with great humor and incredible action. Guardians of the Galaxy has fantastic features that many people will love and includes popular soundtracks that is enjoyable to listen. I loved Guardians of the Galaxy because it expands the Marvel Cinematic Universe and focuses on a new group of superheroes that will set new adventures for the the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie is fantastic and never gets boring to watch over and over. Guardians of the Galaxy is as good as The Avengers, featuring both humor, a good plot, awesome action scenes, and getting superheroes to join together to stop a powerful villain from causing mass destruction. Guardians of the Galxy is and should be considered one of the best action movies in the world. I loved Gaudians of the Galaxy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy met my expectations in the respect of being a good movie. What the movie did do is exceed my expectations in aspects I didn't think they would. Like most people seeing this movie, I went in not really knowing anything except that it looked interesting and had potential. After just a few minutes it had me laughing and kept me smiling for the next twoish hours. Let's discuss the elements that made me love this movie so much...Story- The plot is pretty solid for this movie. The story centers around Peter Quill after he steals an orb that holds a powerful stone. he than gets caught up with four other misfits who work together, after figuring out the orb true power, to save the universe. the story helps expand on the characters and the marvel universe.Characters- The characters are great individually, but fantastic together. Peter Quill(Chris Pratt) with his Han Solo vibes and comedic relief. Gamora(Zoe Saldana) as the fighting badass. Drax(Dave Bautista), the muscular, vengeance seeking fighter. Rocket(Bradley Cooper) a smartass, talking raccoon. And last but not least, Groot(Vin Diesel), a talking tree. You would think what a group of misfits like this would do together, being all very different. But, they end up save the universe, surprisingly. The characters build off off each other, enhance themselves and others around them to form overall good characters that are relate-able in multiple ways.Music- The soundtrack for this movie was one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a while. It included all "retro" songs including "Hooked on a Feeling" by Blue Swede, "I Want You Back" by The Jackson 5, and Escape (The Pina Colada Song) by Rupert Holmes. Overall the movie was Fantastic!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew nothing about Guardians Of The Galaxy before the film was announced and even afterwards I still know nothing about them.So I didn't really have any expectations going into the film and was I surprised.IT WAS AMAZING! Probably my favourite Marvel film!The story was awesome, it was funny without being stupid, wasn't oversexualised and the aliens and space shots weren't overdone but still looked wicked.I was under the assumption that this film was set in like the year 3000 or something so I was quiet surprised to see that this is set in present time, just set outside and away from Earth.Loved the cast! Not too familiar with Chris Pratt but he was definitely a good fit in the film. Dave Bautista was a surprise in his role as Drax (I don't hold too much value in wrestlers as actors, although Dwayne Johnson is probably the better one out of them.)Major kudos to the creative team that they could make you fall in love and feel emotions towards two totally computer generated characters.The soundtrack to this film is equally as awesome as the movie, if not better.If you a Marvel fan, most definitely check this film out!I will most certainly be buying this on day one!!</fullReview>

I watched the movie only to know about the purple infinity stone. But the movie was actually quite good and enjoyable. James Gunn really pulled off an unbelievable task by turning an almost unknown comic edition into an amazing movie.The humor of the movie is excellent but at the same time does not try too hard for it like Iron Man 2. Also it beautifully lays the foundations for future Marvel projects without much friction like the Avengers : Age of Ultron. Worth a watch even if you are not a big marvel fan or do not follow it much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Marvel Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this awesome film 2 years back in the local cinema. I went with my good friend. We both had low/medium expectations for the film. The promo art seemed cool, but the trailer seemed somewhat cliché.So my friend, the audience and myself sat in silence and awe as Starlord explores the new planet. It seemed so epic and serious. That is until Starlord started dancing to "Come and get your love", and at that point the audience and myself burst into laughter. And that's what it was like until the end of the film. It mixes in humour and seriousness, and it has such a good balance that the end product is almost perfect.I was never really a Marvel Fan, but this film changed my mind. It was just so good. It had awesome action sequences, cunning humour and a few tear drops here and there. The characters are very interesting- they all have their own issues and goals, but eventually see the same goal and work as a team to achieve it.It's impossible to talk about Guardians of the Galaxy without mentioning the soundtrack. The 70's and 80's nostalgia music is awesome, and suits the film in a somewhat unexpected way. I personally love the music used, and the Director James Gunn and his composer placed in the best places. From Come and get your love to Hooked on a feeling to Cherry Bomb, the music will get you clicking your fingers.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy is the finest marvel film. It has never been topped, and it's unlikely that'll ever be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy is a space adventure of heroes who must save the Galaxy from being destroyed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Miller 5-6-16Guardians of the Galaxy is about a space adventurer Starlord who finds an Infinity Stone named the Orb. A powerful villain name Ronan wants the power of the Orb. Starlord joins forces with Gamora an assassin, Groot a tree, Rocket Racoon a raccoon and Drax an alien with vengeance. Together they become the Guardians of the Galaxy to save the Universe. The producer of Guardians of the Galaxy is Kevin Feige. The film was released August 1, 2014. Guardians of the Galaxy is a unique space adventure. It starts in 1999, Peter Quill finds a space ship and is abducted by bounty hunters. 26 years later, in 2014, Peter Quill finds a powerful Infinity Stone in space named the Orb. Peter then takes it to the planet Xandar (Zan-Dar) and meets Gamora, Rocket Raccoon and Groot. They fight each other at first. Then they get arrested by the Nova Core and are sent to Prison. Thanos, a powerful villain who wants to destroy the universe. He gives Ronan the order to bring him the Orb. In the Prison, The Guardians try to escape so they can stop Ronan from obtaining the Orb. The Guardians meet Drax the Destroyer who wants vengeance because Ronan killed his family. The Guardians then team up and escape prison. Then they go to a severed head called Knowwhere. While they were in Nowhere, Ronan finds the Guardians and gets the Orb. Ronan informs Thanos that he has the Orb and then refuses to give it to Thanos because Ronan wants to become stronger than Thanos and threatens to destroy Thanos after the Guardians. Ronan attacks Xandar. The Guardians of the Galaxy battle Ronan. Guardians of the Galaxy has amazing effects. Marvel Studios has introduced a new team with new fictional worlds. The film had massive sound effects during the battle of Xandar when gunshots were made, the sound of the Orb's power that could wipe out the person holding it had a cinematic effect. The most interesting part of the film was when foreshadowing was used. When the Guardians were in Nowhere, a villain named the Collector were informing the Guardians about the Six Infinity Stones and together, they contain invincible power that wipes out humanity which builds a plot to a future film. The dialogue was impressively used. Thanos has the most interesting dialogue when he told Ronan "Return to me again empty handed, I will bathe the star ways in your blood." Thanos was an outstanding villain. It shows viewers that Thanos is a threatening final boss. Rocket Racoon and Starlord had sarcasm which adds comedy to the film. The Guardians of the Galaxy included classic songs in the background because they discuss about relation and teamwork. The background music show relation because Starlord loves and misses his mom after she died of cancer and Starlord and Gamora love each other. The songs used were "Hooked on a Feeling", "Moonage Daydream". Peter Quill's hero name "Starlord" is meaningful to viewers. The song Cherry Bomb was used while the Guardians were preparing for battle to show viewers teamwork. Guardians of the Galaxy is an entertaining space adventure of heroes in the galaxy who battle Ronan to save the Universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Marvel's Best Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is driven by good plot, witty comedy, a powerful cast, and all backed by an extraordinary soundtrack. The film directed by James Gunn was released in 2014 and produced by Marvel Studios. Peter Quill is a space bounty hunter played by the amazing Chris Pratt, his story starts off dark as his mom is dying of cancer and he is soon to be abducted by aliens. He is then raised by the space pirate group called The Ravagers. 26 years later Quill steals an orb not knowing what is inside. This is where we meet Gamora, Rocket, and Groot. All three attempt to steal the orb from Quill. This huge fight lands them all in a huge prison. There they all agree to help each other escape so they can sell the orb and split the profit. The inmate Drax joins the team and helps the escape plan. We learn that Gamora is a relative to the films villain Ronan and he wants the orb because it contains the key to the destruction of the Nova Core... an Infinity stone. As they try to sell the orb they learn what is inside and its power and then go on a mission to keep the orb from Ronan. They need to become The Guardians of the Galaxy. This movie is visually stunning and effectively uses CGI to create the space setting. As you expect from a Marvel film the casting and production team are amazing. The story line is accompanied by Awesome Mix Vol.1 this is the movies soundtrack and provides a light tone to the movie. The theme is conveyed by the amazing abilities of Marvel story telling, driven by hard action and well written dialogue. The movie shows that a team can be wired and not go together at all but if you work together you can accomplish anything. Overall this is one of my favorite movies, and it hits a home run every time it is on my TV screen.</fullReview>

The story was great, the special effects and CGI were even better, and it was absolutely entertaining.Drax the Destroyer, played by Dave Batista, was so funny with how literal he was. People who are literal usually are not funny, but Drax the Destroyer perfected it.Groot, played by Vin Diesel, was a tall wooden idiot, but he has a violent side to him that cannot be matched. Rocket Raccoon, played by Bradley Cooper, was also extremely funny. But Rocket Raccoon was also intelligent, and he used it to create new innovative weapons and plans on the spot in order to get him what he wanted.This movie also did an excellent job leading up to the Infinity War that is going to happen in the upcoming Avengers Infinity War movies in 2018 and 2019. This was a nice addition to the Marvel collection.</fullReview>

A great movie with plenty for every age to enjoy. It is set in the ever expanding realm of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and has some great Easter eggs hidden within that help to anchor this particular movie to all those that have gone before and to those that will follow on from it.

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of all time, though still not the best in the MCU.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is another movie that is very tough for me to review using my typical format. Watching this movie as a "critic" is incredibly difficult because I know every line and every joke. Unfortunately, it doesn't still give me quite the same tingles and tears it did the first 10 or so times I watched it, but I remember them (and those three words get me in the feels every time).To put it plainly, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of my favorite movies of all time, and the best best movie produced by Marvel Studios so far (yes, as a movie, I rank it above Iron Man (though not by much)). It is not, however, a better comic book movie than Iron Man, and, as I write this, I am not entirely sure it is a better comic book movie than The Avengers. This may sound paradoxical, or at least contradictory, but it is a rather common thing in films. Citizen Kane is somewhat slow today when watched today, but Orson Welles invented (or perfected) several camera techniques and angles in that movie, and was essentially the father of the modern Hollywood movie. Because of this, and not for much else, Citizen Kane is still considered by many to be the best film ever. Empire Strikes Back was a better movie, but Star Wars is the best Science Fiction movie of all time. Godfather 2 was a better film but the original of that series was the best gangster/mafia film of all time (sorry Goodfellas). In that way, Guardians is better, but can never be the best.Guardians wouldn't, couldn't, exist without The Avengers...and The Avengers wouldn't. couldn't, exist without Iron Man. For that reason, Guardians comes in 3rd in my list of MCU movies, though I might change my mind about that tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Marvel Films to Date, and That's Saying Something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is directed by Peter Gunn and is the story of a human named Peter Quill, who was abducted by an alien group called the Ravagers as a boy. Once in space, he becomes a sort of smuggler, branching off from the Ravagers and doing his own thing. Eventually, a dealer asks him to retrieve a specific orb for him that resides on an abandoned planet called Morag. Upon retrieving the orb, he learns that a warlord named Ronan is also wanting the orb, along with a few others. Peter, and a few friends, have to prevent the vicious Ronan from gaining the orb, and save the day. They're the space Avengers.I really didn't expect this movie to be good; I thought it was going to be trash. However, Marvel proved, once again, that they can make some good movies, and Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely one of them. Almost everything about this film was great, and exceeded my expectations in every way possible. Guardians is funny, crude, action packed, and pretty deep as well. The script and actors juggle all of these elements so well, and really make for a great time with a movie.The best thing about Guardians is the characters. Peter Quill, or Star Lord, is great lead character, played excellently by Chris Pratt. Zoe Saldana was great as Gamora, proving yet again that she is really good at playing sexy, multi colored aliens. Although he only repeated the same line in different tones, Vin Diesel was awesome as Groot, and brought a sort of intimidation to the character. Dave Bautista was a perfect choice as Drax, and his traditional way of speaking added a lot of humor to more than a few scenes.Rocket Raccoon. I honestly thought that Rocket was going to be an annoying little rodent that was supposed to be funny, yet none of his humor would be pulled off well. I basically thought that Rocket was going to be the Jar Jar Binks of this movie. Wow, I was wrong. Rocket Raccoon was one of the best things about this entire film, and I loved every minute that he was on screen. Bradley Cooper did such a good job as this character, and brought so much comedy to the already funny film.The direction was great. James Gunn did a really great job with the camera, and used a great style during both action scenes and exposition scenes. His limited amount of cuts during the action really helped the movie, considering a lot of the action was space ships flying around each other. That's another great thing about Guardians: the special effects. All of the CG looks great, including Rocket, Groot, and all of the space battles. Particularly during the battle at the climax, the special effects were great.Now, I did have a problem with this movie, and that problem was the villain, which I was really disappointed with. With many Marvel films, the villain is pretty boring or bland. This includes the Abomination (The Incredible Hulk), Whiplash (Iron Man 2), The Mandarin (Iron Man 3), and Malekith (Thor: The Dark World). Adding to that list is Ronan, the underdeveloped villain of Guardians of the Galaxy. Although his background is covered, it's very brief, and if anybody tunes out his introduction scene, then he's just a bad guy who is bad...and a guy. That's about it. He doesn't have too much character development, and is pretty boring altogether.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy was a great movie, and would be perfect in every way if it just wasn't for that villain. You should definitely check out this film, because it's really worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the movie cover mostly all parts funny and sad and hate and just a tab bit of love. now I'm not really a marvel fan but this wasn't to bad to watch I like the fight scenes and the story was good but I didn't read the comic book so I don't know if they stuck by the story from the comic book. the costumes was amazing and I love the special effects that went along with the movie. I think they pick the right cast for the characters they all bring different aspects to the movie and there personalities now don't get me wrong im a bad guy fan also I do like the good guys but most of the time they make the good guys costume look stupid or plain lol. the fact that they made Thanos look in that movie was pretty good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now that, is what I call masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have tried to make this as spoiler free as possible.When Guardians of the Galaxy was first announced, Marvel was in it's full swing. There were movies like Avengers and Iron Man series, which had given it great success. Movies like Capt. America: The Winter Soldier and Thor 2 were declared, and Marvel was looking forward to be the best of all. But when Guardians was declared, almost no one know who or what they were. And today, Guardians of the Galaxy is my favorite movie. What James Gunn did with this, is absolutely fantastic. Chris Pratt as Star Lord, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax, Vin Diesel as Groot, Bradley Cooper as Rocket, Michael Rooker as Yondu, all of them were perfect. The acting was brilliant, story was awesome, and most importantly, the soundtrack was perfect.Guardians of the Galaxy is a story of 5 misfits, who are forced to save the world from Ronan the Accuser when fate brings them together. And the comedy, action, and fun that follows is completely mind blowing. And then, you have the Awesome Mix Vol 1 playing in the background, which makes it more fun.The only negative thing, Ronan was not that deadly. Then again, Marvel movies don't have deadly villains.The action in this movie, was one of the best in any Marvel Franchise ever. The war on Xandar in the end, showed how amazing Marvel can be in action if they wish.In the end, all I'd like to say is, DO WATCH THIS MOVIE. It's a crazy mix of perfect acting, a lot of humor, 5 people who should not just be compatible forming a team, with beautiful music in background, and a fun watch ,for people of all ages. As for me? This is my favorite movie of all times, and I have watched it 30+ times, still I never get bored.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 releases in a couple years, and Marvel has my money for that movie right from now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favorite new movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really love this movie. When I first heard about it, never reading the comics, I thought, "That sounds really lame", but I was pleasantly surprised. The acting was the great, the soundtrack was alright, but I'm not a huge fan of '60s and '70s music. They picked the right actors to play their roles, the effects were amazing and the whole movie was just awesome.This movie is about a group of unlikely heroes who all come together and save the galaxy, hence the title, Guardians Of The Galaxy. Peter Quill, AKA, Starlord, is a human who was abducted from Earth about thirty years ago. Nowadays he travels the galaxy to the outer regions to steal things. That's right, he's a thief. After getting caught, he finds himself in prison, with a lot of other criminals, obviously. He meets Gamora, an assassin who is wanted dead by nearly every other prisoner because of who she works for. Drax, a really big guy who wants to kill Gamora but gets over it. And Rocket and Groot, a genetically modified creature who looks like a raccoon and his best friend, a tree alien. They all break out of the prison together and escape from the guards. They find out that the orb that Starlord stole earlier in the film is actually home to an Infinity Stone, something that Gamora's boss has been after for a while. Eventually, everyone fights with Ronan, Gamora's boss, and in the end, Ronan loses, like losers do. Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It manipulates with humor, but still a great Marvel film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An '80s-lovin' burglar. A green-skinned assassin. A bodybuilder. A walking tree. A talking raccoon. Nothing familiar from our view of Marvel. If you think that Marvel's crazy for trying to throw a blockbuster with characters nobody knows into theaters, you're obviously a 21st century kid. It's called originality and freshness compared to the sequels and reboots plaguing the cinematic world nowadays. Guardians is a fresh &amp; welcome entry not just the Marvel universe, but the cinematic universe in general. Peter Quill a.k.a. Starlord (a cool Chris Pratt) was abducted from Earth 20 years ago and works under the hands of space pirates led by blue-skinned greedy Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker). After discovering a strange space orb on a desolate planet, he escapes narrowly from interceptors led by Kree warrior Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace). It seems everyone's after him: Yondu sets a bounty for his capture and Ronan's temporary master, Thanos, sends his green-skin daughter Gamora (Zoe Saldana) after Quill. It becomes clear as the movie goes on that the orb has something that can change the fate of the galaxy. To evade Ronan, Quill eventually forced to ally with Gamora, buff Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), a walking tree called Groot with only three words of dialogue (Vin Diesel), and the genetically engineered talking raccoon Rocket (dynamite Bradley Cooper). The plot? Keep the orb out of enemy hands. The pace? Kinda slow. The humor? Spot-on. Much of the bonding between our extraterrestrial misfits takes place early in a prison, but it can be safely said that it's as necessary as it is slow. It all unfolds into a structural problem that is quite common in Marvel movies: "rush to the big bang". While the climax of this movie is entertaining, a small cut on the prison sequences and the climax could have been filled with scenes adding more depth to our characters, who don't come out as dimensional as we'd expect. If anyone's got more depth than anyone else, it's Rocket. But more on that later. This annoying flaw can easily be put aside by the surprises that this film brought to us. Director and co- writer James Gunn's execution of this film hooks us to this stranger material at hello. The script he co-wrote alongside Nicole Perlman makes up for the overabundance of 2D characters with relentless energy that humor that could have easily fallen flat but makes up laugh every time. One-liners are the kind of comedy that crash on arrival when executed poorly, but each one feels fresh. I laughed the entire time at jokes ranging from Jackson Pollock to Kevin Bacon. It's nice to see him grow from his writing bombs from the "meh..." Scooby-Doo films and especially from the dreadful Movie 43. It's a blast watching our title character dancing to '70s music on his cassette player next to blasting aliens on his starship with his misfit group. The soundtrack is very nostalgic and adds a unique feel to the film. I wonder how it could have gone if it went all-original? The cast mostly works on top of the eccentric characters. Pratt is undeniably having a blast as the space warrior and knows how comic timing works. Saldana is simply Saldana, making the space baddie's daughter assassin seem significantly less menacing. A threat, yes. One to hate, no. Bautista does his best here and fits well under all that makeup, but you can tell the guy's never acted. Cooper proves he can shine through voice work and adds lots of depth and sometimes emotional resonance to arguably the most fun character in Guardians. Diesel can surprisingly provide humor and heart through three words, "I am Groot.". Everyone else is easily replaceable, even Pace. But the great Glenn Close is never bad as the leader of a military/police force.Energy, bullseye humor, and an overall outstanding sense of fun is the driving force for this film that would have flopped if it missed any one of those three. Marvel has a virus of getting to an disproportionately long third act too quickly, and it clearly shows in Guardians. The film's clearly overstuffed with plot and characters and has a weird structure, and I felt it. But those can be easily forgotten when Rocket's blasting a rifle on his buddy Groot's shoulder and when Quill flirts with Gamora. I had a very fun time, but the movie's far from perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From "I'm Not In Love" by 10cc that sets up the prologue to "Come and Get Your Love" by Redbone that begins the main story, the tone is set right from the start with Guardians of the Galaxy. This isn't your everyday superhero film, though it does have all the characteristics of a Marvel one. Guardians of the Galaxy is contagiously upbeat right from the opening credits and keeps the mood light throughout. It has action, comedy, a little drama and a little, albeit slightly one-sided, bit of romance. Set almost entirely in space, in a galaxy far.. far.. away, this story follows five unlikely heroes towards a path none of them thought possible. Throughout the movie, this unexpected blockbuster, you'll be taken through some exotic locations, meet some familiar faces and, even though you probably had no idea who they were prior to the film, you'll be left wanting more by the end of it.

		<fullReview>Having seen most of the recent movies in the "marvel universe" series, or which this is purported to be a part, I was surprised by how little it has to do with Captain America or Iron Man. It is actually a very different movie, something as though you made a movie about Hans Solo before he got involved with all that good guy stuff, and then set it at a lightning pace reminiscent of animated films like The Incredibles.The performances are terrific, especially the lead, who is a revelation for those who only knew him for his amusingly shaggy TV role. The movie is incredibly funny, yet occasionally slows down just enough to offer a moment of character insight that prevents it from falling into the noisy-special-effects trap of a lot of big-budget action flicks.While I rarely read comic books, and thus am not familiar with the source material, I would have expected this wacky story and structure to come from some weird indie graphic novel rather than a big publisher like Marvel. I like some of the other Marvel movies, but this one, which stands on its own little island far away from Samuel Jackson, is the best of the bunch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally A Fresh Comic Book Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I for one am sick of the superhero genre dominating the modern day box office and Hollywood. I don't want to see 9 different superhero films with the same kind of plot just to see 2 films where all the characters come together in a plot that is no different than all the other films before it. I don't give a damn about "phase 2" or whatever. Just stop. Cranking out these movies just for the sake of having more cross overs and sequels is ridiculous. While I can't deny that the main plot of Guardians Of The Galaxy doesn't stray far from all of the other comic book movies its tied to, it's approach feels much fresher, and I can't say how much I appreciate that.There was a lot of things I liked. The mixtape soundtrack was really cool. I also enjoyed all the main characters and their interactions, especially when the lead to some emotional moments throughout. The visuals are also very vivid and creative. The whole design of the galaxy and its people should be appreciated. But I do acknowledge issues. The aforementioned typical comic book plot and finale. The action sequences leave a lot to be desired to be honest. But I think issues like this could be fixed in a future sequel.I still dislike the idea of more silly comic books films and crossovers, but at least this film was unique enough to make me look forward to the sequel to this and even any future cross over films involving the Guardians. It's a fun popcorn flick. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a funny and good movie. But I don't know why they decided to put comedy in a Marvel movie because Marvel movies are susposed to be serious the whole way through. This is the best marvel movie so far, but the only marvel movies I have watched other than this is Captain America(2011), The Avengers, and a little of Incredible Hulk. I give this movie a 7.5/10. The reason I give this a 7.5/10 is because it was a little boring in the middle and I wasn't 100% sold on the characters. What I liked about the movie was the humor, the special effects, etc. Unlike The Avengers, they sort of killed of a character because SPOILER ALERT: Groot dies, but one of his parts is planted and he becomes a small plant. So overall, it was a good movie. It gets a 7.5/10</fullReview>

First of all there is the talking racoon. Second there is the 80's soundtrack which sometimes helps &amp; sometimes is annoying depending on your taste. The cast is terrific &amp; includes plenty of good villains. Overall the art direction is stunning. I can't wait for the sequel. Because of the PG rating the violence and language is keep in check.

		<shortDescription>Absolutely brilliance technicals with so-so script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with most of the other reviewers that this was an amazing technical achievement. The CGI was flawless, feeling less like CGI and more like "real life animation". The textures were intense and the motion spot on.I would say this movie is Firefly (Serenity) meets Star Wars. Pratt was gorgeous, cheeky and strong. Zoe looks much better as my sweet brown baby than as greeny. Rocket, a raccoon, really? A fun character but single-handedly responsible for the loss of one star in the ratings. All I could hear in my head when he was on screen is the Beatles "Rocky Racoon". Sheesh. Oh, and Karen Gillan is very cute but in this character she is shrill, emaciated and weak. Wish Selfie was renewed... Sorry, I digress. I really didn't appreciate Groot until about 1:30 or so. Then I loved him. BTW, waste of a paycheck to cast Vin there.The story is well worn and predictable and most of the script from 1:00 to 1:40 or so is detrimental to the entire experience it cost another star. Those two points are the reason for the other two missing ratings stars.So, Chris Pratt +2, CGI +4, technical fun +3, cohesive cast +1, story -1, script -1, raccoon, -1. Overall I did enjoy my two hours in the chair and 3D was a lot of fun.Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Guardians of the Galaxy Delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is the story of five unlikely friends who find themselves in an outer space race to save the galaxy from the super forces of evil. This is another film adaptation from Marvel Studios which boast big adventure from a group of out of this world misfits.The Guardians are obscure characters from Marvel and James Gunn directs this comic book, action, sci-fi odyssey. The cast of characters include an irreverent space adventurer Starlord/Peter Quill played by Chris Pratt who was abducted from Earth by aliens as a boy, and since then has traveled the stars honing his space bartering skills and frat boy sarcasm. The movie takes off as Starlord finds an orb with mysterious powers, for which he later learns the value to several sinister forces, including Ronan (Lee Pace), the fearsome leader of the Kree aliens. Realizing he needs help protecting the object, he recruits a eclectic roster of prisoners: Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a genetically engineered raccoon with a temper and propensity for violence, Groot (Vin Diesel), a nine foot humanoid tree that has only mastered speaking his own name, the dim-witted, muscle head Drax (Dave Bautista) and the seductive green-skinned assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana). Despite their differing agendas, they join forces to preserve peace in their galaxy, and risking their lives across the stars. The Guardians of the Galaxy movie is styled and structured much like the classic Star Trek with the characters similar to the interplanetary archetypes like Han Solo and Captain Kirk. Gunn employs a narrative style is much like the great spirit of exploration that Gene Roddenberry established inn his work. The look of Guardians of the Galaxy is a high-tech future, with laser beams, and vibrant stars and strange planets; made possible much in part to CGI. Starlord fighting lizard aliens in the puddle, and tangibly interacts with it is an impressive use of this cinematic technology.The Guardians of the Galaxy delivers on action, visual appeal, and humorous banter. However, this film could have done without the predictable obligatory romantic subplot between Gamora and Starlord. Despite that shortcoming this film is well produced, directed, fun, and worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>silly and somewhat childish but rather funny sci-fi comedy adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is more of a comedy than anything else. It is truly a comic magazine brought to life on the big screen and more focused on delivering a sequence of action scenes and laughs than anything intelligent in the form of plot or characters. I would say it is a movie for the younger audience and comic fans. Having said that I must admit that I found it rather fun to watch.The main characters are two mostly irresponsible rascals, one dumb but likable living tree and two fanatics of which one certainly need not apply to the Mensa club. Of the five I liked Rocket and Gamora the best. Rocket is a rather likable rascal and Gamora is simply cool. Quill is sometimes just silly, Groot is more of a living prop and Drax is just too stupid.The story is more or less just there to tie the scenes together. Unfortunately we do really not get much of a background to the Guardians of The Galaxy universe. It would have been nice to get a bit more understanding of why things are as they are etc. The return of this movie is watching the action, the special effects and the laughs. It is an action-adventure-comedy plain and simple. If you approach it as such it works reasonably well.Speaking of special effects, they are generally well done. The designs are interesting. The shape of the bad guys spaceship is totally ludicrous of course but visually pleasing and goes with the rest of the movie's tendency to be more of a comedy than a serious movie. The same can be said for that cool but weird net they made by interlinking fighter crafts.On the whole an entertaining movie. I have to say that the dancing scene at the end was a wee bit too silly for me though. I have a problem understanding how a movie like this can get such a relatively high rating at IMDb but okay it was fun to watch and it is not entirely undeserved. Personally I think a 7 out of 10 is more in the right region.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's best so far? No, but still incredibly enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I don't read comic books, but I am at least nominally familiar with a lot of the Marvel characters. That being said, I had no idea who the Guardians of the Galaxy were. To a degree, after seeing this, I still don't completely understand since they don't really go into a lot of character depth but I am interested in going back to this world and exploring these characters again. GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY has eye-popping visuals, an incredible soundtrack and some legitimately good world-building that manage to transcend a rather run-of-the-mill story. The basic plot is that these five characters, who are all outcasts in their own way, are thrust together through circumstance and unite to overcome a villain bent on destroying a planet. Those characters are Peter Quill/Starlord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel).The best elements of the film which stuck out to me were the outstanding visual effects, world-building and character design. There are a lot of things thrown in together, and despite the enormity of it all, I never felt overwhelmed. Also, the action sequences were well-shot and there some truly amazing space battles. The performances, however, are more of a mixed bag. First, I will say that Chris Pratt was amazing as Peter Quill. He brought an everyman quality to his character and had a great sense of humor. Rocket and Groot were also great characters to watch in every scene they appeared. I'd go so far as to say they were my favorite characters. They were equal parts cute and badass, and have some of the best lines and most poignant scenes in the whole movie.On the other end, though, I thought that Dave Bautista and Karen Gillan (as Nebula) weren't at the same level as other members of the cast. And then there were other characters who barely registered because they just weren't in the movie that much. Thanos is one of these, and I also didn't like Josh Brolin's voice-over. You also have John C. Reilly and Glenn Close who show up for a few scenes. Sadly, the main villain Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) was just as weak a villain as any other villain in a Marvel film. That's not to say that Lee Pace didn't do a good job or that the character didn't look cool, but he just wasn't given enough to do.On a more positive note, the soundtrack was amazing. Kind of makes me want to buy a copy of Awesome Mix Vol. 1. And, for all of the lack of originality in the story, it was executed in an interesting way and elevated by the chemistry of the core cast members. I wouldn't say that it's the best Marvel movie to date, but it certainly is the most "out of the box" and daring thing that they've attempted so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy, best Marvel movie to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoiler alert***In Guardians of the Galaxy we have Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) a scavenger that was picked up from Earth as a young boy, locating an orb that contains one of the infinity stones. While on Nova he gets in a fight with Gamora (Zoe Saldana) for the stone. Meanwhile Rocket and Groot (Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel) are trying to capture Quill. They are all arrested and sent to the Kyln prison where they meet up with another inmate Drax (Dave Bautista). They may fight and bicker but they come together as a team and a family to defeat Ronan (Lee Pace) before be can destroy Nova.This leads us to the theme of the movie, teamwork. The first time they work as a team is when break out of the Kyln. They all gathered the items that Rocket needed to break them out. Even though they worked as a team they still hadn't gelled together yet. That came at the end of the movie during the battle with Ronan.If this theme sounds familiar to you it should. It took place two years earlier on Earth when Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) brought together a group of extraordinary superheroes called the Avengers. It can also be found in the Fantastic Four from 2005 and the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen in 2003.A technique that we saw used during the film to show the development of the theme was developing characters. This is the most evident with Drax's character. When he is introduced in the Kyln he is all about revenge and killing Gamora. The change in Drax happens on Nowhere when Groot saves him from drowning when Ronan throws him in a vat of liquid. The development finalizes on Ronan's ship, the Dark Aster, when they are walking to the bridge and he realizes that the rest of the Guardians are his friends. Another technique used during the film is ensemble acting. While all five of the Guardians have different backgrounds and came from different places they all have different skills that help out the team. For example Rocket is very good with building weapons for the team to use while Gamora can use her intellect and military training.Like I mentioned the theme is teamwork. Like Loki (Tom Hiddleston) for the Avengers and Professor M in the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (Richard Roxburgh) the Guardians used a common cause to bring them together. That was Ronan in this film. They now have a bond that will serve them well against other foes.</fullReview>

It's got heroes and villains, damsels and black knights, jesters, Shire Reeves and deputies as well as a white knight. Oh, and don't forget the honorable Groot tree. My biggest surprise of the movie was to find out who played Groot. This movie is just plain a lot of fun and it's not one of those movies that only the kids will have fun with. In fact this movie was pretty clearly made for an adult audience. Having said that I would also have to say that its a movie made for the inner teenager in all of us. It has "hidden treasure" and has pirates, lots of pirates, swindlers, and everything that an old Errol Flynn, Captain Blood in the 43rd century could need. It uses flawless CGI to create a fantastic future galaxy, far far away. When the movie was over I wanted more and yet I was satisfied too.

		<shortDescription>A delightfully offbeat sci-fi comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not many movies can effortlessly transition from a boy grieving as his mother dies of cancer to the same character dancing and lip-syncing his way through a cavern of carnivorous lizard-squirrel things. Guardians of the Galaxy is one of those movies. It is offbeat, more than a bit mad, and far more awesome than an adaptation of one of Marvel's back burner titles, directed by a guy who used to work for Troma, has any right to be.Our protagonist is Peter Quill, Star Lord, the grieving, alien abducted child grown into hilariously insane treasure hunter and adventurer. It is impossible to overstate how perfect Chris Pratt was for this roll. As Star Lord he answers once and for all the question of what it would look like if Andy Dwyer went to space and became a superhero. He is clueless, shameless, and unreasonably lovable. He's a nice guy and a scoundrel, a man who will gladly rob or double cross anyone yet has an unspoken sense of honor; a lucky idiot who nonetheless scrapes by on his wits alone. He kind of reminds me of a younger Han Solo, only laughable.Accompanying him in his latest misadventure is a collection of the most disparate, and desperate outlaws the galaxy has to offer. Green skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana) is the deadliest woman in the universe. Raised by the mad titan Thanos and trained from childhood as an assassin, she can kill any being alive and has no time for fools or flatterers. The imposing Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista) lost his family to the Kree zealot Ronan the Accuser many years ago and ever since has been a nigh unstoppable engine of destruction who lives only for revenge. Rocket is a talking raccoon. He's an abrasive, sarcastic, fast talking, lying, thieving, backstabbing, and oh-so-adorable con man whose solution to every problem involves lots of firepower. And Groot is a giant tree man who only says three words.Individually they're reasonably formidable. But together, they are the galaxy's uh, well, most dysfunctional team of heroes. They really don't meet under the best of circumstances. In fact there's a lot of shooting and punching and insults involved. But when they're thrown in the galaxy's highest security prison, the chance of escaping and possibly making a fortune is reason enough to work together. And when Ronan and Thanos threaten the existence of an entire civilization, they're the only ones with a chance of stopping them. It's quite interesting to watch the characters go from antagonists to allies of convenience to real friends. And the bickering along the way is hilarious.In fact the entire movie is hilarious. Between the slapstick, puns, historical and pop culture references, and the characters' eccentricities and zaniness, it's a laugh a minute. Rarely outside of a Three Stooges short have so many people called each other idiots with such frequency or justification. There are a number of excellent running gags, including Star Lord's obsessive attachment to his Walkman and Groot's well, everything. Add in a gift for picking the most inappropriate musical accompaniments possible, and this movie can even make scenes of prison brutality funny.The action is also first rate, with excellent fight scenes and space combat worthy of Star Wars. The effects work is equally good, and I don't just mean the explosions and lasers. The space stations and starships have an extremely crisp, detailed look to them, the make-up and costumes on the various aliens are quite convincing, and Rocket Raccoon is incredibly lifelike and expressive, fully on par with the Caesar and friends in the recent Planet of the Apes movies.The plot, while hardly cerebral, is good by action movie standards and makes good use of the film's source material. There are also some very good minor and supporting characters. Ronan and Nebula are suitably menacing and despite having little screen time Thanos makes a strong impression. Benicio Del Toro does a nice turn as the Collector, and I particularly liked Yondu, the redneck outlaw captain. The soundtrack, which consists of 70s and 80s pop hits, seems an odd choice, but it adds wonderfully to the oddball feel, contributes to the humor, and is undeniably catchy.Guardians is one of the funniest, most exciting, and most unusual blockbusters of recent years, and one of the best films of the summer. It strikes a perfect blend of action and humor, heroics and cheerful idiocy, and while first and foremost a comedy, manages at times to be deeply touching. You'll get more out it if you have at least a passing familiarity with the comics, but even if you've walk in knowing nothing beyond what the trailers and this review have told you, this is as much fun as you're going to have at the movies this summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel movie I've seen in a while..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie was a nice surprise. It turned out to be much more than I expected.The humour and action sequences combine very well and make for a great watch. Actually the humour element is what made the movie so good for me. The jokes are well timed and not corny at all. Also the character design and art style of Rocket and Groot are awesome, same goes for all of the other characters but those two would be my favourite.The story builds well over the course of the film and includes some crazy battles with very nice CGI. Yes, the graphics are awesome. If you watch this movie on the big screen or at home on your HDTV you should be quite amazed at the level of detail and effort that was put into the special effects.Overall an almost perfect movie for me. I give it a 9/10 only because I wish it could have been longer. I'm looking very forward to the sequel, hoping it's not too far off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Glimmer of Hope, However Faint...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite its smart casting and often undeniable craftsmanship, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (TM) has really been testing my patience of late, and what was fresh in 2008 is starting to feel stale and contrived. Marvel has its story lines so tightly intertwined that every film feels forced to reference at least 2 others in the franchise at this point, and we've reached a point of suffocation. Not helping matters any is a sense that they're basically making the same film again and again, even if they're mostly making it very well.So, on the Guardians of the Galaxy... finally a universe mostly divorced from the Avengers (back to that in a minute) and feeling worlds away from that studio's recent output. Fun, cheeky, self-aware and with much more memorable characters (Groot and the Raccoon being the standouts) than your standard superhero fare, Guardians is at its best when it really lets go and embraces its silliness. It also boasts an endlessly hummable soundtrack. Marvel being Marvel, however, the result is much less perfect than the current IMDb rating would have you imagine. Reused plot tropes are legion, from a distant demigod underwritten super-villain (+ an arch-villain confusingly introduced with no bearing on the plot) to yet another "destroy-a-city" climax, Guardians is often handicapped by its narrative similarity to preceding films, and you can't help but wish it had been released before all its mostly inferior cousins. Thankfully though, it is denied the cruel fate Captain America was given, force-projected as he was into the Avengers time period for the sake of corporate synergy.Is this a great film? No. But it is an often very entertaining one, with hugely likable characters, and it offers a glimmer of hope, however faint, that Marvel might relax its centralized creative hold and allow for more original ideas to break through. If that ever happens, the age of superheroes will truly be one of movie magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much of the story or character development, but the 70s music and the humour keep the movie interesting,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite a fresh and humorous origin story for a group of vigilantes-turned-heroes. The plot is quite predictable and there's no character development at all, but the movie doesn't take itself too seriously at any moment and it's aware of it, and that certainly works in its favour. The 70s music comeback for a superhero film was quite a surprise, and it worked wonders for the storytelling. The spectacular sets and the brilliant special effects certainly add to the beauty of the film. With a little more story and character development, it would have been more memorable (like this year's other origin story, 'Big Hero 6').The cast is well selected, especially Chris Pratt. Voice-over from Bradley Cooper as Rocket is also quite well done. Supporting roles performed by talented actors like Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, John C. Reilly and Benicio Del Toro were small but amusing. It was interesting to see Lee Pace's transformation from the Elven King Thranduil (in 'The Hobbit') to the dark and psychotic revenge-ridden villain Ronan in this one.Hope the future parts have better storyline and character development, and hope it maintains the humour and 70s music charm of this part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a family friendly movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Highly entertaining movie but not suitable for children. This movie is now being rolled out via schools as early reading material, however the movie contains harmful, off-hand derogatory messages for children to absorb about how men should treat females and about sexuality in general. Perhaps the original comic book content was very racy, but why should children be exposed to sexually offensive content?It is easier to overlook the sexism in the movies until it is quite clearly spelled out after the guardians have bonded together to fight a common enemy and the only female guardian - with whom any young girl would identify with - is called a whore out of the blue. It's like a slap in the face - you are not equal to the others. So disappointing.There should be a special rating system for movies like this and frat-boy shows like The Family Guy which employ a variety of negative sexist and harmful messages inappropriate for children and young teens. It is very backward thinking in a time when rape culture is being exposed to the light of day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, I went to see this because it was hired as the new star wars, and being a star wars fan myself wanted to check that out. I must say that it truly does remind of star wars, even having many differences (no outline of main characters being sharply good or bad, much energy-blaze stuff that personally don't like much, use of bad-words and of modern music) Strangely, and I wasn't expecting that, it does have an emotional touch to it, and not just action sequences.What really blocked back this from becoming "the new star wars" was really the music. It's not at all touching and epical as the John Williams score we hear in star wars, and the lack of truly epical duels, like the star wars lightsaber duels (here it's made by star-lord banally taking an orb in his hand without dying) I'm so gonna laugh if it turns out that Thanatos is star-lord's father. giving this an 8/10</fullReview>

Even though sci-fi fantasy, had believable moments with the characters. They all had lost something or personal struggles, so the audience can relate to them.Will definitely add to my DVD collection for watching and enjoying for years to come.

		<shortDescription>A Real Hoot...skip IMAX</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the movie was a real hoot and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Great fantasy Sci-Fi at it's best. Save yourself a lot of money by skipping the IMAX 3D experience (usually almost double the normal 2D cost). This is just my personal opinion but it looked to me like the 3D version was an afterthought. I absolutely love 3D but the IMAX version I saw appeared layered...which I hate. Also, IMAX advertises that they have better quality picture and better sound; however, maybe it was just my theater, but I don't equate better with louder. I almost walked out of the theater, but I'd already paid for my ticket, so I did complain to management after the movie about the sound level. Maybe the Real 3D is better, but I was very disappointed in my first IMAX 3D experience. I'd suggest you go see Guardians of the Galaxy in 2D and totally enjoy the movie without the layered 3D effect and horribly loud sound I had to endure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no words! This is the most entertaining movie I've seen in a long long time. From the minute I sat down to watch it, I was just hooked. I actually lost hope in Marvel films.I had just seen Captain America 2 , a few days before I saw Guardians, and it didn't do anything for me. It seems like after the Avengers, Marvel just gave up, with movies like Iron Man 3, Thor 2 and like I said, Captain America 2. But wow!! This movie really got me back !! It is just PERFECT!! from Quills wittiness , to Rockets devil-may-care attitude , to Drax's metaphor difficulties (hats off, Dave Bautista) to tiny baby dancing Groot to the troll they play on Yando! everyone just got their A -Game!! This is a must watch , and especially in cinemas! I do have one complaint , though. .. Marvel-what has happened to your post -credit scenes ??:/ are you Kidding me ? You're the studio that keeps audiences waiting at the theater till the last minute ,and then you just stopped delivering? every post credit scene since Avengers , has been random comedy scenes The first set of movies had the suspense of The Avengers building up with the end credit scenes , so its fair to expect the second set of movies to do the same ,with Avengers 2 :| But now screw it,avengers 2 is the next movie in line, so its too late...Nevertheless you guys better get in the game , and start redefining what clears the bar for a post-credit scene.That being said, I cant wait to see more of these characters in the sequel! James Gunn, Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper! you guys stole the show!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something new is never bad when it comes to comic books, but riding the waves of other successes works too, cause nothing says there has to be a change, maybe one and that's vision. It would be a mistake to think that Disney has no idea what it's doing. They know they need to keep the comic book wave alive and grab new viewers and Guardians of the Galaxy is perfect for doing just that. The new blood infusion comes from James Gunn the script writer, he's proved himself all geek with Super and Slither. Neither were outstanding pieces, but both were entertaining and very funny. But what did he end up doing with a big project and what can we even expect from him? Based on the first trailers it looks like the year's biggest blockbuster even if the Guardians don't have a strong foundation like the Avengers. Though it is a popular comic, it's not as known a brand as Thor and gang. But as more and more trailers came out and info was leaked expectations rose. The hype machine was churning. So only one question remains. Can they jump the huge hurdle that they built? Lássuk a sztorit: After stealing a mysterious orb in the far reaches of outer space, Peter Quill, a half human/half alien is now the main target of a manhunt lead by the villain known as Ronan the Accuser. To help fight Ronan and his team and save the galaxy from his power, Quill creates a team known as the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' to save the world. First off it's a visually pleasing action, the story is fast paced, but between two action scenes there is time for character development. It's finally not a problem that there are a lot of heroes in the story and they don't know what to do with them. They all have their place. The story may not be all that, but there aren't major problems with it either and the one liners are great. I laughed myself silly at the teasing going on between the characters. They constantly have a go at each other. The script is definitely designed to have the jokes and the characters as its focal point. And that's not a bad thing. It's entertaining. The films music is awesome, we hear a bit of it in the trailers but it works really well in the film, despite it seeming to be not suitable to a film like this. It totally pulled off what few would have thought possible jumping that proverbial hurdle. But hey with a film with a raccoon sitting on a moving tree while said raccoon machine guns everything in sight you kind of know that it will be huge. But the point I'm trying to make is that Hollywood finally came up with a good script. It's good visually but for me it was a comedy. I for one laughed more than with many of the so called comedies that came out in the last little while. Disney has reached the high point in Marvel films. So the question remains what now? It might sound strange but Guardians has totally given Avengers 2 a new hurdle to jump over. Marvel films stayed high quality this is true but they didn't have any daring, guts to them and that's what Guardians has. I think the film will be a huge success and that's good for a lot of reasons. Hopefully Disney will continue to be brave with the Marvel rights and will dip into some more interesting projects beside the new Captain America. All in all the film gives what can be expected maybe even more. I was counting on it being a visually pleasing fast paced action sci-fi with humor, but it was a surprise how good the actors were, the characters were and the script was. So it became the best Marvel film and that I wasn't expecting. It surprised me. It can't be less than a 10/10. Ironman, Thor time to get cracking. https://www.youtube.com/user/Videodromeblog</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GotG is a fun time and excels in doing what it does</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, for the ordinary movie-goer, the comic book 'Guardians of the Galaxy' probably will not latch on to anything. Probably because they are the minority and we are used to seeing established Marvel characters take the big screen. However, the movie plays off of the average goer not fully understanding the comics not a story, and people are going to have a fun time with it. The characters do have some progression and development, but it doesn't happen over-scene. The good thing about movies that concentrates on the good guys, means you're going to understand them more by the end of the movie. You will love Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and Chris Pratt as Star-Lord, etc. However, things aren't quite similar for the main antagonist. Ronan the Accuser, is still a strong character, but wasn't given the right amount of time to shine. Placing too much screen time on the main characters made Ronan a second-choice, and that made him less likable and less relevant to the story. Overall, the movie is huge fun for both young and old. It's extremely humorous (probably the most humorous among all of the Marvel Studios movies so far), it has great action, great cinematography, witty dialogues, fun characters and also a booming soundtrack. Otherwise being held back by a very enigmatic villain, the movie is a blast. Believe me, you will want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irreverent, absurd... and fantastic. The best film of the summer - Marvel's best yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was like a sudden, absurd romantic fling. I can pinpoint the exact moment where I realised that this Tuesday night tryst to the nearby London Angel Vue Cinema was well worth the absurd ?8 I dropped on tickets. In typical science fiction fashion, we - the audience - were greeted by the traditional alien landscape - dramatic, mysterious and dusty. Our masked hero (because who else could it be) trumps past wreckage and debris, as though propelled forward by the dramatic, ambient score. He walks with near valiant hesitance into the strange, monstrous edifice before him, and gazes into the echoing, damp gloom of the room beyond.And then he puts in his headphones, a song from my childhood comes on, Starlord starts bobbing his head? and magic happens.I'm in love with Guardians of the Galaxy. I'm absolutely, madly in love with this film.It didn't take long for this reviewer to fall head over heels with this modern take on the Marvel comics of the same name (which span across a strange, complicated history from 1969 to the present day). And this isn't the first indication of the company's genius - from over nine, interweaving and interrelated films to an ABC T.V. series, Marvel has proved itself as a powerhouse. But this film steps away from that carefully crafted "cineverse" into completely uncharted territory - the "final frontier," if you will (for any Trekkies out there). The Guardians that audiences around the world are familiar with only made themselves apparent in 2008 - a mere six years ago. In contrast to the well-worn faces of Captain America, Iron Man, Thor and the Hulk, the Guardians were total noobs.But that certainly didn't stop James Gunn's hilarious, jaw-dropping, entertaining and irreverent leap into Marvel's cineverse from becoming one of the best films of the entire year. And this isn't drawn back to one aspect, but all - the casting, to the characters, to the plot, to the script and action? everything about Guardians of the Galaxy screamed success.And that brings us back to the film's first scene - our first introduction to the Guardian-verse, and our first glimpse at our offbeat, eccentric hero, Peter Quill, wonderfully portrayed by Maui- bum-turned-Hollywood-sensation, Chris Pratt. After his first burst of "pelvic sorcery," it was obvious to anyone that Pratt had become a movie star - not just that funny dude from Parks and Recreation, but Starlord. And that's not all; take a look at the Guardian team - green-skinned assassin, Gamora (played by space badass Zoe Saldana), tattooed and literal brute, Drax the Destroyer (in David Bautista's role of a lifetime), pyromaniac raccoon, Rocket (voiced by an almost unrecognisable Bradley Cooper), and adorable - terrifying - tree man, Groot (Vin Diesel, who practically reprised his role from The Iron Giant). Yes, you heard that right - a green person, a space Hulk, a trigger happy racoon? and a talking tree.That's what we're handling here, people. A team with a tree.And yet, that's what makes Guardians of the Galaxy so fantastic. Notwithstanding the fantastically filmed action sequences, incredible graphics and tightly knit script and plot, the absolute irreverence and absurdity of the film are what makes it so endearing. The film masterfully leaps from heavy action and dastardly, villainous evil to uproarious, nonsensical one-liners like nobody's business. It's a perfect formula, tried and tested by Marvel in the past and similar franchises (and I'm making another nod to J.J. Abram's Star Trek reboots). And not only that - Guardians of the Galaxy practically laughs at itself with every Footloose reference, and asks the audience to join along with them. It's not nearly as dark, complex and intense as Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, nor does it have the jaw-dropping (again, dark) destruction of DC Comic's Man of Steel (and upcoming Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice). but that's what Marvel's all about - superhero action-y stuff, but with the fun? and with the human.But notice one thing so far - what about the plot? Isn't that what makes the movie so good - a great plot? Well, in truth, there's not really a lot to get into; it's your typical superhero plot scheme. A group of miscreants - led by the hunky, endearing "bad boy" human - band together to stop evil - led by extremist Ronan (masterfully played by a reviewer favourite, Lee Pace) and his companion turned half-robotic sidekick, Nebula (the wonderful Karen Gillan) from completely destroying the galaxy. But the thing is, Guardians of the Galaxy didn't need to make itself any more unique than it already is - it didn't need to create a new, original plot (nigh impossible nowadays - curses, Hitchcock!). The plot is used and worn, been there and done that. The difference, then - and the reason why I would gladly drop another ridiculous ?8 on a ticket again - is, as according to The Huffington Post - "all in the execution."Guardians of the Galaxy, in all of its cheek, quirkiness and downright daring, has quickly found its way into the hearts of fanboys and fangirls worldwide. It was Marvel's biggest risk yet? and it was a risk that absolutely paid off (and not just in the big bucks). There's no limit to the amount of magic that Marvel is able to create - and there's no limit to where Guardians of the Galaxy can head in the future!Surrender, earthlings, and step aside Avengers - the Guardians are here, and they're here to stay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know much about this film other than it was based on a Marvel comic and characters, and it was doubly mysterious to me since I had given up comic books right right after high school and did not know any of the characters or storyline at all.But I must say, if you're a Marvel fan, this is Marvel, through and through. The characters are hip, loose, funny, heroic yet very irreverent and anti-authoritarian, exactly what I used to love about the Marvel characters from my youth. Each main character has strengths and weaknesses, dark or mysterious pasts and courageous and lovable spirits that endear them to you instantly. The casting is spot on too, with each actor, including the appropriately cartoonish villains, inhabiting their on-screen characters fully and genuinely.Look, this is a comic book, nothing more, nothing less. But it's a *great* comic book, with great scenes, great visual effects, great soundtrack (especially if you're of that generation, which I am), a neat storyline and characters you can care about and root for. What more can you ask for? I loved it.</fullReview>

There are fisticuffs back and forth with those who claim to work for justice. The film is dark, brooding, intense and most of all depressing. Great performances help to enhance this amazing story of friendship and violence. It's an amazing work and everything I had hoped for.

This movie was amazing from beginning to end. A few lulls as we had character back-stories revealed. I loved this movie. It had just the right mix of action, drama, comedy, and sci-fi. It makes me look forward to the next one. Rocket is probably my favorite which I think everyone who has seen would agree. From one liners to full on action.... Rocket Rocks! Chris Pratt did an amazing job pulling this band of misfits together. They kind of become the family over that he was taken away from. By the way, I never knew that you could say so much with only 3 words "I am Groot" So much character from 3 words. From his first intro, to his death, and then resurrection "I am Groot" made us all love him even more. I could go on and on, but get to the theater and see this movie quick.... It's A-m-a-z-i-n-g!

		<fullReview>"Guardians of the Galaxy" was never on my list of movies that I want to see in 2014 because I wasn't too crazy on the marketing that they putted for the movie, but I did give it a fair shake by going into low expectations like the "TMNT" reboot that I have just reviewed today (check it out), and was actually really enjoying it. The "TMNT" reboot was okay and it did entertained me, but I was really entertained by this one more than the "TMNT" reboot. As you read you this review there could be some little spoilers. So here it is: I actually did had a fun time seeing this movie in theaters, and I did thought it was funny. The cast in this movie like Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, and such were all pretty good in their own roles. The action in this movie are very well done, but I don't think they are the greatest or shall I say epic. I thought it did a pretty good by telling story along with the characters that I need to know about. James Gunn has done a fine job on directing movie, and did told a very good story. The special effects in the movie are actually very fascinating to look at. The music by Tyler Bates was fine, but I don't think it is really that memorable or one of those movies scores that I would listen to; the used of 1970's soundtrack really does work for the movie, and there could be some that many other people that love 70's music would pretty much like this movie. Although, I don't think its Marvel's best comic book movie because I am still sticking up with "X-Men: Days of Future Past" as not only Marvel's best, but the best comic book movie of 2014. The humor in this movie is really funny, but it's not really laugh out loud hilarious. Also, the villain in this movie was weak, and not really the best villain that I have seen in a Marvel movie because I have seen better villains in other Marvel movies. Also, during the post credit scene, I was actually surprised to see a Howard the Duck cameo which I think that Marvel might make a legitimate reboot of the character, and do things right than the original 1986 movie which I am going to review that after doing a review of "Guardians of the Galaxy." Overall, it is a fun comic book movie and I think you would enjoy it too. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Light years from Earth, 26 years after being abducted, Peter Quill finds himself the prime target of a manhunt after discovering an orb wanted by Ronan the Accuser. Guardians of the Galaxy was my second most anticipated movie of 2014 after X-Men: Days of Future Past . As a huge Marvel and Sci-Fi fan I've loved watching Star Trek, 2001, Firefly and of course Star Wars. I also always hoped Marvel Studios to run into their cosmic universe someday. There are been plenty of Sci-Fi movies to keep me entertained and to charge my imagination but I was waiting for Cosmic Marvel more than anything. The Asgardian Realms haven't really counted as they were cool but they use magic mainly as a super science. They were getting there with The Battle of New-York in The Avengers and this big hole in the sky above Manhattan spewing out Aliens. Now with Guardians of the Galaxy we're talking about all details of a stunningly beautiful spacecraft. That beautiful and ALIVE! This film is a celebration of the form and I never believed I'd ever get to see a movie quite like what James Gunn dished out with this one. GoG takes Marvel cinematic Universe and open it up to a galactic scale. It takes us to corners of space that only the truest Marvel fans knew even existed; which are very rich as extraordinary stories could be told there. This is probably why people could more easily identify with it as it's not 100% an American movie, it could be appreciated in a global scale as it even doesn't take place on Earth (for the most part it's all very Alien). James Gunn suitably created a world which hearken back to the past with bright colours of all Pop Sci-Fi movies like Forbidden Planet but then also being edgy, looking forward, being dirty and real in any way that other movies haven't been in that genre. It's also kind of a gamble for Marvel as those characters are not as well known as Captain America, Iron Man, Thor or Hulk. They are a bunch of losers who think they're bad and realize along the process that they're good. This Space Opera Odyssey is different from everything they've done before but in the same time it still feels like any other Marvel movie with a same humor, action, scope and sense of stakes. GoG is the holding truth to that tradition. This film is everything I wanted it to be! Read more at http://offscreenreviews.blogspot.fr/2014/08/guardians-of-galaxy.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what an experience it was! I went to see the movie with some friends and just expected some cool action scenes, a decent story and a couple of laughs here and there. While correct on the first 2 things, I totally underestimated the 3rd one. Honestly, I am blown away by the unexpected tsunami of comedy and fun in this movie. Me and my friends literally giggled the whole time while returning to our homes after watching it. That's not to say that movie lacks in other departments, but the fun element is so strong and 'on the spot' it kind of eclipses other parts. The movie starts with a 8-9 year old Peter Quill in a brief but tragic back story. Fast forward to 25 years and he is now a galactic thief who calls himself 'The Star Lord'. Very soon, we are introduced to Groot, Rocket, Gamora and Drax. They all(except Drax) are pursuing a mysterious Orb first stolen by Quill and finally taken away by Ronan to achieve his evil plans. Eventually, all 5 of them join forces so that they can defeat Ronan and put that Orb somewhere safe. Although I have never read or heard about these characters but 30 minutes into the movie and I can write 5 qualities of each. The characterization is superb and the way each character slowly amalgamates into the script is quite amazing. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) as the main protagonist is a very likable, he is an outlaw but kind hearted too. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) is both deadly and beautiful at the same time. Groot (Vin Diesel), although doesn't have much to speak has its moments in the movie. Drax(Batista) is shown to be big on anger and small on the logic but arguably, Rocket the Raccoon(voiced by Bradley Cooper) is the funniest of them all not to mention also a trigger happy pervert. In the later parts of the movie there comes a time when just looking at his face, the whole movie theater starts laughing.I can easily say that its one of the best action-adventure-comedies I have ever seen in a while and IMHO certainly better than Avengers and Iron Man. Hardly a minute passed by when I didn't break into a laugh. Visually too, it is a stunner, while CGI is not necessarily an industry best but it worked beautifully. Alien planets, ships and creatures looked imaginative and fresh. For a Marvel fan it cant get better than this and the icing on the cake are subtle plot themes which connects the dot between this and the prior Marvel movies. I totally recommend this movie to anyone who wants to pass 2 hours of his life in the best possible way :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing short of amazing...!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. CGI in this film was super, there's nothing I hate more than too much CGI in a film but it was so good in Guardians that I was completely lost in it. Never have a seen space look so good, the battles were incredible and Groot and Rocket never looked out of place. Gunn is the perfect director for this, his tone, his balance of comedy, action and emotion blended perfectly and directing GOTG would have been no easy job. DC are still trying hard to get Justice League going, Marvel just made a film with a talking tree and Raccoon and it was AWESOME!!! Great expectations before the film, definitely, and they really paid off. Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the best Marvel films to date, and a really good sci-fi at that too. The film is strong on so many levels, outstanding characters, great worlds, is emotional and humorous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly excellent film that proves just how good Marvel truly is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it was revealed that marvel were making guardians of the galaxy everyone around the world was surprised and that is probably why this is one of the biggest surprises in film history as this film is excellent. The premise of the film sees a group of criminals come together come together to take down a fanatical warrior who plans to destroy a planet. Chris Pratt was really a big of an unknown when he was cast in this role but he is fantastic he is really funny and charismatic which makes you really like his character in this film. Zoe saldana plays the assassin gamora in this film and her back story in this film is incredible and she was great in the action scenes that readymade her character cool. Dave bautista is one of the best wrestlers of recent memory but nobody could believe just how good an actor he truly is. He was so awesome as drax the destroyer because he managed to get across the dramatic part of his character and also had so much humour to him in this film. Vin diesel voices the big tree groot in this film and his character was just plain awesome in this film with the visuals being fantastic and the character being so lovable. We then get to the show stealer with Bradley Cooper as rocket raccoon and he is one of the best characters I have seen in recent memory. He is quick witted and hilarious but he also had some layers to him that made him an interesting character in this fun film. When I first watched this film I thought Ronan was a weak villain but now I get his motivations and his back story I think he is a decent enough villain for this first film because the film is all about the guardians. The story of this film is pretty simple but it works the director didn't try and overcomplicate things, he made it simple and relied on the characters to make this film cool. The script is fantastic with all the humour and drama in it making this film feel alive and unique in its script. The style of this film is awesome and it felt like the perfect mid of star wars and star trek which I am a a big fan of. Also the soundtrack isn't usually something I would mention but it is amazing in this film. Overall this film was an absolutely huge surprise because nobody expected the highest quality but this film delivered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie Worth Grooting For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie with what I thought were bloated expectations. I figured the best parts were injected into the trailers and the rest of the movie would be a disappointing failure. Boy was I wrong. I actually got more than what I bargained for. Not only was the movie entertaining and fast paced, it was really funny. The CGI effects were tastefully infused and not overwhelming. Normally the overuse of CGI is employed to keep rotten movies out of the trash-heap. Unlike other "Marvel" adventures, the bygone methodologies embraced by 'Guardians', rendered CGI as not really being needed. Whenever movies embrace 'old school' techniques, high qualities in acting, writing, directing and scoring can really shine. Don't get me wrong, "Guardians of Galaxy" did have its fare share of special effects ? but they did not take center-stage. This is one 'Marvel' movie I will see again. And when the sequel is made, I have less of a problem paying to see "Part II" than some of the other dribble out there. One of the best this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. This was a very funny and captivating movie, at least for me. I even took my 11 year old with me, and he loved it. We were laughing the whole time. The humour in this movie was somewhat peculiar but very funny and hilarious nonetheless. It's a kind that I haven't seen in any other movies so far. Maybe we could call it a new kind of humour. The story and the characters kind of give off a family feeling too, specially at the end, even though it's all explosions and gun shots(or at least that's what we expected). One of the funniest movies I've seen in the past year along with 22 Jump Street. I would definitely go see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cosmic blast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Guardians of the Galaxy Review From the espionage thriller that was Captain America: The Winter Soldier to this colorful and old-school sci-fi epic, the studio behind these movies has earned its name, as a lot of its movies have been marvelously fun and varied experiences.This year's Guardians of the Galaxy, while being silly and sometimes having its main characters be hilariously oblivious to everything around them, manages to be the most optimistic and funniest of all Marvel movies to date. And that must be something very rewarding for director James Gunn.So after what may be one of the best title screens and character introductions of this decade, Peter Quill, also known as Star-Lord, retrieves a mysterious sphere that, he later discovers, contains one of the six powerful infinity gems. Quill then arrives on Xandar where, after a quick and conflictive encounter, he and three other criminals, which include the greenish assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a genetically engineered talking raccoon who's great at being a smartass called Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and his more organic "Chewbacca type" companion called Groot (Vin Diesel), all get arrested and sent to the prison facility The Kyln. There they meet Drax (Dave Bautista) and reluctantly form their own personal team of misfits to escape the prison and eventually try to save the galaxy by keeping the infinity gem from falling into the wrong hands, these being Ronan the Accuser's hands.The main plot may sound very familiar and in a way it kind of is your basic super hero plot. It has the powerful MacGuffin, the evil villain and the hard time adapting team of good guys.But James Gunn uses these classic plot points as his workbench to build one of the most unique summer blockbusters we've seen in a while. It also surprised me how they dived face first into the Thanos content and I think that will please many people who have been waiting to see what that is all about since his side-nose was shown in The Avengers Like Groot himself, the story branches out and focuses in characterizing the five awesome multifaceted characters that form part of the main team and creates some very unique and sometimes heartwarming bonds and interactions between each of the members. From Rocket's inner struggles to Drax's very literal way of thinking, every single one of the five members gets his or her spotlight through the course of the film.For example if you said Gamora or Groot where your favorite characters I would totally understand it because of how unique every single one of them is. Aside from how well their archs are written the performances given by their respective actors are all great. Even Rocket's voice-acting by Bradley Cooper was fantastically weird and never did I picture Bradley behind a mic. The same goes for Vin Diesel's Groot who with very few lines felt very present in the mixture.But the one that surprised me the most may be Batista as Drax the Destroyer. As a wrestler transformed into an actor (you may say his change was a little bit "draxtical" ;) ), I never had many expectations for him, but he delivered every single line with hystericaly perfect timing making me and many others laugh out loud.Another thing to point out is how perfect the producers used their budget. A balance between CGI and practical effects was well established and the two of them matched perfectly, as both where equally colorful and vivid. Quill's ship, The Milano, looked freaking awesome, and as well as the prison and other various locations it was an actual set which is amazing. It actually feels like a throwback to the more old-school, bright and colorful sci-fi movies of the 70's. But mixing that with the amazing technology they used for the space scenes, the dog fights and the characters of Groot and Rocket, which are so well realized you do see them as being a talking tree and a racoon and not some animated blob hoping around, it's more than we could ever ask for. Good job Marvel.There is also an amazing scene in the movie, which I won't spoil, that takes place in space and James Gunn used a very special technique for the depiction of zero gravity that I had never seen before and it looked f*cking awesome as hell. Very creative too.The only gripes I have with it are the secondary characters. They didn't have much relevance in the plot even the main villain was kind of just there to give the characters a cause. The one that I thought had some funny scenes and was relevant aside from the Guardians was Michael Rooker's Yondu. He had a a very funny scene in a shop with James Gunn's brother Sean Gunn who played his kind of sidekick Kraglin. But aside from him everything girates around the Guardians on purpose and they have it well deserved.Heart-warming, extremely fun and freaking hilarious, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of Marvel's best and for many it may be the best. Not in many summer blockbusters do you get to have this much fun laughing out loud and caring for every single one of the main characters. This movie definitely deserves this 9.5 out of 10.Stay awesome people!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a spectacle to watch. It does not have an epic story, its not The Dark Knight or star wars. But something about this movie was good, its an experience I will never forget. It was like watching Star wars in the theater for the first time.....coming out of the theatres and falling in love with space. I had the same feeling when I walked out of this movie. I fell in love with space again. I would recommend people to watch this while its still in the theatres.

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy is a movie made for me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing how this was made for mass audiences, yet I feel that it was specifically made for me. Let's break it down.1. It's a space opera, and I'm a sucker for Star Wars, or anything similar to Star Wars. I even got enjoyment out of the prequel trilogy. And GotG pulls off this genre very well.2. It's like a western. Witty and gritty. It's humorous at times, serious at others. And they both have balance. It's as goofy as it is exciting. This is why many people are comparing it to the original Star Wars movie. Walk into the wrong bar, lose an arm. Or, in this case, a leg or an eye.3. The music. This was one of the biggest selling points for me. 80s pop music out of nowhere?! That's something you'll only see in a Scorsese or Tarantino movie. And it works amazingly good in this movie. Now, Blue Swede's 'Hooked on a Feeling' is featured in two of my favorite movies of all time, the other one being 'Reservoir Dogs'.4. It tries to funny, and it actually works. There are movies which are effortlessly funny. There are movies which try so hard to be funny, that they fail miserably. And then there's Guardians of the Galaxy. A movie that takes effort in almost every other line to make you laugh. And yes, I can assure you, for half the movie, I was laughing out loud. From slapstick to references to pop culture to references to fine art and literature to purely genuinely funny dialogue, GotG has it all. And it works.5. It instills hope in me for future comic-book movies. Since when did comic-book movies become deathly serious?! I guess we'll have to blame Christopher Nolan's masterful Dark Knight Trilogy; three serious movies about a superhero who is, at his core, serious. That's why it works there. I don't see how we are supposed to take a guy in a red cape and a blue super-suit, with a huge 'S' in the middle, seriously (one of my quips about last year's Man of Steel). Guardians of the Galaxy, thankfully, is different. It's dark at times, but it's uproariously funny at others. Who said superhero movies can't have humor in them?!6. It instills hope in me for the producers about to produce three of the most anticipated movies this decade: The new Star Wars Trilogy. Disney proved with this movie (and, of course, all the other Marvel movies), that it doesn't tone much down for children when it's distributing movies made by other studios. GotG is perhaps the greatest example of this. J.J. Abrams is a great director, and if the new Star Wars movie is anything similar to this, I think us Star Wars fans are in for a massively satisfying Star Wars experience, one that will not only surpass the prequels, but at least meet, if not surpass, the standards of the original Star Wars Trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy is also definitely one of the most quotable movies I have ever seen. It's bound to be a cult classic, as well as a big blockbuster (as we can already see!). There is some great acting all around as well, I can't really even pinpoint which of the Guardians made me laugh the most.And, I know this last part seems far-fetched, but Guardians of the Galaxy might actually win an Oscar.Hear me out here: an Oscar for Best Make-Up. I'm dead serious. The make- up guys did an incredible job with Guardians of the Galaxy.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy is my new favorite comic-book movie, new favorite Marvel movie, heck, it's even one of my favorite films of all time. Right up there with Star Wars. Although a little bit below. Because, come on, it's Star Wars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film of the Year (2014)?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My new favourite film of the year so far - Guardians of the Galaxy! I thought this may have been a bridge too far for Marvel, but yet again they've hit the mark. The acting is extremely well executed throughout, the special effects (as you may imagine) are stunningly fantastic, without being overbearing. It has more humour than its predecessor's - which provides welcome relief without becoming corny or ruining the plot. There's some genuinely funny laugh out loud moments. They've certainly got the mix completely right. The action scenes are thoroughly engrossing; you immediately have empathy for the characters and the situation they're facing. I'm still trying to determine who stole the show..? This film has raised the benchmark and is superbly crafted. A thrilling fun filled blockbuster that's proved more than worthy to have a (now much awaited) sequel! Go see this movie... (8.5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misfits of science fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Virtually unknown beyond the confines of comic book fandom (and not widely known there), writer/director James Gunn's 'Guardian's of the Galaxy' is the first real test of the Marvel/Disney juggernaut. A test that it passes with flying colors.Not merely content to be some B-list 'Avengers' knock-off, 'GotG' boldly marches--and sometimes dances--to the beat of its own drum machine. Its ragtag group of heroes are quirky misfits that are like puzzle pieces; odd and abstract alone, but once they're fit together, they form a refreshingly fun and agenda-free picture that delivers the best pure entertainment I've seen since... well, since Marvel/Disney's 'The Avengers'.Bursting with fun, action and a surprising amount of heart, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is a cinematic sugar rush that also manages to have nutritional value. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do mean film, if you go into this thinking it's just an action packed movie. You'd be somewhat wrong in a great way. Guardians Of The Galaxy has everything for everyone. You'll laugh, you might cry, and you'll be stunned by the acting from the whole cast. The voice acting is spot on, which just adds onto this. The pacing of the whole film just feels right. There is comedy for everyone also, there are all the low-brow punches and kicks. Then there is the witty jokes only half of the audience will get. The soundtrack is spot on, so much that you can't wait till the next song comes on. The CGI is just beautiful, from space scenes to the characters themselves.So I highly recommend Guardians Of The Galaxy, for you and the whole family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart, Sassy, Witty Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I was utterly unfamiliar with the source material, but Gunn wrote two films I adore: the remake of Dawn of the Dead (2004) and then Slither (2006). I expected a Marvel action film. I did not expect an utterly hilarious, delightful, and overwhelmingly charming action film. Truly, I haven't had this much fun at the movies since at least Pacific Rim. The cast is superb, from Chris Pratt to Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper to Karen Gillan (Amy Pond in Doctor Who). Indeed, Gillan was a truly unexpected gem as Nebula (and she actually shaved her head for the role!). She might even have stolen the show for me, if not for Cooper's portrayal of Rocket, the genetically altered, cybernetic enhanced raccoon. This movie was breathtakingly funny, and the visuals were, to say the least, stunning. The space battles, the splendid makeup, the fully realized environments. I could go on and on. Fans of Farscape will, I think, see a lot of John Crichton in Chris Pratt's bumbling, exasperated "Star Lord." With just a dash of Malcolm Reynolds. And that's only the tip of the cultural-reference iceberg. This is a smart, sassy, witty film, and it's utterly over-the-top ridiculous. And sexy. It might wind up being my favorite film of the year. Oh! And the 1970s soundtrack, an inspired touch. Oh! And a cameo by my favorite comic book character ever!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hooked On A Feeling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this movie had more of a comic book feel to it than some of the other Marvel films, it was spectacular as always. The very first scene had me crying, it didn't take more than five minutes. They found an absolutely amazing child actor to play young Peter Quill, that kid has a great career ahead of him. The story then jumps 26 years into the future, and it just gets better from there on. Between Peter's sassy immaturity, the non-human's who are often oblivious to the meanings of his comments, and the more serious moments, I was either laughing, completely captivated, or crying through the entire thing. The writers manage to make you care about all of the Guardians as they weave in excellent character development, friendships, and backstories while providing the audience with a masterpiece filled with enough explosions and sci-fi-ness to keep the fangirls and boys glued to their seats. Oh yes, and the classic rock is awesome.I give it 10/10 (for Star-Lord's dancing, if nothing else), go see it as soon as you possibly can.

		<shortDescription>"Why would you want to save the galaxy?" "Because I'm one of the idiots who lives in it!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back when Marvel kicked in Phase 1 of its cinematic universe, we all knew who Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America were. All these films were destined to be hits to some degree. But...the Guardians of the Galaxy? Who are these a-holes? If you're like me and never read comics, you may be asking the same question. Seriously, a gun-totting raccoon? A walking tree? David Bautista? WTF? If box office numbers are any indication, the risk paid off tremendously. The film wastes little time in plunging the audience into the deep end of the most outlandish and far-out reaches of the Marvel universe. From the desolate ruins of an abandoned planet to the thriving heart of an interstellar civilization, this space-faring adventure cuts across colorful nebulae and imaginative worlds, the likes of which have only ever been topped by the Star Wars universe. The film has no shortage of action, as characters fight with their fists, knives, and futuristic guns against an onslaught of bad guys. There is a huge all-out battle in the end, with thousands of space ships filling up the screen. In between the exciting parts, the film moves fast and fluidly with plenty of spot-on comedy, and just enough drama to give the characters a little more depth.The story covers pretty basic ground, using the same old type of Macguffin that Avengers and Thor: The Dark World used. The villain of this film is a pretty flat, one-dimensional fellow who's best remembered for his presence, and little more. What makes this film stand out will be the protagonists. Peter Quill (the self-proclaimed "Star-Lord") has charm, but thanks to the film's opening scene, he provides an emotional anchor we can all latch onto. Drax is a warrior driven by vengeance, but is so blunt that he can't comprehend metaphors, and hilarity ensues. Gamora is a fierce fighter as well with an allure of her own. Rocket is a hard-drinking gun-happy raccoon with attitude. Groot is a walking tree, who can kick some butt, but also provides some of the most lovable moments. This whole gang is very much in the same vein of space outlaws as in Firefly or The Cowboy Bebop; each character provides enough emotional investment and attention so that they stand out and become heroes we can root for, no matter how bizarre or unlikely this union seems. The film is also loaded with a plethora of side characters, who all stand out in their own ways, to the point where I wished they could have had more to them (especially Thanos, who's obviously going to be a major player somewhere down the line; Nebula, who I thought was cooler than anything; the Collector, who's not given that much to do here; and Yondu, who clearly shares a history with Quill, but it's hard to tell where his loyalty is). Through the character interactions, the whole team emerges as a dysfunctional crew that stands up to tyranny in their own rebellious way, and their evolution from bickering individuals to literal Guardians of the Galaxy is quite the fun trip.This film is crafted with solid and precise photography and editing. Acting is top-notch; you'd probably never expect much from this cast, but everybody does their best to make the characters stand out. Chris Pratt is not too shabby as the main hero; I enjoyed watching Zoe Saldana; Dave Bautista's performance is surprisingly solid; voices by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel get the job done well. Everybody else contributes admirably. Writing is pretty good. This production spares no expense on the outlandish and imaginative sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is decent.Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the most well-rounded blockbusters since Marvel's own Avengers. It balances action, comedy, and storytelling very well. It defies all the odds and presents this obscure group of misfits as a thrilling new franchise for the masses..5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Content: Very Good | Film: Very Good)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PlotPeter Quill (Chris Pratt) is exploring a planet and finds a sphere that he plans to sell for a few bucks, but he is not the only one who is looking for it. Little does he know that this sphere contains god-like power that could destroy a planet. While he is transporting this object he is detained by the authorities and incarcerated with Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Groot (Vin Diesel) and Rocket (Bradley Cooper). Together they escape prison, but lose the almighty sphere. Now it is a race against time and space to stop a madman before he can extinguish countless lives in an instant.Character DevelopmentPeter Quill does development slightly, which is to say there is a basic hand-off from the storytelling in beginning of the story to the end. A very clever device, where some of those dots were connected and where some of them were not, but the Peter Quill character doesn't have a lot going on below the surface. None of the characters really did. These are some pretty sketchy individuals, which were far more animated by the actors playing them than what is written about them. They seem to have been given just enough motivation to get from scene to scene.ActingTwo of the main characters are computer generated and look as good as the other three that are played by human begins. Zoe Saldana is an odd addition to the human side because she played a digital character in Avatar (2009). Mostly everyone's acting was either played for laughs or for comic book violence, complete with dull weapons and no blood.OverviewI think we have reached a point in filmmaking where you can have CGI characters without them looking like CGI characters. In this film you are going to know right away that the talking raccoon isn't real, but in this film it is made to look real and far more enjoyable to watch than other CGI characters that have spent far too long on the screen. The digital characters in this film seemed like they fit in with the rest of the cast mostly because this film didn't take anything seriously. It is far easier to have a talking tree and talking raccoon with the rest of your cast when your protagonist is a stand up comic.</fullReview>

It was funny,it was serious,it was campy but most of all it was just fun. I can't remember the last time I had such a good time at the movie theater. If you like Firefly,Star Wars or Star Trek you should enjoy it. Chris Pratt was awesome as Peter Quill. Rocket was a nice surprise,Groot also was wonderful. Gamora was wonderful too.At no point in the movie was I bored. It was great to get some Thanos screen time.Many people were saying this movie was a big risk and well this "risk" sure won.

		<fullReview>I just saw GOTG last weekend.It was the best movie of Marvel Cinematic Universe until now.Like other recent Marvel films, Guardians of the Galaxy has a very good mix between the content and images.Visual effect of Guardians of the Galaxy is awesome.3D effect is impressive,especially the fight and space scenes.The action scenes is very good. There are all kinds:the spacecraft arrayed,Shooting and the violently combat. All are standard staging.And the last thing to be said about the Guardians of the Galaxy is extremely quality music.All songs in the movie are very great.Screenplay has a moderate emotional.Storie of Guardians of the Galaxy is enough, not too long or too short. Movies opening is brief, quite emotional. Rhythm of the film does not so quickly that the viewer does not keep up. After the introduction of each character, scene, the climax gradually appear continuously until the end of the film.Generally,everyone should go to the cinema and watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real good, could have been great with more Gamora</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this movie on 8/3/2104 and it was pretty good. I plan on adding it to my movie collection. It would have been great if they had had Gamora in a topless scene like they did Star-Lord but it appears that only the actors are allowed/required to go half naked or more in a movie. Now I'm not calling for porn but if the arrival scene at the prison called for Star-Lord to be shown half naked from various angles they should have done the exact same views and angles on Gamora. I also noticed typically (scene with Stan Lee) that if a much older man is talking to a younger female he's called a perv but when it's the other way around they do everything but give the woman an award. Setting all double standards aside it was real good. Great music and special effects with good doses of humor. I loved the headgear and suit that Star-Lord had. I liked that Star-Lord and Gamora got together and was surprised at the end part dealing with Star-Lord. Also if you can stand sitting thru all the credits there's a little scene at the very end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Up to this point, Marvel Studios didn't have it easy, but they certainly had an advantage. Mining its most popular characters to create a cinematic universe filled with heroes and villains, the fantastic highlights of icons such as Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man filled the screen with familiar moves of derring-do and outrageous power. But now it's time for a change, with the creative team turning their sights on "Guardians of the Galaxy," a relatively unknown property that traditionally earthbound action into deep space. It's a gamble that pays off splendidly for Marvel, who not only strike gold with this oddball collection of adventurers, but manage to create one of the most satisfying pictures of the series. Abducted from Earth as an emotionally wrecked child, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) has transformed into an intergalactic scavenger nicknamed Star-Lord, working for the Ravagers, led by Yondu (Michael Rooker). Coming across an orb that houses a source of unimaginable power, Peter is instantly caught up in trouble when Gamora (Zoe Saldana), adopted daughter of the evil king Thanos (Josh Brolin), sets out to retrieve the discovery, while bounty hunters Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a genetically engineered raccoon, and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), a tree-like humanoid, hope to score big by capturing Peter. Soon teamed with Drax (Dave Bautista), a brute out for revenge, the team is forced to work together when a greater threat in Ronan (Lee Pace), a rogue in league with Thanos, arises, out to steal the orb and crush his enemies with assistance from Nebula (Karen Gillan). While Marvel has become home to unusual creative participants, hiring James Gunn to co- script/direct "Guardians of the Galaxy" is one of their biggest head-scratchers. Gunn bring an unusual sensibility to the project, mixing his love for oddball, Troma-style humor and cinematic textures into a traditional arc of heroism, scored with a tastefully selected mixtape of '70s and '80s rock hits stored on Peter's beloved walkman -- his last connection to a tragic time on Earth, and a personal item he risks his life to protect. While Gunn has the potential to get a little carried away with geek-bait elements, his work here is refreshingly measured and purposed, out to generate a thrilling Marvel adaptation while preserving the idiosyncrasy that separates the Guardians from their more regal brethren. The movie is more comical, taking its lead from Peter's impish sense of humor and the barbed interplay among the characters, allowing Gunn to play to his strengths as a jester while still managing the slightly Lucasian action elevation the rest of the feature embraces wholeheartedly. Perhaps the biggest question mark of "Guardians of the Galaxy" is its impenetrability, being the first of the films to truly pull from an obscure corner of the comic book realm, steeped in far away worlds, layers of villainy, galactic feuds, alien tech, and complex character connection. Mercifully, Gunn has anticipated such a cross-eyed reaction, and for those who spent their formative years doing something other than reading comic books, "Guardians of the Galaxy" remains blissfully accessible, with clear goals laid out for the crew, while backstories are handled with care, making sure the viewer understands what drives these personalities into battle and why the heroes develop a bond that transforms them into a powerhouse unit. Dramatic lines are distinct, threats are pure, and the emotional fragility of the crew is sincere, working to communicate the pain that drives a curiosity such as Rocket, who's sick of being dismissed as just an animal, or Drax, who's out to slaughter Ronan after the monster killed his wife and child. Gunn and co- screenwriter Nicole Perlman create a vivid realm that's never swallowed by excess, maintaining pace, awe, and excitement while introducing these rascals in a substantial way. This is exactly how a fantasy franchise should be established. The technical achievements of "Guardians of the Galaxy" are superb, with extraordinary make-up work that provides a semi-practical wonderland of creatures, all rich with textures and detail. Nebula is a particular standout, with her robotic features triumphantly blended with Gillan's human softness. Visual effects are seamless, with Rocket and Groot truly exceptional creations, loaded with personality and fluid movement. In fact, the pair is so much fun to watch, they deserve more screen time in the inevitable sequel, finding the creatures bringing out the best in Cooper and Diesel. Performances are also top-notch, with Pratt agreeably rascally as Peter, remarkably believable in action sequences, and Pace overcoming his normal imprecision to make a mean baddie in Ronan. And Gunn deserves a parade for pulling something substantial out of Bautista, who presents the movie with blunt force and a few askew comedic beats. John C. Reilly, Glenn Close, and Benicio del Toro (playing The Collector, a flamboyant keeper of intergalactic powers) also make appearances. "Guardians of the Galaxy" keeps to Marvel traditions, including an enormous, elongated third act showdown between good and evil, helping the film achieve its quota of explosions and panicked reactions. Shockingly, Gunn doesn't lose control of the movie. He digs into the potential of the piece, delivering a rip-roaring space saga with defined punctuation, lovable characters, and a mission that carries through the entire effort. It's balanced work and enormous fun, giving all the brand name superheroes a run for their money now that Marvel has cleared a path for the little guys to shine on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is EVERYTHING the new Star Wars should have been - space-trucking drama and fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my mind, THIS is the very best comic adaptation on film to date - it blows away everything else. Of course, I admit I am biased because it also brings to the screen the fantastic, over-geared and outright psychedelic cosmic scene of the Marvel universe - this is the house built by Lee, Kirby and especially Starlin.This is and has always been high fantasy/space opera in the purest form - and the movie pulls it off perfectly. But with a very intelligent twist, it also mixes in self-deprecating humor and doesn't take itself overly serious - laughter and drama goes hand in hand. The cast itself walks right off the comic book pages - having grown up with Adam Warlock (I know - not in the movie but a lot of his supporting cast is) it was a thrill to see Gamora, Thanos, Drax and Ronan the Acuser come to life and be just perfect. Add to this Groot and Rocket - who blends right into the scenery and you forget they are CGI after a few minutes - and of course Peter Quill himself and you have dynamite waiting to blow.The visuals are top notch, the main characters impeccable, the supporting cast flawless and sometimes handled by some serious A-listers like Benicio Del Toro and Glenn Close to name a few, the story line is almost classic Marvel adventure (bad guy wants to blow up universe - misfits band together - chaos and hilarity ensues - but it works and it evokes a feeling that THIS is what the prequel Star Wars movies should have been. Fun, drama, lovable rogues, CGI characters that have heart and a gleam in the eye and smile on the lip as everything goes to hell in a hand basket.This movie has the wide-eyed wonder at high-fantasy space adventure fully intact and it shows.I can't recall the last time I saw a movie where people spontaneously clapped and laughed at the same time - but this one pulls it off - that alone makes it worth an admission ticket :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is by far the most pleasant surprise you can get at a movie theater. With its clever script and amazing performances by the entire cast, Guardians of the Galaxy has become a reminder to all fans and non alike that a touch of freshness or originality can still be given to a classic story known by few, and be exposed as a superb artistic motion picture filled with humor, action, warmth and an amazing cinematography that immediately sends you at light speed to memory lane (if you are in your 30's) as James Gunn accomplishes a marvelous direction combined with a soundtrack of all time classic favorites from the 80's.I cannot remember the last time i had so much fun at a movie theater. No doubt Marvel Studios has done it again! and they continue to prove that they in fact have a clear vision for all that's to come, and that my friends, is a very, very exciting thought. See it in 3D if you can, if not, I am sure 2D is just as good.Marvel; Thank you for a Fantastic 2014!! See you again next year!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since Star Wars was released in 11977 people in the industry as well as fans have predicted the next franchise like it. This one may have come the closest to it. It a marketing dream. I see all kinds of toys video games, cartoons, rides etc. coming from this movie. I am also sure there will be at least one sequel, if not an entire new franchise. It has the feel of Star Wars or it made me feel like I felt when I saw movies like that as a kid. It also kind of reminded me of Indiana Jones and Back to the Future. Special FX are certainly nice in a movie, but FX are a dime a dozen these days. I want a good plot too, so it's nice to see movie that has the best of both worlds. It is amazing looking in all scenes. It's funny and fun. It's touching and will getting you a little teary eyed at points. It's really exciting. That's why I think it will make good rides and video games. The battle scenes are stunning. I looked on the Run Pee app and it said there is really no place in this movie that is good to go to the bath room. You'd better go before the movie starts. It has so many cool characters like Rocket and Groot who steal the show and such great actions scenes. It's just a neat concept. Chris Pratt is a human who, as a boy get taken away into space and ends up being a thief. He steels the wrong thing and ends up getting chased all over the galaxy by people who want it and him. He makes enemies and later friends along the way and they form a Scooby gang to try to "save the day" so to speak, mainly from a funky looking war lord named Ronan with some tar or something on his face, who is played so well by Lee Pace. It's also got a great cast and I just love how far Chris Pratt has come. Not only is he funny and lovable, but he's hot too. Bradley Cooper, Vinn Diesel, Zoe Saldona, John C. Reilly, Glenn Close, Batista, Lee Pace and they all do a great job. They really play some silly over the top characters convincingly. I can really tell that all the actors really put themselves into these characters. It is a really witty script. I love the running gag where everyone can't understand human things like metaphors. Batista delivers some great lines with this gag. Finally, I will definitely be getting the soundtrack. It's all great 70's and 80's songs, some of my favorites in fact. I am going to have to re-do my top movies of 2014 to include this one obviously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazingly Good Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy was my most anticipated movie of the summer and I can honestly say it held up to all my expectations and hopes. Every character is hilarious and likable,have great chemistry with their co- stars and large amounts of screen time. The villain is totally creepy as is his daughter in the film, Nebula (played by Karen Gillan). The audience never failed to laugh at the constant comedy and wit. However, the movie isn't all laughs. It is quite serious at points and the actors do an great job in these scenes. The action is very good although if I had one comment it would be that during the final fight the camera shakes around a bit too much, but nothing too serious. The soundtrack is great and so is the Awesome Mix Vol. 1 which consists of a bunch of classic songs which keep with the movie's tone and upbeat attitude. The after credits scene is very short and, (not going to lie) some people might not think it was with the wait. Overall Guardians of the Galaxy was an amazingly fun time and I can't wait to buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Marvel Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Guardians of the Galaxy' is an action-packed film about Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), who unknowingly steals a very powerful orb and after being arrested must band together with a bunch of other outlaws to take down Ronan (Lee Pace) before he destroys the galaxy with the orb's power. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is written and directed by James Gunn, probably best known for writing the live-action 'Scooby-Doo' movie. Gunn has now solidified himself as a great director and writer after his works on 'Guardians of the Galaxy'.I must say I was a bit skeptical going into this film knowing Chris Pratt was the lead role, but I am pleasantly surprised. Prior to 'Guardians of the Galaxy', Pratt was more than likely only known from his role in the show 'Parks and Rec' and other small roles in various comedies. After seeing 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and seeing the performance by Pratt, I can honestly say that he has definitely progressed as an overall actor. It is no wonder Collin Trevorrow had Pratt casted as the lead role in 'Jurassic World'. Pratt's character Star-Lord is going to be one of those iconic characters that you can not see anyone else fulfilling that role. The way Pratt as Star-Lord progressed on film from selfish arrogant thief, to a noble leader is pretty amazing. Pratt's on-screen charisma is great and the way he could go from comedic to serious was pretty great as well. Every other main character in the film (Saldana, Bautista and Pace) did very well in their roles too, but Pratt definitely stole the show and I believe surprised many people.I will say the CGI in this film was pretty spectacular. It is right up there with 'Godzilla' and 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' for best CGI effects of the year. Everything was done so well, you could really feel as if you were in space or on a spacecraft. I am not really a fan of films set in space, but the setting in this film was pretty good and enjoyable. The costume design in this film was great as well as the makeup effects. The cinematography was good, maybe a little better than average. I think most viewers will agree the soundtrack for this movie is pretty epic. All the 70's and 80's music oddly fits well into this movie and offers a fun experience. Along with the soundtrack the score was done very well with this film too.As stated before, Gunn did a great job directing a writing this film. Every line of dialogue was great and the way the characters played out the lines makes the audience go through many emotions. People will be surprised to find that this movie has a lot of heart and feelings to it. Definitely not your average Marvel film.'Guardians of the Galaxy' is a great action-packed film that anyone can enjoy. Thus far, this is the film of the summer. It is a very fun film with great acting, effects and is just so pleasing to the eye. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' gets a well deserving 9/10 stars from me, but given the option, could have received an 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the most intelligent, well thought out, stylish, action-packed, humor-filled films I have ever seen. I have just left the theater and I already want to go back in and watch it again. The film despite being a Marvel action film was loaded with humor that made you laugh out loud. You fall in love with all the characters in the movie and you grow to have a deep connection with all of them in unique ways. This movie will make you tear up, it will make you grab you seat in frustration, it will make you lean back in astonishment, and it will make you scream with laughter. If you are wondering what the movie is about the plot is about an outlaw known across the universe (or so he says) as Starlord or Peter Quill played by Chris Pratt. Quill inadvertently stumbles upon one of the most dangerous devices the galaxy has seen and is chased by the ruthless Ronin who is determined to destroy everything that lives. Quill assembles a motley crew of warriors who are later dubbed the "Guardians of the Galaxy" and they embark on a quest to save everyone and themselves. I don't want to tell you anymore so you can see the movie yourselves but I guarantee you will enjoy the film as much as I did unless you are an emotionless heathen. I give the movie a solid 10/10 as I was highly entertained the full duration of the film and never found myself bored despite it being 2 hours long! Hope everyone who reads this goes and watches the film and I bid you adieu.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into a Marvel movie, I can't help but have high expectations. This film was the start of Phase 2 of the Marvel Universe. To be honest, when I first saw the trailer I was a little skeptical about it being any good. I wasn't keen on reading the comics or any comic for that matter so I had no clue who these characters were. Since it was a 'Marvel' movie I had no choice but to watch it.This movie blew me away. James Gunn thrilled me with the visual effects and the dynamics of each character. Groot was by far my favorite character even though his dialogue was minimum. Although he doesn't say much his actions on screen stand out.Rocket, you got to love that little raccoon.His sarcasm steals almost every scene.Peter Quill played by Chris Pratt is outstanding with his always-great comedic timing.Guardians of the Galaxy not only delivers the visuals and the action but also a lot of heart that touches everyone in some way or another.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am going to claim their is a "spoiler alert" in this review, although the spoiler is revealed right at the start of the movie. I don't really like these type of movies, but I liked this one. It does have a bit of a "Starwarish" type appeal (I liked the Star Wars series), and there is some funny humour. The character's are unusual and they each have their own personality. The only thing that I would be critical of, is the tendency of writer's to insert "2014" slang in a movie that would not have any connection to Earth in 2014. For example, the main character uses the term "bro". And this is the "spoiler". Since he was abducted by aliens in the 1980's as a young boy, it is doubtful that he would use that term, no matter where in the galaxy he might be at the time. I know, I know...this is a small criticism, but it irks me that the writers and directors pander to the youth audience and for me it feels out of place. Beyond that, I would recommend this movie. I for one would like to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Top 3 Marvel Films to Date - One of 2014's Best Movies By Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, just got back from opening night. Let me first say that I was hugely disappointed at the audience turnout. I wasn't sure if I was even in the right theater. I did have to wait in a line outside the door before the movie doors opened, but let's talk about this line: 10-15 people. NO! That is no typo. And this wasn't 1 hr+ before the movie started. It was like 15 minutes before. It was mostly nerds and dorks but still, what's the deal? Anyways, let's forget about those that decided to stay at home and miss out on this blockbuster! I will first say that I am a HUGE Zoe Saldana fan. In fact, I would marry her even if she punched me in the face. I can't really tell if I like her as Gamora or Neytiri. Hard to pick! Anyways, this movie will satisfy any Marvel or Sci-Fi fan. The action is definitely there. The visuals are second-to-none (which is saying something given it is 2014 and many movies these days are just CGI by default.The story is simple but it keeps you interested from beginning to end. The casting was excellent. In fact, Batista may have broken the curse of WWE stars being busts in the movie business (cough Cena cough Rock...) There is an after-credit scene but it is nowhere near as epic as X-Men Days of Future Past.Overall, this is definitely the movie to go see this summer if you were going to pick just 1.While I gave X-Men Days of Future Past a 10/10, I'm giving this a 9/10.Solid overall and I predict it will make plenty of money to warrant a solid sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got home after watching this in the theater.I can easily say this is the best blockbuster of 2014 so far and in the Marvel Universe, this is movie that finally matches and surpasses The Avengers. Avengers 2 just found real challenge.Marvel is going to be remembered in the movie history, years from now, as the company that attempted something very difficult: a series of movies that are all woven together, in an epic scale.The one thing that I noticed the most: I couldn't take out the big smile from my face for the entirety of the movie. This is not a comedy, the screen writing, the direction, the acting, they all worked like a very refined piece of delicate machinery to deliver an action packed story that is not overdone in Michael Bay or Rolland Emmerich style and still portrays a galactic story of epic proportions while not taking itself too seriously. The combination couldn't be better.The characters all work extremely well together. This is the classic story of the group of underdogs that come together to form a team. Something like The Avengers but without a big organisation like SHIELD to bring them together.Chris Pratt was delightful as the leader character. He is the Luke Skywalker of the new generation. Witty, practical, jack of all trades. Zoe Saldana is the Leia of this generation, not a princess in distress but a woman of the 21st century, strong, smart, focused. Rocket and Groot are the new Han Solo and Chewbacca, while the Milano is the new Millennium Falcon. Drax complements the team with muscle and confidence. A fantastic team.Lee Pace must be in everybody's radar. I didn't hear much about him, but after Thranduil in The Hobbit, then Joe MacMillan from Halt and Catch Fire, and now as a very competent Ronan, the Accuser, he scores well. Ronan is not in itself a very compelling villain, knowing that he is just one step behind to get to Thanos (and by the way, Josh Brolin as Thanos was superb), but it works rather well. We're getting closer and closer to the Infinity Gauntlet. Can't wait to - I don't know - 2020 to see the end of this epic Thanos saga.it's been 37 years since Star Wars. We didn't have anything close to it. Guardians is the next best thing ever since. This is science fiction done right. Can't find enough adjectives to qualify it. Don't hold back and just go see it, you won't regret one bit and you will end up wanting some more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must see movie of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a surprise! A movie that lives up to it's own hype. So many movies look good on previews and then you find out the previews were better than the movie. This movie wins, hands down.Now, it's not an intellectual film, so don't expect anything deep. It never pretended to that type of film, though. It promised action, and followed that up with a sly sense of humor, and then more action, and it delivered on those promises. That in itself sets it apart from most films out there today.In this film, a young boy is whisked into space, and becomes a mix of Hans Solo/Indiana Jones (the fact that they are both played by the same character seems odd in comparison). He is scavenging worlds for valuables on a bounty system. He gets into more than he can handle with his last assignment, and ends up with just about everyone hot on his trail.There is a green assassin who wants his treasure, and then a talking raccoon and his tree buddy that are turning him over to other outlaws for a bounty. Last addition is a muscle bound psychopath who only wants to kill. This motley crew will form the Guardians of Galaxy, and take on the responsibility of saving billions of lives. It's quite a ride...and there are laughs and some tears thrown in for the mix. A great mix.The only reason I don't go to "10 out of 10" is that there wasn't enough difference between the characters. You have a thief (Starlord), and then you have a person who specializes in killing people, the green skinned assassin Zamora....no...wait, the specialist in killing people is Rocket the Raccoon...oops...no, wait, it's Groot....oh...maybe it is Drax the Destroyer....hmmm....seems to be the biggest occupation in the group. So, a thief and four really tough guys who murder people form the group. It's still a great group, though....just a little more diversity would have been nice.Worth the price of the ticket...but sneak in your own popcorn!.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. The story is good and I like it. I love the actors. They have a good way of capturing the characters. The writing is awesome. I mean these are some good superhero that marvel introduced. The characters are cool and 3-d and they explain their history. They also have slight moments of humor which was OK, but I only chuckled a little, but I don't laugh at movies a lot. The action scenes are cool and exciting. The depth of the characters is exciting, like when Groot sacrifices himself and you see how much Rocket cares for Groot and I like the end when Groot is growing again. I also like the references to the Walkman and the cassette, fun fact the Walkman featured in the movie was the first cassette Walkman. They did good. I like that I can come back to this movie and not be bored. I want to see more of this movie. I hope they make a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't need to say anything about guardians other than it is simply the greatest film in history. And that there's a fact.great for kids and adults alike, this flick never fails to put a smile in my face and is legitimately my favorite film ever made. Right down from its soundtrack to its outstanding cast and director. You will fall in love with each and every character and form some kind of attachment with them. You will get lost in the incredible world that is created and you will laugh at the hilarious relationships that are formed between characters. It's difficult to pick out any flaws with the film but if I had to say one thing, it'd be that the villain, Ronan is not the most memorable film villain. Certainly not as memorable as say, Loki from the other MARVEL studios films. But never the less it is still an outstanding film in terms of the sci-fi genre and movies in general.</fullReview>

Also, the customs, story line, easter eggs, and comedy lines make the movie even better if that was possible.

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is another film released by Marvel; not only does it take a gallant approach to humor, but it tries to keep the pacing of this comedy driven style throughout the entire movie. The heroes are nothing remarkable, one is a princess defecting from her father, another is a professional junker that gets caught up in the works, and another is simply a very angry man out for revenge; I will mention the characters that really steal the show are the raccoon and living-tree-pet ? their dynamic is nothing short of brilliant. The movie is upbeat, cheerful and very colorful; despite how characters may die, it doesn't play much into it. The plot is there if you want to see it, but this movie is clearly about the adventure involved.Like the recent Avengers movies, there is a god involved, one of his henchmen is up to no good and the heroes are out to stop him. If you like a movie that takes place across the galaxy and -IS-NOT- Star Wars, this might just be the movie for you. Unlike the later Star Wars movies, this one has the colorful antics, upbeat demeanor the movies were probably going for, and Groot is strangely better than Jar Jar.Originally posted to Orion Age (http://www.orionphysics.com/? p=4914).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Marvel films that I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the best superhero films that I have seen in the 2010s (Dark Knight was 2009). The plot: A human thief (Chris Pratt 10/10) unknowingly steals an orb which contains an Infinity Stone and risks his life to save it. His escapades catch the attention of Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel). They form the Guardians of the Galaxy and fight a Kree fanatic who is one of Marvel's easily dispatched villains (Lee Pace). Thanos does make a cameo but I don't think it is as good as the reveal at the end of Avengers Assemble. Top marks go to James Gunn, the director who did a tremendous job in turning another Marvel property into a global phenomenon. My favorite scenes have to be the ones with Rocket and Groot. They seem like relatively small characters compared to Iron Man and Captain America, but their chemistry works so well that I think that there could be a spin-off. Guardians of the Galaxy: 9/10. I gave 9/10 because nothing is as good as Avengers Assemble. I hope that Volume 2 is as good as this one because no pressure James Gunn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is one of my favorites superhero films and movies in general. This is one of the funniest ,haywirest films ever directed. It shows also ,that the marvel studio has the courage to invest into even the lesser known hero teams of the marvel universe and still make a enjoyable movie out of it. As someone can see from my summary above, from my point of view these team is very much alike with the Star Wars' team ,but it doesn't become a simple copy,instead is shown, in reality, the Guardians have their own storyline ,which is simply a child of Star Wars. Also the comedy is excellent as well as, its cross with the sci-fi elements, creates a ton of entertaining and even thought provoking moments. To conclude I hope the 2017 sequel to be as good as the first ,continuing Marvel's score (up until today in march 2016) of zero bad outings.</fullReview>

The dancing to to the artifact scene is fantastic! I would also highly recommend viewing this through the vidangel app on roku that allows people to filter out the swearing and gore. When will Hollywood learn that there is a huge market for films that don't contain vile garbage. This was such a fun movie !

		<shortDescription>Excellent daft escapade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie made me laugh. Most modern Hollywood comedies leave me cold, Adam Sandler, Brat Pack drivel, for example. The reason I enjoyed this was that I liked the characters. The chemistry between the male and female leads was best when they were antagonistic, when he disgusted her. I didn't buy into the romantic aspect of their relationship. The last half hour of the movie was by far the weakest, but I guess that they had to provide some climactic fireworks. The movie worked best when the characters were plotting, bitching and scheming. Also the last half hour would have worked better if the villain was less so-so. I didn't yearn for the downfall of the big villain very much and his female side-kick was sweet rather than menacing. This deflated what should have been a suspenseful climax. The visual and spoken gags were the movie's strong point, which worked best when Rocket was around. Rocket was one of those characters I love. Just his facial expressions alone had me laughing. Without Rocket, the movie would have lost a couple of points. Quill was charismatic and seemingly effortlessly pulled off a tricky blend of foolish clown and heroic leader and straight man to Rocket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a visual treat, it is possibly one of the best films I'm ever going to see. We can see characters band together in hunt for Ronan. It was also good to see how the chemistry between the guardians of the Galaxy changed through out the film. Incredible doesn't even begin start how good this film is. I also like how the group all wanted Ronan dead for different reasons, which added to the humour and comedy. The comedy is outstanding even though it does have the most swears in a marvel film. Everyone who saw the film that I know loved the film too. Marvel have dialled their film making up in this film. This proves just how good the marvel films can get. I'm sure this is only a fraction of what marvel films can do. Even though I think this film is only a fraction of what marvel films can do I also think it will be hard to match this film in pure standard. I think this film was incredible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I watch one of these films, I am immediately at a disadvantage because I don't know the mythology behind them. It didn't matter here because while progressing the story, we were filled in well by commentary from the characters. Chris Pratt is a funny guy with his endless sincerity and optimism. What works here, and what others have said, is the humor is offhand enough, but funny enough, to not interfere with the mission. The good guys (as well as the sort-of good guys) have a nice chemistry. Some are clueless and some are simply very clever. I remember seeing the ads for this a year or so ago and the raccoon put me off in the ads. As it turns out, he was a dynamic, sympathetic character who is himself a victim of circumstances. He ever gets called a hamster at one point. Anyway, I just wanted to weigh in on a very entertaining film. I'm sure the sequel will continue the fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the film may be enjoyable for younger audiences, I found myself cringing at the dialogue, some of which made no sense and I simply cannot see people having conversation and talking to each other in that manner. The acting was atrocious, the soundtrack was out of place, and I can assume that the screenplay is a bore fest. The film's soundtrack makes no sense, but, it does have some enjoyable songs. The songs were kind of catchy, upbeat, and are probably good to dance along to. However, the title sequence in the beginning in which Chris Pratt's character turns on some space music player and starts randomly dancing around made absolutely no sense. Who would walk into a dark and mysterious castle on an alien planet, turn on a music player, and the break out into dance when your on a mission? He even acted surprised when the aliens tried to arrest him for stealing that orb, which was his fault as he could've stole the orb and quickly fled, but, no, he had to randomly break out into dance from a band from Earth that I myself have never heard of, though the music itself wasn't all that bad. The acting...oh, the acting. Talented actors Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana get caught up in this poorly-written mess that can only be saved by the impressive visual effects. We'll get to that in a moment. Chris Pratt's character just simply seemed unlikeable, and I didn't understand the boy's mother dying of cancer in the beginning, as I watched only 44 minutes of this mess and the only time the mother's death was mentioned was in that one scene. The dialogue made the character even worse. Zoe Saldana was actually likable for the 44 minutes of this movie that I saw, and she absolutely nailed the lines she had that I was able to suffer through. Now, on to the plot. I could not even begin to understand what was going on in some scenes, as the all-too-quick transitions from one scene to the other just dragged my attention away and kept me from having an understanding of what is developing, plot-wise. This hard- to-follow plot ruined the impressive fight scenes, as I could never understand why everyone was fighting. Now, this is solely my opinion, so, if you enjoyed this movie, fine. I can understand why you may have liked this movie, but, for me, it was just a confusing, poorly-written mess with a nonsensical soundtrack, at least, for the 44 minutes that I was able to bear. The characters are somewhat forgettable. There are only two good things about this film that actually make it worth watching: Zoe Saldana and the visual effects. Zoe Saldana, while by no means in her best role, absolutely nailed her role in my honest opinion, even though, as I said, I only watched 44 minutes of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Marvel announced in 2012 that Guardians of the Galaxy was coming to theaters in 2014, I remember thinking: why release this movie and not a standalone Hulk movie after the success of The Avengers? All the other major Avengers got their sequels, why didn't Hulk get his sequel? Mark Ruffalo killed it in The Avengers! Well, after watching this movie, I'm so glad that didn't happened!I'm going to be honest: I had no clue what the Guardians of the Galaxy was when the announcement came. I read some comics with them and I thought they were okay. But I never expected the movie to be as great as it actually is!Chris Pratt is a great Star-Lord! Funny, cool and a total badass! I have always liked Pratt, but I was surprised that he could be such a good lead role in an action movie! Thanks to him, I think Jurassic World can be a great film! Wow he's so likable! Pratt for President!Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel as the CGI characters Rocket and Groot are as good as Pratt's Star-Lord! Every line Cooper has is either hilarious or crazy talk! Love it! Groot can only say one thing (you know what it is) but still brings a lot to the other characters and the movie with his strength and his heart. He even delivers the saddest moment in the whole movie! Both are great characters!The other Guardians, Gamora and Drax, are okay characters. Not bad, but far away from the other three Guardians greatness!Ronan is a hilarious villain. The movie doesn't takes itself to seriously. That's one of the reasons why this movie is awesome! But when the villain try to be as serious as possible, it just ends in laughter and I am loving every second of it!The only problem I have with the movie is some parts of the supporting cast. Characters like Nova Prime, Korath, Nebula and The Collector didn't do that much and could easily been left out of the movie, in my opinion.Besides that, this movie is great! The characters, the action, the comedy, the soundtrack! I think the biggest reason why this movie is so loved is because it's so fresh and new. I recommend this movie for everyone that wants to have a good time, because that's what you get from watching this movie! Easily one of Marvels best movies ever made!</fullReview>

And the movie lacked that awesome ending. The Verdict -I thought the humour really worked in the movie, I had a lots of chuckles &amp;laughs and also the contrast between humour and drama was really good.The movie is absurdly fun ride is mix up of lot of good sci-fi times and you're gonna have FUN ASS time with it?it's not a perfect movie but will I see it again? -yeah id see it again and you would too?the movie also has post credit scene which reveals, "they will return"...so good news...we will have a sequel ...

Groot a tree who can only say i am Groot exclusively in that order. drax a mad man ronnan killed his family so drax wants to kill him. in my opinion drax is not a good member of the team until the end. he just does so many what the heck things throughout the movie. and thats why its only a 9 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Introduction to Marvel's Galactic Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the final of my ten reviews of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films that I've been writing as I watch the movies leading up to "Avengers: Age of Ultron". As such, this review (like the others) is written as a second impression review. In the series, I found that some MCU movies deteriorate with time (Avengers, for example), some stay about the same (Iron Man 1 is still great, whereas Iron Man 3 is still terrible), and then you have the occasional film like "Guardians of the Galaxy" that wasn't one of my favorites in the theater, but is much more enjoyable upon a second viewing.As I think about why that might be, I think I might sum the whole thing up to an initial lack of familiarity with the characters. Guardians of the Galaxy was by far the least familiar Marvel property for me in terms of watching the MCU films. I remember having one GOTG comic book (a special cover with some sort of a robotic foil skeleton figure that looked like Wolverine on the front), but I never knew the first thing about the team when I was into modern age comic books. As such, whereas with the other MCU movies I watched them wondering if they would stand up to my criticism based on my love for the characters, with GOTG I found myself completely ignorant on the front end, meaning that the movie had to do its job of selling me on its characters and storyline alone.When I first saw this film in the theater, I left feeling like the movie had done this effectively, but with a big problem: even though I was completely able to follow the film, I just simply didn't enjoy the characters. Perhaps in large part this was to be expected, since the natural inclination is to compare a Marvel movie to other Marvel movies, which meant that I was comparing GOTG to "The Avengers", "Captain America", etc, all of which feature characters I have strong brand allegiance to. Still, "Guardians of the Galaxy" left me dissatisfied when I left the theater. I just didn't see what was so special about the film.To say more about that, one of the things that left me with a strong impression when I saw the movie in the theater was that it features comedic humor much more prominently than some of the other Marvel movies. In the theater there was a laugh a minute, with the audience contributing heavily with an eagerness to laugh. That left me feeling as though the film was a bit too childish, not serious enough, etc. To add to that, the movie also features so many different characters and villains, most all of whom were foreign to me, and it just made for a movie that was hard for me to enjoy.That said, though, upon this second viewing, I found that the film has really grown on me. Is the movie goofy and a bit sophomoric? Yes. However, when you go into it knowing that and expecting it, it's easier to appreciate it for what it is. And while the jumble of new characters is a lot to digest at first, the movie is much easier to follow and appreciate the second time around. I found that the characters grew on me, the villains made more sense, and the overall contribution to the direction of the MCU (with the coming of the Infinity War) was significant and enjoyable.All that said, my original criticisms were not completely unfounded, but upon closer inspection this is nevertheless a great movie. One side note though: Having watched all ten MCU movies in the course of four months, I found that there is an increasing use of profanity as the series moves on. "Guardians" seemed to have a bit more than others in the series, which is unfortunate given that it is an otherwise fun, family friendly movie. It's not over the top and most of the words are what you might hear on TV any given evening, but be mindful of this if you have kids.All in all, I'd give it 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

It is indeed great to watch the creation of someone who has put it on the screen. I admire the way the actors play; simply amazing. I, honestly, was surprised that Vin Diesel was the voice of Groot and actually after behind the scenes videos I discovered that Lee Pace is actually Ronan.

Visually the movie is stunning the cgi effects are completely out of this world!(no pun intended) the screenplay was brilliant although some would call it tacky I found it to be part of the character of the movie. The soundtrack fitted perfectly apart from "Cherrybomb" urrgghhh (shudders) and I for one would say this is going to become a cult classic in the future. Comic book movies are generally hard to pull off but GOTG has definitely done it for me, then again each to their own. 10/10 from me and a definite must see!.</fullReview>

While you're at it, go ahead and download "I'm Not In Love" by 10cc and "Cherry Bomb" by Joan Jett and The Runaways. Yes young ones, we know, we where there...Only downer - soundtrack could have been tons better. The late 70s and early 80s had much better music to select from and any true Walkman sporting hypester would have been listening to the Dead Kennedys or Run DMC, but I digress.Dead weight: John C Reilly and Glenn Close just feel like ballast brought on board to steady the ship when in fact they should have been jettisoned.Did I mention mind bending special effects, the toroid shaped Dark Aster mother ship, Benicio Del Toro, faceless necro-soldiers, an Infinity Stone ('an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it' says Wiki), fighting girls, Cosmo the Soviet space dog and Benicio Del Toro? AND IT'S ALL IN 3D! In the future it will be cool to have seen this movie in the past.Review by Feeney Last</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spectacularly Funny Action Space Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one apart from comic fans knew who the Guardians of the Galaxy were prior to 2014. Now on the other hand there wouldn't be many movie goer families that don't who they are.Guardians of the Galaxy is the story of five misfits that form together to try and save the Galaxy from the evil Ronan (Lee Pace). The Guardians are led by adventurer Peter Quill or Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) after he is taken from Earth 26 years earlier and thrust into the world of aliens and strange planets. The band of misfits also includes; Quill's possible love interest Gamora (Zoe Saldana) whom is also an ex-servant of Ronan, a strong alien bent on revenge who doesn't understand metaphors called Drax the destroyer (Dave Bautista), a smart mouth, talking Racoon called Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and a sort of talking tree called Groot (Vin Diesel), who can only say his own name.If you didn't realize by that synopsis this movie is a fun ride. It has the perfect blend between action and comedy. Now days there are so many superhero movies that have gone down the path of being very dark and serious but this movie really knows what it is and doesn't try and over complicate things. It's a funny movie that also has great and interesting character with spectacular visuals and action. This makes it a fantastic blockbuster that's a light hearted version of comic book movies and it definitely works.As this was the highest grossing film of 2014 it shows that you don't have to be a Batman or a Spider-Man to pull off a comic book movie box office smash hit. These characters were unknown to the general public before the film and when the movie was announced there were many skeptics to how well the film would go, me included. All the skeptics and the worries were put to bed when the movie proved to be the great movie and the success it was. This has opened the doors to more opportunities for Marvel and DC to take unknown properties and release them onto the mainstream and for them to be a huge success.The actors in the film are very pretty high quality and high profile with them giving very entertaining performances. Chris Pratt portrays the perfect swashbuckling space adventurer with him being compared in equal to Harrison Ford. Thanks to his performance in this movie he has been eyed to play Indiana Jones in a reboot of that franchise. Zoe Saldana once again changes her skin color, this time to green and does a good job with her character. Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel do very good jobs at voicing their characters and they both give their characters a wealth of personality and emotions especially Vin Diesel with his one line of dialog repeated. The rest of the actors do good jobs at portraying their characters with no bad acting involved.The main negative to this movie is the villain who is pretty uninteresting and generic. This is the fault of a lot of Marvel Cinematic movies of late with the villain being boring and not that interesting. This movie really only focuses on the heroes which is the really important part of the movie but it would have been good to see a good villain in the film.Overall "Guardians of the Galaxy" is great action sci-fi movie with great comedic relief and fantastic characters. I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves smart comedy and fantastic action sequences. If you like Star Wars you will like this movie.I rate this movie an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of Marvel Studios thus far?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to be honest, to me, it really is. Watching this really makes anyone who watches marvel movies for something more than punches kicks smacks and 'that looked pretty cool' moments surely take from it that it has what the others were missing (as much as I love them) and that is that this is the only one that has heart and most of all character development. Captain America has no character development, he is just a victim of circumstances placed from one setting to another. The same goes with Thor, Iron man was a rich guy who's a bit of an ass who felt bad about the things he had done so he became a rich guy who's a bit of an ass who doesn't sell weapons anymore and got a little bit sad after the battle of new york for 5 minutes. I will say again, because I know a lot of you defend marvel movies as if they can do no wrong or you are defending your families honour in feudal Japan, I have enjoyed every marvel studios movie and own them all on bluray, some even on 3D bluray, but I'm not going to lie to myself and pretend they have any character development. Oh Tony and Bruce have a joke together 3 times, prime character development, well done. Just no. But I hope the well received nature of Guardians spurs on marvel to take of the bubble wrap around their other characters and let us see under the hype that goes along with their alter egos expectations, because it worked wonders for this movie.</fullReview>

The actors were great, animations (as I deem them to be) are flawless, story-line is awesome, and the characters themselves are alive and easy to relate with human emotions.Writing as a Marvel fan, GotG is completely different from the other Marvel movies created from the past years. If you're curious about the difference I'm trying to explain giving GotG a chance and watching it is harmless. I hope many more would watch this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel Nailed nailed it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. I am at a nearly a loss for words at how well Marvel created this film and brought these characters to life. As an avid lover of comic books and nearly all superhero universes I was going into this movie with low expectations because the group Guardians of the Galaxy seemed to be a tough task to cast as well project their identities to the audience. First of all I think that the actors casted into each characters were spot on. I was worried about Chris Pratt but he slimmed down and nailed the slight condescending womanizer that is Peter Quill. Bradley Cooper and Zoe Saldana were also outstanding as Rocket and Gamora. Lastly, I was a little bit upset at first that the movie storyline is not sticking true to the comic book structure of who Peter Quill's father is; which if you read comics you know is Jason of Spartax. I have a hunch as who his father in the movie is but will not spoil anything. Overall wow, job well done to the entire Marvel Studio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie for teens if it weren't for the annoying music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some kid's mother is on her death bed. She gives him a gift. When she dies he runs out and is abducted by a spaceship.We meet Peter again in the present (future) on an abandoned planet, were he pulls an orb out of some holographic image. He calls himself a junker and an outlaw by the name of Starlord. Some bad guys show up who want the orb. He defeats them. We learn that some bad guy named Ronan was commissioned by some uber giant bad guy to get the orb at all costs. Now they put a bounty on Peter and Ronan sends some green girl to get the orb.As he's about to deliver the orb to the buyer on an earth-like planet, he runs into the green girl and a pair of bounty hunters--a talking raccoon and a walking tree.They are all jailed. Turns out everyone in jail wants to kill the green girl because she or her boss has murdered family members of all the inmates. Among them is an articulate steroid muscle. They all agree to work together to escape. They come up with a plan and indeed manage to escape of sorts. But turns out that muscle in his eagerness for revenge called Ronan somehow in order to confront and kill him. Ronan shows up, grabs the orb and kicks their behinds. Peter ends up grabbed by his mentor, the same guy who abducted him in his youth.Now they all have to work together to grab the orb, which contains an infinity stone so powerful that it can destroy galaxies, no less, and defeat Ronan before he can destroy the earth-like planet. Just how does Marvel manage to make dozens of movies with the same story? Guardians of the Galaxy is mild adventure movie for teens. It places more emphasis on story and emotions than on CGI carnage. But it's a bit too much, it's constantly trying to get the audience to shed a tear. I do appreciate though the moderation in hyperfast brain-frying CGI battles. What I don't appreciate is the constant loud obnoxious music blasted at full volume. I sure hope this isn't a return to the 90s fad when movie studios were more concerned in selling a lousy compilation CD than in making a good movie. I'm also a fan of the 70s and 80s and like some of the music of the time, but here they managed to collect the absolute worst songs of the era. If that weren't enough, there's the obligatory bombastic Wagner-ripped off orchestrated music. If some American lawyer ever convinced the Wagner estate to sue Hollywood studios for piracy and other related crimes, they'd make trillions.This movie is also quite funny as when Peter challenges Ronan to a "dance-off" during the climax. Guardians also looks pretty cool at times. They learned their lesson from Thor I. Audiences want to see cool, colorful cosmic sights.Casting is iffy. Pratt, Pace, and Gillan stand out. Saldana and Rooker are awful. Cooper, Diesel (?), Close, del Toro are unnecessary. Why not give a chance to new or newish actors, instead of throwing even more money at these multi-millionaries whose contributions to this movie are questionable at best.For the intended teen audience, Guardians is a recommendable movie. Despite the silliness of it all, it doesn't treat the audience as complete morons. The movie handles language well, not vile but even articulate at times--always a good thing to foment in young people. The fact that this movie turned out so well while directed and written by people with virtually no experience, and this is becoming a strange trend lately, shows that all the fuzz about "The Director" is completely overblown. Clearly the way movies are made these days makes the role of the director far less important and it looks like it doesn't take a lot to direct a movie. That's not to take away Gunn's writing skills, which are also rather surprising.It's an alright movie for older audiences as well, but I have to say that the oversaturaturation of the movie market with Marvel movies about the destruction of the universe is starting to get a bit too much.</fullReview>

The sets, the makeup, the art direction, the CGI, the costumes, etc. Besides all this, I thought that film lacked in plot. The characters I thought were full of personality but their conflicts didn't get me emotional enough to care about them.It's worth a watch with the kids, or late at night with a couple of brews when the mind is usually turned off.

The diamond thingamajig is just like the tesseract thingamajig from the Avengers and thousands of other movies, and that factor is becoming a bit tiresome.I did see however in the big tattooed galoot and in the tremendous space vistas the potential to finally make Bester's "The Stars my Destination". With Tom Hardy playing the lead role. Now that would be a proper movie.Just relax and watch Guardians for what it is, throwaway fantasy popcorn.

		<fullReview>As you have already noticed I don't think this movie is the best I've ever seen. But that doesn't mean that I think it's the worst I've ever seen. Chris Pratt performs pretty decent as Peter Quill, or "Star- Lord", with his cheeky attitude and, sometimes, funny moments. Peter Quill teams up with Gamora, Drax, Rocket and Groot, after certain more or less unfortunate circumstances, in hope of stopping the evil villain (too cheesy?) Ronan The Accuser. Underway they run into problems in different location, such as a prison escape. The aesthetics in the movie is quite good. The CGI is pretty good and the motion capture of Groot, Rocket and so on is really well done. All in all, the movie is worth a watch, especially if you're a Marvel fan but will also work even though you're not.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Those Who Felt Like the Avengers Wasn't "It"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was everything the Avengers was not and that is... extremely fun, exciting, well-paced, and spectacular. I don't think the Avengers was as good as everyone else seems to believe, that's not saying I hate it, I just don't think it's that great. Now before you shoot me down and block me, hear me out.Guardians of the Galaxy is a story that isn't so much about story as it is about developing the quirkiest, funnest, and most interesting characters that Marvel has to offer. Anyone who thought Captain America and Hawkeye were bland and boring in the Avengers, look no further. (I will frequently compare the Avengers and Guardians). Each character is given enough development in the first half that they aren't just caricatures. Each person is given enough dialogue and none of them seem to mugging for the screen.I haven't even gotten to the best part. THE SOUNDTRACK!! This soundtrack is better than Frozen, better than Avengers, better than Iron Man. When you leave this movie you will be whistling "Hooked on a Feeling" or chuckling to yourself about the opening credits scene or singing Jackson 5's "I Want You Back" or possibly even thinking about Marvin Gaye's "Ain't No Mountain High Enough". The soundtrack pushed this movie into such a silliness and over the top fun that it was incredibly enjoyable to watch. Now I haven't really said anything bad about this film because there isn't much wrong with it. Except it suffers from being a Marvel film, so, the villain is only meh. Marvel struggles so bad with villains that it's almost sad. The villain in Guardians is not terrible but he's no Joker or Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor or even Loki. The villain is forgettable and not well developed and that's a definite drawback. In short, Guardians of the Galaxy is the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time, it's exciting and wacky, its soundtrack is phenomenal, and its villain is underwhelming.Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with high expectations and was happily surprised with what I saw. The movie flowed very well with plenty of comedy, action and drama for everyone. The movie moved along nicely with no stall points. The plot was good. The characters were dynamic and true to the comic series. The costumes and makeup were bang on as were the sets and animations. The whole thing had a very "Firely" series vibe to it which had me glued to the screen the entire length of the show. Even a couple of my friends that are not typically into this sort of movie genre said that they were glad that I convinced them to see the film and would even see it again. All in all I enjoyed this movie thoroughly and would definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Negativa Critics of this movie have a common theme.....they simply seem unhappy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was indeed a great movie. Though probably wasn't meant to be taken too seriously as if it was going to overshadow Stars Wars or Raiders of the lost Ark. It's quite a shame that negative critics compare it as such, as if the writers, directors, actors, etc. had expected it too. One common theme it seems among the negative critics is that they seem bitter or just generally unhappy. They went after this movie for the silliest reasons. A.) it failed as a comedy. Guess what? it wasn't supposed to be 100% a comedy. Most people got that. B.) It's not a great movie like a Beautiful Mind and doesn't belong in the top 250....that doesn't even make sense to compare it to that movie, which negates any credibly for that review. I stopped reading after that comment. C.)Chris Pratt failed as the lead super hero....did you read the comic and understand the character he played? He played it PERFECTLY as designed. I could go on, but not worth the time. Overall, the majority of the public loved this movie and "got it" and didn't over think it. They just had a really good time at the movies, I'm sure. It's just frustrating for me to see reviewers give this movie 1s and 2s, because this movie does not deserve it. I would expect someone taking such a low position probably doesn't like a lot of things and their issues aren't about this movie. Go see this movie. It is a MUST SEE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the hype I didn't know what to expect. I certainly didn't expect the movie to be so much fun. Lovable characters, believable friendships, emphatic emotions, excellent humour throughout. The story arc was generic. Good v Evil. Losers come good. Save the planet. There are reminisces of Star Wars. The Music is used to great effect and surprisingly fits in easily with the futuristic space age scenes. The focus on the old eighties Walkman is a sweet nod to my favourite decade ever. It's basically lots of laugh out loud fun with characters you can care about. My only gripe is Zoe Saldanas painfully looking thin waist. Her shape is not womanly. It was the only thing that bothered me about the whole movie. Towards the end there are clues to what may be explored in the sequel....bring it on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is gorgeously made &amp; remains true to the genre it follows. Its pure popcorn entertainment!'Guardians of the Galaxy' Synopsis: A group of space criminals must work together to stop the fanatical villain Ronan the Accuser from destroying the galaxy.'Guardians of the Galaxy' doesn't aim for greatness, which in a way, works for the venture, but in an another manner, doesn't. Agreed, entertainment is the priority here, but the film never comes across as ambitious or different. Its a regular Good versus Bad story, that's been witnessed an umpteen number of times by cine-goers time &amp; again.But, coming back to its pluses, James Gunn &amp; Nicole Perlman's Screenplay is well-done, offering moments of pure action &amp; also sly humor. James Gunn's Direction is impressive. Cinematography is striking. Editing is neatly done. Visual Effects &amp; Action-Sequences are absolutely stunning.Performance-Wise: Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, delivers a charismatic performance. He steals the show. Zoe Saldana as Gamora, is motionless. Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, is superb. Vin Diesel as Groot &amp; Bradley Cooper as Rocket, entertain. Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser, is menacing. Michael Rooker as Yondu Udonta, hams. Djimon Hounsou as Korath, John C. Reilly as Corpsman Rhomann Dey, Glenn Close as Nova Prime Irani Rael &amp; Benicio del Toro as The Collector, are wasted.On the whole, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is fun!

		<fullReview>Far from a brilliant movie, it has enough to deliver, especially if you are a CGI fan. I did not dislike the movie but as it went on, I could almost guess what was going to happen. There is no real surprise. It would gain if it had a bit more depth. Intro, development and conclusion of the story are rather trivial. The characters will probably be more explored in the sequels since in this movie the spectators did not get to learn anything about their history (except for the main character of whom you get a glimpse). In my opinion, this is a more cheerful, hectic and colorful "The Chronicles of Riddick". Briefly, I would say :Awesome: - CGI; Average: - Actors; - Story; - Jokes; Awful: - Does not bring anything new.</fullReview>

It did not live up to my expectations but this movie was great.It was funny, fresh, new, and something you don't see from DC. I am glad Marvel does this stuff. Rocket and Groot stole the film for me, but Star Lord was great too.I enjoyed the film in theaters, but I guess the down side for me was it still didn't feel like it was complete and maybe the 2nd will fill that void.All in all, GotG was one of the most enjoyable films of 2014.

		<shortDescription>A conscious revolt to straight-up Marvel movies. Entertaining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is fairly divisive and I'm aware of the naysayers that find those "lame jokes trashy", "character development problematic" and "dialogue full of clichés". In defense of these three major complaints, I say well of course it's not the funniest film there is, but no less humorous than any other film in the superhero genre. Pretty damn entertaining on the overall and casting did a great job with Quill the Starlord.What I find earnest about this film, is James Gunn's intentional treatment of the space western being a different beast entirely from conventional superhero flicks. Whether in conscious revolt to self- important straight-up Marvel movies, OR mere satisfaction of style and whim consistent with career trajectory as an indie writer- director of B movies (Dawn of the Dead, Slither) I can't say with certainty. Maybe a combination of both. With that in mind, is James Gunn officially an auteur? Yes. Does being one also make him an artist? Maybe, maybe not. Anyway, considering Kubrick's axiom that "a film is or should be, more like music than fiction." I'm inclined to agree with all final verdicts that declare "Guardians of the Galaxy being an unpretentious, fun and likable mess."Too many cling to the naive belief that a movie rises and falls with character development ? not necessarily. While it is okay to care about character development, over insistence is to place too much emphasis on just one element and overlook the rest.What matters is the overall design works in favour of story material using suitable language. GotG is geared towards the edgy, cheeky and comical. Bunch of goofs and misfits become friends and save the galaxy.It's a real shame that clichés in the film intentionally deployed before being voluntarily jettisoned by self-awareness midpoint (as a form of comic device) has completely escaped the naysayers.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of the year so far?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a laugh a minute. I haven't seen a film I've enjoyed as much as this for ages.It's hard to find any faults with it. The soundtrack is superb and super funky. The visuals are out of this world (didn't get to see it in 3D but I'd imagine it'd look even better)The characters are to die for, I love the development, the nuances, how back story and motivations aren't skimped on. Everything looks, sounds and feels great. It's an absolute treat of a film.Some may think the current score on IMDb is quite a high one. It's justified. There were lines in this film that had the audience roaring with laughter. By the end of the film, you find yourself caring for a giant talking (somewhat) tree and a CG raccoon. It's that good.Like Watchmen, none of the characters are what can be truly defined as heroes. Anti-heroes perhaps. They don't even like each other. Throughout the roller-coaster of a film you end up caring for what happens to them even though they spend a great deal of the film wanting to rip each others throats out.I would sum the movie up as a masterclass in high humor, silliness and warmth..and with two of the characters being more than a fair nod to Chewbacca and Han Solo, I'd say the up and coming Star Wars films are going to have to step up to the plate and raise the stakes after seeing this one.Do yourself a favour folks. Go and watch it. It's near guaranteed to put a big smile on your face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have rarely enjoyed a film as much as I enjoyed Guardians of the Galaxy tonight. From the funny little dance we get from Quill at the start of the film, to his funky moves at the end, this film keeps things refreshingly light and yet also manages to offer up real heart. You warm to all the characters - from the surprisingly eloquent Drax to the wise-ass that is Rocket, to Groot's innocence, Quill's badboy ways and Gamorra's quest for vengeance, each character has something of worth.The bad guy is a little flat but we don't get to see enough of him, which is a shame as he could have been an interesting enemy. That said, he offers a few good scenes of malice.The scope of the film is huge and both the sets and CGI work is top-notch. The film is beautiful, with lots of strong attention to detail.I also loved the soundtrack. The use of 80s songs rather than a traditional score makes the film seem more down-to-earth. I loved this film and it is one of the few I would consider seeing at the cinema again.</fullReview>

If you take your kid to see it most of it will just go over his head, unless his reflexes are good ;)This movie takes the space-opera tropes and creates something refreshing. Dave Batista is surprisingly good as Dr-ax. Zoe is excellent as always. Chris Pratt owns as Star-Lord. Though Diesel only speaks 4 words , this is his best performance to date. And finally the show steal-er, Bradley Cooper as Rocket. Best Character in the movie. Finally , go see it. Probably the best time you will have in a movie theater for the whole year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is another successful Marvel adaptation for the big screen and the birth of another potentially long-running (and profitable) franchise. Chris Pratt stars as Peter Quill, or Star Lord as he prefers to be known as, an adventurer who lives by his wits and finds himself the quarry of menacing forces intent on retrieving a dangerous artifact he has stolen.He falls in with four unlikely comrades each with their own purpose, who at first are enemies but form an alliance that grows stronger throughout the movie, culminating with their friendship. This friendship overcomes all adversity and saves the day, and restores security to a peaceful world.It's not much of a plot but who cares? The film is supremely entertaining, with eye-popping CGI, a cheeky script, interesting and likable characters, warmth, humour, and a refreshing intent to not take itself at all seriously. The non-human characters, Rocket in particular, generate a surprising amount of sympathy and connect very well with the audience. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, and Dave Bautista all carry the movie very well with a lightness of touch and an emotional depth many comic book adaptations lack.The politics behind the plot I felt was a little too complicated but necessary I suppose to hang future episodes on and to provide a framework for the five adventurers to continue their dubious path on both sides of the law. A sequel is planned for 2017 which I am already looking forwards to.See this film! Two hours will flash by in what seems like minutes, it will be a fun evening and money well spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel Film (yet) and one of the best films I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had good expectations walking into the theater and knew that this film would be good. After all it received a lot of attention but none of the praise I've heard so far met it halfway. This film was simply amazing. Action, comedy, and even a little bit of drama -- this film had it all the way through and kept it coming. The acting just as the directing was stupendous to say the least. Compared to other series in the Marvel Universe this was one of those that didn't seem to be lacking. The drama felt real and not scripted, the comedy was very reactive and didn't feel planned, and the action was done well but not too much. Guardians of the Galaxy was just a film that got it right. For many superhero films they happen to have all the ingredients but never in the right proportions; which for this film wasn't the case. Many praises to Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, and Dave Bautista for their roles. The rest of the case did an excellent job as well; I must say that Ronan was perhaps my favourite villain yet--next to Loki--Lee Pace had the role spot on and definitely gave me the feel of being perfect for those shoes. James Gunn's directing wasn't any less praise-worthy and really knew how to set up each scene to form subtle references to spot-on jokes. Above all this was a good film and no scene felt hindered in any way. For those who haven't seen this I say you should -- this is a must-see on the big screens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MARVEL's best movie yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw this movie in a theater I found this movie really hard to believe to be a directorial debut but the movie turned out to be another good one that is one of the best along with Citizen Kane, The Maltese Falcon, 12 Angry Men etc. The movie tells the story of Peter Quill (played by Chris Pratt) a man who has been abducted for 26 years after his mother's death of cancer, along the way he meets not a lot of people to make friends with on the planet Xandar meeting his future Guardians of the Galaxy teammates Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana), Rocket the Racoon (Bradley Cooper), Groot (Vin Diesel), and Drax (Dave Bautista). Not only this was a real action adventure as well as being hilarious in most scenes. This is one of the best movies of the year, but after i saw this movie I was dying to see it again. In the beginning I felt bad for Peter because he lost his mother inside I really felt his emotional pain I would feel the same too if I lost a loved one too.A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow. Best Marvel Movie to Date!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is by far the best movie that Marvel has put out since The Avengers. Iron Man has always been my favorite, but Guardians was without a doubt my favorite movie to date. It has everything needed in a great movie; humor, action, suspense, drama. I hardly ever give films a 10/10, but Guardians was nearly perfect in my opinion. Go see it while it is still in theaters, especially in IMAX. This movie shows exactly what a film should look like on a big screen. The colors and action sequences are spectacular, its just a fun movie. Even if you aren't a big Marvel fan, you will still enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After discovering a mysterious orb in another part of the galaxy, Peter Quill, originally from Earth, is the main target of a manhunt led, by a genocidal maniac, and New Romantic Ronan The Accuser. Being hunted across the galaxy Quill gets together with a group of misfits that need to learn how to get along before they can become the titular heroes they are destined to be......I'm a huge movie fan, but I haven't picked up a comic book in years, and like many, I hadn't heard of GOTG, before the film was announced. Add to the fact that I have never seen PAR, and the trailer wasn't mind blowing, I wasn't expecting much.I don't think I've ever been so wrong about a film before, and to add to the compliments, I've not had this much fun in the cinema since I was at university. I'm not saying its one of the best film ever made, but its so much fun, and consistently brilliant, its hard not to have a good time.First off, Pratt is brilliant as Quill, a troubled individual who wasn't given a choice about his life, and was snatched at the lowest point of his life. He is films empathy, and although he is a thief, he is seeking answers for himself.Saldana and Bautista are good, they are totally overshadowed by Cooper and the literally Wooden Vin Diesel, as the comic relief, and the film excels whenever they are on screen. They are Marvels Han Solo and Chewbacca, and I believe that this is intentional.The references to Star Wars are huge, and although many will disagree, this is the noughties Star Wars, this is the film that everyone will be referencing in 37 years time, this will get special editions and re-releases, because it's an event, its a film that demands repeat viewings. Not because there are so many hidden gags and background references, it's because the film is well written, has great performances, has a lot of heart, and juggles emotion, excitement, and humour just right.For my money, it's easily Marvels finest effort, because it just doesn't take any risks, and goes bonkers on the screen for all to see and lap up. And it can do this because the script is so good, the narrative is excellent, and for once, its a fun film for all the family.After a few years of mundane summer movies, 2014 has made up for it tenfold.I'm guessing years ending in 4 are good for summer blockbusters1994: Speed, True Lies, Maverick 1984: Ghostbusters, BHC, Temple Of Doom. 2014: GOTG, DOTPOTA, Godzilla.See it, love it, see it again.Its wonderful stuff.And there is a little something of a new breed of hero involved too......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a huge Marvel fan (both comics and film) I was delighted to hear this film was getting made with the perfect choice of Guardians and what a perfect cast to play them. The biggest surprise for me was Dave Bautista who I thought was only cast for his size but his delivery was spot on for Drax. Chris Pratt was hilarious whilst still excellent at delivering some of the films most emotional scenes.CGI in this film was super, there's nothing I hate more than too much CGI in a film but it was so good in Guardians that I was completely lost in it. Never have a seen space look so good, the battles were incredible and Groot and Rocket never looked out of place (aside from being a tree and raccoon).!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Guardians of the Galaxy is an all-round great family movie in which you can watch it again and again! I really enjoyed this film because it had some great one liners and was very entertaining for me and the whole family. This film had a great cast including names such as Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and Bradley Cooper they all have great chemistry together and work well as a team. The music in this film was based on the 60's and 70's pop hits which gave the film a feel good vibe and added to the theme of the humour involved for example the novelty hit Escape(The Pina Colada song) by Rupert Holmes and Cherry Bomb by The Runaways, Therefore making this Movie one that I would highly recommend to any adults of any age I would say the same for children but it does have a few swear words and one use of the middle finger which again adds to the humour but may not have the same effect on the children or the parents. Other than that this is a film that I need to add to my collection, so go out and watch this film in the cinema I promise you will not regret it!</fullReview>

The first scene i didn't like that one, I hate hospitals, I have no idea what the point of ti was but once the space stuff starts, it's truly a visual orgasm. It's basically like a far out spacey movie with some far out classic rock music to accompany it. How can you go wrong with that?---you almost can't conceivably....Above all though, it was fun. The wwe guy was borderline in his horrible acting but luckily the gave him a character who takes everything literally and doesn't really have to expand much on more than one emotion...seriousness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a back drop of music from the seventies and eighties this is yet another action movie that actually lives up to the hype it attempts to talk up. Five losers take on the galaxy's feared enemy in this Marvel film based off the legendary Guardians of the Galaxy comic. Marvel brings a cast with the well-known A list names Vin Diesel (Fast and the Furious), Bradley Cooper (Hangover), Chris Pratt (Moneyball and the Lego Movie). Not to mention various B list actors who faces we all know and love from their past movie exploits.Guardians of the galaxy brings us back to that age old movie that you can laugh, cry and get upset with as it brings you on a roller-coaster thrill ride throughout. The effects stand out all by themselves to not only high light the characters but show off their various expertise. But all of this is nothing compared to the CGI that is rampart throughout the movie.Now I wouldn't compare Chris Pratts performance to Harrison Ford in Star Wars but in this role his performance gives the film a great touch. Not to mention Dave Bautista not sounding like a woody ex wrestler as he talks in this film makes it more memorable. So grab the kids and sit down with some popcorn as this is what can only be a lead in for more avenger style movies but with a space back ground.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great escapist movie, that makes you shoot rainbows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were a few times when the movie trudged along and felt pedestrian. But thankfully, it picked the ball back up and kept on throwing it back at you.The coordination was good. I wished John Carter was like this. It felt like a real adventure, reminding me very much of the last star fighter back in the 80's.I felt like a kid again. It did something very right. Throughout the year, we've had sci-fi adventure movies which creeps this insidious contemporary context at you. It makes you think which unfortunately for me I find distracting and somewhat tiresome.The second most film I enjoyed this year was Winter Soldier. And it did a great job of chucking some conspiracies and social relevance. But it dampened the spirit and left me slightly miserable.Then you had Godzilla, another - the government is hiding the truth kinda of movie. It was well done if a little wanting.Then, transcendence, X-men, the upcoming Hunger games. All movies/books I enjoyed. But I needed away from all this. Edge of Tomorrow was great and underrated. Simple action and comedy that like this was done well.And this movie. It did the comedy brilliantly. The direction had to be top notch and the comedic moments hit the right notes pretty much all the time for me.There was a little baggage, but it served well and gave this movie that emotional element that juxtaposed the carefree roller-coaster adventure and also gave the characters depth.Yes, I felt good on the inside. Not like the kind of good which The Secret of Walter Mitty gave me. But a childish kinda good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Galaxy is in good hands</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler alert folks, if you haven't see Guardians of the Galaxy.But you totally should.If I've said it once, I've said it a million times. THIS IS MARVEL'S TIME.They played out a huge gamble on uniting their heroes into the Avengers and it paid off big. Then the thought of combining all these movies with ties to the next movie, risky, but brilliant.Now they have pulled another brilliant movie by bringing us the Guardians of the Galaxy. Once a virtually unknown group in their comic universe, now a huge money making force to be dealt with that rivals The Avengers themselves. The biggest gamble? Putting 'The Guardians of the Galaxy will return' at the end of the movie. What if this movie flopped? They would have pulled a Buckaroo Banzai on us. Marvel knows what they are doing and it seems as if they are unstoppable.The Guardians of the Galaxy is the story of a misfit group of 'thugs', none of them fit the typical hero mold. A scavenger, a big burly killing machine, the daughter of the universes biggest tyranny bent on total destruction, a genetically altered raccoon and a tree. Not the type of group you'd call if there was a problem, but they're the ones you'd want.This movie gets you from the start, even with this being a group of new characters; we're introduced to them quickly and during the course of the movie that you don't even notice it. (No being bitten by a spider Spider-Man sequence or Batman parents being shot flashback here) and they are thrown together to fight a common threat to the galaxy and wind up becoming friends in the process. The best part aside from the action is the humor and this movie is full of it.The real stars are Chris Pratt as Star Lord Peter Quill (like Han solo meets Indiana Jones with smart remarks for days)from his dance moves to his trying to explain common expressions to those around him is hilarious and Rocket who is only out for himself and his pal Groot (Seriously, a disgruntled raccoon, what's not to like?) There are plenty of cameos too, if you are familiar with Marvel comics you will catch lots of them (even Stan Lee is there), the best is the appearance of Thanos the Tyrant. (The purple guy at the end of The Avengers) and even Benicio Del Toro as the Collector (the guy from the end of Thor 2) also stay until after the credits for a cameo from a notorious Marvel character.A few things did bother me, so if I may?..1-Peters ship was destroyed and the Nova corps rebuilt it as best as they could, even his tape deck? How many cassette tape players are just lying around in another galaxy? Did this planet have a Best Buy?2-Peters Walkman, what does it run on? All these years and he never had to replace the batteries? Did he stop by an intergalactic Wal-Mart?3-Gamora, for being the daughter of a tyrant that everyone wants to kill, after the jail scene, no one seems to care that she is just walking around. Weird right? 4-When Rocket and Groot try to take down Quill at the beginning and Gamora gets in the way, all this stuff is happening out in the open with a bunch of people watching and no one tries to help? What kind of planet of pansies is this? 5-John C. Reilly's character, he arrested Quill right (a few times from what he said) and he has Quill on speed dial on his phone? 6-Yondu (the blue guy) keeps bring up how everyone else wanted to eat Quill but he stopped him, DUDE WE GET IT! Move on! 7-When they escape the prison, Quill just hands them his ship as he goes back for his Walkman. Why did he trust them, sure they helped break him out, but they could have just take the Milano for themselves and not looked back. That would have made for a short movie.8-Quill puts on his mask and can fly through space. HOW? His body is still exposed to space, and the top of his head is too because his hair stick out when the mask is on. Other than looking cool, what good is the mask really? And there were others but that is neither here nor there.Guardians of the Galaxy?GO SEE IT! If Marvel keeps this streak up, there is no way any DC comics movie or Justice League movie will be able to top this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The script for this movie should be hung next to the Mona Lisa, because it is a piece of art! Never in a million years thought this would be the best Marvel movie yet, but it is!! Get used to the name Chris Pratt because you're going to be seeing a whole lot more of him! The only thing I was upset about was that I did not coin the nickname "Star Lord" for myself! He's everything Hollywood was hoping that Dane Cook, and Ryan Reynolds could be when they took a shot on those guys! Pratt is the future #NoHomo. So often in these movies you get a really good lead actor, and then the supporting cast isn't believable. Or maybe the lead actor is to much of a try hard, and then the supporting cast has to pick up the slack, but leaves you wishing the lead actor was better. I've seen a lot of these movies and I can say that the cast and script was picked perfectly. I was skeptical at first of what changes Disney would make to the Marvel movies when they took over, but so far they're killing it! I think if Siskel and Ebert were both alive to witness the Disney take over of Marvel they would give it 2-thumbs up even if they aren't all that into Sci-Fi films! I'm excited for the next one</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dare to say that this movie, considering modern day standards can be compared to movies like for an example Star Wars (1977) and Indiana Jones (1981). I would have never thought that i'd see movies with such high entertainment value as those ever again. It is so rare to see movies with such likable and identifiable characters and so well thought pacing. This movie had me thinking movies of my childhood and what makes them so unique, and at the same time had that something fresh what i've been craving for so long. The team of heroes is very well balanced, although some of them steals the show sometimes here and there. I think the reason why i compared this movie to Indiana Jones and Star Wars is that the humor between the characters is quite similar most of the movie.I was a little disappointed on the main antagonist though. And some jokes were a little out of place considering the overall spirit of the movie. For those two things i lower my score from ten to nine.This is the the roller-coaster ride of this year emotion-action-humourwise!Ps. Rocket Rocks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fresh Fun Filled Entertaining Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rag-tag group of has-beens ban together to stop a ruthless villain who wants nothing to do but destroy cities killing millions. Guardians of the Galaxy was a huge gamble of Marvel, branching away from a well known formula to introduce a completely new universe, with odd creatures such as a talking raccoon, with no big A list stars and based on a property that very little people knew about. Guardians of the Galaxy was without a doubt a huge gamble and fortunately for them, it paid off in spades. Just when the Marvel films started to feel a tad stale and routine, here comes along a fresh fun filled film that is an entertaining ride from start to finish. I had a lot of fun with this film and it's been awhile since we've had fun at the movies. Dark, depressing, brooding films seem to make out summer blockbuster schedule, heck even the last two Marvel outputs were pretty dark (Captain America and Thor) but Guardians breathes new life into the summer blockbuster and more importantly the Marvel universe. The cast seems to really gel well together, even Dave Bautista, a wrestler with little acting experience, seems natural here getting some of the biggest laughs. Both Groot and Rocket Raccoon are computer marvels that have both heart and laughs. Of course finally Star Lord himself does his Han Solo with the right charm and wit. Gunn's films always blend comedy into whatever genre he seems to be diving into: Horror (Slither) Superhero (Super) and now Sci/fi-Action with Guardians. Gamora is the one character who never plays anything for laughs, her character is too serious to let the jokes fly, but she is a deadly assassin. Gunn uses a beautiful colour palette here reminiscent of Blade Runner and The Fifth Element. A welcome sight to these eyes. Guardians loves to bath in the colour it introduces to us. It loves its characters, action, self awareness and most of all, music. The music in Guardians plays into the story as well. You'll sometimes fight the urge to dance in your seat. I can't recommend this film enough. It's sheer fun that is non-stop entertainment. Chris Pratt is about to burst onto the scene and I look forward to more Guardians to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"They call themselves the Guardians of the Galaxy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of those films where nobody was sure how it would do. Many were unfamiliar with the characters and it was going to be a difficult task to introduce the characters to mainstream audiences. But then we got hooked on a trailer, with people loving the music and quickly opening up to this new band off a-holes. Whilst it's not the major overhaul of the standard marvel formula that some were hoping for, Guardians of the Galaxy is both enjoyable and successfully introduces audience to a different kind of superhero.Part of the appeal of the the characters is that they're not the usual heroes. There's Starlord (Chris Pratt), a space bandit who acts like a goof and was taken from earth at a young age. Gamora (Zoe Salanda), an assassin who was raised to be the perfect weapon. A revenge obsessed murderer named Drax (Dave Bautista). A talking tree whose vocabulary is limited to "I am Groot" (Vin Diesel). And an aggressive genetically altered Racoon named Rocket (Bradley Cooper). They're greedy, rule breaking rogues who usually act only for themselves. The only reason they're saving the universe is because they were put in a situation where they had to. They're different from the normal heroes because we're not all sure that they will do the right thing. Since many audiences weren't familiar with the characters the film did a good job of introducing them. The exposition never feels forced and we progressively learn more about the characters as the film goes on.By learning more about these characters, we actually begin to feel for them. Each characters seems to blend hilarious comedy with great tragedy. Take for example Rocket Raccoon. At first he makes us laugh with his aggressive personality and small demeanour. But then we learn about his insecurities about feeling judged for being different and alone in the universe. By the end of the film we begin to feel genuinely sorry for him. This is thanks to the great performances from each of the main cast who successfully combine comedic delivery with genuine sentiment in their performances. Just like other memorable team superhero films like X-Men or Avengers, Guardians does a great job at juggling its characters. With so many great actors getting roles in the film (John C Reilly, Karen Gillan and Benicio Del Toro to name a few) the script does a great job to give every character there own funny and memorable moment. Then there's the soundtrack. It is a 'best of' remix of some of the most memorable tracks of the 70's, with classics like 'Hooked on a Feeling' and 'I Want You back' certain to make this a high itunes seller. It performs many important roles in the film. Sometimes it sets the tone for a cool action sequence. Others it will create some funny completely out of the blue moments. It even plays an important role in the story, acting as Starlords only link to earth to create a touching back story to the character. Whilst it didn't link too much to the rest of the current marvel film universe, it did begin to further establish Thanos to audiences and establish potential future story lines. Fortunately unlike others like Iron Man 2 that became all about establishing future films, Guardians never lost focus on the humour and action that makes the film so great. And by doing so it leaves us wanting to see some more of this part of the universe.</fullReview>

It would have been nice to know a bit more about the villains and Nova Corps however. I can't wait to find out more about Star Lord's father and what this new team will be doing next. The jokes made us laugh, the action was intense and satisfying and I think I felt teary once or twice, but no strong emotion left with me from the theater as it did after watching The Avengers; Captain America, the Winter Soldier; and Thor, the Dark World. Well, actually I did have one lasting emotional response, after seeing the scene following the final credits. I felt a resounding "NOOOOOOOOOO!" in my brain because I saw the first one. Please Marvel - don't go there! Any of us who saw the first one won't even be tempted to view another. July 2016 add: I was referring to a return of "Howard, the Duck" which I saw in the theater in 1986. One of the worst movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Intro to the Guardians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the film I had mixed feelings. I came to the conclusion that I love these characters so much it's hard for me to see them portrayed differently than how they should be (appearance-wise and personality-wise). I remember having the same feeling after seeing The Incredible Hulk the first time (Hulk is my absolute favorite) but luckily after a good night's rest and a long introspective solitary car ride I was able to get past it.I saw it (Guardians) again the next day and loved it more. I think the film did the best possible job of introducing these characters to the largest audience possible and accomplishing financial success.That being said I wish Drax and Gamora would have had more intensity in their performances. I loved the intensity in Nebula and Ronan although I thought both characters were wasted to a degree (Ronan should not have been defeated so easily and certainly not killed). I really wanted more of Nebula and Ronan, exploring the motivations behind Ronan's fanaticism (making him feel more three dimensional and believable). Wanted more of the Collector too (another waste of a great actor). Thanos too lacked the dark menace I wanted to see (he just didn't feel as epic nor as evil as he could have). Yondu's Yakka Arrow was brilliantly realized but he himself was barely a shade of who the character should be.Loved Rocket and Groot! Star Lord was funny but not the character I wanted more of. I understand why the film goes overboard on the humor. If you can get an audience laughing you can get them to go along with just about anything you want (and for a story as crazy as the Guardians it was a sure fire way of ensuring success with such a questionable property). But Marvel has got to start ratcheting up the tension. A story that requires the Guardians of the Galaxy should be one of universal peril, something that dwarfs the stakes that any earthbound hero deals with. And when you are introducing someone as dark as Thanos things need to feel dire. Ronan is a serious threat but the movie treats him almost like a cartoon character (again I understand why, it's a kid's movie for god's sake) but still- there's a line between doing what it takes to be successful and doing a story justice. The film seemed streamlined the hell out of (which is great for today's A.D.D. audiences but does little to create any real substance).I hope Marvel has shaken all the laughing out of their systems and we finally get another dire epic like Captain America 2. Let's hope Avengers 2 is more serious. All in all I do really enjoy the film. It didn't have the "Wow Effect" on me like Cap 2 or Avengers but I did seriously enjoy it more the second time after the disappointment wore off. I think (hope) it is one of those films that gets better the more I watch it.My hopes for Guardians 2: I hope they take it more seriously. I hope Gamora gets her gold circles around her eyes and shows her truly deadly side. Lose about 70% of Drax's scars/tattoos and amp up his intensity. More Nebula (I loved Karen Gillan's performance). With Thanos being in cahoots with Death let's bring back Ronan for another ride and flesh him out (Lee Pace is too good to just throw away). Increase the threat and darkness surrounding Thanos's character (make him feel scary as hell). What about the Collector's other Infinity Gem? Where the hell is that? More Collector. Soon Marvel needs to start laying the groundwork for either Captain Mar-Vell or Adam Warlock (the only men able to defeat Thanos). The Guardians need to start recruiting real power players in the next film (either Warlock, Mar-Vell, Nova ((Richard Rider)), or Quasar). And make Groot more gnarly.Either the above requests or give us Kang The Conquerer and introduce us to the Guardians of the Galaxy from the year 3014 (the originals) and bring us a united front of both teams of Guardians (including the REAL Yondu) together to take down Kang. I'd love that! Sorry to ramble on for so long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I AM GROOT!" There, that's my review. Lol, in all seriousness, Guardians of the Galaxy was a fantastic movie. First of all, it was absolutely hilarious. The only superhero movie to date that I think rivals it in pure humor is Thor 2 but that was largely thanks to one person, Kat Dennings. This film has great laughs thanks to every character. From Peter Quill constantly fighting his ego to Gamora's "who put the sticks up their butt" misunderstanding to Drax not being able to understand metaphors to Rocket's abrasive edge to Groot's incredible dialogue, they all provide laughing moments throughout the film. The action sequences were done really well, as is to be expected from Marvel these days. The plot also unfolded nicely. I was worried in the beginning that they were trying to stretch the audience's attention too thin and have too many plot elements going on at once but they merged fairly quickly and developed well. I still would've preferred for this element of the Marvel universe to stay separate from the Avengers but hey, it's still very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians? Galaxy? James Gunn nailed it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the best examples that Marvel would not hesitate to break the limits and go on expanding the universe. And also with James Gunn on both director's seat, Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing but a masterpiece as it's the 10th film of the Marvel Universe. Gunn has proved himself in dark humor and also elevating climaxes in both Slither and Super (especially Super). And in GotG, we can see that he is taking them both to a whole another level. And Chris Pratt, he is what you would expect him to be, but it doesn't mean a bad thing, because I don't think that no one would be more appropriate for the role of Star-Lord. He is funny as always in GotG too. The story that Gunn has brought together is both compelling and makes you curious. As for the scenes, you can expect what you can expect from a Marvel film and multiply it with 10 times and add some Star Wars awesomeness to it, and there you have the Guardians of the Galaxy. Film is, as you expect, revolves around a lot of CGI but you shouldn't worry about it because it flows perfectly in the film. If you want to see the one of the best franchises of this year, you must go see this, especially in an IMAX theater if you care more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The review: Typical superhero movie? No freaking way. Good movie? For sure. A combination of so many different types of movies and genres, a witty, action filled space romp with characters worth rooting for. It's more just a Sci-if movie than a superhero movie and more like "The Fifth Element" than "Iron Man".At the beginning we are introduced to Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) as a boy who goes through the loss of a family member and is then basically abducted by a spaceship. This is an event that will be referred to throughout the duration of the film. The unlikely band of "a-holes" meet each other and kind of join together within the first half hour, and each member has their own distinct look, sound, and issue. The group consists of Peter (Pratt) who would like to be called "Starlord" and seems to be a thief with not a lot of regard for others, Gamora (Saldana) with some unknown motivations, Drax (Bautista) whose family was killed by Ronan, Rocket (Cooper) who is partners with Groot (Vin Diesel) and at first wish to collect a bounty on Quill. When thrown into a prison for various reasons the unlikely team collaborate to humorously escape and chase after the mysterious orb that Quill steals at the beginning. With a few miscellaneous details and plot twists the majority of the film involves the acquisition of the orb and retention of it and trying to stop Ronan, this in no way got old to me, or mundane. The chemistry of the main characters, their desire to not care "too" much, a smart script, some incredible direction, special effects and some solid action make this one a keeper. While not in line with the typical Marvel superhero genre, this one breaks the mold and is an enjoyable Sci-fi actioner with humor and heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bravo! Not long after the release of the outstanding Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Marvel did it again with Guardians of the Galaxy and now I have a new personal favorite. This is their best work for me because of how funny, unique and thrilling it is. The characters have interesting backgrounds and their interactions are always a lot of fun to watch. The movie also has plenty of heart because they share a troubled and sad past so you end up getting emotionally invested by them. It's extremely tough to pick an absolute favorite character as each one of them has a moment to shine here. James Gunn directed and co-wrote the film, achieving a perfect balance of humor, style, action and character development. Guardians of the Galaxy reminded me of the first time I watched Star Wars: Episode IV ? A New Hope, giving me the same feeling of awe and exhilaration. It's the type of movie that instantly makes you want to experience it again right after seeing it. Everything was so fresh and exciting, being another admirable work from Marvel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite my rating, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The first film since 'The Dark Knight' to receive a 4-Star rating on average by critics. I honestly did not expect things to go so well for this movie, but here we are. All things considered, the only drawback I have is Batista's acting skills. He's an awesome WWE personality, but that's where he truly belongs. While his portrayal of Drax the Destroyer left something to be desired, it doesn't take away from the rest what makes this film so great. The stand-out is Rocket Raccoon (voiced perfectly by Bradley Cooper), who always managed to steal the show. Gamora is probably the sexiest alien woman I've ever seen, lol. The visual effects and sound are phenomenal. The soundtrack is amazing and the first great shot of Thanos does not disappoint. I am eagerly awaiting the next Marvel installment in it's seemingly-endless array of fantastic films - being, of course, 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron.' This film, as far as I'm concerned, is worthy of nominations for Best Production Design, Best Makeup &amp; Hairstyling, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Visual Effects. Possibly Best Original Score is there isn't anything else to use as a space-filler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director James Gunn, who started his career out doing b-movies (and showed respected for his roots, by giving his ex-boss, Lloyd Kaufman of Troma films a "don't blink or you'll miss it" cameo) does an amazing job with this big budget special effects spectacular.Not just for fans of comic book superhero movies, its an awesome space opera able to stomp it with such big dogs like Star Wars and Star Trek. One of the most incredible action adventure films I've seen that was exciting and just so much fun to watch.Chris Pratt as the Terran outlaw, Star Lord gives an A-list performance that reminded me of such pulp style heroes as Flash Gordon and Buck Rodgers. Pratt was able to humanize Star lord with a comedic performance that did not lesson the Heroics. Makes me want to see this guy in more leading man roles.Zoe Saldana is the reigning Queen of Sci-Fi, even without adding her turn as Gamora, the sexy green skinned, tough as nails assassin to her credit. I'm becoming such a huge fan of Dave Batista out side of the wrestling ring, as an actor. He really showed us that he has what it takes in this film. Bradley Cooper as Rocket Raccoon was Hilarious and it was fun hearing Vin Diesel as Groot, a plant man of few words.The main antagonist, Ronan the Accuser was pretty cool too. I'm not to familiar with this side of the marvel comics, but I did like seeing the small references all over the movie. Like the movie adaption of the Nova Corps. They fit so much of the Marvel Universe into one movie and it's so amazing that it worked out so great.Just like Iron man, Marvel was able to turn a low level comic book into a must see summer block buster.</fullReview>

My favorite character who I thought was the best was Gamora (Zoe Saldana) she played very well, and fought in the movie very intensely. My second favorite character would be Drax the Destroyer (Dave Batista) his humor in the movie was incredible how he wouldn't understand certain things that our society says today, enjoyed! Like I said before it was an awesome movie with humor and ton of action that anybody would love! I honestly have never seen anything like it!

		<fullReview>Marvel delivers entertainment, special effects and usually a boatload of action. But with the relative success of Pacific Rim, (and as memory dims on John Carter) Marvel/Disney is probably wondering if it's property is sometimes a bit of a trap.I understand that in the franchise world, a one off film with new characters is a ridiculous risk, and this probably accounts for why the film is so very conservative in nature. The film trades the usual minor philosophical dilemma for fairly weak humour. It is a well trodden journey in familiar surroundings, at least told with panache and great visual effects. But I must say, there is something impressive about the rendition of a tree and a raccoon, and in fact all around the effects are pushing the bounds of what we've seen before.Very entertaining, but urgently forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film with high hopes.I was not disappointed! The cast was spot on, coming from an old reader of the comic series. They introduced the Kree to the Marvel Comics Universe (FINALLY!), and every single one of the actors cast as the Guardians was SPOT ON! I am a casual fan of professional wrestling, and I am not a fan of Dave Bautista. I understand that most professional wrestlers are excellent actors, but didn't expect much of Bautista as Drax the Destroyer. Instead, Bautista acted out his role to perfection, as did every one else in the film.I honestly wasn't expecting much from Rocket Raccoon (considering he's entirely CGI) or Groot. Instead, Rocket was voiced to perfection and amusing, and Groot stole the show.There was a great mixture of emotion, action, and campy humor to make this film an icon in the Marvel Cinematic repertoire. The cheesy 70s and 80s soundtrack made the film so much better, for which I commend director James Gunn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delivers on its Promise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't be fooled by my review.Guardians of the Galaxy won't help you achieve enlightenment, fall in love or lose weight.Especially if you're the chick who sits beside me, crushing a popcorn tub singlehanded.But if you're looking for a great movie this weekend, you won't find anything better on the big screen. Guardians delivers what it promises, and more.That being said.As is always the case with Marvel Studios productions, some won't enjoy it. Guardians isn't part of the superhero genre, however.It's science fiction. None of the characters are 'superheroes.'Technically thus comprises the ragtag band: one human, two aliens (one genetically enhanced), one anthropomorphic raccoon and one humanoid plant.It belongs in the intergalactic genre; the same barrel as Star Wars and Star Trek.If that sounds displeasing, you may be in the same boat as the douchey dude two seats down from me.The opening scene's a tearjerker, and I'm 'swept up,' so to speak.It takes place on Earth and involves nothing extraterrestrial. At the emotional climax he speaks."Is this when the raccoon shows up?" Douchey Dude asks the Popcorn Vacuum.Not only is it unfunny and in bad taste, it's illustrative of his mindset. He's completely unwilling to buy in.His wrap-up comment post-viewing is, "It was all corny."If he's so above it, why go in the first place?I try to avoid personal yarns but am endlessly astounded by the behavior of other adults. If you can't let yourself enjoy the movie, then don't go see it.James Gunn, the writer/director is just a great guy. He's been on the Adam Carolla Show twice recently. He's enthusiastic, intelligent and wants to do the sequel if the first is received with public favor.In his latest appearance on Carolla's podcast, Gunn claims they cast Chris Pratt as the lead when the actor was out of shape. But it's clear Pratt got physically fit by the time shooting rolled around.Zoe Saldana is the queen of science fiction. She plays a major role in both of the more recent Star Treks and wears similar makeup in Avatar. Saldana's phenomenal as Gamora, and you can tell she does a lot of her own stunts.Plus she's enchanting. It's odd how lovable she can be with all that makeup on.Bradley Cooper is almost unrecognizable as the voice of Rocket, the raccoon everybody's been talking about. As per the usual, Cooper's great.This is Vin Diesel's second voice-over role as a humanoid being. Not only is he the voice of Groot in Guardians, he's also the robot in The Iron Giant (1999).Karen Gillan's performance is particularly noteworthy. She's a Scottish actress who's quite prevalent in Doctor Who, and played a role in last year's Oculus.Gillan's terrifically menacing as the bionic woman. She's creepy and evil and fits the tone of the movie perfectly. Hopefully we see more of her in the future.It's overall a balanced, vastly diverse cast of characters. The sum total of which makes for a well- acted movie.Guardians does a lot of things right. The writing constantly defies convention and satirizes common sci-fi themes.For example, when the heroic outlaws ask for help from the authorities, it's a relief to see their call's considered, rather than immediately dismissed.Much like the humorous discussions of plan creation, Guardians masterfully navigates clichés.Location and contextual details are presented in a cool and efficient fashion. Digital readouts accompany interstellar approach shots of planetary environments as the perspective transitions between settings.The shooting, editing, cinematography, music and score are all impressive. I think it's time we retire "Ain't No Mountain High Enough," from all future soundtracks, though. That song belongs to Remember the Titans.Despite some overcompensating laughter in the theater, the humor is strong and consistent.Although the end credits leave much to be desired, the opening credits are informative and wildly entertaining.There is a lot of action, both hand-to-hand and aerial combat. It's well choreographed and thrilling.I wonder what percentage of the on-screen material is CGI. It must be upwards of fifty percent; but it all looks realistic.My only criticism regards the scene after the credits.It's a major disappointment if you don't understand the reference. I'm almost twenty-five and although I've heard of it, I'm still outside the joke.If the reference is slated toward an audience older than me, why can't this movie be rated R?I know all the answers to my question; they're just infinitely dissatisfying.And I was hoping for something that gets us looking forward to the sequel.Regardless. It's a tiny failure in an otherwise remarkable film.Guardians of the Galaxy is cute, thrilling and fun.It's everything we can ask from PG-13.</fullReview>

The post credits scene with Howard The Duck was totally unexpected and has left me wondering how it will tie in with the next movie... Does Howard join the Guardians? Or maybe the Avengers in Avengers Age Of Ultron? That said, this movie was worth ALL the hype! Action, a bit of romance, some sad scenes and plenty of stuff being blown up! Such a twist at the end to find out that Star Lord was in fact part alien himself, his father being an ancient powerful being... wonder who that might be.. All in all, it is worth every dollar spent and every minute in the theater!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE Marvel movie you need to see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel has done it.Year by year, movie by movie, they've built up a universe with their main Avenger characters so engaging and entertaining that every new film crushes box office numbers and critic reviews alike. But this time, they've push their limits even further.They took The Guardians of the Galaxy ? a collection of characters nowhere near their top tier roster ? and not only made a movie worthy of the Marvel universe?they may have made THE BEST MOVIE in the Marvel universe.Let's go a step further ? Guardians of the Galaxy might be the best movie you'll see this year. Period.It's a bit difficult to pin down Guardians of the Galaxy as just sci-fi, because it blends so many other elements. This movie is WAY FUNNIER than you thought it would be, and at the time same, way more emotionally gripping than you were ready for. The casting is damn near perfect. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, and Bradley Cooper are all home runs. Dave Bautista does surprisingly well. Vin Diesel repeats the same 3 words for the whole movie, and still steals your heart away. Karen Gillan is terrific. Michael Rooker is an absolute joy to watch, in a role that I thought would have been a terrible fit for him. The only short fall you might find is Lee Pace as Ronan, this movie's main villain. That's not to say that he does a bad job, but it's very possible that Rooker and Gillan's also-villainous roles just steal some of the spotlight from Pace. Let's talk about the soundtrack. Outside of the orchestrated pieces, Guardians is purposely heavy on 80's cheesy-pop music. The music ? specifically, the songs on Peter Quill's "Awesome Mix-Tape" ? are Peter's only remaining link to earth, and serve a dual function. Not only does the music serve as an emotional tether to Peter's past, but it gives the audience a very grounding effect on the grand scope of space. You'll be flying from planet to planet, viewing spectacular backdrops, but the music will make you feel as if it's all normal, the way Quill has become comfortable in space. The soundtrack is truly an unsung hero of this movie.Quick notes: - The action isn't the best you'll get out of a Marvel flick, but the space fights are terrific. (You might even say a bit Star Wars-esque.) - The movie looks good graphics-wise, but 3-D isn't entirely necessary. - The ending is fantastic. - Of course, stay through the credits. But be warned ? the final post- credit scene probably has nothing to do with any future Marvel movies. It is, however, a huge nod to the comic-savvy fans out there.Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the reasons we still love movies. Marvel wins the summer?again. 5 out of 5 on the BDBOS.

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy needs no introduction. It's tag-line is simply "You're Welcome" and that is about the most appropriate tag-line I can remember in recent history. Guardians is the best film of the summer, of the year, and of Marvel's entire roster. Here is a film with five of the most interesting, unique, lovable, bad-ass, and developed characters in film history. They have truly sensational interplay together that will have you laughing harder than any comedy this year. In addition to the tears from laughing, there are moments of true emotion and heart with the potential to move you to tears. The entire film is sheer perfection, from its action and effects to its big laughs and moments worthy of cheering. It is one of the most stylish and entertaining sci-fi films ever made. Bravo Marvel, Bravo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best marvel films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching every marvel feature film as of recent times, including all captain America, iron man, Thor and avenger movies, I must say that guardians of the galaxy is a breath of fresh air!It is the perfect combination of drama, action, comedy and coolness! Each character lends perfectly to the team, rather than trying to dominate it (as you see in a way with avengers) and also gets to tell a bit of a story with their background and allows you to relate and connect with them to understand how they got to be who they are at the time of the movie. While I haven't seen the actual comics for these characters, from a movie point of view, I felt each character had enough depth and would be well received by different demographics in the audience - i could hear the laugher from the rest of the crowd.The other thing that was great if you are a fan of the marvel movies is the links to its other films and other random things. While I can tell you how amazing the action and graphics were - which of course they were since its a marvel film..! It was at the subtle little hints that gets thrown around regarding other characters and story arcs in the marvel universe! Featuring a decent case - and Bautista can actually act! I've got to say that this is definitely up there with one of the best marvel films to date!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very pleased with how whelmed I was when I saw this movie. I had very high expectations for it, and it delivered on all fronts. I honestly did not expect there to be so much comedy involved throughout the whole thing, but they went that route and it definitely paid off. Although, I will admit there was a bit of clumsy dialogue when it came to introducing the characters. As I expected, the movie picked up and we got to the real meat of the film. Out of all of them, of course, the one who stood out was Rocket Raccoon. He was meant to be the cool character that everyone loved, and he played the part very well. Even Batista, a wrestler in his first major motion picture, played off a very good Drax. I say that not knowing how Drax was depicted in the comics, but I could just tell, he did very well.Then there came our dancing hero, Chris Pratt, who is very quickly becoming a household name. I love Parks and Recreation, and I love the Lego movie, and I am proud to say that I would trade both of those for his part in this. This has to be the best we have seen him yet (especially since he so obviously bulked up for the role.) As the movie so eloquently hinted at, we will be seeing a sequel, so I say bring it on! If it was made with the intent of a sequel, I can't see a reason it would fail so have at it! I'll just sit here and wait.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just start by saying I'm a huge fan of the Marvel Universe and all of the previous films and I always get excited for the prospect of a new marvel universe film being released. However this one was different, having seen the trailer a few times it just wasn't ticking any of the right boxes for me and I felt like for the first time I could be disappointed by a Marvel Film.However this was not the case, this film will leave you mesmerised. I don't even know where to begin first off the sound track is immense and the acting is first class, the film itself is jam-packed with action from end to finish and it's also filled with pure comedy gold. The last time I went to a cinema screening and heard so much laughter must have been The Hangover which is an amazing testament to this film which isn't even billed as a Comedy on the IMDb genre listings.The film's main character is Quill, an unconventional hero to say the least who we get introduced to when he attempts to steal a special orb that is wanted by the evil Ronan. When he ships an assassin, the green skinned Gamora, to recover the orb, the pair find themselves in the Kiln (Prison), along with the most suspect bounty hunter a loud mouthed raccoon and his muscle which is none other than a walking limited talking tree. You manage to learn a lot about the characters throughout the film and develop feelings for them and understand their struggles and want to see them succeed.My one piece of advice for any movie fan would be to go out of your way to see this film! It really is a serious contender for film of the year and I can give a 100% guarantee that it will break into the IMDb top 250 by the end of the month.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to watch this in the Liverpool IMAX, which I have to say is the only way to watch this film and it turned out to be one of the best films I have ever seen. It has everything, one of Marvels best films. When I first heard about this film I did not know what to expect,I have read the comics but I didn't expect them to produce it so well. In IMAX it will literally blow your mind, I was captured from the beginning of the film and it was just none stop action, it has funny bits in it as well which had be laughing out loud. The effects in the film were outstanding, the story line was well written and the acting brilliant. The one liners in the film had me in tears, totally made the film for me. Each character was picked perfectly from the handsome,sarcastic and incredible cheeky Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) who happens to find a band of unlikely friends to take on Ronan. There is the all out sassy and master assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana)a rather small but incredibly angry raccoon by the name of Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and his rather large and all round nice guy and bodyguard Groot (Vin Diesel) who is indeed a walking &amp; semi talking tree man and how could I forget Drax (Dave Bautista) the tough guy with massive vendetta. I would defiantly watch this film as soon as possible and you will not regret it, a brilliant film and again one of the best if not the best film I have ever seen! I am going to watch it again soon!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expectations: Blown Away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit, when I first heard that Marvel was doing a Guardians of the Galaxy movie, the only thing I could think was "Really?" in a rather disappointed tone as if Marvel had lost their mind. After Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America, The Avengers, (yes) Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, and Captain America: Winter Soldier, they green lighted a GotG movie? What were they thinking?Then I saw the first trailer, and it caught my interest, but I still just couldn't picture it. Not along side the greatness of the previous Marvel movies. It just didn't seem like it would be a good movie to me. I couldn't conceive of what possible plot they could have come up with for a move with a raccoon and a tree.Then I saw the fourth trailer on iTunes and got rather excited. From the fourth trailer, I started to have hope. But the big problem with having hope in a movie you know nothing about is that you can get that hope dashed...quickly.But I bought my ticket anyway, giving Marvel the benefit of the doubt. After all, perfect track record so far. If anything, it wasn't going to completely suck. That much I knew.First part of the movie before the Marvel logo actually tugged at my heart. Then the part after the credits had me laughing so hard I instantly knew this was going to be a perfect movie. And not a single moment of the movie disappointed me. I laughed and I laughed, and I was excited, and I grew more excited, and I laughed some more. It was the best time I've had at the movies in years. It has been forever since I left a theater that excited to see a movie again. And I plan to see it many more times. Thank you, Marvel, for giving me a new favorite movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was like the first time I saw Star Wars...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw pictures and the announcement of Guardians of the Galaxy, I was like "Wow Marvel Studios is going to have their first dud"... then I saw the trailer and my mind changed. After seeing some amazing trailers and hearing that the critics are all gung-ho about the film, I purchased my tickets in advance to see it a day before release - in 3D (which I rarely do).The movie works so well that it reminded me of the first time I saw Star Wars when I was a kid... more like Empire Strikes Back - since I remember that as a kid. There's a sense of wonder, you want to explore the world, and most of all you want to go along side Star Lord and these quirky rag tag misfits, which one is a tree and another is a smart-ass raccoon (who might be the best part of the film).This film is a block buster that's done really well and highly entertaining. This film also serves as a tie-in with the other Marvel films and if you look carefully enough you will see a bunch of references throughout.Overall it's a fun, quirky sci-fi film that works great on so many levels and the 3D also adds to it. Hopefully it does well as the theater I was in was 10% full. Go see this, it's up there as one of the best films of the summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a different kind of marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I watched this movie because it's Marvel, but I don't know a single thing about the backstory. And also for the good-looking Karen Gillan and Lee Pace (who definitely do not look good here but more like unrecognizable). At first, it is really confusing. Not until halfway through the movie did things start to fall into place. Here are the few reasons why you should watch this movie. 1. Groot. He is really cute but also good at fighting. I reckon he will be as popular as Minions soon. 2. Rocket. He is also cute and really funny with all his puns. 3. Drax. At first you find him irritating. I think he looks like Jeremy Renner (hawkeye). He deadpans a lot. But then he became funnier when he's interacting with Groot. 4. The visuals. I think the city of Zandar look great and all their gadgets is like "Men in Black". 5. Karen Gillan. She sounds really smooth and she looks so eerie. Somehow I think Peter's mother look like her. 6. The violence. Although this movie is supposed to be lighter and not so serious, the violence is more than other Marvel movies. Want to see a "pen" stabbing in and out of people? How about impalements? You can see them here. 7. Anti-heroes. If that's your thing, you can have your fill of them. Only Groot and Peter seems the most heroic. 8. The plot is simple. Just break out of prison and run from the bad guys and get the orb. No multi-layers of intricate plot. Things I did not really like: 1. The alien makeup kind of restricts the emotions of the face? You can't tell from looking at them. 2. Zoe Saldana always plays the stoic action girl like Colombiana etc so it gets really boring. And no idea when did Peter fall in "love" with her. I'm like in Avengers there is no obvious "love". To conclude, if you like simple, funny movies, just watch this. This is the best kind of simple, funny movies. I like these kinds of movies too so I'm quite satisfied with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most fun I've had at the cinema in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to watching the movie, I didn't really have any significant expectations. Much like most people, I'd never heard of these characters before and the trailers made it seem a little too silly.But I was astounded by how fun this movie actually is. I've watched it a couple of times now and I still enjoy it very much. The story has a Star-Wars adventure-like vibe to it that works perfectly and fits the characters and the world (or should I say Galaxy?) they're in.The plot isn't terribly original but it doesn't have to be. Like the title implies the movie is mostly about the Guardians themselves and director Gunn nails that aspect of the movie completely. It's a blast seeing them mouth each other off and the humor is just spot on, by far the funniest marvel movie to date. Chris Pine and Bradley Cooper do a tremendous job with nailing the comedic aspect of the characters. Dave Bautista is, surprisingly, a little bit of a revelation in this movie and is equally hilarious, expect to see him in more movies from now on. It's not all fun and games though, the Guardians also have a vulnerable side to them which the actors portray brilliantly.The action sequences are equally great, although the last act feels a little too familiar in its setup to a couple of other Marvel movies (namely Thor 2 and The Avengers).All in all, this is the best comic book movie I've seen since the Dark Knight and one of the best movies of the year 2014.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun - Hip - Entertaining - Own This DVD For Your Library.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a film comes to the ending credits and you feel remorse because its over - you've just seen a great movie. That's exactly how I felt last night having watched Guardians of the Galaxy for the first time. I couldn't wait to get home and order a DVD online so I could watch it again and again. This movie packs so much fun and action into it you feel somewhat exhausted by all the excitement. The nostalgia of a 70's sound track is novel and shows how original the writers were in conceiving this script. The CGI is perfect and I've never seen so many moving objects in a CGI screen before and I'm told this is a tell for the size and power of the super computer used to make the incredible fighter ship scenes - it was in a word awesome and not to be missed. The acting and directing are flawless and again using live and animated characters side by side were executed perfectly. I highly recommend seeing this movie for the sheer adrenaline and over powering thrills it generates in an audience. See it at least once in a big screen movie house to get the full impact of the screen and the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>excellent movie...the music nd the performances are very good..its a must watch for me. Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. If there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. The film's unlikely hero is Quill (Chris Pratt), an eccentric gunfighter in the Han Solo mould who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil warlord Ronan. When he dispatches his top assassin, the green- skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), to recover the artifact, the pair find themselves locked up, along with the galaxy's most unlikely bounty hunters ? a gun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick (Vin Diesel) who just happens to be a walking tree. All the actors do a great job at portraying there characters, they feel real beings. You get to know about them and their struggles and you become attached to them. Every character in the movie got their time to shine, especially Rocket Raccoon who is voiced perfectly by Bradley Cooper. Everyone is pitch perfect in their roles even Batista!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Marvel Movie Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Guardians of the Galaxy" (2014) is simply the best Marvel movie yet. I saw them all, and honestly, i wasn't so dragged into a simple joy of watching a Marvel universe picture before. This one has it all and beyond. The script is so good, so funny, so not to serious about itself that it's a joy to simply listen to a characters, and what a great characters there are. Directed wonderfully by James Gunn, it's a winner from start to finish. The visuals are superb (sure Oscar nominee), the soundtrack is excellent, acting settings and all clicks on every cylinder. What is unusual for big budget flick, is that is not takes itself serious, and this is why we can't help of watching it with wonder - it's very original. MIchael Bay should watch this movie as an example and learn of how big budget movies should be made in the first place.Overall, whether you are Marvel fan or not, do your self a favor and watch this picture with your friends and I guarantee you, you will have a truly entertaining movie evening.</fullReview>

You can't play with someone's emotions so early! 11 minutes - it's funny, packed with action and good music and visuals, now I see why it is so popular :) 1h 9minutes - not much to write about so far... It is OK and nothing beyond that, you can say that I am a little disappointed... especially for a 8+/10 rated movie...1h 24minutes - it looks good though... so at least you have something to look at it because the story sucks big time...1h 43minutes - I am honestly ashamed of watching this crap and people on IMDb are giving this 8/10... just wTF!? Haha the ending is so cute! ...BUT THE MOVIE IS NOT! Make sure you watch the bonus scene after the credits.I can't say that I didn't enjoy it but it is far far away from an 8+ grade movie...

		<shortDescription>Hooked On A Feeling: Not Just Another Comic Book Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel Studies is on a roll. Guardians Of The Galaxy to the average moviegoer may seem a little silly. I say this because if you don't know anything about the comic itself one might think a talking raccoon and tree might be over the top. However I find this movie to be the most entertaining of all the original movies for each character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe(MCU). Never did I expect to feel that way before seeing this movieChris Pratt puts on a stellar performance in this film. Throughout the movie you get the sense that he put a ton of effort in preparing for the role. Not only did he meet the physical demands of transforming into Peter Quill(Starlord) but he has just enough whit, charisma, and sarcasm to get audiences laughing and cheering for his character to become the leader of the Guardians. As an actor Chris Pratt is already on his way to super stardom. (Check out the Jurassic World trailer if you need further evidence). Rocket voiced by Bradley Cooper was also a crucial role to execute for this movie. He's angry, misunderstood but in most cases you are laughing because he is so cynical you can't help but laugh. Groot is the one member of the guardians that is naturally good hearted. Even though he is limited in his verbal communication viewers can connect with his numerous acts of courage and heart. Gamora played by Zoe Saldana fits nicely in the cast. At this point she is a staple in sci-fi fanboy movies. Last there is Drax played by a former WWE star. I always roll my eyes when I see one of these guys in movies but David Bautista exceed expectations and then some. I would explain further but do not want to give up any spoilers I strongly recommend all movie lovers see this movie. It extremely well written. This is the first origin movie for a comic book where I wasn't bored at some point. There are some really intriguing pieces to the MCU universe that are revealed as well. It felt fresh which is hard to find. Phase 2 has gone well for Marvel this movie continues to heighten the bar for everyone else including Marvel itself with Avengers: Age of Ultron due out in May 2015</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action with humor and awesome soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love superheroes and fantasy stories that take place on alien planets! I also love a movie that brings out the many emotions in me. This movie delivers five unlikely misfits turned heroes with comedy and great chemistry. The main character, Peter Quill is a thief and fortune hunter. who has a very extraordinary childhood experience which brings him to inhabit an alien planet. He unwittingly recruits an alien entourage who all have their own unique powers. Combined, they are a formidable force who end up being chased by bounty hunters. The story makes you cheer for the heroes, blush at the romance between the leading man and leading lady, sniffle when things don't go well for the good guys, laugh at the bickering and in-fighting, and dance in your seat to the old school soundtrack. Plenty of spaceship explosive action and my preference, hand to hand combat! Among the plethora of alien beings is the bad guy, Ronan who creates lots of problems for everyone as he goes after the object in Quill's possession.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seen the trailer and right away wanted to see it. It has made me laugh and even cry. Never have I seen a movie that I wanted to see more then once then this one while being in the theater. The best part for me is when the flower dances and Groot (I think his name was) turns around and she stops dancing. The raccoon is pretty much my favorite char in the whole movie, just because he is who he is. I would say a must watch, if you haven't already seen it I can't wait for the sequel Guardians of the Galaxy 2 but sadly I will have to wait a little longer then two whole years before that one is even coming in the theaters. So in short, great movie, love the action and love that crazy raccoon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)What a hoot! This is a great spoof while still being a terrific action-adventure comic book romp. It is great? Aw, shucks, it ain't?but it tries so hard and has so many laughs it's a must-see. It's crazy to bother to outline the plot (it's a formula of power and evil and some sweet innocent good guys and girls against the odds). And there are so many main and minor characters you can't make that simple, either. But it's how they interact that makes it flow. And how they push and push the conventions to make it absurd and clever and truly witty. It's funny! You'll laugh, and laugh some more.Look for lots of bright humor, good character development, and clichés upon clichés. This is what it's trying to do and it does it beautifully. Expensive and expansive to make, but handled with real professional focus. A surprise, after many more routine blockbuster computer graphics superhero nonsense. Can't wait for the sequel.</fullReview>

No boring .... 2 hours of fun ........ Funniest marvel movie ..... Good addition in 2nd phase of marvel's universe ... Director give every character its funny charm you will not miss mischievous funny Robert Downey Jr. In this marvel movie .... Story is written like a comedy of dumb people and added sci-fi planets and evils of dark side ........ If you think its not good movie just because it don't behave like super-hero movie then i must tell you marvel is not making super-hero movies like DC but it make genre movies with sci- fi and action so don't miss judge the movie by its box office collection and if you like this kind of movie which i described then watch it and don't miss single movie of marvel universe's 2nd phase if you already seen all previous movies of it..... Because this will lead you to the start of third phase infinity war ..... In the end must watch comedy action by marvel .......</fullReview>

The movie was well paced and i cannot say that i did not enjoy it.It is a typical popcorn movie where you can turn off your braincells...at least when you are not into the comic stuff, i guess - because my friend and various other people in the cinema seemed to see a lot more in the characters than i did.However from the point of view of someone who usually avoids action movies and hero movies - it is a good 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a winning combination of comedy, characters, and special fx (and a little heart)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy was something I saw this past summer, and by now it should be gone from my memory, or rather a little faded. Summer blockbusters should be fun as disposable entertainments (or on the flip-side can be detrimental to your brain and well-being if they're not), and yet Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel Studios' 10th feature film in eight years, has a little more to offer than the usual. At least, it should be said, with its characters and most of its cast. Plus, it's a comedy deep down - with some tragic roots that aren't totally ignored - and it stays true to that and makes it more memorable on those grounds. If it's not THE best of the MCU flicks yet, it's probably the funniest by way of its ensemble.After little "Starlord" (yeah, it's not his name, but might as well) loses his mother at the start of the movie (and yeah, a bit of a dramatic start, but director James Gunn makes it real and impactful) and happens to get, yes, sucked up into a spaceship by some mysterious group, it cuts ahead to twenty years later as the boy is now a man (Chris Pratt), a kind of bounty hunter but for objects instead of people. Somehow one thing leads to another and he winds up in a prison, alongside a motley crew of other 'low-lifes' like Rocket Raccoon (voiced by, yes, Bradley Cooper), his companion/partner/Tree-Monster Groot (Vin Diesel), a woman (Zoe Saldana) who is actually from a family of royalty but gets shuffled out by a betrayal of sorts, and Dave Bautista as a Big-Headed Lunk named Drax who's one crutch is that he takes things very literally (including gestures that seem self-explanatory).This central ensemble is cast and played with excellent timing and a strong variety. No one member is alike, even though there's plenty of sarcasm to go around - Starlord is like a Han Solo, but to a point so is Rocket Raccoon, and of all things it's the latter who is the most 'bad-ass' of the bunch with his technical skills, though also the most unbalanced - and quirks and distrust is a-plenty. There's a lot of comedy in the writing, including some off-kilter sexual references - which, for me as a summer movie presumably meant for kids, made me giddy that they could get away with it, and more importantly that they were hilarious - but also Pratt has excellent timing and chops with everyone. And yet he doesn't play it all for laughs all the time, and when called upon to be serious or call back to his character's mother and past, he can go there too.The fact that Gunn can get the audience so worked up about this group is really endearing (he described the difference between them and the Avengers like the difference between the Stones and the Beatles, similar songs to play in a group, but varied approach to the music with Guardians being harder edged), including, yes, a giant tree and an over-bearing Meat-Head like Draxx. And there are a couple of solid supporting players who have just delightfully bizarre science-fiction/space-opera get ups (this is also a variation on Star Wars of course); Benicio del-Toro in his one scene and Michael Rooker, the best 'villain' type character of the film as Starlord's a-hole mentor, steal their scenes completely.I mention all this good stuff, not to mention some winning action set-pieces and occasionally truly spectacular special effects, because the main plot of the film isn't all that great. It's a little been-here-done-that, the Magic Item (one of the items that will eventually make up the Infinity Gauntlet) that has to be saved and protected, and a main villain via Lee Pace that just isn't interesting or compelling. He does what he can, but there isn't much room to do past what is required. It's almost as if Gunn and Nicole Perlman (the writers) knew they had to work with this boiler-plate sci-fi story, did decently, served the franchise that's continuing, and decided that the best way to make this worthwhile would be to give the really choice stuff to the heroes. For me the only thing keeping it back from the heights of The Avengers is a really captivating villain or stakes in that regard.But if you watch it for these main players, their rapore with one another, the awesomely self-conscious soundtrack (you laugh when certain songs come up, and tap your feet at the same time), and some of the wilder visuals that can come up for these planets and settings - and did I mention a f***ing raccoon is one of the great characters of the past several years in mainstream films, it must be said again - it's popcorn bliss for a couple hours and change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, bit cheesy but worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has all the same problems that a lot of Disney films have: I'm not just talking about the family friendliness of them and the inevitable cheese that brings; they also seem to have problems with their values. They always feel 'old-fashioned' like they haven't realised that the world is changing and we don't expect to see men behaving like stereotypical 'gentlemen' or 'players who meet their soul mate and change their ways'. We don't need to see the woman be saved by the man and the protagonists don't have to be white (or brown but covered with green paint). I just think that Disney need to get in touch with today's reality.Also, the CGI was fairly bad in a lot of places and the story and script were very predictable most of the time.So it seems that when you have a cheesy, predictable, old-fashioned and clichéd story to tell, the answer these days is to make sure it's funny.Which brings me to why I've given this a 7 and why I would recommend watching it: it's genuinely funny! I laughed out loud a fair few times and I was never bored.There's no real character development, most of the characters are one-dimensional but it's fun! I think this should be a TV series although the amazing Firefly didn't last long so I doubt this would either.7/10(and bring back Firefly please)</fullReview>

Star Wars ... for a new generation. And in every film, every offering, not only is a beachhead made, the start of another franchise, but as well the preparations for the next step can be seen. Further, the strategy of including little closings rewards for those who survive the Biblical length credits sequence is paying off: fully half the theater stayed at the showing I attended waiting for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a good film but not great as I found it to be a little slow in places. The beginning of the movie seemed to plod along a little and I thought it took to long to get interesting (a little like the first series of the TV show breaking bad). Thankfully when the movie actually got going it was really good, anyway all that said this movie is definitely worth watching and shouldn't be missed, especially if you like nostalgia as epic is the only word in my opinion to describe the awesomeness of the nostalgic sound track which accompanies this movie. There hasn't really been a sound track as good as this in a while. I also feel the storyline is well thought out and the acting is carried out with some good talent. I think this may very well be a movie I watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Marvel Hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians Of The Galaxy is the latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and with the recent success of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, it had a lot to live up to. I'm glad to say that Guardians Of The Galaxy is one of Marvel's best films ever made.Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), finds himself locked up in a space prison after attempting to steal an orb, that Ronan The Accuser (Lee Pace) plans to use to destroy a planet and abuse its power. In the process of being captured, Quill meets Ronan's assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana), who has betrayed Ronan, two unlikely bounty hunters Groot (Vin Diesel) and Rocket (Bradley Cooper), and Drax (Dave Bautista). The group then join forces to stop Ronan from abusing the power of the orb, which we later discover is actually an infinity stone.Guardians Of The Galaxy is a perfect blend of action and comedy. There were countless points in the movie which made me laugh, but also had the action you want from a superhero film. The cast were superb, Bautista however being the least impressive, but his performance can be forgiven due to the funny lines he provides. For me the stand out performances were by Chris Pratt and Bradley Cooper, both perfectly cast and probably the funniest two out of all of them. The storyline is compelling and perfect for a film like this. I also liked the relationship between the characters and how it develops throughout the movie.Marvel have once again proved that they are ahead in the superhero films business. Guardians Of the Galaxy is full of funny moments, great acting, and even a few surprises here and there. The 70's soundtrack will definitely be stuck in my head for many days to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Winner of Most Underrated... and probably a few Oscars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My honest opinion on why this movie has done well and is doing so well is because of the low expectations everyone had going into it. 1. Its ANOTHER formulaic, predictable, load of bullshit to make wealthy Hollywood producers more wealthy. There will be a kick-ass transformation or emergence of a superhero, the bad guy will whoop his ass the first time they meet, the character deals with some inner conflict and wins in the end possibly with the help of trusty/busty sidekicks. Seen it all before. 2. I've never heard of them before. (I'm not really into comics) It's that simple. 3. Starring in it are the fat funny moron from Parks and Rec, an animated raccoon and Vin Diesel as a tree, and the hot girl from all the Science Fiction movies but is green still hot? Let's just say the advertisements at Subway were weird and not nearly appealing as my Meatball sub.HOWEVER, the entire movie surprised me. The beginning was the emotional mandatory death of a parent. (nothing new) It wasn't as good as the beginning of "Up," but it was OK. The mysterious superhero introduction of Chris Pratt... was... perfect. I laughed my ass off because it was funny. I am 19, probably much younger than the average critic which you can most likely tell from my writing. They are marketing to my demographic I guarantee it. So when I say that I prefer this movie over almost all of those that I've seen in the last year or two. It is no beginning of an epic series such as Hunger Games, Harry Potter, LOTR, or Star Wars, but as a stand alone action film it was excellent and entertaining. I won't go too deep into the details of the plot. It wasn't anything too special or crazy but it was at the very least decent. The three way fight was cool and dramatic. The prison break was very well done and a great action sequence. The space battles looked like a cross between Star Wars and StarCraft which is a compliment. I don't want to spend too much time on the plot but I will say that even though it was 2+ hours I never once checked the time or felt fidgety. There are plenty of other areas that this film excelled in. The CGI was very well done and I'm guessing very expensive. The score was also surprisingly good for a Marvel movie. It actually made it stand out among other superhero movies, but who the hell is Tyler Bates? Why have I never heard of him? Character development, for having 6+ main characters (except for Gamora) there was a decent amount of individual depth for each character. What I really wanted to comment on and give attention to was the brilliant writing and humor that went into this movie. The dancing at the beginning was funny. When Rocket said he was kidding about needing the prosthetic leg, I actually laughed out loud. When Drax said he was "thinking about something else," it was hysterical! Why isn't this type of humor more common in the movie industry!? This is why people are watching far more TV dramas than movies these days. A lot of critics on here disregard the jokes in this film as "average superhero one-liners." Umm I thought they were funny. As I said before I think many people went into this movie with their mind already made up and with the film in its categorical box. This movie is VERY different than most modern superhero movies. Chris Pratt wasn't trying to be a Robert Downey Junior Iron Man or an obnoxious punk, rebooted Spiderman. Chris Pratt plays his own unique, off beat, charming, ORIGINAL character. (I think some of the credit should go to the under appreciated writers by the way *cough cough*) And yes this movie was packed with pop culture references such as StarLord's mix tapes filled with retro pop songs. Why are pop culture references looked down upon in movies? Television dramas such as Sherlock, House of Cards, and Parks and Rec thrive on pop culture references. Look how well all of those shows are doing. There were just a few things that I absolutely loved about the writing though. Now whether it was scripted or improvised, Chris Pratt's dancing was just perfect. When do you ever get to see a white man not suck at dancing in a movie? Its light, comedic, fun, it gives us kind of a break in an intense action movie. I don't know it was just different... The other thing that I loved was that the evil Ronan never got to finish his evil monologues. Why is it that in the midst of the most hellish, chaotic battles or fight scenes that the bad guy always has time to give a brief autobiography, an in-depth explanation of his evil plan, tell us what what he's majoring in, and why his favorite color defines his personality or whatever? I'm pretty sure that this only happens in Hollywood (I'm guessing). In GOTG every time he is in the middle of his diabolical speech he gets interrupted by the metal hull of a ship or Chris Pratt's dancing. It's just something I wish would happen more often. I just loved Ronan's "what the hell is going on" face, it made me chuckle. I'll wrap this up by saying that I went in only hoping that Stan Lee's cameo would be funny (which is was) and that by the end I would learn a little about the modern struggles of a talking raccoon from his point of view. I ended up being fully satisfied for two hours and two minutes. Great job everyone! P.S. why wasn't the dancing Groot clip the after-credit surprise? The other one was lame as hell and I had to pee :(</fullReview>

For a movie to be in that list it should have something intriguing, something out of the ordinary, something unique. The Guardians of the Galaxy is not such a movie, it is a good action-comedy, like Bad Boys, good but not special, not unique, it is boring. I lost my time for the first time due to IMDb advice and hope it never happens again.

		<fullReview>I've never really liked any of the Marvel movies except the X-men. Thor was weak, Iron Man felt like an extension of Marvel's own narcissism, Captain America was ridiculously cheesy, and The Avengers blew so hard I can't even believe it. But I love Superhero movies and so I thought I might as well give Guardians a shot because of all the praise it was getting. Turns out, the hype was actually real. This movie impressed me from start to finish, never relenting in its amazing pace that never felt too fast or too slow. The film cycled between sadness, humor, and action in the most fluid of ways that never removes you from the experience, but instead deepens it with each shot fired, tear shed, and joke cracked. All the other top notch movies I've seen only really excel in one genre (humor, action, etc.) but Guardians nailed all it attempted. The soundtrack was awesomely throwback in a way that makes sense but also conjures thoughts of nostalgia to when we also dreamed of being awesome, young at heart space adventurers ourselves. The cast is superb with everyone really delivering their intended part. Chris Pratt and Bradley Cooper really shine above the rest. I usually don't give 10s to movies but I can't find anything bad to say about it (except a lame after credit scene, but that's not even part of the actual movie). A well deserved 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dopey, silly, touching, thrilling, poignant, heartfelt, hilarious... there's just too many words to describe "Guardians of the Galaxy"- arguably Marvel's best film yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A definition:"Entertainment- n. To be provided with feelings of enjoyment and/or amusement."...I firmly believe the definition should be expanded with to include "The feeling one achieves when viewing 'Guardians of the Galaxy.'""Guardians of the Galaxy" is thus far the tenth entry in the "Marvel Cinematic Universe"- the every-expanding film franchise including such heroes as Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America and others. And it was one that garnered some interesting responses and hype in the months leading up to its release. After all, this is a film that features a talking raccoon, alien species and an anthropomorphic tree.But shockingly, under expert guidance of director/co-writer James Gunn and thanks to a lot of creativity, the film flourishes and stands tall as perhaps the best entry so far in Marvel's Cinematic Universe.Chris Pratt stars as Peter Quill, a human who was abducted by aliens as a young child, and has since made a living in the universe as something of a scavenger and thief. After inadvertently connecting with a motley crew of others (including Gamora- the daughter of an evil titan played by Zoe Saldana, Drax- a vengeance-hungry alien played by Dave Bautista, Rocket- an experimental being that resembles a raccoon and is voiced by Braley Cooper, and Groot- a walking, talking plant and Rocket's pal, voiced by Vin Diesel), Quill is pulled into a struggle to save the galaxy from Ronan (Lee Pace), a ruthless alien who seeks to destroy it.This film is pure fun and grand entertainment.The performances are all perfect. Pratt strikes just the right balance of silliness and seriousness. Saldana is given a lot of room to grow as a character. Bautista proves very capable as a wrestler-turned-actor and gives a lot of great moments. Cooper is absolutely perfect as the hot-headed raccoon. And Diesel provides both wonderful belly-laughs and even some great touching moments as Groot. This is just a perfect cast.James Gunn excels at his job. Even though he started his career with the hyper-cheap Troma Entertainment, he's right at home at the helm of this ship. In addition to some fine, kinetic, fun direction, his script (which he co-wrote) has an absolutely perfect balance of story and plenty of wonderful character beats. Gunn is definitely the man for the job with this film, and there's nobody else who could have done a better job than he did.The set and costume design is first-class. The score Tyler Bates compliments the visuals well. The effects are eye-poppingly unique and gorgeous. And the wonderful soundtrack of great oldies (including everything from "Hooked on a Feeling" to "Come and Get Your Love" to "Ain't No Mountain High Enough") amazingly works well with what is on- screen.This is just a great, fun film. And it is easily the single-most entertaining movie I've seen in years. I loved it to death, and absolutely cannot wait to go back and see it a second, third, fourth and fifth time."Guardians of the Galaxy" gets a perfect 10 from me. It has to. It's charming, heartfelt, hilarious, action-packed. It's pure entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another CGI epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw Guardians of the Galaxy yesterday. I liked it but only give it a 7 out of 10. Sometimes there's such a thing as too much action. The blurring speed and short scenes just didn't work well for me in 3D. And I'm a 3D fan, having a 3D projector and 5x6' screen. At 2 hours of almost non-stop violence I was happy to leave the theater. Having put in 2 hours of yard work and standing in line 30 minutes to vote before hand, I actually nodded off for a minute. Yeah, the CGI was great and the humor well-placed, but for all the noise there was little if any suspense. My wife and I were whispering what the next scene would be and generally guessed right. It's like watching motor cross. The first few preliminaries are interesting but by the time you get to the final, who cares? Cutting it to 90 minutes would make it a better film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy. For me, one of the most anticipated movies of the year; it's set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but features characters that the majority of us have never even heard of. I was very excited going in to this so lets review. The basic premise is that a group of criminals, of various degrees, join together to stop a villain from destroying a world, I know, it sounds like a lot of sci-fi films, but that's it! This movie has so many science fiction elements but no where does it ever feel like a rip-off, it is most definitely it's own thing. I'll start with the story, as I just said it covers some familiar ground but it does it so uniquely it is extremely entertaining, from not just a plot view but also nostalgia from the great sci-fi epics you love; you do get a Star Wars feel, and then you start getting a Star Trek vibe and even Indiana Jones for some of it; but because James Gunn does a fantastic job writing and directing it is comprised of brilliantly unique twists and scenes and characters that any comedy/sci- fi fan will love. Chris Pratt as Peter Quill was entertaining, Zoe Saldana was both interesting and fun as an alien assassin; of course the voice work to both Rocket and Groot were top notch with Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel respectively. Even the wrestler-turned-actor was really good in his role as the very literal Drax bent on revenger for his family and delivered some awesome lines. Talking of lines, the dialogue in this movie is the best; the comedy, the tone, the banter it all works, definitely a few laugh out loud moments. Obviously it's a Marvel movie so the special effects are some of the best you're going to see, with mixing huge real sets with visually stunning CGI of space, and worlds and the colours are very pleasing to the eye. The only bad things I've heard about this movie was that it had a weak villain but for me Ronan had a very powerful presence, I feel that a lot of villains in the MCU have been quite weak (with the exception of Loki and possibly Red Skull) but this guy I enjoyed, he felt like a threat. My personal gripe with the movie was only very minor, first off, the beginning had a very dramatic scene and then literally seconds after it went full comedic which I thought was an awkward transition and secondly was Thanos, he was OK in the plot but Josh Brolin's American accent I felt was very obvious for an alien titan and took me out of the movie slightly. Apart from that Guardians of the Galaxy was, and always will be, AWESOMENESS.</fullReview>

I think this Movie was better than Captain America the winter solider. (WARNING THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS) I liked the part when they showed Thanos in a chair talking to Ronan and Loki's boss in the avengers. I hope Marvel would do a guardians of the galaxy and Avengers 3 in Later Avengers sequels.I think this was the funniest movie i have ever seen. (WARNING THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS) Maybe if they put in a different end credits scene it would've been better. So Overall this Movie Was funny, Outstanding, Creative, Smart, and Action-packed. I cant wait until the sequel Comes out. So for those people who haven't seen it go and see it before Avengers comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply a fun movie to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Different people will probably come away with different reasons about why this film is enjoyable: lots of aliens / monsters / spaceships, outcasts bonding together, tons of action and explosions, fast moving story, likable comedic characters, cool 70s pop/rock music, etc. For me, it was the spectacular scenery - wow ... some of it was just breathtaking to watch. The planetary landscapes and outer space visuals were especially rich and attractive. Even the animation was amazing. Rocket (racoon-like creature) is tough work for any team of animators - but he just looked 'alive' and real like all the other characters. Plus, many of the scenes featured numerous complex ships, creatures and environments with enough detail and independent movement that the universe felt believably teeming with life. Though it might have minor weaknesses here and there - it'd be misleading to dwell on any of them and not give a fellow moviegoer the highest recommendation for good summertime scifi fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy is a hugely entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I'm not a big fan of the "cosmic" elements from the Marvel universe (I prefer the more mundane and "realistic" stories), I liked the recent reboot of the comic Guardians of the Galaxy very much, thanks to writer Brian Michael Bendis' skillful hand, who applied his classic humor and perfect characterization in order to renovate the saga, making it a very amusing and quite ambitious "space opera" which took itself the freedom of playing under its own rules, without losing the respect for the established continuity. However, I didn't know what to exactly expect from the film Guardians of the Galaxy. At first sight, it feels like an anomaly into Marvel's filmography, lacking of superheroes in the conventional sense, and a director who is famous (at least among the fans of B cinema) for his twisted sense of humor and contradictory origins (James Gunn initiated his career in Troma Films while he was working as a screenwriter of the first Scooby-Doo film). Fortunately, that exotic combination of sensibilities ended up producing a hugely entertaining film with a solid emotional content, interesting characters and an excellent return to the science fiction cinema set in space, with abundant spaceships, alien races and epic conflicts which encompass entire planetary systems. But it's not a film meant to be taken very seriously (come on, one of the main characters is a mutant raccoon and another one is a tree with a face). The cast immediately assimilated that naughty tone, and brought perfect performances. Chris Pratt employs his humorous instincts and dramatic capacity very well; Zoe Zaldana brings the exact combination of toughness and sensibility to Gamora; Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel bring quite a personality to their digitally animated characters; and Dave Bautista shows an appropriate level of gravity in his character. I also liked the way in which the screenplay developed the villains, and we can count on Stan Lee's habitual cameo, even though my favorite one in here was (even though it just lasted for half a second) Lloyd Kaufman's... in a Marvel film! What's next: Ron Jeremy in Avengers: Age of Ultron? In conclusion, Guardians of the Galaxy is a very satisfactory experience which, in my humble opinion, perfectly captured the spirit of the comics, with that wink which reveals us its main objective of entertaining us, even though there are millions of lives in danger and the ending is a bit bittersweet. My only complaint against this film is that the edition falters on a few moments, obstructing the narrative with scenes and sequences which don't always "stick" correctly. For the rest, I enjoyed Guardians of the Galaxy very much, and I left the cinema very happy... specially after that post-credits scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You're fine, and you're mine, and you look so divine"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy has a defining scene late in its runtime and it's the kind of scene that summarizes its characters, situations, and humor in ways better than any analysis could do justice. The scene comes when our titular heroes are gathered in their bunker, confused and trying to concoct and develop more of their "12% plan." When they finally figure something out, each character stands up to declare their participation with Rocket Raccoon standing up last. "Now we're all standing," he states, "a bunch of jackasses." That is the best summation of Guardians of the Galaxy I've ever heard and probably will hear. The film works largely in part because it's a more lax, carefree Marvel film than we've seen over the last year or so, unburdened by the commonalities the brand has bestowed upon and the smothering sameness gift-wrapped in expensive special effects and complex pyrotechnics. While the effects and the sound engineering/mixing are nothing to shortchange or overlook, this has to be the most witty, hilarious, and consistently fun Marvel film I have yet to see, which is something the company genuinely needed in their long line of serious franchises.The film concerns Peter "Star-Lord" Quill (Chris Pratt), who was abducted from Earth by The Ravagers in 1988, shortly after his mother's death. Twenty-six years later, Star-Lord is wandering on the planet Morag when he finds a small, spherical orb that apparently holds enough significance that the evil villain Ronan places a bounty on Star-Lord's head once he learns the orb is in his possession. He also sends Gamora (Zoe Saldana), an orphan who was trained by the arch-villain Thanos, after the orb. However, one afternoon, Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and his tree-like humanoid pal Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) see Star-Lord in public and try to capture him to obtain the large bounty. After a large, violent brawl, the quartet is thrown in prison and learn that the orb is worth several billion units. In order to obtain the units, however, they will need to trust each other entirely, which proves to be more of a challenge than it already is. They also come in contact with a large, muscular, and very literal man named Drax (David Bautista), who works to help them so they can be the noble Guardians of the Galaxy.Director and co-writer (with Nicole Perlman) Gunn knows that, unlike with Marvel's The Avengers, these heroes likely couldn't sustain a feature-film on their own. However, by throwing them together, giving them numerous dialog scenes to showcase their characters' timing and humor, and develop them each considerably with their own stories and motives, he can create a film centered around some of the most likable superhero characters. Despite being a superhero, Star-Lord is entirely human and relatable, from his sassy remarks to his love for eighties music (which leads me to believe that Redbone's infectious jam "Come and Get Your Love" has never been used to greater effect than in Guardians of the Galaxy. Gamora shows her incredible energy through every scene, thanks to competent writing and a solid performance by Saldana, who seems to be just starting to break out of the female action hero archetype. Even Drax is the heart of some hilarious scenes, being that he doesn't quite understand metaphors and views everything in a firmly literal sense.But the scene-stealers are Rocket Raccoon and Groot, who compliment each other effortlessly well. Rocket Raccoon has his brash, sometimes vulgar sense of humor to back him up, consistently being an entertaining presence, while Groot's character and conversational simplicity make him a warm and easily-lovable soul. Together, the five create one of the most effortlessly fun and engaging band of heroes that challenge The Avengers in the sense that these characters don't appear to be impenetrable forces of nature. They're not invincible beings and exist on a realm that can be more directly relatable to the audience. In other words, they're the superheros for people that don't really care for superheroes.Marvel truly needed Guardians of the Galaxy in my mind; a casual, irreverent superhero film that shows misfit characters rather than polished ones and momentary pauses for some hilarious dialog rather than disjointed shouting and stale zingers. What Marvel also needed was a film that had a true sense of humor, rather than just infrequent winks to the camera or dopey little sequences of deadpan, which is what Guardians of the Galaxy bears in excess. This very feature is evident from the film's inclusion of a bold, memorable soundtrack, made up almost entirely of hits from the seventies and eighties, with the heroes' theme song "Hooked on a Feeling" by Blue Suede at the film's center. While the battles are still pretty long and often infused with some indistinguishable chaos, this proves not to be such a distracting feature since the bulk of the film is such a royal and unexpected treat.In a time where I, and I'm willing to bet several others, are experiencing incredible superhero fatigue, Guardians of the Galaxy provides the ibuprofen and the regeneration the genre and the audience needed.Starring: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, and David Bautista. Voiced by: Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. Directed by: James Gunn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy... Mini review...It's been called the boldest and riskiest move yet by Marvel Studios, with some eagerly anticipating theatrical failure...But after sitting through 2hrs of awesomeness I can honestly and safely say that Guardians of the Galaxy is a treat for the senses with a brilliant foot-tapping, head-bopping soundtrack and great humour with lots of one-liners.With a great cast and a wisecracking performance from Chris Pratt as Peter Quill/Star Lord who is clearly equal parts Han Solo and Mal Reynolds. Among other characters in the film there's Rocket played by Bradley Cooper who is positively brilliant and (dare I say it) probably one of my favourite characters in the movie.I have to agree with some critics who are calling Guardians of the Galaxy "possibly the best Marvel movie yet".Personally, I thought the movie was terrific. It's funny, it's sweet, it's exciting, it feels fresh and familiar all at once. it wears its heart on its sleeve, places tongue firmly in cheek, and never once gives up trying to impress us. It's bold to compare this to Star Wars, but the comparison is there.I won't spoil the plot or tell you what characters from the Marvel-U appear in the movie but what I will say is that it's not a superhero movie. In fact, this is a different type of movie from the Marvel studios, and that's a good thing!Oh and by the way, there's a scene after the credits although it's not a must see.Many reviews are saying this is "Star Wars for a new generation" and I'll be honest, I have to agree! I enjoyed every minute of Guardians and I'm sure will too!Here's looking forward to Guardians 2 in 2017.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pro Reviewers...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I look through some of the metacritic reviews and they leave me wondering what a person has to do, what degrees or credentials are needed, to be a pro reviewer. I was no fan boy going into GotG, it was never on my shopping list back when I was reading comics. But I found this movie to be fun, entertaining, and engrossing in the sense that I was enthralled with watching the characters interact. I personally thought that for a first GotG movie it worked in good character background and development, and loved that there were those moments where you either laugh out loud or nods your head in a sudden glimpse of understanding about why they do what they do.That said, what I don't get is why some reviewers fail to even do a google search on what the comics were about before writing their review, or heaven forbid, before viewing the movie so as to understand it in context.Instead I see hugely negative reviews, no not all the reviews but quite a few, by people who are clearly ignorant of what they are even watching. I get that they want to be heard, but trashing a movie which is clearly a hit in order to draw people to your article to find out why you hated it, is frankly childish and purely self-serving. No one says that as a reviewer you must like a movie, if it is not a movie you liked or a genre you appreciate, it might be best to clarify that. If I see a movie I don't like and I tell a friend about it, I always clarify the reasons why rather than simply trashing the writers/directors/actors/etc. Perhaps I am wrong in my assessment. I don't expect everyone to love this movie as much as I did. However, I do expect professionals to provide me with clear and solid reasons for not liking it. Even if it is just to say that it wasn't their kind of movie or they dislike comic movies or they dislike sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hooked on this Feeling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at the Guardians themselves and it is abundantly clear that Marvel still has the ability to introduce new, interesting characters to the fold. Chris Pratt's 'Star Lord' is the studios' most instantly likable and charismatic lead since Tony Stark back in Iron Man I, and the rest are just as captivating. Gamora acts as the perfect foil to Quill's flamboyance whilst the fact that Drax can only take things literally is a fountain of comedy throughout as well as showcasing an excellently subtle amount of character progression as the film progresses. However it is the almost Han Solo-Chewbacca axis with Groot and Rocket that provides the most laughs as well as emotional depth. Groot is incredibly lovable, if challenged linguistically, and Rocket is the pessimistic, criminal genius that proves that this band of heroes isn't quite as squeaky clean as Marvel's earlier characters.The whole film almost feels like an open love letter to the most famous space-based sagas of the last 40 years. The cavalier attitude of the Guardians feels very Star Wars, whilst even the guns that Quill uses could have come from the arsenal of the U.S.S. Enterprise. This is a gentle nod to the pioneering sci-fi of the late 70s and 80s and the way fact that most of the films' most serious moments are undercut with humour is also so refreshing. There has been a tendency in recent years to make superhero films go darker and darker a la Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. Now, I loved that trilogy, but it's so good to see a film that puts sheer enjoyment first. Indeed, the bad guys in the piece don't have a great deal of light to their considerable shade, with Ronan, as well as his sidekick Nebula (A shockingly de-gingered Karen Gillan) staying firmly in the Nasty Bastard category throughout. But all of this doesn't really matter, as they both do this to great effect. Moreover the stunning visuals as well as excellent sound track keeps the pace bouncy and fun.Is it perfect? Well no, but there are only a few minor things. As I've said, you could ask for a bit more depth to the bad guys' characters, but that isn't too distracting. Benicio Del Torro's 'The Collector' however was a small point of annoyance for me though, as he and his servants seemed to be a rushed plot device to try and add a bit of context to the film. Finally, (minor spoiler warning) the aerial finale is one that is strikingly similar to The Avengers, as well as this year's excellent The Winter Soldier. Does that make it less enjoyable? No not really, but this repetition could just be the only side note of caution from what is otherwise a brilliant couple of hours of entertainment.Therefore Marvel's biggest risk could just turn into its biggest success. Guardians is the fun 'heads' to The Winter Soldier's serious 'tails' on the Marvel coin of films, with both showcasing the remarkable ability for the studio to reinvent itself and not to stagnate. Stick with the sombre 10 or so opening minutes of the film and you'll be rewarded with two hours of unadulterated entertainment that flies by. The presence of 'big bad' Thanos, who we saw at the end of The Avengers, in this film further suggests that this rag tag group of unpolished heroes is here for the long haul, with this film acting a the near perfect meet and greet for them and the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most impressive film to date. I got emotional thou when his mother passed away ie possibly of cancer or something. The film starts of with family members including Young Peter(Oleff). The mother wants him to hold his hand, and he couldn't bring himself to. He's about to but she goes and its too late. So in a fit of upset, he goes out. He is then abducted by a spaceship. The plot from what I could gather was that Nova PRime(Close) were recruiting a group of misfits. Rocket(Cooper); Drax(Dave Bautista); Groot(Diesal); Gamora(Zoe Saldana) and of course Peter who is now grown up acted by Chris Pratt. Excellent action, NO question. Excellent comedy. Great humor. It is then found in the end that the Baddie - ROnin is wanting to destroy the galaxy Sanders(something like that). To prevent this, the Guardians of the Galaxy strategise a plan. Sadly Groot passes away, but Rocket gets a stick(from Groot) and he begins to grow again. I was expecting to see Peter aka StarLord shirtless as seen in the XPose interview, however got more than we bargained for. We saw him in his undies. Now how hot is that. Damn. mmmm. Its a bit similar to Avengers. In that major characters from the Marvel universe are gathered and attempted to kill the baddie as i like to call em. heheeheh. Overall a wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Quill, abducted by intergalactic scavengers as a child, finds himself in possession of a mysterious orb which attracts widespread (and unwelcome) interest. Unwillingly accompanied by a small and ragtag band of oddballs, Quill must reluctantly adopt a role for which has never previously regarded himself as equipped: a hero.Based on one of their less well known comics properties, the latest movie from Marvel Studios is a part of the Marvel cinematic universe, although it is unlikely to be clear immediately (other than to expectant speculating comic fans) to what extent. This does not matter: this is a fine standalone movie, best looked upon as the sort of thing a Star Wars movie would have been if a) it had an entertaining plot, b) George Lucas could write dialogue, and c) it remembered to be fun.The story is fun, the eye candy is fabulous, and the script is crisp and often laugh out loud funny. But the thing which makes this film is the characters. The band of 5 "Guardians", based closely on the comics, work perfectly both in isolation and as a group, starting as warring individuals and growing into a team. Chris Pratt does well as the fundamentally decent but hardly heroic Quill - a likable character, with more to him than simply being a good-looking protagonist. Zoe Saldana's Gamora carries some baggage as does Dave Bautista's Drax. Bautista who, I understand is a wrestler, delivers a particularly well-rounded character: superficially one-note, there are great depths here, conveyed well, in a performance which manages to be both funny and tragic, sometimes at the same time. But the two favourites here are quite definitely Rocket (a genetically modified raccoon with anger management issues, voiced by Bradley Cooper), and a walking tree called Groot (his three-word vocabulary voiced by Vin Diesel). Their interdependent relationship is a joy, and Groot simply owns all the movie's best moments.The 3D is completely unessential and adds little.Did I say this movie was fun? It is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Marvel made a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best word to describe Guardians of the Galaxy is entertaining. Not overwhelmingly so, but it had some really good moments. I understand that the current hype surrounding Marvel movies has lead to inflated reviews, but don't be fooled. This is just a recycling of the same effects, costumes, jokes, and thin plot lines from the previous movies. This can not really be called a superhero movie, so much as a comedy. Every other line was a joke, usually a cheesy one liner, and it was filled with that typical Marvel humor. You know, characters get in a big fight, they knock out the bad guy, everyone is breathing heavily and the room is quiet, and then one character says something cheesy and the whole audience laughs. They hit the ball out of the park on a few jokes, but I managed to stay pretty straight faced for most of the film. I understand the love for superheroes that currently exists, but this movie was nothing more than a very average feel good comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There should have been more surprises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one thing I expect from a movie like GotG is an element of surprise. We all remember that amazing Hulk scene with Loki from The Avengers. Why was it so funny? Because you would not expect Hulk to bash Loki in that moment and then he does and you can't stop laughing.Now with this movie, let me point out how you know everything that is going to happen a few scenes before it happens.First, the mom asks to take her hand and the boy doesn't. You know that some time in the future the same scene is going to happen and at that time the dude will take the hand.(obsession with closure..Sheldon anyone?) Half way through the movie and you also know whose hand this is going to be!Second, the wrapped gift. What can you have in a box of the dimensions of 1.2 times a cassette given to a guy who is obsessed with a SONY tape recorder and a mixed tape?Third, Skylord replacing the infinity stone Pokemon ball with a fake one in the end scene. Didn't he already cheat Gamora while he ran back to retrieve his tape recorder? (surprise! he went back for the tape recorder!) And didn't we all see her handing those Pokémon catchers out like water bottles to everyone?Apart from all this, was I the only one who thought that Ronan's oath to wipe out the Zandora or whatever people was a very strong allusion to Hitler? All in all this is a passable movie with a little good humor and some good action scenes. I am rating it this low because of the hype that this thing has created and because it totally did not live up to it for me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much and not enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot of information thrown at you in the beginning, planet names and bad guy names and goody guy names and names and names and names. Fortunately most of this isn't important. All you need to know is that there's an orb that everyone wants (the old McGuffin thing).There's a lot of action in this movie and the characters are unique and funny and that's okay but the main story, "Everyone wants this orb" was just really underwhelming to me.The stuff in the prison wasn't bad and I liked the escape.Did they need TWO big boss bad guys (Ronan and Thanos)? The conflict with the two sisters was kind of irritating too. Zoe Saldana looked like she just walked off the set of "Avatar" and was playing the same character.I know a lot of people love the old songs (which were OKAY) but I think the movie's obsession with them was a little distracting. I get it, they remind Quill of his mother, but the tape would have worn out long ago and, truth be told, he'd probably get sick of those songs after 26 years.Vin Diesel and Glenn Close were both kind of wasted in this.It wasn't a BAD movie but there was just so much work put into service of a mediocre story. The same complaint I had of "Avatar".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As perhaps one of the few in the screening I went to who was familiar with the source material (yes even with the original 1969 incarnation) this film had a lot to live up to for me especially with all the positive buzz surrounding it, but thankfully it did not disappoint. Guardians Of The Galaxy delivers on almost every level and it's great to see a studio being brave and confident enough to have allowed James Gunn to make this relatively unknown property, other studios could really learn something from the success this film will undoubtedly enjoy ? firstly stop making dramatic changes from the source material that your film is based on (there's a reason it's popular to begin with). Secondly if your film is good enough build brand awareness like Marvel did with this as the marketing for this film as it was simply faultless. Thirdly superhero movies can be fun without being silly as this film proves, so we don't always need dark and broody.The main thing that Gunn got just right with this was the tone and balance, yes it's mostly fun (without really being an out and out comedy) but it also gives you just about enough information about each character so that you will root for them but not so much that it ever slows things down or becomes too pretentious. For example the first two scenes which feature the same character (at different ages) couldn't be more different in tone but somehow it still feels right and a natural progression.Chris Pratt anchors the film as Peter Quill offers great charisma and the progression from wannabe to hero always feels right, after this you feel that major stardom beckons. Zoe Saldana is always great and her Gamora works perfectly well although I feel the character is played as more of a foil for the others so it's a generous performance. Rocket is so well animated that there was never a moment that I thought about him being CGI, he's brilliantly voiced by Bradley Cooper, so he is in many ways pretty much the character on screen I'd always imagined he also has some great lines. Groot almost steals the film and although Vin Diesel does well with the limited lines it's the animators that really succeed here by giving Groot such humanistic facial expressions making him the heart and soul of the film. Dave Bautista was perhaps the biggest surprise for me, his Drax was not only very fitting in terms of being a revenge driven powerhouse but he also has some of the funniest lines and offers some subtlety, it will be interesting to see what Bautista does next.The villains fare less well although this is not uncommon for a superhero movie because the main purpose of the film was to put together the team so although Lee Pace, Karen Gillan and Djimon Hounsou are perfectly fine, they look great but they're not really fleshed out and are fairly generic. The plot is fairly straightforward as with many Marvel movies but that's not really the point here because there's a real tonal shift which means you may notice it less. It really is a beautiful looking film too so kudos to the artists, costumes and makeup are impressive too. The film succeeds because like Peter Quill it has a lot of swagger, it's always fun without ever becoming too goofy, it's accessible without spoon feeding the audience and therefore it's just a whole lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We're in good hands. I think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter(Pratt, playing it like a mix between Han Solo and Marty McFly, likable from the get-go) steals a coveted orb, and intends to nab the reward, until he? eventually? realizes that it's too powerful, and has to be kept out of the hands of religious fanatic Ronan(Pace, terrifying, psychotic, driven), or he will commit genocide.Our unlikely and reluctant hero meets others like him(they fight at their first encounter), and these scoundrels(there weren't enough of those in the franchise) form an uneasy alliance, gradually connecting with each other and becoming selfless and heroic. Bounty hunters Rocket(Cooper, angry, bitter, smart), a cyborg raccoon(!) and Groot(Vincent? eh, or: Diesel, putting a lot of emotion into three words, na?ve, enthusiastic, a big lug with a huge heart), a giant, sentient tree(did I mention this came out of the Silver Age? It's a Saturday Morning Cartoon every step of the way, and gloriously so). Assassin Gamora(Saldana, sultry, deadly, moral) trying to break away from adoptive father Thanos(Brolin, with all the gravitas that requires? with only a short appearance, he's not the main villain? see above? he makes a real impression), and "sister" Nebula(Gillan, sadistic because of her intense jealousy borne from their sibling rivalry), who hunts her down. And Drax(Bautista, who does remarkably well for little experience? everyone, character and actor, is solid), essentially Conan(the barbarian, not the O'Brien) of space, who wants revenge on the bad guy for his murdered family... or possibly aforementioned, since she worked with him?There are too many elements in this(groups, people, allegiances, motivations?), and the scope and abilities of some of them is a little difficult to get a proper grasp on, but once you let it sit, probably after the end credits(which you must stay through!), it does all come together. Somehow it splits the focus and time fairly equally between them, if it only hints at, and doesn't explore. This is amazing from start to finish. Everyone has something to bring to it, in action, drama, humor, etc. This is a stand-alone that takes place in the same universe as the Avengers films, and you can go into this with no knowledge of those, or the comics it emulates and is based on. This takes inspiration from Star Wars and Indiana Jones, and lives up to the standards set by those classics.There is some violence(it doesn't push the PG-13 as much as other recent entries in the genre) and a little strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys big, fun Summer blockbusters. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From James Gunn, director of Slither and Super comes a whole new epic action galaxy hero universe, Guardians of the Galaxy. While the plot of this film may feel too overstuffed at times, but the film is surely one hell of a ride!! GOTG is visually dazzling with breathtaking action sequences and is one of the best a scifi/action film could offer. The characters here are also very likable and very engaging to watch with their humors and hearts. The film also has so many catchy soundtrack moment that it could almost become a musical film but anyway the songs are great and really live up to the mood/tone of the scenes. The 3D effects are quite better than expected (as seen from the trailer) and really makes the action scenes more enjoyable to watch. Overall, this may not be Marvel's best film but it's surely one of the most entertaining and action-packed ones! &gt;&gt;B+&lt;&lt;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expectations Exceeded</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this films with sky high expectations as both a fan of the DnA run on the comic and Gunns previous work as a director (Slither is awesome).The ting that baffles me most is that, as a fan of the comic, I should be pretty ticked off by the film as they have changed many things from the source material. Drax has a completely different back story and personality, Ronan is just a "bad" guy, Nova corpse can't fly etc etc.The thing is the film was just too much fun for me to care about those things. Everyone is saying its like "star wars" or "raiders" etc, in my humble opinion they're wrong. For me it reminds me much more like Ghostbusters than anything else. Not just because its more blatant in it's humor (although it is), it's because its about a group of dropouts and losers who are way out their depth saving the world/galaxy.The film truly rocks! From the great visuals, to the cool story, to the action set pieces, to the emotional scenes, to banter, right through this fully realized universe that Gunn has created.If I had one nit to pick I do think that Ronan is slightly under served due to the film having so much to do as a first outing like introduce an entire galaxy as well as a whole team of heroes. It would have been nice to have more of the history of the Xandar/Kree war to add more weight to Ronans actions but the rest of the film is that good its easy to ignore that small fault. Hopefully now they have already done most of the set up work they can flesh the other aspects out more in future Guardians films However the biggest and most pleasant surprise of all for me was Drax. Like I said earlier, he is the character that has been altered the most, he is also played by a professional wrestler (who haven't had the best track record for producing acting talent) and in the heaviest make up out the bunch. I thought he was going to either suck or be the weakest link by a long shot but no, he flat out gets some of the biggest laughs in the film and some of the most touching scenes too, no spoilers but there's a bit with him and rocket towards the end that made my "hay fever" play up.Going to see it again on Wednesday and cant wait for July 2017 so we can do this all over again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy(GotG) is easily the best comic book to film adaptation. It had the right level of action, inspired moments of humour and perfect bits of tenderness. The cast was fantastic, the script superb and the plot never went dull, from Chris Pratts opening dance to the final confrontation. Chris Pratt's star-lord was simple amazing. A superhero protagonist who didn't take himself to serious yet didn't slip into man-child cringe. Dave Bautista, who I had reserves about, as Drax was a big win. He fitted the role perfectly, managing to bring love and care to a psychopath. And finally Bradley Cooper as Rocket Racoon. The cockiness, yet emotion he gave Rocket was terrific, not to mention hilarious.Overall, best comic book film, best film of 2014 and my personal second best. I highly recommend it and implore anyone and everyone to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing and amusing take on the superhero genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm quite a casual fan of Marvel comics and their movies, so I didn't know much about Guardians of the Galaxy going in nor was I expecting much.The blend of action and humour was great. The tone of the film, which I think is balanced very well, was perfectly set in the opening sequence. The comedy especially was actually funny. I think this is largely down to the fact that the characters were so thoroughly well established, with each character having decent screen time. None of them felt underdeveloped and you felt connected to all of the main cast.By and large the acting was very good, stand out being Chris Pratt. A very strong performance as well as delivering on the comedy. The movie is really hinged on him as a central protagonist, and he did a great job of leading the narrative as well as standing out as a character in his own right. Even former wrestler Dave Bautista did a good job. He didn't exactly have a huge range to deal with, but he delivered the serious parts and he was also pretty funny. The writers definitely played to his strengths which showed.The writing in general was very good. It is a well structured film, and is kept moving along at a reasonable pace. The dialogue is expertly written, with great gags and jokes delivered in great timing. The cinematography and visual fx were fantastic. It's a very good looking film, easy to watch and choreographed well. It had a great blend of sci-fi almost Spielberg-esque visuals, which I think gives the film a distinctive look from the other Marvel movies. The CGI was generally very good. Groot and Rocket especially looked fantastic. The only downside here was you can tell that the large portion of time was spent on the main characters CGI (and rightly so), but it means that tertiary CG characters tended to be a bit lacking and not look up to standard.Unfortunately I felt Lee Pace's performance as main villain 'Ronan' to be quite one dimensional and wooden. He shouted a lot, and put on a deep voice, but what presence was built up around his character I felt fell flat when he actually started speaking. Also, his character motive was basically him being a religious fanatic. While being topical, I felt that his core motivations was quite a simplified notion of "West vs East" as apparent in the two warring cultures of the Kree Empire vs the Xandarians, to the point where I felt it was exploitative of post 9/11 anxieties and leaning towards patronizing.Overall though, a very entertaining and most importantly funny movie. Quite different from any other modern Marvel movie, which is a good thing. Recently I've found that some of the post Avengers Marvel releases (with the exception of Days of Future Past) to be feeling quite stale. This film has definitely got a unique and distinct personality which I think sets it apart from the rest, in a good way.I have to say now though that it is probably in the top three Marvel movies alongside 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' and 'The Avengers'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Marvel's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know who is making the final script decisions at Marvel these days, but I'm found the last two films (Captain America: Winter Soldier, and now Guardians of the Galaxy) to be exceptionally entertaining.To be honest, after the disappointment of the most recent Iron Man and Thor films, I was beginning to feel as if the Marvel superhero flicks may have run their course, i.e. that they were beginning to fall into that lacklustre phase where the creative team is just going through the motions to collect on an easy payday.I also hate when movies rely far too much on special effects and big budgets, instead of those increasingly rare qualities of good characters, solid plots, and great writing.That's where Guardians of the Galaxy really shines. Yes, I like the big screen sci-fi settings and slick gadgets or impressive superpowers just as much as the next guy. But I'll take emotional engagement over that any day of the week. Make me care enough about the characters to tense up in my seat when they're in danger, to genuinely like them for their unique characteristics, to want to be there in that theatre with them and feeling a bit of a letdown when the movie ends - that's what I love about great movies. Anything short of that, no matter how glitzy, just isn't worth it.I also love good humour in between all that tense action, and this is an area where I think Marvel really shines. I laughed as much as I tensed throughout this movie. To be honest, that's what made me like the main characters as a team so much - their banter was hilarious.True, the plot of this movie is not particularly unique. At its core, its a good guys vs bad guys superhero flick. It's hard to find a truly new story in that dynamic. But as with Jame Cameron films like Avatar, what I like is when the plot is solid enough - when it has no glaring holes - that it doesn't distract you from all the good stuff.All in all, I have to say this: if you're average movie-goer like myself, go see this film. It's one of those rare times you'll feel like you actually got your money's worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel Film to Date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Galaxy's un-mightiest heroes unite in cosmic bliss to create a unique, funny and heartfelt superhero movie and the best Marvel film to date.Marvel is finally expanding its already colossal film empire into space. A risky move given their safe track record. Even with lesser known heroes, Guardians is at the pinnacle of hype and I'm glad to say it paid off. A new world apparently without sarcasm and irony and full of literal meanings. Guardians is filled with funny scenes, making it unlike any tentpole superhero movie seen before. However, the trailers and previews did a lot to reduce the impact of certain dialogue, which obviously is not the fault of the production. Guardians is funny nonetheless and its self referential style keeps us entertained: "We are Kevin Bacon" is an actual quote. Seriously.What makes Guardians unique is James Gunn being at the helm. This is not a director that has been phoned in. The arbiters of the Marvel Universe, Joss Whedon and Kevin Feige, are recruiting directors that need more recognition. "Super" is one of my favourite films, and it's unique likability translates perfectly into the Marvel Universe.We knew this from the trailers and from the mouth of James Gunn, but the soundtrack is awesome; filled with classics from the 70s and 80s that many identify with. But even with this light hearted inclusion, there is layer to it, a minute origin story that gives great character development. All protagonists have a story that I actually care about. These are damaged characters with heart and soul. I wanted to get to know them and I wanted them to succeed. Groot only has a three word vocabulary, but he had more personality in one hefty trunk leg than the entire well spoken body of Superman, and to be fair, much more than Thor or Steve Rogers.Tyler Bates' score works well with out heroes. A good job, given that some of it was composed before the film began production. Rarely does a director film to the score, but it works and fits in well with the soundtrack.For me, 3D has always been a gimmick. Nothing more than a fruitless attempt to squeeze paying customers out of a little more cash. Guardians on the other hand fully embraces the third dimension, keeping the audience immersed in space. James Gunn said that he was much more involved in the 3D conversion and it shows. Having to shift your gaze to focus on a piece of space rock before your eyes is an amazing experience. To add, in conjunction with IMAX, the entire mise en scene feels real and you can observe a varying depth of field. Movies like Guardians is why IMAX and 3D was created.When Marvel announced that Cap 3 would compete against Man of Steel's sequel, I was rather disappointed. It felt that they were getting too big for their boots. A large degree of Marvel movies, for me, are typically average, but with this release I hope that Marvel is finally creating great movies, rather than simple fillers. It also further proves that DC needs to lighten up and quit being so dark and depressing. Cinema is an escape, a 2 hour chance to connect and enjoy. Guardians of the Galaxy is testament to this. It gives pure entertainment, but balances with interesting characters, all the while supporting the over arcing themes of the comics. A great Marvel product, an even better movie and I can't wait for Phase 3 to get started.Action: 5 Score: 4 Soundtrack: 5 Direction: 4 Acting: 4 Story: 4 Screenplay: 4 Watch Again?

		<fullReview>Star Wars for today's generation. And maybe even a little better than that because it is just packed with such fun that I haven't experienced in cinema for a long time. Marvel has outdone themselves once again. Marvel and Disney have been worried that this film will be a financial failure but I haven't been in such a crowded theater since the start of the year.This origin story of this band of misfits starts out with an emotional scene, then the tone changes into this Indiana Jones in Space adventure, then it deliberately makes fun of itself and at last all these tones merge into one and the film keeps this tone for the whole length of the film. When it needs to be emotional it is, when it needs an action scene peppered with humor you get and action scene you haven't seen before. Everzthing in this film works except maybe the main villain. He isn't very menacing but you have so much fun in all the other aspects of the film so you are happy to overlook these details. Plus Ronan The Accuser serves just as build-up for a much greater threat.Every character steals every scene they are in. There is no way you will be able to pick your favorite character because in every scene suddenly all of them become your favorite. Chris Pratt has turned over a night into a household name all thanks to Marvel and his charm and likability. Before he served as a professional goof ball but I don't think that will be the case anymore. He shows such a wide range -switching from comedy into action/adventure or a quick-witted scoundrel. Zoe Saldana has established herself a long time as the go-to-action actress and once she shows why she has earned that. She can be sexy, funny and kick ass all in one moment. Dave Bautista is a real surprise here as the warrior taking thins way too literal and therefore his actions and dialogue end up as some of the funniest in the entire film. Bradley Cooper has tried to make his voice unrecognisable as the Rocket Racoon and he has created not another CG animated character but a character from flesh, blood and fur. His cynical, gun-toting maniacal raccoon will surely end up as the fans favorite but as I have stated before all the characters get the same time to shine. Groot, a sentient tree with a limited vocabulary is the most innocent of all of the members of the team.James Gunn had to abandon his dark humor and frankly a little weird for the mainstream audience but what is more than obvious is the enthusiasm that this film was made with. In every shot you can see the filmmaker who finally got the budget to realize all his dreams and ideas and so he stuffs into this film, all those shots and camera angles of his dreams are all here. The film is therefore such an amazing ride which sucks you in for 2 hours and then spits you out and you will want to go and see it immediately. It's that kind of a movie.This is the film that all the teenagers are going to be talking about when they are 30 years old in the same way the Star Wars generation talks about that experience today. The whole Marvel Cinematic Universe is a history in the making which I am sure will be talking about for a long time. The choice is yours if you want to go and see heavy intense drama disguised as a summer blockbuster go see the Dawn of the Planet of the Apes . But if you want a self-referential light-hearted fun go see the Guardians of the Galaxy. It is one of the best films you will be able to see this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say that this review is not meant to dissuade anyone from enjoying this movie or going to see it...after all we each have our own tastes and preferences which apply to a myriad of things in life. Yet I am not one of those that liked or enjoyed "Guardians Of The Galaxy"...I know...shocking!!! I had misgivings about this movie since the beginning, but after all the hype it has been getting recently, and at a friend's insistence, and against my better judgement, I went to see it...and boy do I regret it! It was underwhelming to say the least!"Guardians Of The Galaxy" is yet another big, blockbuster, popcorn behemoth in the increasing tradition of movies that like to keep pretending that they stand for something or possess a deeper meaning than the actually do! Do not be fooled into believing, guided by the cries of joy and applause it is getting, that this is some kind of irreverent, anti-establishment, rebellious, subversive movie, a proverbial cinematic middle-finger to the franchise, re-boot, sequelitis infirm and moribund Hollywood! This isn't the wink, wink, nudge, nudge (thank you Monty Python for that one!) kind of film! As many of its $100 or $200 million dollars plus budget counterparts, this is yet another blighted vomit fest of explosions, special effects...a thunderous, meaningless, meandering cacophony of irrelevant sights and sounds, all neatly disguised under a thin, and I mean very thin, coating of substance! It is populated by characters I didn't care for, a story that left me somewhere from indifferent to bored, accompanied by direction and production values that fit into the cookie-cutter mold of the Marvel- Disney juggernaut! The only reason I did not give it a lower rating than 4 out of 10 was that sometimes(though not often enough)some of the humour and jokes hit their target, and I thought that Groot was mildly interesting.It will surely make money and win accolades, blah, blah, blah...but for me as a moviegoer, this flick, "Guardians Of The Galaxy" or as I re-named them "Turdmasters Of The Universe", will fade from memory and join the ranks of a sadly increasing list of movies I won't care to remember I have ever seen.</fullReview>

There are people out there who have serious acting skill and never get seen. There are sci-fi movies that have an original story that don't have a budget to be released at their full potential. Support people with talent and original ideas. Do not see Guardians of the Galaxy as it contains nothing that vaguely resembles any of those things. Congratulations on nailing the CGI though guys, that was great. If I felt like staring at great CGI for two and a half hours though, I'd play Call Of Duty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All-time FAVOURITE (And I'm a movie buff!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Gunn has created a film that I find incredibly emotive yet highly humorous, original, yet amazingly relatable, and so enjoyable that I find it beyond compare. That may be putting it on a bit thick perhaps, but I mean it. The film itself has a background only in a comic book series from several decades ago, and yet despite the apparent lack of awareness of who the Guardians of the Galaxy are (WHO????), Gunn manages to make his audience fall in love both with the characters and the Galaxy he has created; an accomplishment on its own to be admired. The main criticism I feel others have provided is that its plot- line, whilst creative, is linear and predictable, but I would respond by mentioning that the Galaxy James Gunn has had to create to allow the Guardians story to unfold in such an eloquent manner, proves that the plot of this film is anything but unoriginal, and its 'predictability' is merely a product of the skilled and intense writing. The film manages to boldly couple a new brand of unique, witty humour, with an engaging premise, plot and panoply of characters with seemingly nothing in common. Superbly edited, remarkably filmed, amazing CGI work, incredibly acting, notably by Chris Pratt, as well as the obvious Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper and others. Loved it. Can't wait to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The MCU is known for selling all of it original and best characters, and left selling to the masses whatever they can scrape up and shove down viewers windpipes. However, this movie was not as awful compared to some of Marvel's movie flops. It had some good one liners and some funny quotes here and there. It was a good setup for infinity wars. The characters were mildly developed and have a lot of room for improvement. The mystery of some of the characters left it open for a sequel. The plot is a little iffy with a lot of plot holes, but altogether it is a good film for almost all audiences. This has a plethora of action scenes and jokes. Chris Pratt really brings the film together. He is the star of the movie and brings a lot of smiles to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of intergalactic criminals are forced to work together to stop a fanatical warrior from taking control of the universe.Call me an apostate or what you will, but I do not think this is the "greatest superhero film ever made" or any of the other hyperbole going around. Is it a good story? Heck yes. Is it funny? Heck yes. And are the characters interesting? Heck yes. But it is also overshadowed by some mind-numbing special effects and lightning-fast editing that could be done without.Not to say this is a bad movie. It is not. At all. Among the Marvel films made so far, it is probably slightly better than average. Not quite on the level of the "Iron Man" movies, and definitely not as clever as the second "Captain America", but far, far ahead of the disappointment that was "Thor: The Dark World" (though, to be fair, Thor is a bad character to begin with).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hands down, One Of The Best Marvel Films Ever Made.It's was almost perfect! Of course expectations were high but this was a work of art, In my opinion It lacked what I LOVED about Captain America The Winter Soldier which was that sort of dark gritty nature but that's just me and too be Fair It's not that kinda movie, This gravitates more towards comedy and action. A very important point is that it's not your average watered same joke said differently and you can tell when the your supposed to laugh, this film is GENUINE funny, i found myself laughing out loud and at times no one else was, not because I'm a weirdo but because I Personally found it funny. And although it's subtle you feel as though you can relate which has a bigger impact on the watcher. Even at the serious moments I'd remember a previous part and chuckle to myself ;DTo take a bunch of characters hardly recognised by the comic book universe and turn them into such a formidable and prominent characters is amazing.Zoe Salanda as Gemora was great, shes hot.Chris Pratt was the perfect choice for Star Lord, hes kinda quirky, witty, funny and can pull off that cool action figure type personnel, reminds a lot of the guy who plays Captain Kirk in The recent Star Trek films who's name escapes me.Bradley Cooper voiced Rocket Racoon and for most people he stole the show, he was amazing, sarcastic quick witted, smart and calculated and the fact that they paired a Racoon who talks a lot with a tree that doesn't makes for a perfect duo.I could go on but lets summmerize, I love this film. The fact that they can get a fairly sub par actor (Vin Diesel) make him say 3 words and he becomes the most liked thing withing the whole movie is outstanding, him saying 'I Am Groot' is the best piece of acting hes done his whole career.I like the fact that Dave is taking this route into the movie industry as opposed to The Rock and John Cena and HHH, Their movies lack a certain degree of quality to me and are very standard and linear, Playing Drax was a good move by Bautista as I think it give him more credibility and leigway to actually display some degree of acting if he needs to. Great Film, Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually start-off with ratings but I am sure it'll go further up when I see it next :) Every single character in the film packs a punch and you totally (G)root for them. It is one of those rare films maintaining a balance of power between good and bad, all through.Beautiful build up of all character; each one of them reaches crescendo. Director shrewdly wards off any triteness in screenplay and familiarizes you to characters without traditional flashbacks and too many back stories; he rather lets actions of the characters speak for themselves?audience is settled into knowing and conciliating with them in natural flow of story.All five heroes?Quill, Groot, Drax, Rocket, and Gamora?have connected well with the audience and are going to stay with us a while. They have the usual, appealing premise: a band of anti-heroes, mercenaries, and brats coming together to save the world. The goodness in them isn't apparent but inherent; now they know it and so does the galaxy! Michael Rooker as Yondu Udonta, with his whistling arrow, was a top-drawer. With all his nonsensical antics earlier in the film, you don't bank on him to wrap it up this good! But boy does he NAIL it against the Kree soldiers :) Always nice to see Stan Lee getting some, dude deserves it all! Looking forward to Cosmos the Soviet Dog taking charge in the skull outpost in upcoming film(s). Howard the Duck was briefly there; maybe Marvel is just pitching the character...and because they can?unlike the counterparts, DC.When it comes to comics, I was only somewhat familiar with the Guardians, more so to the recent 2008 team, and have never gone deeper in all the Guardians of the Galaxy stories?my to-do immediately.8.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm usually not for the abundance of CGI and comedy, but James Gunn pulled it off nicely. It was spectacular, and it goes to show that a movie doesn't need to be dark and broody to be good. A great film can have humor. The acting was good (Bautista, however, was alright), the graphics superb, and the story was good. This movie is an intro movie to these characters and it all ties in toward Thanos, so expect bigger things to come! It's amazing to see that this virtually unknown comic book make so much success among the masses. This was sort of a risky film, I'm sure, because people didn't know how it would play out. But, obviously, it worked out fine in the end. I think when it comes to these types of movies, and comic book movies in general, the director is CRUCIAL. If the director has a very creative vision on how these types of stories are played out on screen, it can do loads of good. What I didn't like about this film was Thanos. Seriously, he looked like a video game character. I don't know why, all the other actors and extras had good prosthetic make up, but Thanos had to be CGI. It threw me off a little. Otherwise a fantastic film.</fullReview>

I had the idea that it would be more of a kids movie; one reason was Rocket the raccoon. Yesterday I finally watched it and boy was I wrong... The Guardians of the galaxy is a random band of rascals made up of an assassin, a raider, two bounty hunters (kind of) and a huge blue guy hungry for vengeance. For different reasons they find them self's fighting an evil set on destruction on epic scale that is threatening any planets in the galaxy. Now you think "that's really nothing new" and you're right; it isn't. But take my advice ad see it. If you have any interest in sci-fi, action or comedy you will find all three. The performance is good at worst and excellent at best. The whole range from CGI and environments are perfect right down to small details and corny things like a precious Walkman (Goolge it... ;) ).

		<fullReview>Marvel's biggest risk that has pretty much confirmed that Marvel can't do wrong, except Iron Man 2 and Thor 2. With interesting characters, a fun and engaging story and possibly the best pick for a director, there was no way this could have gone wrong. I love this film but I do have some problems with it and surprisingly, they're all to do with GrootThe scene with Groot picking off the flower and giving it to the little girl was cringe worthy. It came out of nowhere and in my opinion it didn't match with the rest of the filmThe scene where Groot goes "We are Groot" was also cringe worthyMy last complaint is not to do with Groot, so I technically lied but the scene where Gamora is out in space and Quill puts his helmet on her, was too long. It's not that it got boring, but realistically Quill's brain should have leaked out of his ears. Again, only a small complaint but what else can I say? This film is great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel Yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I finally got round to watching Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and I have to say, I freaking loved it!For those of you who've been living under a rock, Guardians of the Galaxy is the latest superhero film from Marvel. Its about a group of misfits who have been brought together by a common goal, money and revenge. The aim was to sell an orb they had been fighting over for an obscene profit and go their separate ways. But as they come to find out what the orb actually is, and who wants it, their mission changes and they come together as the self proclaimed 'Guardians of the Galaxy' to do just that.Now anyone who has seen this film will tell you, its not your average Marvel superhero film. For starters they aren't superheros, in fact they are, in their words, losers. That is what I loved about the film, there wasn't any blind patriotism, no compelling feeling to do good, just the motivation that if they didn't fight then they would all die.The characters were varied and engaging, I liked each one of them which is odd for a superhero film as I tend to feel a little sick of their self-righteous attitude. But with this set of characters there wasn't a moment where I disliked them. They each had their own story, their own motivation for doing what they do and I understood and empathised with each one.Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) was great as the lead and added some great moments of humour which is sometimes cringeworthingly done in Marvel films, but in this case it worked and actually made me laugh. Another great character was Rocket (Bradley Cooper) who brought some laughs but also produced a very moving scene when intoxicated explaining his frustrations of always being taken at face value and written off because of what he appeared to be.Groot (Vin Diesel) was a great example of how facial expressions and body language can say just as much as actual words and produced some rather wonderful moments himself. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) was the serious character absolutely brimming with honour. But as we got to know her we found she had lost just as much as the rest and began to thaw as the film progressed.But I have to say Drax (Dave Bautista) was the surprise favourite of mine. Not only did he look immense and fight like a demon but was hilarious. The fact his species knew nothing of idioms made for some hugely funny moments, that and his short attention span and even shorter temper.What I loved about this film, and which I believe is missing from many of the Marvel films is that it didn't take itself too seriously. Yeah it had some serious points in it but it managed to tell the story in a way which wasn't all 'for king and country'. The character's personalities played huge part in this, the fact they were anti-heroes proved to be a refreshing take on the superhero film. There was no reason for these outlaws to save the galaxy besides self preservation. That and camaraderie, having each been alone for most of their lives, they found solace and companionship in each other and above all they fighter for each other as much as for the galaxy.Also, hats off to the soundtrack which was truly original for a superhero films. Every time one of the tracks popped up I was instantly taken back to the beginning of the film to Quill's mother's death and it reminded me that even though he is a funny character, he does in fact have a sad past, not to mention a mysterious father which i'm sure we will hear from in the sequel.Overall this film was a resounding success, if only Marvel would make more films like this. Character based, with personalities you connect with and back stores you care about instead of CGI fuelled fight-feats. So Marvel, if you're listening, more of the same please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy must have been a very hyped Marvel Superhero movie of 2014. At first, it was questioned that a movie depicting a band of lesser known superheroes would ever make financial success on the big screen. When it was released on August 1st, throughout a few months, it was successfully huge. This was worth noting that audiences do have an appetite for something a little unusual.When I watched Guardians of the Galaxy from beginning to end, I wasn't entirely amused. It was enjoyable no doubt. But it had a lot of flaws in my opinion. I really hope the sequel in 2017 will bring some improvement because this sub-franchise of Marvel has a lot of potential.I'll start with the bad parts first. The plot is overall weak and too simple. The villain, Ronan wants an orb that has power and the heroes have to make sure he doesn't get it. I mean this movie is obviously based on a comic book and is supposed to be more light- hearted and less serious, but it really felt like a Saturday morning cartoon episode that is expanded to a full-blown blockbuster. Another downside of GoTG is that pop culture references = comedy/Humor. I don't get what's funny when a song from the 70's/80's is being played every 30 minutes throughout the movie. In fact, I'm already sick of the 1980's nostalgia that is prevalent throughout not just this movie, but other ones. It's becoming too cliché in this decade now. We get it. The 80's was cool for people that were kids at the time. We don't need this kind of pandering throughout every fun film. Guardians of the Galaxy also should have focused on less action and more character development. I really wanted to know more about Rocket Raccoon (which was my favorite) and more dynamic backstory on Gamora.Now the good parts of GoTG was the chemistry between the characters. Chris Pratt plays Starlord well and may become a Sci-Fi icon in the future. The world-building is also great. The GoTG franchise can really stand against Star Wars if it wants to.Guardians of the Galaxy is really a film that didn't not live up the hype, but it wasn't terrible or fairly decent either. It was good, but not great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.. the best movie of 2014. But before discarding the review read further to see why:People will be mixed, is not the usual lame plot superhero movie where you got the good guys fighting an inner conflict and win before they can defeat the bad guy (Captain America, Dark Knight, Thor,etc). If you look for that you won't find it. Nor the plot itself is brilliant, but in the ends is sufficient one because its enough to keep you interested even-though there were some dull parts. It's not a SF masterpiece, but that's not what you came for at a marvel movie! So you will say OK, the plot is not brilliant, then ? Well what makes this movie great is the charm and chemistry of the characters, the jokes so perfectly timed, the visual effects and the soundtrack. Its like making a soup and this soup turned out great because at the end what counts its the sum of its parts and that's what a movie is, a full visual experience and this one was awesome.To validate this, I brought my girlfriend to the movie, she hates SF and superhero movies. She's no fan of notebook like movies too, just loves the realist ones. Yet she enjoyed this movie beyond my expectations. To conclude, is one of the best movies I've seen, not because any part of it was mind blowing, but because if you take the hole visual experience, it was the best one I felt in years at a movie theater. Give it a try, let behind you preconceptions, hopes that the story is so deep Adele will appear rolling on the screen or that Arthur C. Clark is envious of the plot and just enjoy.</fullReview>

Guardians didn't exactly have the same buzz about it that other Marvel movies did, so I came hopeful but not exactly optimistic.How wrong I was! This movie is so amazing I can't even comprehend it. The storyline was awesome, the acting was spot-on, and the CGI... Well, it was so amazing I wished I was there, just to see it in real life.After it all I can't even decide who my favorite character is... Is it the hilariously funny Rocket, the bad-ass "Walking Thesaurus" Drax or the adorable Groot?The start is a bit boring, but after the first ten minutes it's 2+ hours of awesomeness. This is the best movie Marvel, no, ANYONE has ever seen. If Marvel had promoted this better, it would have a higher box office result than The Avengers. I for one have paid to watch this again at the movies since, and I don't have a job. That's how good it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to find a movie that makes the whole family feel like they just left an amusement park and everyone feels like a little kid. Guardians of the Galaxy makes you feel that way. Your drawn in quickly, which is excellent for the younger audience, your kept in your seats with action and laughter and everyone of all ages can keep up. Even though it's a fast pace movie. Each character plays a part and it's hard to chose a favourite. The one thing that impressed me most with this movie is there is an actual story line to follow. Each character has a story and their all brought together for the same reason. And you cheer for each character. No one stands out and before the movie is over your wondering "are they making a part 2?" Everyone will come out smiling and wanting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Marvel films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be one of the best films of 2014 and one of the best ones that Marvel has made. It is funny while still being a great action film. All of the actors were picked extraordinarily well and made the movie that much better. It is fun for the whole family but older generations will appreciate it more seeing as the music plays right into all of their generations. One of the best characters in the film is one that does not even have that much to say. Groot is one that brings so much to the screen and make you laugh without even doing that much. He is hilarious while also being a character that makes you feel something on the inside. His main companion, Rocket, is also a blast on screen and brings to the film a great comedic element.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of 2014!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been hyped for this movie ever since the first trailer had come out. Growing up I have watched Marvel movies and was a real Marvel fan- boy. I had no doubt that I would love this movie; and I was right - it was seriously amazing. I've known Chris Pratt from Parks And Recreation (Which is a hilarious show) and he seemed like a pretty good actor, could be really big one day. He definitely didn't disappoint in the movie, probably the best actor honestly. He completely stole the show. I'd consider this to be his breakout role. I'm not sure if I would say this is Marvel's best film but it's up there with Winter Soldier. Which is probably my favorite Marvel flick. I didn't have any problems with the film which is pretty good since I always usually dislike one or two things about movies I watch. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a fun action-packed comedy with heartwarming moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello, I have already reviewed all of the other Marvel Cinematic Universe movies not just to get a start on my movie reviewing career, but also in preparation for Guardians of the Galaxy. Is this another fantastic entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or is it the first terrible film in this shared universe. Lets get into the review.After the death of his mother in 1988, Peter Quill runs and is captured by space pirated known as the Ravengers. The space pirates are led by Yondu who raises him. 26 years later, Peter, who goes by the name Star Lord, steals an artificial orb from an inhabited planet. However, after he steals the artifact, he is pursued by Ronan the Accuser. He then flees to Xandar, but is attacked by Gamora, the adopted daughter of Thanos and an assassin who works for Ronan. The fight draws in 2 bounty hunters; Rocket the genetically engineered raccoon and Groot the humanoid- like tree alien. They all get imprisoned by the Nova Corps, in the prison planet, Kyln. The group then escapes from prison, but not without Drax the Destroyer, an alien who seeks vengeance against Ronan for killing his wife and daughter. The group then teams up to stop Ronan from stealing the orb and using the artifact residing within it to allow Ronan toy destroy the Galaxy.Guardians of the Galaxy has so many hilarious jokes that most of the time, I was bursting with laughter. Remember when is said that Thor: The Dark World was the funniest Marvel film yet? Well, now I just changed my mind, because this is not only the funniest Marvel film yet, but possibly of all time as well. Every single joke that hits the screen never misses the mark at all and keeps the audience bursting with laughter. However the movie acknowledges that it is not a straight-up comedy and knows when to be serious. Still when it's funny, it's hilarious.The acting is perfect from the ensemble cast. Chris Pratt is incredibly wise-cracking as Peter Quill/Star Lord and is a blast to watch on screen. Zoe Saldana is great as Gamora who is very serious in nature and has a very good back story and arc. Dave Bautista is excellent as Drax the Destroyer, who is the most serious character in the movie and is angry at Ronan for killing his family. He also has some pretty funny lines in the film. Bradley Cooper does an excellent job voice acting Rocket who has a very ferocious attitude. Finally, Vin Diesel is great voice acting Groot who has a very innocent nature. The cast also share some terrific chemistry between each other.The action scenes are excellent. The visual effects are terrific as well, along with some breathtaking 3D. The makeup design also looks excellent. My favorite action scene is the prison escape. There are so many shoots that are so well done, along with some very funny moments as well.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy is another fantastic installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is hilarious, well acted, well written, and has some really pure entertainment value to it. My only problems with the film are that the main villain is very weak and there could have been a little more character development for Groot and Drax. Other than that Guardians of the Galaxy is a near perfect film and one of my favorite Marvel and superhero films of all time.MY GRADE: A- (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most fantastic Space Opera movie since Star Wars PERIOD!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians Of The Galaxy is simply stunning film making. The story, the characters, the spacecraft, the effects, the sound, the soundtrack, the actors, the stunts.... look everything is simply fantastic.For me, this movie is not a super hero film, it's a space opera with characters who have a few interesting abilities in it. It's a group of people/characters who can hardly get along while trying to work together and who just happen to decide to save the galaxy thanks to one man who somehow convinces them, it's worth there time with other's who know the job needs to be done.This movie had my all time favorite SciFi series (BLAKES 7) elements wound into something completely different from Star wars or Star Trek for example. It achieved it's goals and more and what a film it is.FOR: * EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!! AGAINST: * Not for people who can't handle an escape from reality into another universe.I could write pages of goodness on this film, but seriously, just go watch the movie for yourself and understand the greatness that is GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY!!!!(For me, the Star Wars beater).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into this movie, I had no idea what to expect. I had never heard of these heroes before, and I had little to no expertise based on the trailers and footage I have seen. I saw these footages, and I thought to myself, "This is either the greatest idea ever put to film, or the stupidest thing I've ever seen". However, I decided to turn my analytical brain off, and I give the benefit of the doubt. This is what I got when I walked out of the theater: it's a sprawling space opera with a sort of interesting characters, a fun sci-fi romp through diverse and interesting worlds, wildly inventive action sequences, and an almost non-stop barrage of humor and fun. The Guardians themselves are a bizarre assembly of losers and misfits, with the CG-created Rocket and Groot providing some of the most emotional and human moments of the film, and it's all brilliant. In fact, they practically steal the show. This shows that Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel should do more voice- over work in their acting careers. I give credit where credit is due and first-time blockbuster director James Gunn did a great job. Gunn is mostly known for directing "art-house" and hipster films; however, in his first attempt at a blockbuster, he does a great job at realizing his vision for this world, because rest assured, this film wouldn't have been nearly as good with someone else at the helm.So, maybe you never heard of Guardians of the Galaxy (like me). But I can tell you that this movie is a sum up of all this: a colourful, tongue-in-cheek fun, purpose-built for grown-up lovers of kitsch '80s science-fiction. Now for the next movie: they team up with The Avengers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'm having the same problem as everyone else. Better or worse than the Dark Knight Rises? Gnnnn, let's agree to say: different.The Dark Knight was so good because of its ambiance, very dark, very serious; its scenario, that was utterly brilliant; and its main villain, who was just the most psychotic **** I've seen ... ever actually. The Guardians of the Galaxy are about just as good, but for the opposite reasons!The mood is very light, full of humor, and fun references, and clichés, and 80s memories, although Gunn manages to sparkle a bit of seriousness from time to time. The ultimate confrontation between Pratt and Pace, for instance, is hilarious and unforgettable! "What are you doing???"The scenario is not as complex and brilliant as the Dark Knight's, but it is not its purpose here. It has to be entertaining, fast paced but not too much, with a lot of places to visit and many people to meet, all the while staying coherent and understandable by your non-comic fans audience. And boy it was!Finally, the characters that shine in this movie are not the villains (actually those are more its weak spot), but the heroes! I wasn't expecting Pratt to be good, or at least not that good, but Saldana managed to surprise me as well. And how can a CGI raccoon generate so much empathy? And how can a freaking wrestler be so believable on screen (even if the role does suit him like a second skin)? I mean come on! You've got to love this collective band of a****les!And James Gunn for orchestrating this wonderful piece. Best superhero movie ever, tie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie by Marvel after the Avengers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a long time Marvel has been disappointing me. There movies have quite boring plot and they try to overcompensate by adding humor which has grown to be too monotonous over the years. This movie is filled with it but this time it is quite funny because these characters have brought something new to the plate. It does not have the same superheros trying to be witty and arrogant. Few scenes are so good that even the coldest of heart cannot stop themselves from smiling. The friendship between Groot and Rocket is quite entertaining unlike the melodrama we saw between "CA and Bucky". Although this movie lacks the basic composition of a good movie which is 'da good story(plot)' but still the scenes(script) are quite awesome which makes the movie enjoyable. The movie also has some mysteries which will be revealed most probably in the upcoming films of the series. The acting is superb and no one in this whole wide world can ever complain about special effects in a MARVEL movie, they were as usual great. All in all this is a very good movie and i cant wait to see the GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY meet the AVENGERS. I am just quoting something i read "The only thing better than Guardians of the galaxy is their soundtrack"."I AM GROOT"</fullReview>

First time Leading man Chris Pratt gets ripped as Star-Lord and has you laughing the whole way. Weather its his witty dialog or goofy dancing Pratt leads his cast and team in an EXTREMELY ENTERTAINING MOVIE.Geek dream girl ZOE SALDANA is the sexy green GAMORA BRADLEY COOPERS a crazy Coon WWE Star Dave Bautista is DRAX THE DESTROYER and VIN DIESEL goes back to his IRON GIANT roots as GROOTAnd together they ARE the Guardians of the Galaxy. By far a refresher from the regurgitated heroes we've been seeing since the 1940s (no disrespect)but this refresher gives you so much action and humor the audiences made me miss dialog from laughter. Overall GOTG is one of my new favourite superhero flicks to date. Marvel did everything right to make this movie a success and it wins in so many ways.@TOPSimp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This latest instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe takes us on a voyage across the stars on a quest to save the galaxy. Although this may sound like a run-of-the-mill storyline, this is far a run-of-the-mill package. Five vigilantes must unite to save the galaxy from the threat of an all-powerful villain, threatening to either destroy or conquer. While the main story arc may be reminiscent of Star Wars and the like, there are enough sub-plots, humour and 70s tunes to make it stand out on it's own, however rushed the final act may seem.Our five heroes are played brilliantly by the cast, with most bringing a comedic value and chemistry that is greatly appreciated, especially Chris Pratt with main man Peter Quill's distracting pelvic thrusts. The characters are played so well that you really do have a connection with them during the climactic scenes, wondering how you felt so much for an over-sized twig with only three words in its' vocab; "I am Groot".There are many an action sequence, as you can come to expect from Marvel. Gunfights, starship battles, and the wipe out of an entire platoon with the swing of an arm from a wooden Vin Diesel providing a fix for the action junkie.But, as most over-hyped films do, there can exist a shortfall. Lack of female cast is notable, and unfortunately, the beautiful Zoe Saldana does not make up for this problem alone. Her character seems underplayed compared to the others, which is a shame, as her relationship with on screen sister Nebula could have been played further and been used to its full potential. Maybe this is something that we will see in sequels to come, as undoubtedly there will be.Aside from this flaw, Marvel Studios have created yet another fantastic addition to the franchise, which many a die-hard fan (and not) will enjoy tremendously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is a story about four outlaws consisting of, Peter Quill(Chris Pratt), Gamora(Zoe Saldana), Drax(Dave Bautista), humanoid tree Groot(Vin Diesel) &amp; Rocket(Bradley Cooper) the anthropomorphic raccoon. After Peter Quill stumbles upon an orb, he is the victim of a manhunt. Turns out, that orb is high on the list of big bad, Ronan(Lee Pace) the accuser. Gamora wants to stop the chaos. Drax wants to avenge the death of his near and dear ones. Groot &amp; Rocket want to get the huge reward by capturing Quill and bringing him back to the Nova corps and leader, Nova Prime(Glenn Close). Now, it is up to, Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, Groot &amp; Rocket to get the orb, before it falls into Ronan's corrupt &amp; evil grasp. Guardians of the Galaxy is an extremely good film. Like any other Marvel movie, the humor is there throughout the movie. There are also a number of Laugh-Out-Loud moments. The special effects are mind blowing. Guardians of the Galaxy is the best 3D movie of the year. The 3D has been put to great use from the first scene, to the last scene. Good job, James Gunn. What makers this movie so likable are the boy/girl- next-door characters and the outstanding performances. Chris Pratt is spectacular as Peter Quill. Pratt has worked really hard to get into the skin of his character. Quill is completely muscular and Pratt never loses his cheeky charm, which is common in all his movies. Pratt is outstanding in the emotional scenes as well. Zoe Saldana is amazing as Gamora. Dave Bautista is impressive as Drax. Vin Diesel is effective as Groot. Bradley Cooper is hysterical &amp; full of energy as Rocket. Lee Pace is wickedly villainous as Ronan. Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Djimon Hounsou, John C. Reilly, Glenn Close &amp; Benicio Del Toro are awesome as Yondu, Nebula, Korath, Corpsman Dey, Nova Prime &amp; The Collector respectively. Guardians of the Galaxy is a must watch. It's a movie for the underdog in all of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Guardians of the Galaxy" - living proof of a number of sayings and proverbs. Alternatively: "The number of passes in quality", "Do not fix what is works "," First you work on reputation, then the reputation you "," Patience and hard work - a little effort "," Seven times measure - one cut off ", and so forth. And if you think that all of the above wisdom will be reflected in the movie - you will be surprised, as the film primarily the result of their application in practice. Indeed, since the announcement of the "first phase of Marvel» and presentation ambitious plan, the result of which were "The Avengers", the creators and then honed business creation algorithm cash entertaining movie. of film to film in this comics universe, by trial and error, then cutting, then adding some elements, created this recipe. And Eventually by a huge team of talented people and local deity Joss Whedon, viewers have seen firsthand how in one frame can coexist huge green monster, a man in cyberspace suit, with a hammer and an alien visitor from the past. In view of all above, potential visitor session "Guardians" was morally willing to contemplate talking tree, aggressive raccoon, green and Woman lilac pitching, not even acquainted with the original. Moreover, readiness to quickly grew into a burning desire, once it became clear what kind of fun awaits the viewer. Although it would seem, what's new? How many times have we shown this - completely different characters stumble into a team and take on a common goal become a real community. All this combined with the space battles, hunting for a powerful artifact and amusing skirmishes. At the time of start to yawn and tedious to say that it is, say, repeat, self repeated plagiarism. The most basic dignity accountable movie that it just do not give free minutes for the above classes lasciviousness. From the first minute you sit down in a chair great, ride quality, which after a short interlude immediately gaining speed. From time to time, after the next bend, sitting in a chair given the issue of well-being, and as soon as you hear the sound of at least some, which is accepted as an affirmative answer, a new round begins events. Without delay, without sagging, but not turning in Kaleidoscope, the film does not come off themselves throughout timekeeping. About team of local heroes will tell you more than once or twice. And yes, raccoon - Incomparable. Many go on precisely this aggressive, Fluffy foul-mouthed and get it in full, but at the same time will surprised at how harmonious and interesting wood can be character, in the truest sense of the word. Another nice thing to expect the viewer as only losers, which is what the protagonists person rush into a whirlpool of events. Without pathos, without strain, from time to time mocking the canons of the genre, they will act in accordance with simple human motivation. In each they own, but will summarize the main premise of the team itself Quil (Star Lord), with it, as the real bummer and rogue - the mouth of another character. And all this, mind you, without interruption from the universe «Marvel», just a little bit on the sidelines. That look because of the angle appears reactor Hammer, purple or striped pants dimensionless shield. But even without chief operating locomotive this cinematic characters series, is the host of the place of references to the original tapes and other "The Avengers", but nothing about the scene after the credits (wait required) and say nothing - the level of recklessness and idiocy it happening head and shoulders above anything that you may have seen before. Local humor, above the waist level, is not trivial, although a little child - and is worthy of all degrees of madness going on, and those who generates. The film can safely go to both children and adults - everyone find a fun taste. Space battles and landscapes, beautiful soundtrack music Tyler Bates and incredible colorful pictures - only a few components of this holiday entertaining movie. everywhere Experience movies seen the first two "phases Marvel» and light touch of the hand local demiurge Whedon - he knows how to balance one narrative and a motley crew of characters. If you have such a possibility, heartily recommend going to IMAX - local 3D multicolority and worthy of your attention in this capacity. As a result, the viewer is invited to walk hateful outer futuristic bike. At first glance - nothing beyond outstanding, except that all quality, nicely decorated, with use of modern technology and the experience of past episodes. All that is adored and cherished guarded in such a movie, director James Gunn provided with ease and love, which is visible in each frame of the film. "Guardians of the Galaxy" - excellent, beautiful and funny movie that can not only entertain and inspire, and give real holiday moviegoers of all ages.Source - http://review.couplelovestyle.com/kosmicheskij-velosiped/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the 2012 film "The Avengers", "Guardians of the Galaxy" is a movie that had a lot riding against it and in the hands of a lesser filmmaker, would have failed. "Guardians of the Galaxy" knows how ridiculous it is and plays with that aspect to make the film work. While primarily a comedy film, the movie still manages to have some serious and sentimental moments in it that do not feel out of place, my guess being that that is attributed to James Gunn's (Super, Slither) directing and writing skills.Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), who was abducted from earth as a young boy, has now become a criminal who calls himself Starlord. On a planet, Quill steals the an orb, which serves as the movie's MacGuffin, and escapes from a group of people trying to stop him. Quill refuses to return to his colleague Yondu (Michael Rooker) so they can make money off the orb together, who subsequently places a bounty on Quill's head. When Quill tries to sell the orb, he is met by the resistance of three others, Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel) who want to capture Quill for the bounty on his head, and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) who wants to take the orb and give it to her buyer. All four are captured and sent to a prison where they encounter Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista). The group learns from Gamora, a former minion of Ronan (Lee Pacer) that Ronan wants the orb to destroy the galaxy, the five criminals band together to escape the prison and get the orb to Gamora's buyer, with Drax wanting to use his freedom as an opportunity to kill Ronan.While other Marvel movies seemed to have a lot of comedy that felt out of place at time or got annoying, "Guardians of the Galaxy" is able to make the comedy work with it. With the ridiculousness of the movie, "Guardians of the Galaxy" would probably of only worked as a comedy. In the hands of a lesser writer and possibly director, the movie would try to work by pointing out how ridiculous everything in it really is, but instead they made it an actual comedy. Even though it was a comedy, it still managed to have some serious and sentimental moments with investment in the characters. Comedy-wise, this is probably one of the best ways I've seen it used because it is not needlessly funny and it knows just how much to give out.All of the actors in this movie are very good and have good chemistry with one another, even though half of them are computer generated. I usually do not bring up acting unless I am really surprised by it or am just flabbergasted at how bad it is, but I really felt the need to comment with this one. While none of the performances are Academy Award worthy, with a film like this there was a chance that some of the actors would just do as bad a job as possible to see if they could get away with it. All of the actors give as good a performance as they can. Surprisingly, Dave Bautista, the voice of Drax, is very good in the movie because usually having a wrestler acting in a movie hurts it, but Bautista does a very good job.I'd say the one area of the film that lacked was with the villain of Ronan. Other than the fact that he is one of the most powerful beings in the galaxy, there really isn't much to his character and he is kind of a bore. Compared to other Marvel villains like Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Magneto (Ian McKellen/Michael Fassbender), and the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), there isn't anything that really sets him apart as a character. While he is not as badly written as the villains in "The Amazing Spider-Man 2", they at least had aspects that set them apart. Complete with good characters, a good story, and a mixture of funny and serious moments that don't feel like they contradict each other, "Guardians of the Galaxy" is a surprisingly good movie. In fact, this movie was fun, unlike a lot of comic book movies have recently been.</fullReview>

And my answer was, well, since I thought the movie was excellent, they did justice to all the characters. My biggest fear was that this was going to be too kiddie (the talking raccoon in the preview and the tree). but it wasn't. It's highly entertaining with a good plot, good characters and great pace. The special effects are amazing.. you completely forget that the tree and the raccoon are digital characters, you just accept them. This is a movie for the whole family, also a movie I think single adults males and females will enjoy. It reminds me of when I first saw Star Wars and I am not afraid to compare it to that glee I felt after wards. I think this film is deserved of multiple viewings and a must have when it released. And Chris Pratt is the perfect "Star Lord".. sort of like both Harrison Ford character Indiana Jones and Hans Solo wrapped up into one".</fullReview>

It is burned into my head when I saw it more than 30 years ago and it made this type of action finale what it is today and at this point, there is no reason to do it again. But Marvel keeps digging it up. I don't even give two clasps about Thanos this or Ronan that gobbledygook garbage. That stuff is clearly pushed into the script in heavy portions by the Marvel heads when Gunn was clearly onto something all by himself. There are many many other ways to end a movie without that freaking cliché, but I guess the CG for this stuff is prefab. Despite all these misgivings, the movie does succeed.The ridiculous Ronan seems lifted directly from Animal House's Neidermeyer, the movie really lacks any sense of suspense but the exchanges of the Guardians anchor the movie with Mo- Town and 70s pop muzak. Somewhere in there is a better movie without air fortress battles and "there's to many of them" quotes lifted from Star Wars, but you'll laugh enough to pay for the ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first i was skeptical about seeing this movie, i knew none of the comic lore and was going in as blind as a bat. I was surprised at what i found.Let me start off by saying that this is one of the best superhero films to date! The chemistry between the actors was brilliant and the plot was not confusing at all event to a newcomer to the Guardians like myself.Out of all the performances my favorites was Chris Pratt's. He plays the role of star lord amazingly.This is probably one of the best character representations in a film I've ever seen. He does so well he sounds like an outlaw from the western movies, but with a modern twist. My favorite character wasn't even Pratt, it was Bautista's character Drax. He was always so serious and and to the point that it was hilarious almost every time when he had a conversation.The only problems i had with this movie was that, it was slow at times and boring in others. I also didn't care for the after credit scene to much.All in all Guardians of the Galaxy is a must watch and must buy when it come out on DVD.See you in Age of Ultron-M</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Proving without a doubt that Marvel do their best work when putting themselves out on a dangerously twiggy limb without a safety net, Guardians of the Galaxy has made one hell of an entrance.I was prepared for it to be little more than a curio. With Marvel's standard teaser trailers revealing some out of context attempts at humour and little in the way of storyline I'd already made my peace with the possibility that this would be Marvel's first, well-meaning misstep. On paper, it's a potentially epic fail. A largely unknown property that straddles the no man's land between comic book fantasy and space opera, populated by a cast of not exactly household names and fronted by the chubby guy from cult (i.e. beloved but little seen) mockumentary Parks and Rec, it features a band of initially charmless felons that include a talking tree with a 3 word vocabulary, a double crossing thief and a trigger happy raccoon. Instead, like the Jon Favreau's Iron-Man and Joss Whedon's Avengers, James Gunn's Guardians is - in defiance of all logic and expectation - a beautifully bonkers triumph. Like the best comic book movies, it downright revels in the flaws of its heroes from the monosyllabic Groot (surely the easiest paycheck Vin Diesel has ever earned) to the narcissistic self regard of roguish leader Peter Quill aka Star Lord aka the newly buff Chris Pratt. It's also laced with Marvel's trademark tongue-in-cheek humour which, as ever, extends to the slickly conceived comic book violence (watch Groot take out...pretty much anyone).If anything, between the wisecracking Quill and Rocky Raccoon (Bradley Cooper in possibly a career best turn - and yes, I have seen Silver Linings Playbook) and the beatific Groot, Zoe Saldana's Gamora and Dave Bautista's homicidal Drax do come across as marginally less interesting.But faced with the challenge of introducing an entirely new galaxy to an entirely new audience in 121 all too brief minutes, Guardians breathes heart and soul into its cornucopia of heroic freaks with cunning efficiency while still finding time for hordes of cameos (not least the end credits, which features the most unlikely comeback of all time). Confronted by near omnipotent villains (Liverpudlian Lee Pace doing a storming job as an interstellar terrorist), and infused with an almost childlike nostalgia (aided and abetted by the gleefully retro soundtrack - on a mixtape no less!) it's little wonder that whispered comparisons with Star Wars can already be heard. I count myself among those mildly alarmed by the departure of Ed Wright from the upcoming Ant-Man, but between Guardians and The Winter Soldier, my wavering faith has been sufficiently buoyed. I may not have a clue what Marvel are up to, but as long as they do who am I to argue with these comic savants when they're capable of such cinematic alchemy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chix Chat on Film review: A Marvelous tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a Sci-fi film with enviable comic relief this story had to have one of the saddest opening scenes ever when we first encounter a young Peter Quill (Wyatt Oleff), who appears to be just any small town USA young boy experiencing a devastating hardship, then his life takes an incredible turn for the unexpected. What this scenes does besides pose a question of who fathered him it sets up the soundtrack that accompanies the entire film, since in 1988 everyone had their Sony Walkman and Peter was no exception. We immediately fast forward to 26 years later and find an adult Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) who is a bit of a scalawag, on a commissioned job to retrieve a mysterious orb, which leads to unimaginable adventure. The story of how the Guardians came together was happening on the forefront, but there were also some other major stories taking place like a maniacal Ronan (Lee Pace) bent on destroying a world, Drax (Dave Bautista) driven by revenge, whatever the heck was going on with Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) who was some sort of space pirate and a sibling rivalry that made for one of the great fight scenes. There were a number of things that tied this film to other stories that have been told focusing on the Marvel Universe including Benicio Del Toro reprising his role as the Collector who we only encounter briefly in Thor the Dark World (after credits) and Thanos another after credits character previously introduced. The special effects in this film were as big a star as the actual stars especially for the only characters who were already in league together, Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel). These characters always felt as real as Star-Lord, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Drax. Who would have expected to come to a movie and feel any kind of emotional attachment to a raccoon?! If you stick around through the credits you will understand why the effects were first rate, there had to be at least ten animation companies credited. As with all the Marvel films there is an after credits scene, however the thing is if you are too young to remember the pop culture of the 80s you may not get the joke. This was storytelling at its best, and was very entertaining from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's nothing short of a miracle that there are heroes out there who can save the planet, but as for Peter Quill, who just lost his mother and his father is out to get him Star Lord a.k.a Peter, gets to go on a adventure that he has never dreamed up of. Along with an assassin, who is out to steal an orb for a powerful being who is out to destroy planets, that contains a stone that could destroy planets and beings, a raccoon, a tree, a powerful inmate, Peter takes back the galaxy and saves the galaxy from the ultimate annihilation. But what these unexpected heroes don't know there is a plot and an unknown evil who is seeking for stones to gain control over the entire galaxy that can spell ultimate doom for everything and everyone in it. This movie was good to say the least. The casting was exceptional, the graphics were superb, the direction was good. It was no more or no less than perfection, but it could have been a little more on the adventure side. I'm not saying it lacked adventure, it just needed more. I just can't wait to see the 7 stones, OOPS!, did I say that? Well, we'll just have to see what Volume 2 has for us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Be warned - DO NOT TAKE THIS MOVIE SERIOUSLY, OR YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. It is a light comedy, a joke adventure, and it should be judged as such, watch it in that mood only. If you liked Ant-Man, it is very likely you will enjoy this one too.The plot perfectly justifies the existence of every character, no matter how ludicrous the concept might appear on a first consideration (like a talking raccoon!) and it has some very nice, fun action sequences. Some of the fantasy space environments shown are great. The makeup and CGI use is amazing, and flawlessly executed. The characters are likable, and the action-humor balance is well done, at least in my opinion. For those who say it is dumb or childish, it really isn't any more than any other Marvel movie.I never watched this one when it first came out, just because the idea of a talking Racoon and a plant man seemed so absurd that it drove me off. It looked stupid to me. I saw it on video yesterday, only because my wife insisted. I admit I was wrong for not doing it sooner. It is fair for it to be rated as one of the best in Marvel's movies, it totally deserve it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, stylish sci-fi adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is without any doubt the best Marvel movie I've seen. One big reason for that is, that it doesn't feel like you'd need to be familiar with every other Marvel movie out there: GotX stands on its own feet. None of the other Marvel movies feel this much like stand alone movies.When you think of it, GotX is a movie that is easy to watch even for a non-Marvel fan as a story about a boy who got abducted and became a space outlaw. Then he makes friends with a ragtag group of people and they end up saving the universe. It's fun, well made sci-fi flick, that doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't care if you know Iron-Man, Hulk or Captain America. Those are names that mean nothing in the part of the galaxy this movie takes place.What makes GotX also stand out is its relaxed atmosphere. Unlike many other sci-fi movies out there, it doesn't try to be unproportionally epic, it tries, and succeeds, to be a fun adventure, with characters you can root for. Sure, there's not that much character development with the bad guys, but you know they're bad and sometimes that's enough information.Guardians of the Galaxy is one Marvel movie I'd recommend even for those people who aren't into Marvel movies. Out of their line up it definitely is easiest to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I write this, the soundtrack to the film in question is blaring on a loop through my earbuds. A purchase made mere hours before actually seeing said movie. I would have purchased it even if the movie tuned out to be a dud, because it's that good. Imagine a summer road trip playlist put together by Tarantino himself. What amazing times we live where O-O-H Child by The Five Stairsteps can play over the final battle scene of an Action/Sci-fi/Comic Book romp and it actually works. And that is what makes this film so brilliant, it takes the ludicrous and does just that, makes it work. But I digress, Guardians of the Galaxy is, no doubt, the most satisfying experience I've had at the movies in a long time.--Continues reading at: http://www.mockfilmsblog.com/2014/08/guardians-of-galaxy.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When first announced that the comic book "Guardians of the Galaxy" would have a film adaptation and obviously would be connected to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, many people were excited and looked forward to the launch of the film, but for me it was just another movie superhero in an era where the superhero films are the owners of the box office. There was just thinking the same thing with the sequel to Captain America, The Winter Soldier, where I said to myself "Is just another superhero movie to make more money", but I was wrong, and now the guardians of the galaxy had the opportunity to keep my mouth shut just as the Cap. And they did. It is definitely a cool movie, full of action and comedy that made me laugh the entire film, even crying and jumping with excitement. The guards turned out to be the Avengers space but with its own essence and style. Marvel once again make me shut my mouth and look forward to the sequel of my new favorite movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so much fun, I went in the theatre knowing nothing about it, and came out with a beaming smile on my face. The movie doesn't pretend to be anything else, it is what it is, a fun Superhero movie for everyone! It has lots of action, lots of effects, many silly jokes, great music and it is to be enjoyed by children and adults alike, yet it was executed to perfection.Of course it isn't perfect, no movie is, but because you are having such a great time with it you quickly forget about any short comings. What the movie does extremely well is that, it provides us with characters we quickly get attached to and end up caring about. And because of it not only does the movie take us on an epic adventure filled with action and laughter but also an emotional one.The movie has so many great moments, who could forget the epic dance off at the end? How about the thesaurus joke? But it wasn't just about being funny, how did you feel when Groot decided to sacrifice himself to save our heroes? What about when Groot lit up the inside of Dark Esther? Which was one the most beautiful cinematic moments, only to be quickly ruined, quite deliberately, by Drax's epic speech! If only every superhero movie was this good and this much fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love this film. I never heard of Chris Pratt until I watched this movie. His performance in this film was truly entertaining and brought something new to the heroes of Hollywood! He is simply a natural at what he does and his performance seemed effortless throughout the whole movie. Every character in the movie brought something to the table and each one was different but they all had such great chemistry. Tying in his love for his mother made a lot of people connect to the main character as well especially since it is a sci-fi. I enjoyed the visual affects, but what really made it for me was the comedy. The comedy made this film. Chris Pratt made this film. It really put him on the map and especially being his first lead in a huge blockbuster. Good for him. I am sure this will open up more roles for him. Look forward to seeing him in more big roles like this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As much as Marvel sucks, well, this doesn't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel Studios has become an idiocratic cult that has somehow created for itself a cinematic niche which only it can fill and sustain. Year after year, Marvel manages to garner critical acclaim with flimsy, repetitive narratives and tiresome characters, critics and the masses alike revelling in obvious exercises of money-grubbing banality. Age of Ultron, even as a comic book film, was senseless, feeling almost like a remake of its much better (but still poor) predecessor. Ant Man was laughably clichéd, barely scraping by on its mildly intriguing visual innovation. Fantastic Four was ghastly. And the Avengers are the single most annoying bundle of inconsistent characters that I have ever been unfortunate enough to acquaint myself with. Glancing at the synopses for Marvel's upcoming endeavours, I am struck at how similar they all seem to older Marvel fare; conceptually impaired, overly serious, and all thoroughly atrocious. I often wonder why Marvel is the Hollywood powerhouse that it is, when it seems to dabble only in the realm of glorified TV movies.Then I remember Guardians of the Galaxy.Guardians is the best Star Wars spoof you'll ever see. I might even go so far as to say that it is a better film than Star Wars, but I'm sure that such a sentiment would spark death threats and such, and even thinking about it now, I'd like to take that one back. Guardians may surpass Star Wars in terms of charm and colour, but Star Wars has a better feel for its characters and concludes with nothing less than pure jubilation. Screw you, Death Star! Chris Pratt stars as the ever-lovable, cheerful renegade Peter Quill, who was kidnapped by space aliens when he was nine or so, right after his mother dies in front of him. Brutal stuff. And after we are forced to sit through the Marvel logo, which reminds us that cinema is art only in the sense that capitalism is art, we are transported across the galaxy to a planet with a super funky name. And I mean transported. The film's visuals are really quite stunning, the bleakness of space enlivened with red, orange, green and blue, making it feel like a mystical Tolkien-esque realm rather than, well, space. In fact, the film itself is a mind-blowing celebration of colour and shape, revelling in the capacity of the silver screen to mesmerize an individual out of existence. I'd say in terms of visuals, it epitomizes CGI-based escapism.But this is all an afterthought when acknowledging the film's merits. While the visuals are remarkable, what really intrigued me about the film was its novelty, wit, and wonderful characters. Every character is given depth and self-awareness. I don't recall ever laughing so hard in a Marvel film. And I have to admit, a few scenes brought tears to my eyes.Guardians has heart and soul, and a solid dose of hilarity to boot. And although it may be the first of a billion-dollar franchise, well, I could care less. I don't want to say this, but...agh... urgh... gah......thanks, Marvel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of 2014.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my favorite film of 2014. When I saw the trailer, I asked myself how any movie with a talking raccoon and tree in "space" could be good, but I was wrong. That so called tree's name was Groot, and he was my favorite character. I think that what I liked about this movie is its variety of genres. The soundtrack consisted of some of the best all time songs, and the director had those songs played at the perfect moments. I found myself in tears more than once,(beginning when star lord's mom is dying, when Groot dies, and when star lord discover the second mix-tape his mom has left him) and laughing seconds later. My favorite scene was when The Guardians are close to death and Groot knows he is the only thing that can save them. Throughout the entire movie the only words he says are "i am Groot", yet in this scene, while his fellow guardians are wrapped in his branches, his last words are "We are Groot" This scene was so emotional which shows a lot considering it involved a talking tree. I also liked a lot of Star Lord's scenes because his character was so humerus. There is not one flaw that comes to mind when i think about Guardians of the galaxy, and I think it is a movie that everyone needs to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The surprise film of 2014!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, that is exactly how I felt about this movie: the biggest surprise of 2014! I don't think Marvel would have ever predicted how much of a commercial and critical success this movie brought in. When people first found out about this movie, nobody cared about it. However, after the trailer was relished, people suddenly became exited for it, and when it came out, it suddenly became the highest grossing movie of this year. Critics loved, and audiences loved it the same. Me, as a big Marvel and Sci Fii geek, thought that this movie was awesome.First thing i liked about this movie is Chris Pratt's star making role as Peter Quill/ Starlord. He is almost the definition of a great protagonist. He has a lot of humor, wit, and charm to captivate the audience, and he also did well at the emotional scenes. He is pretty much the combination of Han Solo and James T. Kirk. The rest of the cast is also great, including Bradley Cooper as Rocky Raccoon and Zoe Zaldana as Gamora. Another Highlight of this movie was the action scenes. The films action scenes reminded me that of scenes from Star Wars and Star Trek, which I really liked. The films humor, as I said before, is also really great, but the film also pulls off some great emotional scenes. Overall, Guardians of The Galaxy is a great movie for all lovers of Marvel and Sci Fi. James Gunn delivers an fast, funny, and exiting movie about a band of misfits. Go see it, it is one of the best movies of 2014, and a highlight from one of the best years for Marvel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I saw this movie on blue ray yesterday for the first time. I thought this movie would be stupid as heck when I saw the trailer come last year. I didn't see it when it was released in August, but when I saw the ratings, I wanted to see it on Blue Ray. Boy, this movie was awesome. It was FUN too. I think it was, in a way, refreshing. It's a relatively new group of heroes, sort of doing their own thing that is not tied to the avengers....for now. This movie was super risky to make. But James Gunn, I applaud you, you nailed it. It's funny, and the CGI is amazing. The Cosmos looked so good in the film. I liked the story, because I am a big fan of the Avengers, and this movie is merging into that, so you know any fan of the avengers will enjoy this. The acting was so good, even Bradley Cooper's voice over for Rocket. The movie just felt fun. I hope the next one will be even better. Marvel is really stepping it up lately, which is a very good thing. Looking forward to Guardians of the Galaxy 2!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel do it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Guardian of the Galaxy.' Who are they? I didn't know. Of course I quickly found out that they were based on ? yet another ? Marvel comic book, but a lesser-known one this time. And ? yet again ? we have another branch of the 'Marvel cinematic universe' which is currently best known for Iron Man, Thor, the Avengers and so on. However, what's most notable here is that 'The Guardians' is possibly the least 'linked' movie to what's already gone before. You could almost consider it a 'stand alone' film which needs no real knowledge of all three Iron Man movies (for example) to watch it.Perhaps Marvel knew they were taking a gamble, investing so much money in a film that *most* people haven't really heard of. That's why they didn't 'link' it that much. That way, if it bombed at the Box Office, they could quietly forget about it and carry on with what's popular, i.e. 'Earth-based' superhero movies.But then that's not going to happen. Because 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is great. Maybe what's best about it is that it doesn't really feel like a 'superhero movie' even though it's set in the same cinematic universe. In case you don't know... the five Guardians who find themselves forced to band together in order to stop an evil intergalactic warlord from destroying the universe (nothing new on the plot, eh?) are: Star Lord ? our former resident of Earth, now all grown up and living in outer space while acting like a bad boy version of Han Solo, a green-skinned warrior babe alien called Gamora (Star Lord's obvious love interest ? again, nothing new there), a muscle-bound alien, Drax, a borderline psychotic cyborg-racoon, Rocket and his tree-friend, Groot. Star Lord is basically the star, so he gets much of the screen time. He's played by Chris Pratt who enjoys being the bad boy and does it well. However, just Gollum partly stole the show in Lord of the Rings, it's the computer-generated Rocket the manic racoon who's a sheer joy to watch (Bradley Cooper who voiced him said he based Rocket on Joe Pesci's bonkers character from Goodfellas ? yes, sometimes I could kind of see that there ? think a furry Joe Pesci with a tree for a best mate).Now, it wouldn't be half as much fun if this lot all got on. So they don't. Like the Avengers they constantly argue and bicker and try to outdo each other as much as possible. And that's fun to watch; it's a good way to enjoy the light-hearted nature of this semi-Star Wars clone before the action starts. Naturally, there are plenty of action scenes ? laser fights, chases, space battles. They come with the territory and keep the kids happy. Personally, I found all these a little too computer-generated and ? sometimes, especially while in space ? I couldn't tell who was shooting at who.Basically, you don't need to know much about Marvel's 'universe' to enjoy this. You only need to enjoy family sci-fi action films to appreciate this. Deep down, I know there's nothing that new about this film, it's plot or cast, yet I can't really help but love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Favourite movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I thought this was going to be some tired 'America saves the universe' pastiche, full of same old same old characters and heroic dialogue, beautiful and invincible agents and so on. So when it me laugh out loud within 5 minutes, more from surprise thanactual comedy I'll admit, I started to think that maybe this would be something a little different.What I realised early on is that this is the film Serenity thinks is was and so desperately wanted to be. Nothing wrong with Serenity (apart from poor casting), but GOTG was fun, funny, thrilling and looked fantastic from the start. It took the old superhero clichés and made then look ridiculous with lines like 'Ok, Im standing. Here we are, all standing in a circle. Like jackasses'. Sure, the pirate with a heart of gold has been done to death, but never with so much tongue in cheek irreverence, panache and plain old fun.Visually it's stunning, the characters are believable and well constructed, even Groot, a walking and talking tree. There is absolutely zero in the way of hero talk and that's what really sets this apart from the likes of Capt America and The Avengers. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but is happy to poke a bit of fun at the genre. Maybe some of the language and humour isn't suitable for children, but its not too strong and kids under 9-10 probably wont notice anyway.Also, it has a brilliant soundtrack. I can't wait for part 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Avengers on crack !!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard the name "Guardians of the Galaxy" and then heard that it was another Marvel film, I couldn't help but feel that it was going to be another one of those quintessential Marvel films. I don't dislike them,but the frequency of their releases has started to get on my nerves, and also the fact that most of them have become monotonous and similar in structure and content has made me slightly indifferent about them. Fortunately I was wrong in this case.Guardians of the Galaxy is one of those grand summer blockbusters that lets you relax without demanding too much introspection, however it remains witty,really funny and never becomes uninteresting. It is a film that knows what it is which is a popcorn blockbuster and it works brilliantly. The main reason why it works is the non- serious style in which James Gunn has directed this film. There is no forced seriousness, no contrived sentiments for the most parts and the humour is fantastic. There are conversations that had me belly laughing. The story is well written and cgi work is great(as is expected from a Marvel film). What elevates the film to the next level is the quality of the characters. The main characters namely Peter, Gomora, Rocket, Groot and Dax are all likable, memorable characters with their own distinguishing personalities and identities. The voice- over job done by Bradley Cooper is fabulous. Chris Pratt is fantastic as Peter or the "outlaw" Star-lord, Zoe Saldana puts in another solid performance in a sci-fi film, Batista also did well with the limited acting experience that he has.The script is magnificent. The writers went all the way to make the film as funny as it possibly could be. Yes there are a number of conveniences and it might have been a problem in a different film, but for a film like this whose sole purpose is to entertain the crap out of you and do it in such a witty,funny way, I am willing to overlook them. The only negative is that the character of the villain could have been more developed and more intimidating.Guardians of the Galaxy can be described as a witty,funny and devilishly sarcastic brother of The Avengers. I had read an article where The Avengers were called The Beatles of Marvel and Guardians of the Galaxy,The Rolling Stones. All i can say is that I have always preferred the Stones over the Beatles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awesome Marvel movie I have ever seen since the Avengers! I'm not familiar with the story, I never read the Guardians comics but sometimes that's part of the fun; just experiencing the story by movie standards regardless if it doesn't follow the source material. I don't know if it does so I can't tell you if it does, and even if I did I probably wouldn't tell you. I'd let you see it for yourself. Aside from that, the special effects are incredible! Some of the stuff looks like they used the same effects for Andy Serkis from Lord of the Rings, King Kong, Rise/Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. I don't want to say too much and spoil it for you. All I can say is if you liked the Avengers, you'll love this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As I suspected, that raccoon makes it all worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As most comic book movies and blockbusters in general, this film is a classic fantasy with some modern mambo-jumbo thrown in instead of magic. But at the same time it is much more a character driven story than most sci-fi action movies I've seen in a while. That's a good thing!Now, I have no idea what the comics were like, I went to see the film because it was 3D and it has a rad raccoon in it! Yeah, I am that shallow. But even if some of the characters were cardboard, like the unfortunate case of Karen Gillan's, most of them had depth and humor. One thing you should NOT do, and that is buy into the antihero hype. Every time Hollywood tries to sell you anti-heroes they just mean regular heroes that are not spotless boyscouts to begin with.As expected, the raccoon was really nice, but not in a cartoonish way, but in an angry frustrated creature that had attachment to only his trusted friend Groot. Vin Diesel played Groot, but there was no reason to do that. The character was completely animated and had no real dialogue. Why hire a known actor for that? One of the other interesting characters was Bautista's. He is the classic "Barbarian", but has a lot of emotional depth.Bottom line: unexpectedly good, even for a mainstream genre movie. Don't expect miracles, but it is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, I get to see Guardians of the Galaxy while it's still in theaters, and I'm glad I did. It's the story of a ragtag band of five heroes fighting against evil in the universe. The fact that one of them is a raccoon and other is a tree is immaterial, as is the fact that each of them is a criminal of little repute. Point is, they're good guys taking on the evil Ronan, a being who seeks a legendary Infinity Stone, an ancient artifact that can grant the possessor devastating powers (and often death).The Infinity Stone is held inside something called the Orb, about the size of a softball. The Stone itself is a gem on the same order as the Cosmic Cube seen in Captain America: The First Avenger. So, yes, the universe in which The Guardians exist is the same one in which Cap and the rest of the Avengers exist. Seeking the Orb is Ronan (Lee Pace), at the behest of the mighty Thanos (an uncredited Josh Brolin) so that Thanos will help eradicate the planet Xandor for him. In any event, it's a middling thief named Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), aka Star Lord, who grabs the Orb himself in a cave on an abandoned planet. Ronan's thugs, led by Korath (Djimon Hounsou), attack Quill, but the latter manages to escape in his chrome spaceship. Quill tries to sell the Orb to a broker, but when it's learned that Ronan is involved, the broker declines, which leads to Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a green-skinned assassin, attacking Peter in order to retrieve the Orb, under the orders of Thanos, her adopted father. Ah, but at the same time, two bounty hunters - a riotous raccoon named Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and a sentient tree named Groot (Vin Diesel) spot Quill, who by this time is a very, very wanted man. They, too, join the m?lée, but all four of them wind up captured and sent to a high-security prison called Kyln, which seems like a combination of "killing" and "kiln," and which in any event looks like a bad place to be. And, if you're Gamora, it is, because she's Thanos' daughter, and much of the criminals in Kyln have had their planets, homes, and families destroyed by Thanos. It is also at Kyln that our quartet meets up with the fifth member of their tribe: Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), who has a personal vendetta against Ronan. Drax is huge, sort of blue, and is deeply sensitive - although he has no idea how metaphors work.Not only is the action fast paced, the dialog - perfectly delivered by a top-notch cast - is terrific and hilarious. Sure, a prevailing theme is the old chestnut about people from diverse backgrounds coming together to fight a common enemy, but think of this as a higher-tech Star Wars, except with fewer robots. There are cultural references to the 80s (when Quill was abducted, as a young boy, from Earth), too. The chemistry among all of the leads is spot on; with each taking turns at saving the lives of the others. Even the plant-like Groot, who's often described as the muscle of the operations, shows plenty of savvy and a willingness to sacrifice himself to save others. There may be a lesson there somewhere.Along with Pratt, Saldana, Bautista, and the voices of Diesel and Cooper, the supporting cast features Benicio del Toro as a collector of rare objects, Hounsou, Michael Rooker as a fellow scoundrel to Peter Quill, John C. Reilly as a Xandorian official, and Glenn Close as Nova Prime (ruler of Xandor).In the end, good things happen. It's a comic-book movie, for goodness sake, so that's not a spoiler. But it's not really the end. Guardians of the Galaxy is a huge success as a standalone movie, and it leads into not only its own sequel but also that of The Avengers. If you look closely, you can spot some remnants of other Marvel Comics, items that may (or may not) indicate who or what will be involved in future cinematic stories from the studio. Guardians of the Galaxy is certainly fit to be in the same, ahem, universe inhabited by other blockbuster superhero films, like The Avengers, Thor, and Iron Man. It's visceral entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I'll say to all that those who didn't see this movie ,please go for this movie for a great Adventure Movie. As i am a huge Marvel fan I was delighted to hear this film was getting made with the perfect choice of Guardians and what a beautybul cast to play them. The greatest surprise for me was Dave Bautista who I thought was only cast for his size but his delivery was spot on for Drax. Chris Pratt was hilarious whilst still excellent at delivering some of the films most emotional and action scenes.CGI in this film was super, there's nothing I hate more than too much CGI in a film but it was so good in Guardians that I was completely lost in it. Never have a seen space look so good, the battles were incredible and Groot and Rocket never looked out of place (aside from being a tree and raccoon).Gunn is the perfect director for this, his tone, his balance of comedy, action and emotion blended perfectly and directing GOTG would have been not so easy job. DC are still trying hard to get Justice League going, Marvel just made a film with a talking tree and Raccoon and it was AWESOME SUPERB....!!! :) Love you Marbel</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by James Gunn Starring: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Dave Bautista, Lee Pace, Karen Gillan, Michael Rooker, Glenn Close, John C Reilly, Benicio Del Toro Certificate: 12A Running time: 121 Minutes Budget: 170 MillionAfter being abducted by a spaceship at an early age and discovering a mysterious orb in another part of the galaxy somewhat twenty six years later. Peter Quill from Earth, also known as Star Lord, becomes the target of a manhunt led by maniac and fanatic Ronan The Accuser. Whilst being hunted across the galaxy, Quill groups up with a team of misfits and criminals with contrasting and temperament personalities. Together, they must fight Ronan and his mercenaries to prevent the galaxies destruction and become recognised as "The Guardians of the Galaxy".The brand new instalment, brought to you by Marvel Studios is here. The Guardians of the Galaxy is an action, adventure, science fiction, superhero film, based on the marvel comic series of the same name. Already a critical and financial success, "Guardians of the Galaxy" is the tenth instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and with a sequel already announced, it is the next franchise at Marvel Studios. It becomes the fourteenth movie in 2014 to surpass $300 million worldwide at the box office, which it did in only a mere ten days. The film itself has been said to have "injected life" into an otherwise lower than normal summer box officePersonally, I have never read The Guardians of the Galaxy comic books, however I have always had an interest in Marvel movies, like much of the world. To me, I could not understand why Marvel gave this project the green light. After all, it was shot on a budget of $170 million. They were taking an extreme risk as a title unfamiliar to most and an actor also unknown to most, could potentially wound Marvels reputation, especially after the release of the critical acclaimed "The Avengers".Although I have previously been let down in the Marvel Universe with movies such as Iron Man 3, X-Men The Last Stand and the horrific supernatural Ghost Rider movies. I will continue to watch Marvel features, as long as they are released, this is because of the variation of pictures they now deliver to there audience and the enjoyment they usually bring. When I first recognised that Guardians of the Galaxy was announced I became intrigued as to how it may pan out. With James Gunn attached to the Directing duty, I was somewhat worried for the movie. No disrespect to the individual, but as I associate him with Scooby-Doo and its sequel, I presumed that this movie was going to be of a poor standard. However, I decided not to make a judgement, until I viewed a cinematic trailer. The trailer itself, blew me away. I had great expectations for Guardians of the Galaxy, certainly after the trailers release and they paid off. It is one of the best Marvel features in recent times and a personal favourite of mine. The film contains emotion, humour, a superb plot and fascinating characters with CGI to drool over. The casting choices are fantastic, however I do believe that John C. Reilly and Glenn Close, could have been used to a fuller effect. The performances are of a good standard, specifically Chris Pratts portrayal of Star Lord. However it is of course, Vin Diesels Groot what steals the show. It excels at being fun, which is its primary function after all and although there are a few minor plot holes, I believe the writing to be at its finest. I would recommend that you watch this movie in theatres as soon as you get the chance. And Most of all, it is a gamble that pays off for Marvel. In addition to this, I loved the soundtrack and the jokes and comedy lessen the tension and keep the scenes light and unique. I would imagine, that this is to really differentiate itself from Avengers Assemble, which could be made as a comparison due to there still being a team of individuals, saving a region, in this case the Galaxy of course. Guardians of the Galaxy is inventive, creative, innovative and quite frankly, I cannot wait for a sequel which I expect James Gunn and co- writer Nicole Perlman, to deliver only the best once again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY! The newest Marvel movie is about a rag tag group of mercenaries, thugs and thieves who find themselves building an unlikely partnership to get paid... or save the world, whichever comes first. This film marks the third entry in Marvel's phase 2 of films and on top of being the most risky property to date, I have to say that that it is so far the best. As skeptical as I was about this movie shining beyond its little recognized source material, it really turned out to be something that was really worth seeing! Everything here works, the dialogue is witty, the characters are very funny, the special effects are top notch and the action is literally out of this world. If you liked movies like The 5th Element or shows like Firefly and it's subsequent movie sequel Serenity, then you're going to LOVE this movie. If I had any complaints, I would say that at first it is rather tough to get into. There are an awful lot of names and planets and characters and plot lines that come at you pretty darn quick and if you're not ready for it you might just get lost. Also, you might want to put your brain into "anime mode" for the first 20-30 minutes or so where you just believe whatever you see without question, because the film asks you to believe a whole lot of really out there stuff compared to even the most outrageous earth based Marvel movies. That aside, I have to say that this is one of Marvel's best movies to date, so even if you're not a Guardians fan, you will still enjoy it and who knows, this movie just may make a fan out of you. Check it out because Guardians of the Galaxy gets a 4.5...out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Marvel Movie Since "The Avengers", Bar None, and Easily Among the Most Loved Sci-Fi Bonanzas Ever, Period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.9/5 starsGuardians of the Galaxy is just as irreverent as fans of the frequently zany Marvel comic would expect - as well as funny, thrilling, full of heart, visually splendid, and packed with witty one-liners. Chris Pratt, overflowing with charisma, plays Peter Quill a.k.a "Star Lord", the leader of the pack of endearing misfits, and his blissed-out space cowboy (with a love for 70s and 80s music) is so full of good will that he buoys the film and its requisite whizbang special effects. Zoe Saldana is smoking hot as Gamora, and brings a sense of visceral sensuality and deadly dynamism to her role. For the first time Dave Bautista is well-cast in a role that actually exploits his physical prowess along with his unexpectedly bang-on deadpan humor. Bradley Cooper renders one of the best voice-overs ever for a computer-generated, cinematic character, and his "Rocket Racoon" along with the imposing, muscular, tree figure, "Groot", literally steal more than a few scenes with their physical humor and witty dialogues.Director and co-writer James Gunn, brings a giddy, wondrous, endless sense of satisfaction to proceedings, which is possibly, dare I say it, reminiscent of the grand sci-fi space saga of your - the "Star Wars" trilogy. Gunn appears to remember the high of certain kinds of movie-going experiences, where when the credits are over, all you want to do is get back in line and enjoy the whole damn thing again. The plot is bonkers, but to Gunn's immense credit, the core little group of disparate characters manage to latch themselves to you, and you're in for the whole ride. Gunn has helped take a relatively unknown property and made a film that will surely help blast these incredible characters to a level of fame that will spread across the galaxy.Guardians of the Galaxy" has wit, energy and zaniness to spare. It's overstuffed with effects and incidents, but it looks great, it feels fresh and is sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. It will pop your corn and leave you hungry for more. If blockbusters are the cinematic equivalent of junk food, then 2014 has been a goddamn ice-cream sundae, and this movie in particular is the bright, sickly sweet cherry sitting on top. "Guardians of the Galaxy" isn't just a fun- filled, adrenaline- pumping, visually dashing, humor-laden, ripping space sci-fi adventure; it's one of the best, most crowd-pleasing blockbusters in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epicly Awesome But Sorry Its Just 2nd To Cap 2 For Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fourth entry for Marvel this year and this one surely didn't disappoint me. I am among the fans who never knew about the Guardians of The Galaxy until the movie's trailer came out but was really intrigued by it especially after finding out that Dave Bautista was going to be in the film The story was nice creative and not all that straight forward save the universe kind of plot just the way I like it. It was all adrenalin rush from start to finish for me but done in a really good way and the balance between seriousness and humor was really well organized. The characters were all great to watch and despite their annoyance sometimes, I did kind of feel sorry for them after hearing about the background story especially Quall's and Drax's story. The effects were over the top excellent for me. Nothing much more I can say about thatActing wise, Chris Pratt does a solid job as Star Lord. He had the looks, charm, leadership and the skills which he shows he perfectly in this movie. His costume in this movie might be one of my favorites yet Zoe Zaldana as Gamora didn't impress me that much in the film but she did well for her role and her tragic background story on being the half daughter of Thanos kind of reminds me of MK's KitanaDave Bautista in a way was a surprise entrance here for me. His performance as Drax for me was one of the best in the film especially during the 2nd half of it. He definitely earned my respect for his role in this film and shame on the WWE fans who criticized him for leaving wrestling. Keep it up BautisaThis maybe Bradley Cooper's finest voice performance yet as Rocket Raccoon. His character reminds me of Face, another character which he played in The A Team (minus the charming personality). He for me was the most annoying character in the movie Groot however was a quite a shocking one for me. Don't get me wrong , his character is great but Vin Diesel going from a bad ass Dominic Torreto to a the tough but dumb personality like Groot felt kind of like not his original style but nevertheless, Groot looks so innocent in this movie and I felt bad for him getting bullied by Rocket most of the timeRonan The Accuser is one of the most scariest villain designs I've seen in a while but his presence was really menacing and really evil but enjoyable to watch at the same timeI enjoyed watch Nebula more that Gamora in this film. Karen Gillan does an awesome job for the role. She has definitely made me become a fan of hers after this movie. I felt really sorry for her character though. Although the legitimate daughter of Thanos, being treated as 2nd to her half sister Gamora would even make me upset if I was her. I wished she had more screen time in this film but she was awesome in this role. Hope she'll sign up for another Marvel hero or at least become the next Mary Jane in The Amazing Spider Man 3Overall, an enjoyable film. This is definitely Marvel's year on the big screen. However personally, I will only rank GOTG as my 2nd favorite Marvel movie of the year (The first goes to Cap 2 Winter Soldier). For all Marvel fans, you are definitely in for a treat and as for DC, LETS SEE YOU GUYS TOP UP THAT with your Man of Steel 2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wittiest Superhero Movie Ever (Up Till Now)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this movie out of curiosity: How on earth a movie of 'peasant' superhero can outscore the 'elite' of 2014 like Captain America and X-Men in IMDb? I can figure it out quite clearly after watching it. In my opinion, which is hopefully humble, Guardians of the Galaxy is the wittiest superhero movie we have so far. It even surpasses RD Jr's flamboyant Stark, again in my opinion, so it really means something.The plot is standard and predictable, nothing special. I don't even have to throw any spoilers to give you a rough idea. You have intertwined groups of similar interest fighting, and as usual we have the "good" ones and the "evil" ones. Following the current trend, the "good" ones are not the angelic heart-good, but crooked- good.The characters are also not anything we never saw before. We have the main guy, the lady partner, the joker, the muscle, and the loyal. I am pretty sure the rodent/raccoon bounty hunter, Rocket, would be at the top in the list of favorite characters. He reminds me of Donkey in Shrek: loud, cynical, and obviously witty.The special effects are decently cool, but again, we have seen it often in previous superhero movies. What I found as the strength of this movie is the humor. It blends nicely into the characters. I had two hours of good laugh watching this movie. It is refreshing, since typical superhero movies tends to be too melodramatic and put humor just as filler. The humor is so good, that even the sad scenes feel humorous. You can even use it to distinct it from other superhero movies. Instead of blabbering the forgettable title, "Guardians of the Galaxy," we can refer to it simply as 'that witty superhero movie.'In conclusion, it is a fun movie to watch. If you expect a mind- boggling superhero movie, this is not for you. If you are into movies with breathtaking special effect, you may become a little disappointed. But, if you want to watch a superhero movie full of laugh and not another tragic superhero story, please consider this above other options. You won't be inspired by it, it will likely be forgettable, but you won't regret watching it.----------------PS: Wooohooo, my very first review in IMDb! Kinda feel great to unlock this achievement. Please excuse my imperfect English here and there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A total blast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director/co-writer James Gunn manages to deftly blend witty humor, rousing action, touching drama, and full-tilt go-for-broke imaginative fantasy into one hell of an infectiously enjoyable cinematic cocktail that not only delivers on the dazzling grand scale spectacle, but also has plenty of moving human (and alien) moments amid all the fancy CGI pyrotechnics. What makes this film so special and appealing is the tremendous feeling of loyalty and camaraderie amongst the colorful and likable misfit protagonists: They're a scrappy ragtag bunch who initially don't seem that decent or heroic, but in the long run prove they got the right courageous stuff to qualify as true guardians of the galaxy. Chris Pratt makes for an engaging and charismatic lead. Zoe Saldana likewise shines as one tough and formidable gal. Dave Baustita provides loads of brawny charm as the vengeful Drax. Vin Diesel's throaty rumble fits perfectly for gentle giant sentient tree Groot ("I am Groot"). Michael Rooker has an absolute ball as the fearsome leader of a gang of interstellar pirates. Moreover, such familiar faces as Glenn Close, John C. Reilly, Bernicio Del Toro, and Gregg Henry acquit themselves well in neat secondary roles. Stan Lee and Lloyd Kaufman pop up in amusing cameos. However, it's Bradley Cooper's exemplary vocal work as the resourceful and quick-thinking raccoon Rocket who almost steals the whole show; Cooper projects both a fierce sense of sharp sarcastic humor and a genuinely surprising vulnerability as this lovable mutant rodent. Alas, Lee Pace's petulant Ronan rates as a rather blah central villain, but fortunately Karen Gillian as the bitter Nebula compensates for this. The choice soundtrack of 70's rock gems and a wealth of inspired pop culture references -- love that Howard the Duck cameo at the very end! -- add immensely to the overall irresistibly spirited merriment.</fullReview>

Hip, funny, totally irreverent take on the usually more serious and somber Marvel Comics sagas set in the far reaches of the galaxy spotlighting a group of outcasts with little in common who?through a series of complex circumstances involving a powerful mystic Orb?are brought together and reluctantly decide to unite and foil the treacherous plot of a Kree fanatic bent on power and destruction. Setup is familiar, but with impeccable casting, flippant dialogue, superior special effects, a rocking soundtrack, and enthralling action scenes, it pays back in spades. Non-comic aficionados may be completely unfamiliar with the characters and see this as a thinly veiled hybrid of the Avengers, Star Trek, and Star Wars, but the finished product is just so much fun to watch that it really doesn't matter. A worthy, memorable, and distinctive addition to the Marvel universe. ***</fullReview>

And how he is daring, charming, and arrogant but in a good kind of way.He is the subject of an intense manhunt by the authorities along with the main antagonist Ronan(Lee Pace barely unrecognizable), who wants to threaten the universe. But when Quell is arrested along with the other soon to be members like Dave Bautisa Drax the Destroyer who lost his family to Ronan, Zoe Saldana's Gamora who is the henchwoman another rival to Ronan and briefly, Quell, and Groot a tree like humanoid who barely talks, and Rocket a raccoon who is a hunter and mercenary an expert, of weapons and tactics.These unlikely group of people with nothing in common must put aside their differences and work together. For the good of mankind and defeating Ronan, along with fending off other rivals like Michael Rooker's rival bounty hunter against Quell.Really with wit, charm, and lots of great dialog. Pratt a star in the making!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just like everybody else out there I went to see this movie with no idea what so ever of this "Guardians of the Galaxy' characters nor story. In short, I wasn't expecting much from this movie. Boy, was I wrong! This movie quickly gets off on the right foot by introducing us to the main character's origins in one of Marvel's greatest introduction to date followed by the now iconic Marvel Logo intro. Pretty much every main character gets a backstory and reason why they are there. This is great filmmaking at its chore to begin with because this draws us immediately to root and care about the characters. Great action scenes, hilarious moments, endless funny one liners and outta of this world special effects make this movie the most complete Marvel movie I've seen so far. What makes it even greater to me is that at the end of this movie you recall all of the Main character's name and what the movie was from beginning to end. That in itself tells you how good it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A tree trunk that says 3 words, a lady with a regrettable past, a raccoon with an attitude and a guy who has a chip on his shoulder, and a kid whose past haunts him to become a hero. Guardians of the Galaxy is one of Marvel's best movies to date. Yes, I am giving one of the biggest franchises a compliment. This movie was really cool.The cast in this movie was just superb ? Chris Pratt, to the lovely Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, John C. Reilly, Glenn Close ? this cast was the best ever assembled since The Avengers. Racing across the galaxy to save the inhabitants of a planet from the tyrannical reign of Ronan (Lee Pace). We see that Ronan is after an orb to gain powers that any human could not contain it ? or they die. But with the power in Ronan, it makes him more powerful and undefeatable. But with teamwork and a little faith, from the Guardians ? Ronan is defeated.This movie was pretty awesome ? I would have to say. All in all, I can pretty much say that I'm anxious to seeing the second movie in 2017.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians Of Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be Honest, i didn't knew who the Guardians of the Galaxy were, but they got me with the trailer. This year we had pretty good films as Godzilla, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and it seems that Guardians of the Galaxy are Marvel's next big thing!!The movies is full with everything, literally everything, it has action, comedy, and even more you won't expect.The actors stick to their roles, such as Bradley Cooper or Vin Diesel, even former WWE wrestler Dave Bautista makes an excellent performance. The story is probably one of the most original i've seen on Marvel. So i'll keep it to you simple, if you want a film that KICK-ASS in so many ways, that has very good actors and you want to have a good time with your son, your wife, your girlfriend or your mother, father, brother, trust me this is it.These my friends are The Guardians of Marvel.i mean Guardians of the Galaxy.But seriously,it should call Guardians of Marvel because this is so much better than any movie ever made of Marvel.Don't trust me, go see it yourself</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I don't review many movies and I hate CGI but I felt like Guardians of the Galaxy (GOG) did a great job of balancing CGI with a lot of hard work on their costumes, acting and the writing was FANTASTIC. The actors did a great job but they did have a great script to work with. The hype was totally justified.The actors were awesome and the story plot was great. It was a bit hard to follow and the names did get confusing but its minor details in a wonderful story.I do have to say that I didn't know anything about the story before I went but if I wasn't a fan then I am certainly now. They did a great job telling the story and it could have gone Dragon Ball Z with the wrong script. Go and see for your self. I think the movie will be higher than 8.8 soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without getting too poetic, Guardians of the Galaxy is fantastic. Pure and simple. Guardians is just flat-out exactly what I wanted from another "group against badguys" action spectacle: a witty and snappy sense of humor, phenomenal writing, *gorgeous* special effects, well rounded and lovable characters and an overall story that weaves its way effortlessly into the Marvel movie mythos. It's one of those rare, jam-packed rides that makes me want to just go get right back in line and enjoy it all over again. It stands right next to The Avengers as an incredibly entertaining piece of filmmaking while also offering plenty of its own style and humor to make it unique, while the Sci-Fi backdrop makes Guardians all the more enthralling and fresh. In a mere two hours the characters grow and surprise, which is incredible for 5 major characters never before introduced to the Marvel Movieverse.The whole cast is phenomenal, but it's evident that Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) steals the show (I think the whole audience agreed on that one). Combine winning and hysterical performances with smart, snappy writing and you get an excellent, side splitting action comedy. Who knew? Chris Pratt is also *perfect* as StarLord, Saldana plays Gamora very well, Vin Diesel's winning performance of Groot is awesome, and Bautista's character is just plain funny. Combine all the above with some great emotional notes, a few excellent and relevant themes, a fun and entertaining score (combining a memorable orchestral score with classic 70's tunes) all while exploring an enticing and incredible world makes Guardians of the Galaxy just so much fun. It may have some issues, but I had too much fun to care. Top of the line entertainment all around, and one of the best movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy definitely surprised me by its awesomeness. Loved this movie and it is easily one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen this year and this year has had some awesome movies.The movie is great fun to watch. All five of the Guardians (Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, Groot and Rocket) are awesome to watch and all of them have their moments. Their back-stories are also interesting despite wanting to know more in the case of a couple of them. Although there is plenty of humour and jokes, none of it feels overdone. There are also great action scenes and emotional moments without clashing with the fun side of the movie. Although the plot and villains were nothing outstanding, it was good enough not to ruin the movie as it was great fun watching the five heroes meeting and getting to know each other and becoming the Guardians of the Galaxy.Would definitely recommend watching this. It's great fun and the time just flew by watching it. It's a great space adventure/comedy/action movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel Studios does an A Team film (except it's good)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film this evening and it's already become a new favourite from Marvel Studios . The story of a group of convicts/outcasts brought together as (rather reluctant) heroes is not a new one but it's given new life and brings a rougher edge to the occasionally sterile Marvel Universe. As a lifelong of Star Trek, my favourite series in that universe ended up being Deep Space Nine. Much as I loved Kirk, Spock, Picard and Data the characters and values on display could occasionally become a teeny bit patronising. Deep Space Nine allowed characters who operated in greyer areas to take a prominent role and, often, be proved the smartest in the room. In the Marvel Universe while Captain America and Thor have (just about) stayed on right side of pompous in their appearances to date, the sight of Peter Quill robbing (not rescuing) an ancient artefact while boogieing on through the opening credits is a clear example of the appeal of a character who doesn't always the follow the rules (and let's face it, RD jrs' Tony Stark is not as much of a rebel as he thinks he is).The background of Peter Quill (an excellent Chris Pratt) as a child of the 80s (it's not a spoiler if it features in the first five minutes) brings a delightful sensibility to the alien universe that the film otherwise occupies. Few of the characters have any frame of reference for his various allusions and the script mines this fact well, the legend of 'Footlose' is particular highlight. (Another happy by-product of this 80's nostalgia is the best soundtrack to ever a grace a Marvel Studios film.) The film is not without problems, like the Avengers the introductions to the various members of the ensemble mean that other aspects of the story are a left a little one-dimensional. As with the Avengers, it's the baddies who get the shortest shrift with Lee Pace and Karen Gillan left to do little but glare angrily at various characters. When weighed against the excellent main cast, Bradley Cooper is a riot and Vin Diesel is surprisingly touching as a motion capture tree, the unsentimental humour and some rather excellent fight scenes (including a prison break to remember) then the good definitely outweighs the not so good. As an end note, viewers should stay for the end of credits sequences (there are two). Thankfully Marvel seem to be moving away from teasers for films that don't even have scripts. The second sequence is particularly good with a genuinely surprising appearance that ties in rather nicely to 80's sensibility that's permeated the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, campy and wildly entertaining. One of the best Marvel films to date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy plays out like Star Wars on crack, its fast, ferocious and a badass entertaining thrill ride throughout. Following a rag tag group of intergalactic criminals, Guardians has the plot line of a Star Wars film, the characters of a Dirty Harry film and the action of every Marvel movie combined. What makes this film stand out from the rest of the Marvel films is that it engages you knowing that you have absolutely no idea who or what the hell this is. It does a great job filling you in with information from the comic and it makes for an enjoyable watch. Unlike the fans of the comic, I had no knowledge of Guardians of the Galaxy and walking out of it, it really educates you on anything you may have missed out on all while giving proper character growth and development without heavily relying on the comic books as "common knowledge". Chris Pratt is awesome in this film, he reminds me a lot of Indiana Jones in space. He's a wise cracking, ass kicking criminal that can beat with his words or his fists (more times than not, its his fists). Dave Batista, Zoe Saldana, Michael Rooker, Vin Diesel, and Bradley Cooper along with Pratt gives Guardians of the Galaxy a better cast than Avengers. The film comes at you like a bullet train thats about to derail, you're always engaged with these characters despite most of them being an alien, a talking tree or a talking raccoon. The film is really amazing in that you look at these characters and the ridiculousness of the situation and still don't even question it. Now there are some plot holes that will more than likely be cleared up the Marvel way, meaning down the line something will happen to patch up a couple holes here and there. While that may prove to be lazy writing, I think Marvel films have now earned the right to do whatever the hell they want. Guardians of the Galaxy is a great comic book film and this is coming from someone who was so apprehensive about seeing this film that I almost didn't go. This is a surprising, entertaining, gut busting thrill ride that is impossible to disappoint especially to fans of the Marvel universe and franchises. But even if a superhero movie isn't your thing, I'm confident enough to say that you'll have a great time seeing this movie. It is that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most entertaining and crowd-pleasing movies ever made. I just got out of an advance screening with my friend and we both can agree that it is brilliant. The humor is there, the action, the story, the acting, the freaking cinematography! This film is a joy to look at. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack! It's magnificent, and fits the tone of the movie perfectly. I was upset at the end, however, because it ended. I just couldn't get enough, I needed to see more! Unfortunately, the screening I was at didn't include the after-credits scene, that would've most likely have tied-in to "Avengers: Age of Ultron." It doesn't really matter, though, because I will definitely attend the Thursday night premiere of it, and pay $18.50 to see it again, but this time in IMAX 3D! My friend and I can both agree that this is an incredible piece of entertainment, and has made itself in our list of favorite movies of all time. When it comes out, do not hesitate to see it, just go. You will NOT be disappointed. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can always nitpick, Guardians lacks depth, it is very colorful, there could be better character development, but while you watch this movie, you will be entertained. And you will be entertained in a way that you might have not been entertained before.Make no mistake, this is an action packed movie full of space opera (spaceships battling), fantasy (talking Racoons) and cute trees fighting for the greater good. So if you like movies about the real world, this is not for you. But you might have guessed it when you have seen that this movie is from Marvel.But for all others, this movie is highly, highly recommended. It mixes hilarious jokes, great action and fight scenes with memorable characters in such a great way, that you might wonder why not every movie is so entertaining and so funny. This movie felt like 30 minutes, it was over way too fast. And it leaves you in your seat, starting to count the days for the sequel.Rocket Racoon might be the most hilarious and lovable character ever created in fantasy. Every line of this little guy leaves behind a thunder of laughter.I don't know if it is better than Avengers and to be honest, I don't want to be the judge. Some will like it more, some will like it less. And my guess is, if I have seen this movie several times, I might see some faults in it. But until this day, I start counting twice, one time for the days till the sequel finally hits the screen and the other time for the BluRay release.If you have not seen this movie yet, I envy you, because you are about to be blown away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Sci-Fi of this Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1988, on Earth, the boy Peter Quill is abducted by a spacecraft after losing his mother. In 2014, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), a.k.a. Star Lord, is a ravager searching a valuable orb on the surface of the dead planet Morag. When Peter finds the orb, he is hunted down by the Kree warship The Dark Aster of the powerful Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) but he flees. Peter also double crosses his partner Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) that puts a reward on him.Peter Quill arrives on the Xandar city Nova Empire and is chased by Ronan's warrior Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and by the bounty hunters Rocket and The Groot. They are arrested by the police officer Corpsman Dey (John C. Reilly) and his men and sent to the prison The Kyln, where they befriend the strong Drax (Dave Bautista). Soon they learn that Gamora wants to betray Ronan and sell the orb to a dealer for a huge amount while Drax wants to kill Ronan, who killed his wife and daughter. They plot a plan to escape from The Kyln to sell the orb and split the money. But soon they also learn that the orb keeps the infinity stone that gives immensurable destructive power to the owner. They self-proclaim Guardians of the Galaxy and decide to deliver the orb to the leader Nova Prime (Glenn Close) to keep it safe from Ronan. But they are hunted down by Ronan and his right-arm Nebula (Karen Gillan) that want to destroy Xandar and also by Yondu Udonta and the Ravagers that want to sell the infinity stone to make lots of money. Who will keep the powerful orb?"Guardians of the Galaxy" is certainly one of the best sci-fi of this year. The story is a rip-off Star Wars but full of action and very funny, in a perfect combination of action and comedy. The characters are charismatic and the cast has great names ? the only remark is the name of Vin Diesel highlighted in the credits that lure the audience since his character has limited lines ("I am Groot"; "We Are Groot" once and a couple of grumbles. The special effects are top-notch and the music score with songs from the 80's is remarkable. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Guardi?es da Galáxia" ("Guardians of the Galaxy")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unusually Marvel-lous blend of zany humour, quirky characters and thrilling action that makes for a hugely enjoyable dose of summer entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notwithstanding the heart-tugging prologue which sees a young Peter Quill saying his tearful goodbye to his dying mother in a hospital room, it is manifestly clear from the opening strains of that 1970s Redbone classic 'Come and Get Your Love' that Marvel's latest cinematic addition 'Guardians of the Galaxy' just wants to have some fun. Yes, immediately after that prologue, we catch up with our anti-hero - a thieving Ravager, a self-styled Starlord, and a general intergalactic do-no- gooder - skipping along to that song while venturing his way into a cave on an abandoned planet to retrieve a much-sought after silver orb.In case it isn't already apparent from the trailer, that is the first of many 1970s pop classics that form about half of the soundtrack of the movie, and which Peter carries around in a mix-tape with his trusty Walkman. That artistic choice isn't self-evident; although these characters were already known as a team of misfit heroes from their introduction into the Marvel universe back in 1969, it did not come with the same cheeky comic tone which James Gunn has taken to the material. Indeed, the galaxy may be at stake, but the fact that its fate lies in the hands of a talking raccoon named Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a tall talking tree named Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), a massively muscled angry guy named Drax (pro wrestler Dave Bautista), a green- skinned female assassin named Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Peter (Chris Pratt) means that it is a good thing this Marvel picture doesn't try to sell it straight.In fact, it easily stands out from the rest of the more recognisable Marvel properties by simply being more playful than any of the rest. Peter is a sweet rogue played by Pratt with wily mischief. Drax is delightfully hypermuscled and hyperliteral - his rejoinder when being accused by Rocket that metaphors "fly over his head" is an absolute hoot. Gamora is kick-ass cool. Groot is lovably monosyllabic. And the one who often steals the show is the irascible foul-mouthed raccoon whom Groot provides the muscle for, Rocket, who is also streetwise, smart and suffers from an existential crisis. They aren't exactly first-choice to save the Earth-like planet Xandar from the warmongering baddie Ronan (Lee Pace), who wants the orb for his patron Thanos on the deal that the latter would help destroy Xandar - and both Xandar's Nova Corps officer (John C. Reilly) and head honcho Nova Prime (Glenn Close) pretty much make that clear.But it is precisely their misfit nature that makes it all the more enjoyable. Whether escaping from Xandar's space prison known as the Kiln or from the cheekily-titled planet of Nowhere on which Benicio del Toro's The Collector resides, the ragtag gang always have a witty quip to spare, and the cast's delivery of Gunn's cleverly-scripted repartee is spot-on. There is also plenty of situational and physical humour in the numerous action scenes that follow our heroes along their space adventure - and fanboys will have a field day picking out Gunn's homage to classic sci-fi fare like 'Star Wars' in addition to thoroughly lapping up the pop-culture irony.Gunn's casting here is flawless. None of the actors in the ensemble call attention to their own individual characters; instead, they play off each other with offbeat chemistry and perfect timing. In particular, Cooper is almost unrecognisable as the voice of Rocket, capturing perfectly his character's blend of brashness, intelligence and angst in a delivery brimming with panache. They easily overshadow the other villainous sorts who pop up every now and then to wreck destruction - including Ronan's lieutenant Korath (Djimon Hounsou) and Thanos' disillusioned daughter Nebula (Karen Gillan) - who unfortunately turn out just as nondescript as the villains in the Marvel movies so far.That fault is not so much the actors as that of Gunn and his co-writer Nicole Perlman. If something had to give in order to make way for that self-aware smart-assery, it turned out to be both plot and character. Put aside the visual dazzle, and there's no doubt the narrative is about as straightforward as it gets. There is no treachery, no double- crossing, just plain good and bad defined right from the point that the characters make their entrance. Same goes for the characters, which aren't afforded much time for any backstory (save for that prologue we mentioned at the start) in between dodging bullets and blowing up stuff. As far as origin movies are concerned, this hardly makes the impression the way 'Captain America: The First Avenger' and 'Iron Man' did for their respective characters.Those unfamiliar with Marvel lore will also find themselves grasping to understand how the entire universe comes together - for starters, you may wish to take note that the orb is so prized because it belongs in the same league as the Tesseract in 'The Avengers' movie. But if you find yourself lost amidst the mythology, you'll probably still find yourself lost in a giddy spirit of amusement. It's zany fun to say the least, with a perfectly pitched bunch of memorable characters, irreverent humour and some truly eye-popping CGI wizardry. Gunn relentlessly guns at everything that is fun and pleasing, no matter that they may seem absurd - and you know what, 'Guardians' is all the better for it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, go and believe all the user reviews for this movie, and go the theater and waste the price of admission, whatever it is. Or, give me the benefit of the doubt, and trust what I am saying when I tell you that this movie stinks to high heaven. The CGI is top notch, but it ends there, and CGI by itself does not a movie make. There has to be a story, and this movie does not have any semblance of a story, at least not one that anyone could possibly follow or make any sense of, or one that, if published as a book, any sane and intelligent person would ever bother to read. The story told by a movie has to be good enough such that, if published as a book, it would be entertaining enough that people would bother to read it. This movie is nonstop action and fighting. In order to tell a story, it has to slow down a little here and there, but this movie never slows down at all. There is an orb, everyone wants it, and everyone fights over it. This really is all that there is to the story. I hated it so much that I wanted to walk out, but stayed, thinking that eventually it would have to get better, but it never did. This movie must have cost a lot to make, but the money they spent, however much it was, was spent manufacturing compost.</fullReview>

It is not boring or too long it has funny, moments, action and a good plot and a wonderful story.This days there are no original movies anymore and the only point you want to be engage into the movie is the emotion and the feel for the character development which is hard to accomplished now a days because of CGI.

The plot is quite basic but effective: Five people who had no link before with each other will find themselves to protect the entire galaxy against Ronan , one of the main villains who want to control a powerful and destructive gem. The object of all desire in the movie.The cast is simply awesome ,Peter,Gamora,Drax are played by Chris Pratt,Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista . Groot and rocket get the voice of Vin diesel and Bradley Cooper.Every character are endearing , they are funny , "badass",and each of them has their own story which makes them deep enough and give them a personal goal in the movie plot. Moreover our characters evolve in the movie which doesn't make it static and annoying,there is a real work behind characters.For a first volume , this is really a nice beginning for The Guardians of the Galaxy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is just plain... FUN!!!Guardians of the Galaxy is part of Marvel's unmatched MCU franchise, thankfully this particular entry could barley be described as a superhero film. Myself and a friend of mine agreed that the film deserves the much coveted title of: "The next Star Wars"!Okay now that I've spent a whole paragraph over-praising this film, let's get to the technical stuff. The film begins with a young Peter Quill running from a hospital room after witnessing his mother passing away from cancer. He is then kidnapped by freaking aliens! Flash ahead to 30 or so years later to find Mr. Quill working as a scavenger. This leads to one of the most well put together opening credit sequences I've even seen. Peter Quill begins dancing across an alien planet to "Come and get your love" by Redbone. Even going so far as to use an alien looking rodent as a fake microphone. This scene is hilarious and sets the entire tone for the film in a big way. The number one quality Guardians has going for it is the highly clever and fast paced humour. Not to say that the more dramatic moments are not well done, because the absolutely are. The comedic timing and writing however, makes even Joss Whedon's amazing humour in the Avenger's seem tame. Guardian's never takes itself to seriously and live completely in what it is, a fun, hilarious action movie!As per the usual in the Marvel cannon, there are some impressive casting choices here. For starters, where did this Chris Pratt guy come from all of the sudden? Oh yeah... Parks and Recreation. Who would have guessed this man could carry a full fledged blockbuster in one of the highest grossing film franchises of all time? He rises to the occasion in a big way. His perfect comedic timing and clumsy demeanour is unusual for a film like this, but it fits with the tone of the film perfectly. Pratt's performance hearkens back to a cocky Han Solo type and give hope for comedy actors making there way into large scale studio film. Another surprisingly perfect cast member comes in the form of a former wrestler. Dave Bautista portrays Drax the Destroyer, he works as somewhat of a C3P0 type in this film, not quite understanding the complexities of his companions odd, quirky behaviour. Bautista's delivery is the perfect match up for Pratt, in that everything Drax hears is taken literally. This leads to many humorous moments with Drax, along with the best straight man routine since Leslie Nielsen in Airplane! The special effects are predictably astounding, but are taken to a whole new level with the inclusion of two fully CGI animated characters. Rocket Raccoon and Groot, played by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel respectively. These two character exist as some of the most perfectly integrated and lovable CGI effects in history. They exist in the pantheon with Gollum, Caesar, the Hulk, and Draco as landmarks in visual effects and motion capture. Guardians is not without its issues however, most notably Ronan the accuser. Not to say the Lee Pace didn't do an admirable job in the role. The character is just not that interesting. The genre blending could be a bit jarring to some, the film jumps between fast paced comedy and high stakes drama very suddenly. Overall this is a highly enjoyable film, as well as one of the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the chemistry that all the characters seemed to have with each other. The film doesn't take itself too seriously,Star Lord is hilarious!Rocket is cool,Groot is adorable,Drax is sweet and Gamora is a lovely alien chick ha ha! That scene when they were arrested,taken to space jail,and had their mugshots taken,still kills me to this day!I can't stop laughing whenever I think of Rocket not being seen cause he's so short,Star Lord throwing up the bird,and cute Groot just staring into the damn camera. The ending scene when they're all in the spaceship together and the Jackson 5's "I Want You Back" starts playing,is the cherry on top of a wonderful film. I love MJ!Peace to Marvel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the best Marvel film I have ever seen, I have never had a theater laugh so many times all at once, it was actually my best theater experience so far.The movie didn't have any stupid plot lines or events that were just "Because Movie" in it and that really made the whole thing so much better then 98% of all movies ever.Hopefully the next movies to either become a sequel or connect the story lines of this and Avengers will be just as amazingIt was an amazing film that made everything I expected crap, but still I would have watched a cartoon over this.10/10 Best not cartoon movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Marvel Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel films has made me become a believer in the way that I view Superheroes and Comic Books. I have always been a huge fan of Sci-Fi films and this is a perfect combination of the two. Up until I had my four year old son, I don't think I even watched a film with a Super Hero. I would have never considered seeing a film like Guardians of the Galaxy. I even had a hard time convincing my Wife to go with me and our son. I think overall they try to portray it to be a kid film, but in all reality due to the amazing script and Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), as the primary character, it was remarkable. Guardians of The Galaxy is a Sci-Fi film at it's very best. Peter Quill plays a thief in the film, and that was his primary role. He is hired to steal an Orb that had special powers. The Orb was at the center of the film, which houses one of the Infinity Gems, as called Infinity Stones. The hard black exterior shell protects the purple stone, making it look like a Space gem. It is very different how it acts from the comic books, which is what was intriguing. Peter Quill has a lot of competition from others wanting the Orb. Quill finds out later from the help of his friends that it is so valuable because it is almost an unstoppable weapon. He tried to keep it away from the evil villains. In this adventure, he has some sidekicks that will make you laugh, Rocket the Raccoon, Groot, the talking tree and baby Groot. OMG, hilarious!! The special effects and music was out of this world and became a Box Office Top Seller. Guardians of the Galaxy went from a small kid like film to so much more. From the story-line, to the stars themselves, this film has something for everyone, it was my favorite film, and a must see!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best action hero/sci fi film in modern times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate modern films, shallow, poorly acted without any story childish rubbish. BUT not this one Sci-Fi at its best. This is without doubt the best film with the best characters and good actors who made it all seem real. Oh I know it's the usual story line "the baddies are very bad the goodies are good" but these goodies were GREAT! I just felt for all the team, I was carried all the way, the actors were the story and made it real. It was thrilling, enthralling and exciting right the way through, the special effects were brilliant but not the be all and end all the views of space, the Nebula and the cgi characters were the best I've ever seen and made the story better, not overwhelming it as is the norm. It deserves a franchise, PLEASE make more, do a TV series BUT only with the same actors. Could this be the equal to Star Trek? I say you have a change don't mess it up. I have given 10 out of 10 but really I feel this film goes up-to 11. "We are Groot"!</fullReview>

GotG is just THAT good.GotG. It's not a cult movie, it's not a COMIC-CON movie, or a cosplayers movie. It is more valuable and democratic than that, it is, like Star Wars EP IV, Jurassic Park, Jaws, or The Hunt for Red October, a "best of class" type of film. For everyone's entertainment.GotG oozes originality, humor, wonder, surprise, imagination, and self-deprecation. Even the mild cursing is endearing . . . somehow.GotG!

		<shortDescription>It Might Make its Money Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If only the Star Wars prequels were even a tenth of how good this kinda, sorta, updated Star Wars flick.I was way off on my prediction for this Guardians of the Galaxy film. I thought with the stream of Sci-Fi wannabes from sometimes acclaimed novels and a relatively unknown live cast, this was going to bomb and bomb hard. Unfortunately for me and fortunately for the movie, I couldn't have been more off. (In my defense and demise, I predicted this 6 months prior to opening. Sheesh! That's way too early to predict any box office number.)I didn't think the movie would necessarily suck, or would be barely watchable, but I'm just not into Sci-Fi and because of which, it took me 30 days to the day of release to finally see this. Poor choice #2 on my part. (Almost 4 months for The Matrix ? and I wish I had seen that one sooner, as well.) While not perfect, way too many predictable lines and twists and slightly longer than it needed to be, the movie worked extremely well overall. Though the highlights were the literal laugh-out-loud humor, killer soundtrack and very good and inventive effects, the best aspect for me were the fantastic and memorable characters.How they worked on their own, their depth and the comradery between them was simply divine. Too often characters, and especially ego- driven actors portraying them, ruin what could be a fun adventure flick with depth. Everyone's chemistry was spot-on and I couldn't help but love everyone individually and definitely together. Heck, even The Avengers dragged too long on the conflicts within. What was also nice about the bond of our heroes was the reasons of being together. Not a single weak part to everyone's story line ? everything worked splendidly as a whole. To have this many characters ? five main and exclusive characters ? all feeding off each other while maintaining their own direction isn't easy and should be praised when it does occur.I went into this movie with ZERO expectations. I neither really wanted to see it nor did I think it would be bad. What I got was one pleasant surprise after another. For example, the opening nearly had me in tears ? and not from laughter.The movie opens with our future hero and "Han Solo's nephew," Peter "Star Lord" Quill's mother passing and that's immediately followed by his space abduction and eventually 20+ years later. Now, a full blown Han Solo renegade, he's trying to steal a sphere, Raiders of the Lost-like and the adventure begins with him being chased, him meeting the rest of the title characters and the rise of heroism.To be honest, the story is not the newest or freshest out there, but it works beautifully here. Even the negative of occasionally predictable scenes, as mentioned above, was necessary for a movie like this to have. It's enormously unique on its own, but needed to tone it back to be more accessible to the general audiences while giving homage to the greats like this before it.The emotional scenes also worked, as in the beginning ? that was tough! not to get upset then ? and a couple more later. Also, the laughs were plentiful even with the ones absolutely not geared towards me. I appreciated that they spread out the humor so not to just please one audience type. Further, the sometimes ingenious ways of solving problems were fantastic as was the loyalty amongst our crew ? something I love to see in movies like this. Yes, I know it's more realistic to show more conflict than they did here, but I'm certainly not going into a movie like this and trying to find too much realism. And finally, I am HOOKED, as most people are on that dang good soundtrack. I look forward to more follow-ups and cross-over's. I am super glad my prediction didn't come true and happy for a genuine blockbuster in one of the most lackluster box-office summers in many, MANY years. * * *Final thoughts: I might need to watch it again ? ha, I'm definitely buying this on Blu when it arrives, and I might be wrong, but far too many people survived way too long in space and exposed. I kept saying "NO" out loud as if I were Grumpy Cat when I saw one fly through space with only a secured helmet on. His hair was flowing with the transition and his hands were ungloved, even. Again, I might be mistaken, but this and a few other minor anti-physic-issues I couldn't get past.Did this downgrade the movie in any way? Another "NO." As much as I didn't like to see such obvious mistakes, it's still a space- adventure-comedy. Heck, even the very-fun Gravity had its share of issues, and that was supposed to be realistic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watch the movie in theater recently and it was OK. Yup, you don't want your movie to be 'ok', at least 'bad' define something. What the movie lacks are concentration and structures. The story is largely interesting with every characters have their own struggles and unique identities. However, the way the movie portrays them is very predictable and somehow a bit juvenile. The animation values are very visible here that they make it less realistic and approachable. Some of the comedies are quite hilarious but a bit predictable and too much. Comedy doesn't have to be loud. Those flaws just make the movie lacks tension and seriousness. Most of it is trying to appeal the mass audience with those commercial values. What I'm suggesting they should do for the next installment is they should find the focus and strongly hold to it while attaining some commercial values that are needed in this type of movie. It is understandable that they try to grasp as many audience as they can because this is the first one. However, audiences are getting smarter these days that they can see if there is inauthenticity values in a movie. You don't have to try follow the trend that most superhero movies always have but simply set a new one. Remember, those kind of unique identities that make movies such as The Dark Knight and Watchmen an instant classic.</fullReview>

I can't wait for the next one, even it's one of those "wequals" The Groot character was by far my son's favorite character and who could blame him- he's fantastic. Really, really well thought out. Chris Pratt is no part of a few of my favorite movies and show. I thought he was brilliant in Zero Dark Thirty, especially considering he's Andy on Parks and Recs.I'm sure there are those critics who will dislike because it's "unrealistice" or has a Hollywood ending, or that they feel that the humor wasn't funny enough. Well, go rent some documentary on stamps because you don't appreciate quality when you see it.</fullReview>

Vin Diesel is a man who can prove his abilities in the movie Reddit. In this movie Guardians Of The Galaxy, Star Lord is a thief but also a good person.

		<shortDescription>The Most Fun You'll Have At the Movies All Year in This Galaxy or Any</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy follows in the footsteps of its more powerful, well-known superhero family members. What Marvel has done over the past six years is just short of amazing. Pumping out one, sometimes two big budget films a year to (mostly) critical and commercial success in almost every case.That being said, Guardians of the Galaxy was somewhat of a risk for the studio. Unlike the previous Marvel films that featured well-known comic book characters for those who have never even picked up a comic book, Guardians is unknown by even the most die-hard comic book fans. Not to mention the fact that director James Gunn (Super, Slither) doesn't exactly have a massive track record and had never directed a big budget studio film before.Last but not least, Guardians doesn't have a big name actor like Robert Downey Jr. or Chris Evans to sell the film to the public. In fact, the most recognizable faces among the cast are Bradley Copper and Vin Diesel. Ironically, neither actor actually appears in the film, they just lend their voices to CG created characters.Much of the success or failure of Guardians of the Galaxy and their presumed sequels falls on the shoulders of Chris Pratt. Pratt is asked to walk in the shoes of other legendary Marvel superheroes. A lot of pressure for an actor who is hardly a household name. Pratt is best known as the perennial scene stealer on the NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation. Pratt's film career mainly consists of small roles where he normally plays the goofy best friend.Pratt plays Peter Quill, who was abducted from Earth in the 80's as a young boy. Quill is now a swash-buckling space outlaw who goes by the name of Star-Lord, an infamous rogue feared across the galaxy, or so he likes to think. As a child of the 80's, you can see who Quill probably grew up idolizing. As Star-Lord, Quill feels like a cross between Indiana Jones and Han Solo. Quill's memory of pop culture is the one thing that keeps him connected to Earth. That and a Walkman that is constantly playing 80's pop songs.Pratt carries the whole film and his character really sets the tone. He infuses almost every scene with his free spirit and wise-cracking personality. You can't help but not love his character. Guardians is sure to blow up Pratt's career (he can be seen in the Jurassic Park sequel due out next year) and rightly so.Quill rounds out his motley crew with Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, a green-skinned assassin. Drax, an eloquent behemoth trying to avenge the death of his family. Drax is played by professional wrestler Bautista, who is surprisingly competent here as a cerebral brawler who takes everything literally, which happens to be one of the many areas mined for laughs. Then there is Rocket, voiced by Bradley Cooper, a genetically engineered Raccoon whose temper is about as short as his stature. Finally, there is Groot, a gentle giant of a creature that resembles a tree. Groot is voiced by Vin Diesel, who has all of three words the entire film, but is sure to become a fan favorite.This group of characters is what sets Guardians apart from all the other Marvel films. They all have their flaws and they're all interesting and unique. They feel new and fresh and you can't wait to see what kind of mischief they will get into next. I'm not taking anything away from the other Marvel movies, I've enjoyed most of them, but many of them feel a little too formulaic and often times they take themselves a little too seriously. Maybe the best way to compare Guardians of the Galaxy and The Avengers would be to equate them to a high school setting. The Avengers would be the popular jocks that get all the girls and the Guardians would be the misfits who are always getting into trouble. As cool as The Avengers are, they are so powerful that it's almost too easy to root for them. Everybody loves to root for the underdogs and that's exactly what the Guardians are.Although Guardians is a pretty light film, there are quite a few heartfelt scenes, including one 5 minutes into the film that will have you reaching for a tissue before the opening title. We get just a nugget of a back story from each member, which helps us invest and care for these strange characters.Guardians also features one of the best soundtracks of the year. Often times mixing catchy 80's pop songs with fast-paced action scenes. Possibly my favorite scene is one that will remind some people of a more deranged version of "Singin' in the Rain."In the end, Guardians of the Galaxy was a huge risk for Marvel, a studio that can seemingly do no wrong since Iron Man came out in 2008. To say that the risk paid off in a huge way is putting it mildly. Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the best Marvel films to date and it might just be the funniest and most fun film of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leave it to Marvel to make something like this work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is about an extremely oddball group of beings who are brought together by circumstances and have to work as a team to accomplish their own goals. There is Peter Quill, the self proclaimed Starlord and the only human in the group, Gamora, a green skinned alien assassin, Drax, a very literal tough berserk alien, Groot, a walking Tree and my favourite, Rocket, a raccoon. Leave it to Marvel to make it all work with glorious results. Not two, not three but FIVE main characters and this movies somehow manages to pull it off. It kinda did it one movie what Avengers did with six movies. Every character gets their fare share of character development and screen time. The villain was however a typical super hero villain though, which was a shame considering how great everything else is in the movie. The pacing was great, you either were laughing, were being entertained by action or were being drawn in by the drama. I believe Marvel has perfected humor in action movies. It was just SO GOOOD in this, better than most comedies out there. I laughed a LOT during the whole movie. It was nothing over the top or crude/toilet humor or anything like that, it was just plain old good humor with PERFECT delivery. What's even more amazing is that how well the humor was blended with action and drama. I think this is the epitome of how comedy should be added in blockbusters. Kudos to Marvel and James Gunn (Director). The action scenes were great and very entertaining. The CGI was amazing. The soundtrack was mostly old 70's and 80's song, which went with plot of the movie and really worked well. Simply put, This is just PURE ENTERTAINMENT. You'll enjoy the heck out of this movie. One of the best Marvel (MCU) movie, and one of the best of this year so far (Amazing summer season). 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film!.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed This Film I thought it was funny and entertaining and the acting from Chris Pratt was good.Chris Prat was very Funny and Likable and he was Great in his role as Star Lord.Some people have complained about this film and said it's not original but those people need to realise that NO film is original these days. Guardians of the galaxy was entertaining action packed and funny and that's how more films should be Entertaining Not Boring.I Loved this film and I kept laughing at what the characters were saying. I really liked Rocket Raccoon I thought he was really funny. His character just had a way of cracking me up. I thought he was the funniest character to be honest. Chris Pratt was funny too and Groot and Drax had their moments but I thought Rocket raccoon was the funniest. This film has very good characters and good character moments.The story is about Chris Pratt who gets abducted by aliens when he's a kid and he gets taken to another planet and when he's older he becomes stronger and he becomes this character called the star lord and he walks around with a strange mask. The first part of the film mainly takes place in a prison but before he gets there he meets an alien women who tries to steal his Crystal ball and he gets into a fight with her and shortly after that we are introduced to the Groot character which is a talking tree and we're introduced to the raccoon who I thought was really funny his name was Rocket.they try to capture Chris Pratt because they are bounty hunters and they all end up being taken to the prison were we are introduced to another character a big muscle bald guy named Drax who we soon find out is very strong he also gets into a lot of fights. What I liked about this film is that all these characters started off as enemy's but then they all become friends and work together.I really liked the five main characters who were the guardians I thought they were funny and interesting characters.they all escape from prison and team up together to fight Ronan who is the main villain of the movie and I have to say this Ronan character was a little scary he had a certain creepiness to him and I thought he was really strong he knew how to fight and I thought he was just as strong as the Winter Soldier.we find out that Ronan is an evil power hungry maniac.Ronan fights Drax halfway through the film and Drax got a Bit of a But Kicking because Ronan was built like a brick house.Punches didn't seem to hurt him so fighting him was Hard.To sum things up this was a very entertaining movie and I highly recommend it to people.I Really liked the story to the movie I thought it was interesting.I Found the film quite weird at times but what do you expect from a sci-fi film?. Most sci-fi films are weird so it did not bother me much. I knew what to expect from the movie,I knew going in to the film it was not going to be totally serious.The film had some serious bits and some not so serious bits so if you watch the movie don't expect to see a film thats completely serious.The Film is More of a Sci-Fi Action Comedy. Besides I tend to like films that have a bit of humour in them and are not completely serious because that makes the movie more fun.All in all The Film has a good story,good special effects,good acting good characters and good Action scenes.the film was action packed and it had a very exciting ending. So to finish the review is guardians of the galaxy 100% original No,but the movie is Fun and that's all that counts to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hooked on a feeling...!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I've just got back from cinema and I have to say that I am definitely hooked on a feeling - and that feeling is that this film is awesome! Right from the first sequence you are hooked and instantly charmed by Peter Quill as he scavenges for an artifact - an opening act which instantly sets the light-hearted tone of the movie and witty writing makes this character one of the best of the Marvel universe to hit the big screen - even possibly surpassing Tony Stark...! The movie doesn't mess around and you're quickly introduced to the rest of the gang and that's where it ups a notch or two - the bickering between the characters is fantastically well written and continues to progress and develop all of the characters as the film goes on. The group dynamic between the 5 heroes is also brilliantly portrayed and by the end you really feel that the characters care for each other - most notably a tree and a raccoon! As with all the Marvel films the action sequences and special effects are great and, if you haven't already, then get your geek on because Thanos is in the movie! (Ooh! Aah!) I know there is already a sequel in the plans but I can easily see a trilogy for the Guardians already. Unlike most Marvel movies there is always a thought in the back of your mind that there are other superheroes out there, certainly in the phase two movies you can't help wondering where the other avengers are - but this film you completely forget about them and at times forget it is a Marvel film at all - it's actually a great standalone sci-fi movie! The casting for the film is spot on; Chris Pratt - never heard of him before this film but think he has a great future ahead of him, Zoe Saldana continues to show her acting talents, Bradley Cooper brings a soul to a gun toting Racoon, Dave Bautista uses all of his acting skills picked up from his wrestling days and Vin Diesel fits perfectly in as Groot (I am resisting any temptation to make a reference to wooden acting...). But credit should also go to Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Again a character not many would have heard of but he is not just some stock bad guy and we are given a small insight into his back story and I thought his calmly menacing presence throughout the movie was fantastic.So I'm sure everyone who wants to see this film has already seen it so this review won't make any difference to you but if you haven't seen it and can't decide whether to or not, then get in your spaceship and fly across the galaxy to your nearest screening - it's fantastic! Great soundtrack too!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Opposed to others who have worshipped it or hated it down to their single cells, I really have no idea about how I feel about this movie. Probably because of my immensely limited knowledge about the Guardians themselves - which I presume is the case with most - I did not really have any hard feelings about anything that was left out or presented poorly, if I had known them correctly myself for that matter. No Gambits, no Deadpools, no Angels; yet no Quicksilvers also."Star-Lord, man? Legendary outlaw?"First of all, it was too hardcore of a fantasy movie for me, which was also a problem for me at my first time with Thor: The Dark World. The spaceships and all the aliens with dozens of various colours did not strike me as truly professional work. Second of all, the final battle was not that appealing. Although it had many similarities with that of Captain America: The Winter Soldier's, it was too repetitive opposed to Rogers' being breathtakingly intense. Last but not least, despite it being hilarious, there was more potential in it. Come on, man, we're talking about a cliché-supposed-to-be-hot-yet-not guy, a supposed-to-be-deadly-but-not assassin, a WWE champion that does not get metaphors, a raccoon with anger issues, and a Whomping Willow. What could be funnier?"You're an imbecile."On the other hand, it was still a quite fun movie to start with. Rocket and Groot were great as expected, and Drax was dreadfully better than what I thought he would turn out to be. It was fast-paced and also slow time to time. The relationships between the characters were well handled, and the CGI was also satisfactory."No, that was a joke. These two are the only things that I need."To sum it all up, there's pretty much loads going in my head. So I'll just say "I am Groot" and you get what I mean."Why you let him lick you like that for? Gross."</fullReview>

Thank you to the creators of the film! And I think that the Guardians of Galaxy are less popular characters in Marvel Universe, than other main heroes. There are a lot of less known characters in Marvel Universe, and I like that Marvel Studio made this the most awesome film of all times. I think, the creators of Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy can unite characters, and that would be more awesome, than separately. And second thing I want to tell to creators is: please, make another part of Guardians of Galaxy and make it fun. Thank you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misogynistic Language</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is better than the average comic-to-screen work. I would say that it surpasses many of the year's other films of the same genre, such as TASM2, TMNT, etc. However, this film, like many of the other films in its genre, suffers from sexist tones. But it goes even farther and uses misogynistic, violent language against the ONLY female protagonist, Zoe Saldana's character. She is referred to as a "wench," "green whore," and various other derogatory terms by one of the other protagonists. What is worse, he tells her that she is his "friend" but still calls her these names. He then proceeds to exert violence towards an antagonist character who uses a slur against her, proclaiming that "no one else" can talk to his "friend" that way. So, not only does this movie condone rape culture, patriarchy, and violent language, it also infantilizes and patronizes the only female character through making her tolerant of her colleague's "protector" attitude in the aforementioned scene, despite the fact that she is more than capable of taking care of herself. The specific slurs used themselves reflect the dudebro, sexist attitude of the filmmakers and of our society at large: slut, whore, wench, etc. All derogatory sexual terms used for a woman who has more sex than society wants her to. The character has no sex at all in the film, but because she is a woman, she is seen as a sexual object and thus the only way to "insult" her in this patriarchal mentality is to use derogatory sexual remarks against her. I cannot support films like this. Whoever wrote this script needs to be educated in gender studies. Yes, the movie had good visual effects and a solid villain and a good storyline. Rocket and Groot were fun characters. But we should not allow the positive aspects of the film to overshadow the threatening nature of its sexist undertones. Such seemingly innocuous remarks and societal norms contribute heavily to and define misogyny, patriarchy, rape culture, victim blaming, sex phobia, and backwards attitudes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it bizarre to say that this superhero film is endearing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) is charming and witty. However, is it bizarre to say that this superhero film is endearing? It's like giving a delicious sweets to a child who has been fed nothing but weird-tasting medicines. I know I kind of fail at metaphors but I am sure you'd somehow get what I mean.Well, all these while I didn't get the Marvel (or any superhero) hype or fandom. I just can't help it, most boyish stuffs just don't appeal to me naturally, which is exactly the same as how Hello Kitty generally do not appeal to males *spare me* but now I am a fan of superhero films! ^__^All heroes start somewhere and all ladies start somewhere too, right? Now I want my own superhero merchandises and I also to watch all the previous films; Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011), Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), Marvel's The Avengers (2012), Iron Man 3 (2013), Thor: The Dark World (2013), and Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)!! That's a lot, and someday I'll watch all of them!!Okay, straight to the most important point; yes, Guardian of the Galaxy (2014) is worth watching!I like how they portray the superheroes, the casts are amazing and they also have pretty awesome makeup artists to make this happen. It is also visually pleasing, they must have worked really hard to produce this entertaining, heroic film!As for the plot, it is indeed superhero comic-like *duh* where you follows their story and can tell that each of the heroes have their distinct backgrounds and personalities even if you are new to the Marvel Universe. It starts off sad but it is fun and witty from the start until the end!Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) will be out on theaters worldwide by tomorrow!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel does it again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... in the best possible way!'Guardians of the Galaxy' was highly praised by pretty much every critic. They were right. It's very, very good indeed.The cast are uniformly excellent. The visuals are stunning. The soundtrack is perfect. The plot is typically marvelesque in it's simplicity, strength and scope. No-one puts a foot wrong. No-one. But this is not the usual Marvel fare that we've come to know and love.The Point here, is that the film is largely being played for laughs. And it works. All the recent offerings from Marvel have had comedic elements and moments and they've been done very well. However, 'Guardians' sustains the laughs for the duration without losing the action/adventure flavour that Marvel films are all about.As expected, the Infinity Stones story is continued and some previously teased elements are confirmed. Noticeable exposition is kept to a minimum, but some back story for The Big Picture is provided and the direction of future films is hinted at. 'Guardians' may be different, but it's still part of the wider story in the MCU. The already announced sequel is going to be very eagerly anticipated indeed.To sum up, Marvel have hit gold. And it's a rich vein that can be mined for years to come. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Start to Guardians of the Galaxy **Spoiler**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw it at a UK Premier tonight and totally loved it. Great Humour, action, decent villain, good storyline. Saw it at an IMAX, which really added to the film. I really thought the humor was well done in this film, action was well done as well as the Guardians Universe that we got to see.The only negatives that could really pick up on was the story of the group coming together was a bit weak, I couldn't see why that chose to stay together. Also I would liked Ronan to have played more of an action part....but the screen time he had he was still menacing.I was so glad to finally see Thanos in this, looking forward to seeing how the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy storyline will pan out.Definitely will see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've Played Video Games That Make Better Movies Than This Stinker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was absolutely amazed by "Guardians of the Galaxy"....amazed at how bad it was after hearing how wonderful it was.People in all seriousness are discussing whether or not this film is the new generation's "Star Wars." Have the people who are discussing this even seen "Star Wars?" They must be thirteen years old.Indeed, thirteen year olds and younger are the only demographic I can possibly imagine liking this film. It struggles to achieve the same sense of whimsy and humor that infused the original "Star Wars" trilogy, the Indiana Jones movies and even more recent super hero films (see "Hellboy II" for a film that perfects it). But it fails miserably, mostly because the cast doesn't have the talent or the chemistry to pull it off. Chris Pratt creates a vacuum at the film's center -- he doesn't have the screen presence or charisma to carry it. And he's surrounded by a film that just starts in the middle of a dumb story, as if everyone coming to see it is already an expert on this particular series, even though it's one of the most totally obscure of any of the superhero stories. And the action sequences are a frenetic muddle made worse by the 3D. When the biggest asset in your live action film is a CGI talking raccoon, you know you're in trouble.Seriously, I am a big fan of the Ratchet and Clank video game series, which this movie put me in mind of, but R&amp;C (a video game!!) has more humor and narrative cohesion than this film.Grade: D+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Crazy, Epic, Space Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Guardians yesterday on an early screening. You had to sign up in order to win tickets online, so most of the audience was fans like me. The atmosphere during the movie was amazing. I have laughed more than in most comedy films I have seen in my life, the visuals were better and more beautiful than in any other marvel movie and I had a tear in my eye once or twice! Thought the plot isn't new (team up, save the day!), the movie still manages to have a very different take on the superhero/Sci-Fi genre. This is thanks to the music and sometimes crazy, sometimes heartwarming characters that form the Guardians of the Galaxy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Thoughts: I don't think I need to say it but I will I look forward to any Marvel movie that comes out. Have they all been great no but they haven't sucked like some of the DC movies that have come out.Marvel took a big chance with a movie like Guardians of the Galaxy. Its not the typical Marvel movie that we have seen in the previous years. We see Earth for maybe a total of 5 minutes if even that and then everything is out in space.I have to say one of the funniest scenes in the whole movie is right after the opening credits and we are introduced to Peter Quill as an adult. If you are not laughing then there is something wrong with you.But just cause it is off Earth doesn't make it its only departure from the norm of previous Marvel movies. The Guardians aren't all heroic these guys are bounty hunters, criminals, killers even but they band together for a common purpose and save the Galaxy in doing so. You are not getting Captain America, Iron Man etc.The tone of this movie is different too. Yes you have the overarching Infinity Stone hanging over their heads which is really the only tie in we have to the rest of the MCU. But you are getting more comical as well. Yes we have always had the jokes in the previous movies but I think with this group of characters we get a slightly different type of joking and dare I say it is better.I do have to agree with my fellow podcaster Eric that out of all the Guardians Gamora (Zoe Saldana) was flat. Her character arc was not really strong and it was kind of forced it seemed at times to get her to be part of the Guardians and move along certain story lines. Nebula (Karen Gillan) was another one that I think was kind of one dimensional and we didn't really get to see any development from her but she was playing your typical baddie.I have to say for me both Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel) really steal the show for me. Their performances are just great and so so funny. I do not know how people will come away not loving those two.Sadly this time around Marvel has decided to not show the Easter Eggs in the screeners so I know there are some in there but I cannot nor would I tell you what they are.My Recommendation:Who are we kidding this is a Marvel movie you know you are going to go see it in theaters and its going to make tons of money. But yes my recommendation go see the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grossly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really confused at the glowing reviews of this movie. Dull characters. Dull story. Just dumb. I practically fell asleep. Considering I'm a huge fan of James Gunn since his Troma writing days (and to show I'm a fan, anyone else notice Lloyd Kaufmann's cameo?). This one almost put me to sleep. And for those who've claimed it was laugh out loud funny and the audience was behind it 100%...a few chuckles here and there, but the audience I saw it with, walked away confused.There is going to come to light that the majority of the reviewers were paid sponsors of this movie. Something fishy about it all.Anyways, Chris Pratt is good in the role. He is pretty good at playing the 80's character turned into the future, and still retains a 80's face. Rocket (voiced by Brad Cooper) is funny when he needs to be, but is a one-trick-one-line pony. Groot and Zoe Saldana's character are cardboard. Boring stupid forced Shakespearean relationship between sisters. And blah blah blah. Dull is the word. I'm honestly shocked so many people glowed about it. Something is clearly not right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start by saying upfront I was only able to tolerate about 15 minutes of the movie.Being a primarily Marvel comic book reader and TV show/cartoon viewer since the mid-70s, I'm don't care too much for comic book movies as they are not as interesting as or true to the comic book. So yes, I started watching with a bias but three successive clichés in the first 15 minutes were immediate "strike outs" for me. 01. the "dancing to soundtrack while you work" scene 02. perfect fighting and comical acrobatics scene 03. the "hey, that's my property you're impounding ...give it back!" scene... Never mind, the overuse of the charm and whimsy of an CGI space raccoon paired with the comic relief of a CGI walking talking catchphrase spewing tree, or the deliberate use of a song hit soundtrack, etc...(yawn). I think you get the point. IMO, the best comic book movie, thus far, is Watchmen and I don't even read or care for DC comics. And no, I never read any Guardians of the Galaxy comics either.The movie would have been better done as a cartoon or all CGI.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-so on all levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing _Guardians of the Galaxy_. Despite overall positive reviews and stellar recommendations from people whose opinions I value and trust, I found it only so-so at best. The humor was sophomoric?which I expected?but what I didn't expect was how boring it was. To be effective, humor relies on the element of surprise, and with only one or two exceptions, all the jokes were so blatantly broadcast that there was no opportunity to inject the unexpected.In addition, despite a good cast, the acting was flat and one-dimensional. Michael Rooker (Yondu) put in the best show of any of them, and he was really just a blue Merle from the AMC series _The Walking Dead_. Apparently, the director's idea of instilling dramatic tension is to shout, in a rather flat manner. The characters, protagonists and villains, were all overly familiar stereotypes, and there wasn't a single moment in the development of the plot that was not predictable.I am, frankly, surprised at the reviews this is getting. I was expecting a silly, rollicking space opera and instead got a noisy, explosion-ridden pastiche that bordered on tedium. Evidently, a lot of people are more easily pleased than I.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Waste of Time--Ripoffs of Star Wars are Abundant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie just sucked. It was so damn juvenile that, as an adult, I felt as board and uninterested as listening to a 10 year old tell me how their day went at elementary school. There's a main underlying premise, but not much happens between the beginning of the movie and the end, and the damn thing is about 2 hours long. Chris Pratt's character was a rip-off Han Solo but extremely laid-back to the point of being annoying and too hip with a douche, bro-surfer attitude, Zoe Saldana's character was uninteresting and relatively weak in the story when she could have had a bigger part, and that damn raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper was more annoying than Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars! This movie rips off Star Wars in many way, down to the retro-like scifi look of the movie. Half, and I mean it seemed like half...it was that boring, the movie took place in a prison, and nothing really happened besides their dumb escape...trust me it was stupid how they escaped. This movie is like watching an incoherent child's illogical dream. It is an orgy of impossible, child-like fantasy. There is nothing in it that made sense, and there is nothing that engaged the viewer. The antagonist is invincible, but wait no he's not...the protagonist is a fragile human, but wait no he's not...It's probably one of the most poorly written comic book adaptations in cinema history. Hell, or it's probably one of the best! Marvel comic books are pathetically stupid, anyway. I hate this movie with a passion, and I so regret seeing it. Do yourself a favor and skip this boring, extremely poorly written film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvellous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By far, one of the most anticipated movies of the year. Marvel took a massive risk making this movie as these characters weren't as well known compared to others such as Iron Man or Captain America. So, did Guardians of the Galaxy pay off? Yes. This has been declared as the best movie of 2014, some even calling it one of the best sci-fi's and compared to classics like Empire Strikes Back and Blade Runner along with being regarded as one of the best comic book movies. Where I would disagree, I can understand why people would praise it so much. The direction is stellar (considering this is from the guy who directed Movie 43). The effects are tremendous and the cinematography is brilliant. The script is emotional, hilarious and is just amazing. Chris Pratt is outstanding and has definitely proved himself as an actor by bringing Starlord to life and his performance could some day be as classic and iconic as Han Solo's, or the Terminator's. Zoe Saldana and Dave Batista were both great in their roles and Vin Diesel did a good job at doing the motion-capture for Groot. Then there's Rocket, voiced by Bradley Cooper. By far, without a sliver of a doubt, steals the show. When I heard someone compare Rocket to Heath Ledger's Joker as I was leaving the cinema, I couldn't help but agree. The weakest part of this movie however is the villain, Ronan. He didn't seem to have a motive and I don't consider him a character, instead a vessel. Also some of the jokes and humor felt like forced Marvel humor. With that aside, this movie is really fun. Whoever you are, you will like this movie and I believe it gives Avengers Assemble a run for its money and is the 3rd best movie I've seen this year (2nd Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, 1st Edge of Tomorrow) scoring Guardians of the Galaxy a 9 out of 10</fullReview>

On top of that when reading the credits noticed that Nathan Fillion aka. Malcolm Reynolds from the series has a cameo in the movie. The real and CG was pretty much seamless and really worked in this movie more than others I have seen. The inclusion of 70's hit songs was great and I wonder how much the Time-Life website will be looked at for their 70's collection, as well as ITunes.Anyway just a great movie and will keep you entertained from start to finish. When it comes out on video I will purchase it and there are not many that make me want to do that anymore.</fullReview>

They took a bunch of unknown comic book characters like Quill, Gamora, Rocket and Groot; and actually get to care about each and every single character. Even Batista did a great job as Drax. The story was great with a mixture of comedic value and seriousness. The sets and special effects were awesome and the soundtrack truly matched the feel of the whole movie. I would definitely see this movie 2 or 3 more time and buy the DVD when it comes out.All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy was fun watch.

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie even by Marvel's Standards!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie opening day in 3D with my friends and it was incredible to say the least. It had everything you could want. Excellent non-stop action, great humor, excellent cast, amazing use of visuals, and an excellent story. The Guardians of the Galexy are a great team. Sort of like the Avengers but in space. This movie is sort of like the Avengers meets Star Wars (the original trilogy.) With a great team each being different and unique. We have Peter Quill a boy from earth abducted and sent into space. While he is from earth he's lived much of his life elsewhere in the universe so he's used to aliens and different cultures and all that. Then there is Gamora (Zoe Saldana) who is the luscious green skinned alien. We have Groot (Vin Diesel) who is a humanoid tree with really incredible powers that are exhibited flawlessly and Rocket (Bradley Cooper) who is a Racoon type experiment that's very hardcore and really packs a punch. which make an excellent pair and then Drax(Dave Bautista) which is the muscle he's sort of like Hulk a bit. The chemistry between these characters is amazing to say the least. They can be funny as well as charming and they fight really well together. I'm really impressed how the Guardians got together in such a way. I mean it took the Avengers quite a few movies before the Avengers to develop the characters whereas with the Guardians they got together pretty well in one movie barely over 2 hours. I'm very impressed how movie has gotten 2 really awesome teams now in their movies while DC isn't even close to getting their team together. The music was excellent. Lots of oldies songs and very surprisingly it fits so perfectly. The oldies that Peter Quinn listen too were given by his mother so he listens to the music as a way connect with her and in a sense remember his roots on earth. The movie is more comical then the past few comic book movies (Captain America the Winter Soldier, Thor 2 The Dark World, Amazing Spiderman 2, and a few others) however I find it really refreshing to see some of that comical sense like in the First Iron Man movie and the Avengers. Some critics really disliked it but I loved it. I forgot how much I missed seeing super hero movies that are cool but also know how to be funny. This movie does a perfect balance of action and comedy. It's sure to please just about anyone. There were a few things that made some critics gag over but it didn't bother me. Some people found John C. Reily's appearance odd in this movie but actually it works pretty well. Even if you don't like him his role is minor so it shouldn't distract you. Also the villains weren't developed as good as they could have been but in my opinion this movie wasn't as much about that but more about the bad ass Guardians themselves.Some critics will hate this movie because it's different but honestly I love this movie and how different it is from everything else. I feel like a lot of the Superhero movies have been kind of too similar lately and don't get me wrong many of them were great but Guardians of The Galaxy is incredibly refreshing and new while at the same time being kind of old school. Again this movie will please pretty much anyone. This movie is Marvels best so far! They've been doing excellent and just when I thought they couldn't get better they went a step further. Props to Marvel for being so brave and bold and putting out a team that few people outside of comic book readers know about. Also making this film so different was risky. It could have been a major disaster but instead became one of the greatest Superhero films to date. Weather you're a comic book reader, Sci-Fi fan, movie lover, fan of any of the actors, or anything else this movie is for you. Believe me I'm a really tough critic and this movie kept my interest the entire time. The 3D was very much worth it and looked spectacular. Go see it in theaters you WILL love it guaranteed! Lets all show our support for the movie and see it in theaters at least once if not multiple times! If you guys like it too give it a 10/10 show Hollywood that this is what we want! This movie is one of those rare films that hits every note right! It's already got 8.9 and is 37# in the IMDb top 250. I say lets keep giving it 10 out of 10 all of us and keep it up there if not higher. Enjoy the films everyone!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I tell you about the American box office from last year ? That is totally dominated by fantasy movies perhaps ? I did check with boxofficemojo and indeed my fears were confirmed . I say fears and that is indeed what they are . Every year Hollywood produces big budget movies with lots of special effects and screenplays that were written by not a screenwriter but some software program whose only interest is to show off its sister software CGI program . There will come a point in the near future where we no longer need actors , screenwriters or directors and what we'll have is a software engineer make an entire movie single handed . That said it was good that the biggest grossing film in America last year was the Clint Eastwood bio-pic about Navy SEALS sniper Chris Kyle that starred Bradley Cooper so here's hoping my abject fear for the future was allayed somewhat GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY was the third highest grossing movie from last year and I've got the sneaky suspicion it was one of the worst films too . It sums up everything I'm talking about in that you can spend as much money on a film as possible but if you haven't got a strong script you've got a poor film . I can see that the producers were going for a Hans Solo type of story where a likable naughty boy finds himself in a little bit of trouble of his own making but the audience are one hundred per cent on his side . It doesn't really work and the producers have only themselves to blame because the tone seems mismanaged . We get an opening that is emotional as a young boy watches his mother die and this seems totally at odds of what happens throughout the movie which is overblown and effects driven in tune with the average family Summer blockbuster for the most part then we get scenes that just sit uneasily with the rest of the film like the prison scenes I'm probably in a very small minority in saying I didn't enjoy this film at all but I am willing to concede that it made a massive amount of money for the film company and at the end of the day that's all that matters . What I do take exception to is the ridiculous high rating GOTG has received from my peers on this site that saw it rated as number 37 on the IMDb Top 250 movies which is an absolute travesty . Looking on the bright side it's quickly slipping down the list and won't be there for much longer . Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy made me laugh almost non-stop from beginning to end. It's a welcome break from all the conventional superhero movie, with oddballs leading the way instead of "Super" heroes. Surprises galore. There are several tender moments and the stunt work is very good. Sound track is very fun. CGI is unobtrusive. Acting is excellent all round, except Glenn Close who is severely underused. Nice wholesome values, violence is not over-the-top. Recurring theme is one of redemption, honour, self-sacrifice, friendship, and not underestimating anyone's ability to do the right thing. Lots of fun and well worth my RM14. There is an ostrich's egg at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel marvel once again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, when this was announced over 2 years ago at the San Diego Comic-Con, it raised a lot of eyebrows, including my own (yes, a Phage has eyebrows). Marvel were seemingly trying to transition from the grounded approach of Iron Man and Captain America to a film about the aforementioned talking trees and raccoon combo of Groot and Rocket. This didn't make sense and genuinely appeared to be a case of jumping the shark in our eyes. But much has happened in the intervening two years. Marvel have brought in Gods, fire breathing Extremis people and aliens, along with a mere glimpse of the "mad Titan" Thanos at the end of Avengers? a reference that was lost on the vast majority of viewers, but pervaded nevertheless.Skip forward to 2014 and on the eve of this year's SDCC, we got our preview screening of Guardians of the Galaxy. Could Marvel make it pay off? Of course they could. They've delivered what is possibly the finest "Phase 2" film of the bunch. Yes, whilst in our hibernation, we saw Captain America: The Winter Soldier? but we didn't think it merited all that praise. Mainly because we find ol' Cap to be quite the dull hero in his one dimensional "must do good" attitude. If we'd written it up, we'd have slapped a solid 3 Phages on it? in case you were curious. Briefuly, Guardians of the Galaxy tells the tale of Peter Quill / Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) and the highs and lows he goes through after scavenging a mysterious orb. Through various bounties placed on his head, he's thrown together with an oddball group including an assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana), bounty hunter raccoon Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and his tree companion Groot (Vin Diesel) and warrior Drax (Dave Bautista) as the villainous Ronan The Accuser (Lee Pace) quests after the orb, which he plans to use to commit mass genocide. All of this is set against a very colourful backdrop of planets and characters, plus that famous Marvel humour.Where do I start? Let's start with the nerdy paragraph shall we? The one where we talk about it tying into the Marvel universe and linking to the source material? Briefly, this film, despite being set away from the Iron Man / Thor / Captain America trinity fits perfects providing you've been paying attention since Avengers. Die hard fans will see certain plot elements coming together and can see where Avengers 3 or Avengers 4 will be heading? *cough* Infinity Gauntlet *cough* (we can't wait for the SDCC reveals on Saturday!). Plus, we FINALLY get our first real views of the arch-bad Thanos (Josh Brolin). A HUGE grin came over our Phagey face when we saw him on-screen finally. We cannot wait for more of him in the future! As for how it links to the source material? There are liberties taken, but they all work, and should just be kicked to the back of your mind for now.What works so well in this ensemble piece, as it does in The Avengers, is the strength of the cast. Whilst The Avengers had several films to set up the characters and their origins, James Gunn does a fantastic job of doing all that within the film's 2 hour run time and taking them on an adventure too. Chris Pratt is enormously charismatic and really is the "every man" that people can relate to. In fact, despite being a guy romping through space, he's the most grounded lead character in all of Marvel's endeavours . I could actually go through each of the cast members in turn and sing their praises (God knows I love doing this with Bradley Cooper all the time anyway), but that'd take far too long. Suffice to say, that there are no weak links in this story. Even Lee Pace, as Ronan The Accuser comes off very well here. I only mention this, as typically villains are fairly one dimensional (spare Tom Hiddleston's Loki) in their aims? such as Christopher Eccleston's Malekith in Thor: The Dark World, or Mickey Rourke's Whiplash in Iron Man 2. Here it's nice to see a villain that genuinely looks menacing and works well.No Marvel movie would be a Marvel movie without a dose of humour. Well, unless the title is prefaced with Captain America. Guardians of the Galaxy brings humour by the bucketload and genuinely made me laugh on several occasions. As dedicated reader will know, I'm not one to laugh at everything like some deranged drunkard (although many audience members are), but this had some good belly laughs thrown in there. Plus, they reference Kevin Bacon a lot? no joke?So, what are the shortcomings? Honestly, I can't isolate any. Some may say this is simply "The Avengers in Space" or feel that it's becoming formulaic for a team up movie to play out this way. Some might even brandish this as Marvel's Return of the Jedi owing to some "toy-friendly" characters like Rocket and Groot, but I disagree. The pace is frenetic, the acting is sharp and the humour is on point. This is Marvel firing on all cylinders? bring on next year's Avengers: Age of Ultron!Simply put, if you're a fan of any of Marvel's past adventures, then this will have you riveted. I'd also argue that if you haven't been dedicating masses of time to these films in the past years, you'll pretty much be OK too. There are threads of continuing plots running through it that may make little sense if you haven't seen The Avengers and Thor: The Dark World (particularly the after credits scene), but the film can stand alone on its merits too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first review. And I want it to be for this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked out of the theater feeling the same way I did back in 2012 after seeing The Avengers. This movie is enough to bring out your inner 9 year old alter ego and Make You Cry Tears Of Joy. The film was very Action packed. It was a simple plot, but at the same time I felt overwhelmed with all these characters, action and effects.And yes It was still pretty easy to keep up with. And yes Marvel played very safe while launching into its cosmic universe and it seems to be worked out really well.Every member of the Guardians line-up got the right amount of screen time. if you think that Talking space raccoon and a Giant talking tree won't work on a big screen then you are going to feel so wrong after watching this movie as these two were really terrific throughout. Zoe Saldana as Gamora is pretty bad ass. Drax the destroyer is very true to its name. And Yes Peter Quill aka star lord is going to be our new tony stark as Chris Pratt is true show stealer.So, for those who have hang-ups about how you don't want to hear its better or more popular than this or that, don't get caught up in that nonsense. Who cares where people rank The GOTG or Iron Man or The Dark Knight or what have you? It doesn't matter. So, just do yourselves the favor of seeing this movie. It is just a boatload of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid Sci-Fi film and one of the better films in Marvels 'Phase 2'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this film i had no previous knowledge about 'Guardians of the Galaxy' in comics and went into to with an open mind unlike other Marvel films were i have had a bit of knowledge on the characters and what their like. So i was looking forward to this ever since it was announced, It seemed like Marvel are really trying to expand their universe here and not worry about the Avengers or really involving Earth that much which i'm kinda glad, because i always wanted to see a Thor film not take place on earth but i was let down with that with Thor: The Dark World (I didn't dislike Thor, i was just hoping it would be more like this)but i think it was a brave direction to take in the franchise and helps open more doors to introduce new characters into the universe. I liked fact it can be viewed as a stand alone film and doesn't rely on any of the other marvel cinematic universe films. So if you haven't seen Iron Man, Cap America, Thor or Avengers its not really a problem. This film has its own solid story and doesn't rely on any previous knowledge from the other films in the universe.I really enjoyed all the characters, A ragtag group of criminals with their own personal missions and back stories all fighting for their own individual causes but all remain a group to combat a bigger threat. Chris Pratt was perfect for Peter Quill, he had the perfect balance of humour and seriousness for the right moments and helps carry the film keeping it entertaining. Zoe Saldana pulls off a sexy assassin type character again similar to her character in 'Colombiana'. Bautista surprised me, as being a wrestler i assumed his acting would be pretty plain and he would pretty much be utilised for some fight scenes, his fight scenes are pretty cool, but he surprisingly pulls it off with a solid emotional back story to carry his rage throughout the film and some of his humorous lines help bring out his character. Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper as Groot and Rocket nearly steal the film for their own, the 2 of them were perfect, Rockets dialogue is great and his character has some pretty cool moments and Groot is always near by either showing off his brute strength or bringing some humour to the screen. Then there's Lee Pace! who is one of the better villains iv seen in the MCU in a long time! by far the best villains to be seen in phase 2 so far.I really liked the settings and props, its visually stunning and uses an amazing colour palet. I loved the amount of detail in this film from the look of the prison near the beginning to the final fight at the end. one of my personal favourites was the Collectors room were he had different species in cages (Chitauri from Avengers, Dark Elves from Thor and a cameo of another character that marvel fans should recognise after the credits)and other interesting thing that will make you want to pause when you buy the DVD/Blu-Ray to see what you can spot out. The cool Sci-Fi guns and gadgets used in the film, from Peter Quills mask to all the gizmo's and gadgets used by all the characters throughout the film. Loads of them are pretty cool and imaginative weaponry which helps make this one of the better Sci-Fi films of the year. Overall its one of the better Marvel films coming close to Cap America: Winter Soldier and one of the better stories from phrase 2. cant say much was wrong with it and feel this film will be great for Chris Pratt taking him out of supporting roles and hopefully into more lead roles in future films, same goes towards Dave Batista. So yeah i would highly recommend this film to anyone who's a fan of Super Hero films or Sci-Fi lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The productions values were good. The acting was good enough. The film got off to a promising start. I had quite a few laughs, as it is quite funny. But, it just wore me down. After about 45 minutes I did not care about these cardboard cutout characters, with no emotional depth, background, or substance. I admit, I am not a comic book enthusiast, and therein lies the problem. Movies like this one are hard for discerning adults to sit through. The writing was pretty mediocre, at best. Comical at worst. I wanted so badly to walk out, but I went with a friend who wanted to stay, and he regretted that move also. So, see it if you love comic book characters. If you don't, avoid this bloated behemoth.</fullReview>

As for the title "guardians of the galaxy" i would like to comment that while there is a lot of space flight. they only save one planet. sort of.i am so glad i downloaded a cam version of this movie and didn't waste a cent. i would like to say a big EFF you to whomever picked the cast. to this point marvel has had amazing casts. iron man, Thor , captain America? this movie taints marvel. in their pursuit of profit. they have created another flopDO NOT BOTHER WATCHING THIS MOVIE.</fullReview>

It takes more than hiring a personal trainer to be an A-lister &amp; this guy lacks the "It Factor". The lame one liner jokes are relentlessly fired off, all of which fail to hit the mark. The CGI is heavy handed and distracting, this film is the cinematic equivalent of Kim Kardashian: desperate for attention, and utterly empty on the inside. Setting this epic lack of substance to the hits of yesteryear only highlights how desperate the Marvel hacks are to conjure up some sort of hipster factor. Sadly, Zoe Saldana (in green face) is wasted as the token female character in this excruciating hot dog fest. This "movie" will only satisfy the most simplistic of audience members: those who mistake product placement for entertainment. If all you are seeking is an empty shell of film featuring a truck load of hideous special effects, you will no doubt be pleased.</fullReview>

It was interesting for the movie score they used of all these 1970s-ish funk tunes when the guy put his Walkman on.BUT............We get a "Star" studded cast of C and D list actors/actresses oh and Vin diesel we're in for a treat he should go back to racing cars in the fast and the furious franchise. Sure Tom Cruise or someone every drooling idiot knows has to be in a movie to be good. BUT It's too long the story is the same old crap year after year as if we're renting our movie tickets. Seriously why not be the bad guy and destroy a galaxy or two and watch him slaughter a bunch of people and focus on that.I wouldn't give this movie past a 4 star. It doesn't deserve the current 8.9 though. 5 is watchable and if it wasn't for who I went with I would have walked out. I barely watch TV so this is an honest without any brainwashing hype review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Guardians of the Galaxy" must be the perfect summer blockbuster film! Coming from Marvel, home of the angry and angst-ridden superheroes, "Guardians" breaks tradition and was a breath of fresh air with its super-entertaining fun all-out comedy. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) was abducted by a spaceship led by the blue- skinned gang lord Yondu (Michael Rooker) when he was a small boy. 26 years later he is an inter-galactic outlaw self-dubbed as "Starlord". When he steals a mysterious metallic orb, he attracts the attention of an evil lord named Ronin (Lee Pace). Quill gets together with fellow inmates a smart-ass raccoon named Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a tree creature with a 3-word vocabulary named Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), a musclebound simpleton Drax (Dave Bautista) and a sexy green-skinned warrior Gamora (Zoe Saldana) to protect the orb, which contains a powerful destructive material called the Infinity Stone and turn it over to Nova Prime (Glenn Close). I have not seen Chris Pratt act before but he is very good in both his comedy and action scenes. I thought he was able to pull off being the lead of this song. It is interesting to note that he Pratt also voice the lead character Emmet of "The Lego Movie" one of the best movies this year so far.Save for the dramatic opening scene, the rest of this film is riotously funny. I really enjoyed the infectious soundtrack with huge and catchy 1970s hits like from "Come and Get My Love" and "Hooked on a Feeling" to "Ooh Child" and "I Want You Back." This was so much fun. Worthy to watch again, even in IMax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went with my sons at 12 and 14 to see this, with no expectations at all. I mean we'd been massively "hit" by commercials all month, but it wouldn't be the first time a funny and action packed trailer, proved to be a completely different experience in full movie. This wasn't the case here! Guardians of the galaxy delivers from its initial abduction scene to the final dancing plant/tree, and has a kind of feel good energy the you - in my opinion - experience far too seldom these days. It reminds me of a mixture between the later Riddick movies, Fifth Element and The Avengers. The cast is excellent (hard lines to learn Vin Diesel?) and Zoe Saldana makes you wanna go from blue to green. The best is however the promise of more to come. I recommend this movie for all who needs a good and happy day out, no matter age or sex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy was a disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy is everything wrong with today's movie industry and last decades. The company have all the funding they need to produce and hire writers for a solid movie, but yet they end up making something that just looks pretty but with no substance.That's how this movie felt like to me in general. While it had some moments that made me chuckle for real, that was about it. Otherwise it felt like I were watching a movie built up on logic you'd see in an anime where logical train of thought and actions are neglected in the "power of friendship". Which was a real turn off together with the constant clichés in the dialogues. Marvel had the potential to deliver a great movie, I really do think so. But the fact you had to endure the childish plot devices, villains with all talk but no brain and bad writing makes this a movie I'd not like to see again. Taken into consideration and defence for the movie though, it IS aimed for the younger audience albeit the majority of people who knows about GOTG since Marvel's comic are adults by now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best actor was a tree being with a three word vocabulary. The lead actor's character is basically playing Stifler in Space to the extent that he even looks like Seann William Scott. Why not cast Scott instead of someone who is obviously still learning how to act? The dialog was weak and often inconsistently assigned to characters. Although the beginning was decent, I quickly lost interest when a hooded bad guy spoke and sounded exactly like Star Wars' Darth Sidious. Then a huge bad guy showed up with a face that looked exactly like Hell Boy. I read several reviews that said this movie was hilarious. Seriously? The second half of the movie must have been a real hoot, because in the first hour (before several of us in the audience left), I chuckled once. I cannot understand why there are so many positive reviews for a movie that, although contained decent special effects, was riddled with horrible acting and worse writing. If I had $170 million dollar budget, I could have made this much more entertaining, and I'm not good at nothing. They got my $8. Hopefully, they won't get yours too.</fullReview>

This was a film I had high hopes for , but was completely disappointed with how they butchered the characters and turned this into a Serenity Sequel rather then a Guardians film.Mixing and matching story arcs from the Annihilation and Infinity Gauntlet (which predates the current Guardians tandem by 20 years), was a cheap and lazy move by the writers. Not to mention the shameless portrayal of Ronan the Accuser as a merciless madman like Thanos, rather then a noble warrior king that he is .In the end it was a decent movie worth the price of admission , albeit a far cry from the Guardians of the Galaxy fans deserve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We left the theater. It was that bad. (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first five minutes of Guardians of the Galaxy is a hook and gets your teeth sunk in for what looks like a fun, creative, and quirky ride. Then after 10-15 minutes went by I couldn't help but feel I've seen this EXACT movie before. I had. It was a film entitled Raiders of the Lost Ark. You may of heard of it. If you were to watch the first 10 minutes of each of these films and overlay them you would pretty much be watching the same film. So they updated it with a LOT of CGI and super heroes because super heroes are the current trend right now. Of course pepper in a cameo with Stan Lee right? The movie gets worst from there on out. The CGI is over the top, the characters are thrown at us with no development at all but with the assumption we are to care about them. One minute they are trying to kill each other (or not kill each other for some reason... why put him in a bag? I don't get it. Just take the orb). Then about 60 minutes in the producers decide to blast us with a 20-30 minute CGI jack fest that looks just like another film. This time they decided to duplicate Star Wars Episode II (not a good film to replicate). A space chase with CGI only Lucas could love. Ten million things happening on the screen in the span of one chase scene all while blasting our eyes and our ears with brutally piercing effects. Your ears will be ringing for 48hrs after seeing this film. You might have an epileptic seizure if you try to follow all the action as well. This leaves us a little later on with Peter Quill mysteriously smitten over a girl that he has no connection with that has been established. Matter of fact he decides to risk his own life to save her and depend on the undesirable to save him. Sure. Cue more CGI and miraculous healing a minute later to his face.... after all he isn't mortal is he? Or is he? There is also a tree in the film that walks and conveniently regenerates limbs when handcuffs are needed to be placed on him. They have a prison suit that fits a 2' tall raccoon (who doesn't know what a raccoon is even though he speaks English) but not a prison suit that fits a 8' tree. I think this was a case of the CGI department having no problem rendering walking branches instead of a walking rodent. The tree has a case of the Hodors but not unlike Chewbacca he can be completely understood as he speaks articulated sentences. Except with Chewbacca we could infer Solo was guesstimating what Chewy was saying and having fun with it. This is not the case. The raccoon actually understands everything. The film got so bad that we saw a few people get up and leave about 90 minutes into it. We took their cue ten minutes later (the person I was with kept looking at me like... really??) and left as well. The film was an obnoxious capitalistic CGI jack fest that had no story (that wasn't stolen from three other high grossing films), no character development, and no creativity. To give you an example of how uncreative it is, after ripping off the entire intro to Raiders of the Lost Ark the director (I assume) tried to pull a song from the Reservoir Dogs soundtrack and use it to lighten the film. In this case "Hooked on a Feeling" was used. When? When the characters were entering prison of course, why of course they were hooked on the feeling of going to prison. Contrast this with the brilliant work of Tarantino's use of the same song in Reservoir Dogs. It's like the director never saw Reservoir Dogs or he had no say in the music used in the film. What happened to the clever 70s music to be sprinkled in for comic relief? It just disappeared midway thru the film and didn't return til later. They had to have the Episode II CGI jack fest scene to take up half the movie and the pretend romance scene. I could go on from there about how bad this movie was but I would have to go back and watch the last thirty minutes. Maybe after my ears stop ringing and they release the fifth special edition DVD (at which point 99 cents will be the going rate for all other versions) I might just do that. Until then I'll cross my fingers and hope JJ can save the Holy Trilogy that this film and so many others try to rip off while turning a blind eye. It's no coincidence that the poster looks exactly like the poster for Episode IV.</fullReview>

I was wondering if some of the glowing reviews were from people that had a stake in the movies success.Very poor story line, the aliens were all human like with subtle variances and it seemed to just drag on with predictable action and outcomes.

You forget it is fake and fall in love with it as real.. and that is the point to use CG. It complimented the wonderful writing of this flic.The casting was perfect for each character. Design was off from my recollection but still done well. I kept thinking the bad guy was more of a Marilyn Manson nightmare come into life, lol but that was even done well. Glenn close was the only " who did she pay to get into this " person that seemed more of a name add one.

It was pointless, no reason for 99% of the trash talk did nothing for the story. If it was the start of it, I would accept a characteristic development. Yet, for some reason, the language goes to total trash talk near the end? They took the shallow language to the point of adding a word that would get you in jail if you said it to a cop..lol.. It's like they added bad language to raise the movie rating. In doing so they lost a major part of the family markets, if you have a teen it will be fine but those with younger kids will want to avoid this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's everyone raving about? It is clear as day to me that this is a satisfactory movie at best and a dull movie at worst. It is not a great movie or even a very good movie. I realize I'm in the minority, but this movie was basically a remake of Flash Gordon (1980) combined with the Power Rangers movie with a few added clichés from Star Wars. While they were playing those 70s hits, I kept hoping for Queen to sing "Flash! Agh! Savior of the universe!" That would have actually been funny.It's a mess story-wise. It doesn't define it's world; if anything can happen for any reason (or no reason), then nothing's compelling or suspenseful. Action sequences are indecipherable in terms of cause and effect. I kept thinking I should be caring more. Like when the sisters were fighting. There seems to be some history there that made the fight meaningful, but it didn't register. The villain, a ripoff of the Emperor, Skeletor, and Ming, isn't interesting in the least. His motivations are never firmly established.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER? Just describing the first scene.I sit down with my ten year old, expecting to be entertained. Heard so much about this movie, it's this generation's Star Wars, right? First scene, a tragic heart-jerker that kills off the kid's mother. What the -- who asked for this? I hold my kid's hand and we plunge on. Then a bunch of running around and dumb violence. About the time somebody for some reason (who claims HIS father had been killed, AND his grandfather) takes a big hammer and smashes someone's head so "blood" can trickle down into this reservoir, my kid and I looked at each other and said Are You Enjoying This At All? Of course not. So we left.Maybe it gets fun and charming after half an hour. But honestly, this is today's "entertainment"???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I usually never review a movie if I find it crap. But this movie literally crossed its limit.It was yet another star trek wannabe, commercial PoV pseudo sci-fi movie.Here are few things all these pseudo sci-fi movies have in common.1. Aliens who look just like humans but have slightly rough colorful skin. Aliens also share common set of emotions like we humans do. 2. Even on galactic scales English is being used. All alien lifeforms come to an agreement to communicate in English.3. All aliens keeps cracking and laughing on American jokes. They don't just follow human culture, they particularly follow American culture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A misstep from Marvel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must be missing a gene or something as I found very little to enjoy here. Perhaps this is a question of personal taste, however I believe in playing it straight when it comes to fantasy-there's just a lack of realness to any of this. No attempts are made to justify/ground any aspect of the world or characters we're seeing.I disliked the general visual direction and oddball tone personally. Everything felt like surface detail, an unbelievable world akin to a Bucky O' Hare cartoon. The villain disappears off the page too. A few funny moments here and there, but I'm fairly sure I'm down a few brain cells after seeing this utter dreck. Outside of the Avengers and possibly Captain America 3, I fear it's all downhill from here with Marvel movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Marvel Movie Yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy is the best Marvel movie yet. I challenge anyone who would place Iron Man or The Avengers over this action-packed and thoroughly entertaining picture that is the definitive summer blockbuster. It's just f**king awesome! (pardon my French)Hilarious, innovative, and just super fun. I can't recall enjoying a movie this much, right along with a crowd, in quite some time. The less you know about the film and these characters, the better. I'm from a world of movie-watching but not so much on the comic book reading front. My knowledge of superheroes comes from watching Saturday morning cartoons. Like many movie lovers, probably one of the few that will actually admit it, I never heard of the "Guardians of the Galaxy." I had no idea who they were and what they did. This may have made the experience even more enjoyable. There a bunch of funny characters. I'll just say that.There's a moment that overcomes me in the middle of Guardians. Chris Pratt is walking across the screen, after just delivering about a dozen hardcore laughs that literally had me in tears; he's just about gained a theater full of new loyal fans, and Gunn decides to give him a money shot for all the ladies. He walks across the screen in his underwear, sweaty and doused in yellow paint, and heavily panting. I couldn't believe this is the same guy from NBC's "Park and Recreation," Bride Wars, and Her. He's come into his own, and has fully become a movie star, with talent to boot. His work as "Peter Quell" trumps anything done by Robert Downey, Jr. in the Iron Man films. I'd go as far to say that he should heavily be considered a candidate for a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor (Comedy or Musical). Pratt is the new boy toy for every action figure having kid, and every horny Mom that pretends they hate "these kinds of movies."Coming into another big franchise following Star Trek and Avatar, Zoe Saldana moves quietly throughout the film as an unstoppable force as "Gamora." Kick-ass fight sequences, and an interesting enough story that should feel satisfying for even the most hardened movie snobs. Dave Bautista wrecks through the film as "Drax" and even develops his own character ticks and beats that help him stand out considerably.As the voice of "Rocket," Bradley Cooper infuses a dynamic and comical performance that stands as one of the actor's best outings. All I could think of during the film was this is one of the many reasons the Academy needs a Digital and Voice Acting category. Something as lively and priceless as Cooper's voice work deserves some type of recognition. The same can go for Vin Diesel as Groot, though he lacks the speaking volumes to warrant consideration. I thoroughly enjoyed their relationship and dynamic and it's something that plays out completely well on-screen.Obviously, the film has faults. It's very heavy-handed on the whole "we are one, we are friends" message. It actually starts to beat us over the head with it at times. The film also defies all the logic of physics. There are times that even for a superhero film, you have to raise your eyebrow. There's also not really any importance placed on the villain, and I'm not entirely sure I could recite his ultimate plan. This is no fault of Lee Pace as "Ronan" - just an uninteresting story arc.Guardians of the Galaxy is the ultimate summer flick. Something that's just plain stupid fun for you and the whole family. Geeks will bow, audiences will cheer, and the film will secure itself as a new and enlightened franchise for years to come. Gunn's admiration for films like Independence Day, Star Wars, and Top Gun are on full display. There are even instances where I thought of Boogie Nights and Running with Scissors. It's a blend of every clever nuance and thing you love about the movies rolled into one spectacular experience. It's delicious in nearly every way.Dear younger generation, you have been given your "Star Wars." Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey,so I just returned from the European premiere of the movie in German theaters. I did expect a generic but entertaining film like most marvel movies. What I got was a 2 hour spectacle with the most impressive CGI effects I've ever seen. You just can't tell the difference between animated locations, characters and objects anymore. When animated characters are touched it looks real, when animated space ships crash into something you can see the force of the impact and the weight of the object seems just right. Every time a new location was introduced I was amazed by the beautiful look and the diversity of art design.With that in mind the rest of the film can't do much wrong anymore. The story is generic, yes. But what do you expect from a film called Guardians of the Galaxy...some guys try to guard the galaxy. But it is nicely wrapped up and you do not get the feeling it is kept too short. The characters are kept simple but they mostly stick to their characteristics or their racial attitude.I also liked the humor which was above average. All the different species which come together offer a lot of opportunities for some funny arguments and/or jokes.The music fit pretty well into the film and plays a greater role than I expected.One thing that I am disappointed by is Vin Diesel as Groot. I just did not recognize Vin Diesel in this character once during the entire film. He could have just been replaced by some other guy. So he was only picked because he is a famous actor (correct me if I am wrong with this).To sum it up: the film is pretty much worth to be seen in cinema and is a milestone in CGI technics!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guardians of the Galaxy: So much better than I initially anticipated. After first preview I knew I'd see it, but wasn't expecting much. WAY exceeded expectations. The overall tone was unique, and perfect: very funny with the right amount of action/drama. An oddball pairing of characters that works very well w/ a stellar cast.I went into this movie without any knowledge of the story line and it does a great job of telling everyone's story, getting you up to speed and then it takes off immediately. I left the movie feeling extremely satisfied, (with a couple mystery nuggets that were dropped throughout to think about) and hoping for a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable but Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's predictable, cliché and often times cartoonish...yet, Guardians of the Galaxy is still one of the most entertaining blockbusters you'll see this summer. Boasting beautiful special effects and constant humor, Guardians of the Galaxy may not be a groundbreaking entry into its genre, but it certainly is a welcome addition.The finest thing about this movie is the comedy that goes with it. Writer James Gunn really does a fine job of using the archetypal characters (tough female, dumb big guy, sassy little guy) and gives them attributes that add to their farce. Really, the comedy is the film's saving grace, as its predictability sucks away any suspense. Remember, with a film such as this, it's not where the path ends that matters, it's how much fun you have along the way. I give my utmost respect to Bradley Cooper for his sensational, and hilarious voice-over work. Between his prerecorded deliveries and the wonderful editing of Fred Raskin, Hughes Winborne and Craig Wood, the character of Rocket becomes an instant fan favorite. I also enjoyed his lovable sidekick, Groot who tells you his name a ton of times in the film in comedic fashion. If you're a film and acting nerd like me, I think you might find more excitement in seeing Glenn Close and Benicio Del Toro in their fine supporting roles. They don't do much but their presence alone is enough.I find it interesting that Groot, who has the least amount of lines, is the best-written character in the whole film. Groot says so much without saying anything and is easily the most lovable and the most human character in the film. Despite the fine characterization and portrayals of the "good guys" in the film, the villains are terrible. They are probably the worst thing about the movie. They are overly cartoonish and come off as B-movie caricatures. From the overly dramatic, yet beautiful, score accompanying the villains, to their hammy portrayals, they are just hard to watch. It's funny how films of this nature (action, comic book based) spell out everything, as if you wouldn't get it on your own.While I thoroughly enjoyed this film I also found it to be a bit frustrating. Like Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, The Guardians of the Galaxy actually has a deep and darker meaning. Beneath the explosions and punch-lines, the film is about the loss of loved ones. I'm not going to give the movie away for you but be aware that the film is about losing family and friends and how that affects your motivations and loves. If the film wasn't quite so formulaic, it would be one of the greatest films of its genre. Easily. The characters are deep enough and their motivations and loves are justified enough through rational traumas, that this film could have been Marvel's Dark Night. Unfortunately, for me, it's too predictable to hit that mark. I rate this film 3.5 out of 5 stars, and recommend it for ages 13 to 18. You can see this film in 3-D or 2-D at your local theater. Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun, entertaining romp that offers a lot of laughs, has a great soundtrack and is a guaranteed good time.Reviewed by Willie J, KIDS FIRST! Film CriticThe sweet sounds of 80's music, amazing stunts, hilarious one liners, a talking raccoon and a loving, giving tree named Groot are some of the highlights I like most about this film. Marvel has created a 3D futuristic adventure-comedy that explores the true meaning friendship. Chris Pratt plays Star-Lord who is a really good at making enemies and finds himself in trouble when Gamora, Rocket and Groot are after him for stealing the most powerful orb in the galaxy. One of my favorite scenes is when Star-Lord distracts Ronan from destroying the universe by singing Sweet Child and dancing. Everyone asks him what is he doing and he explains that this is what people do on Earth and he challenges Ronan to a dance off. A memorable moment is when Ronan comes charging toward the guardians and he says "Star-Lord." Star- Lord replies finally because everyone is always calling him by his real name, Peter Quill and he wants a cool superhero. It is funny that he is excited by people calling him his alias when he should be worried about getting blown to pieces.Alexandra Byrne, (known for designing costumes for Thor, The Avengers and Finding Neverland) has changed the look of costumes for Sci-Fi and adventure movies. Every costume has more depth for each character especially that of Star-Lord. In the opening scene, you see Star-Lord with a dark maroon cape and metal mask and then, when the aliens try to kill him he escapes by flying via his built-in rocket shoes. The cinematographer, Ben Davis, creates a galaxy never seen before. Throughout the movie I felt as if I was sucked into another galaxy filled with unique aliens and different landscapes.The moral of this film is that friendship is more important than anything. James Gunn shows how desperate all of the characters are to get 4 billion units and then get rid of each other. But, they are meant to do something greater together and that is to protect the galaxy and learn how to love others. I recommend this film for kids 12 to 18 and I give this five stars out of five stars.Reviewed by Shelby R. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

		<shortDescription>Marvel goes into outer space with great success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&#x272d;&#x272d;&#x272d;&#x272d;&#x272d;Kevin Feige and the Marvel team have once again given us another spectacular addition to the ever growing 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'. James Gunn takes the helm of the fairly unknown 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. Like Iron Man, Captain America and Thor the characters feel realistic and the world is very grounded. Peter Quill is abducted from Earth shortly after his Mother's death and becomes a scavenger for his kidnapper, a space pirate, Yondu looking for anything of value. While exploring a uninhabited planet he finds a sphere-artifact. After he double crosses Yondu a bounty is put on his head. After trouble strikes Quill finds himself in prison but after he bands together with four other prisoners, female green humanoid Gamora, tree creature Groot, Drax the destroyer and raccoon like creature Rocket, they manage to break out of the prison. They soon find out however the sphere- artifact is more then meets the eye. This film clearly relies on heavy use of visual effects but despite this the characters and story come first. Although comedy is constantly present the characters have heart and you care about them. Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) gives some of the best lines but the balance is just right so he does not take over the show and the rest of the cast also have their moments. It is true Guardians of the Galaxy is silly, action packed, messy and pushes the law of physics at times and could be seen as a cross between Indiana Jones and Star Wars but it is all round good fun and a perfect summer release. Feige clearly has bigger plans for the out of space gang which all Marvel fans will wait fro with much anticipation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak plot and lots of nonsense battles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read some opinions from different users before watching the movie and even got excited about the idea of paying my entrance for Guardians of the Galaxy, but was absolutely disappointed because what I found was, once again -as many major blockbusters do-, a weak plot and lots of action scenes without an strong story behind. And when a movie lacks an story it feels like an amount of nonsense battles and a compendium of action heroes against bad guys. I really like the characters of the film, but the quality of a movie cannot rely on the strenght of undeveloped characters. Star Wars is still ligth years ahead from these Guardians. Sorry. Waste of money and time.</fullReview>

I'm never into that kind of films, but hey, we give averything a fair chance. I really don't understand IMDb voters though, at the time I wrote this review, it has a score of 8.8 from aprox. 68 000 voters. So that means this film (according to the top 250) is better than: American History X, Psycho ,Rear Window, Saving Private Ryan, City Lights,... I mean like WHAT?! People like to vote so good, because of the general opinion. They don't value real filmmaking. This is something what bothers me, if you check old time classics. Those were great, awesome films. What they bring out know is just a moneymachine. Sad</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Marvel Comics superhero movies are coming thick and fast in the last few years, the trailer for this next adaptation had a humorous approach, of course I saw a more action packed trailer too, so I was looking forward to seeing it. Basically, as a child, following the death of his mother Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) was abducted from Earth by alien pirates called the Ravagers, twenty six years later he has become an outcast, and he attempts to steal a mysterious orb. He is intercepted by Korath (Djimon Hounsou), subordinate to fanatical Kree maniac Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) , and after escaping Peter has a bounty put on him by Ravagers leader Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker), assassin Gamora (Zoë Saldana) is sent to capture him and the orb. A fight ensues between them, and grabs the attention of two bounty hunters, genetically engineered raccoon Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and tree-like humanoid Groot (Vin Diesel), and the four of them end up arrested by the Nova Corps and imprisoned in maximum security artificial moon the Kyln. In the prison the four of them stick together, and are soon joined with powerful inmate Drax (Dave Bautista) who wants revenge for the death of his family at the hands of Ronan, Gamora reveals that she betrayed Ronan as he wants to use the orb's power to destroy entire planets including Xandar, Ronan meanwhile meets titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) to discuss Gamora's betrayal and the loss of the orb. Accompanied by Drax, Quill, Gamora, Rocket and Groot escape the Kiln and flee to remote criminal outpost Nowhere, the group meets Gamora's contact Taneleer Tivan aka The Collector (Benicio Del Toro) who opens the orb, inside it is an Infinity Stone that has immeasurable power to destroy all but powerful beings who can wield it, this is proved when Tivan's assistant grabs it that engulfs him in an explosion. Drunken Drax summons Ronan, he is easily defeated while the others flee, pursued by Ronan's followers and Gamora's sister Nebula (Doctor Who's Karen Gillan), she manages to destroy her ship and captures the sphere, Gamora and Quill floating in space are collected eventually by Yondu, Quill negotiates a truce with him. Quill, Gamora, Rocket, Groot and surviving Drax agree that facing Ronan means certain death, but they must stop him from using the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy, Ronan meanwhile embeds the Stone in his warhammer and threatens to kill Thanos. On Xandar, Ronan's ship the Dark Aster is confronted by Yondu's fleet, the Nova Corps, and Quill's group who manage to breach, Korath is killed by Drax, Gamora defeats Nebula, who escapes, and Rocket damages the enemy ship to crash with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the others. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him while Drax and Rocket destroy the warhammer, Quill grabs the Infinity Stone, and finds that he, Gamora, Rocket and Drax are powerful enough to withstand its force, and they use the power to destroy Ronan. In the end Yondu is given a false orb, while the real one containing the Stone is given to the Nova Corps, the group now called the Guardians of the Galaxy all have their criminal records expunged, Quill finds out he is only half-human, his father was part an ancient unknown species, and he finds the courage to open the last present from his dying mother, the Guardians leave in their repaired ship, the Milano, and Groot seen regrowing in his plant pot. Also starring John C. Reilly as Corpsman Dey, Glenn Close as Nova Prime, The Inbetweeners Movie's Laura Haddock as Meredith Quill, Peter Serafinowicz as Denarian Saal, Stan Lee as Xandarian Ladies' Man, Slither's Nathan Fillion as Monstrous Inmate, Rob Zombie as Ravager Navigator and Seth Green as Howard the Duck in an amusing post credits sequence. Pratt is likable as the wisecracking hero with his "Awesome Mix" cassette tapes, Saldana is cool as the green-skinned warrior, Cooper does almost steal the show as the fuzzy fast-talking sidekick with Diesel suitably voicing his walking tree partner who can only say "I am Groot", and Pace and Gillan get their moments as the villains. It takes perhaps a few minutes to properly get the plot, but once you do it is an engaging one as the heroes of the peace try to stop the power-hungry aliens achieving galactic domination, the high octane chase and fight sequences are impressive, and the CGI and makeup special effects creating the spaceships, creatures and imaginative space spectacle is brilliant, the soundtrack with "awesome" songs like "I'm Not in Love" - 10cc, "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" - Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell and "I Want You Back" - The Jackson 5 is a nice touch as well, a fantastically fun science-fiction action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up &amp; Hair and Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great effects with a notable lack of substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a hospital room where a child witnesses the death of his mother, an alien abduction follows and fast forward some 20 years to the present life of this man in deep trouble. A seemingly ordinary man gets hold of a very valuable object and as a result his life is in great danger as some very important individuals are prepared to go to great lengths to obtain it. In a nutshell, this is the main thrust of the film and it is not hard to observe how it astutely suffers from a very weak storyline.Who the main protagonists were and how this intergalactic link came to be, it remained largely unknown except the occasional insertion of information as the film developed. On this note, this movie developed largely out of action scenes which were pretty much a constant. This undoubtedly was its strongest point, plenty of action some of it impressive will keep one engaged despite the gaps in the story. A put off in this was the frequent attachment of the main character to a cassette player that often played romantic songs and to hear that in the middle of space battle as they tried to survive was very anti climactic.On the whole, this will undoubtedly impress the early teen audience and the die-hard fans of Marvel comics as well as sci-fi enthusiasts. Mindless constant action without a storyline will indubitably be a favourite amongst 13-18 year olds. As for the rest of us, well we'll just have to let ourselves be absorbed by the action and bypass the lack of substance.</fullReview>
