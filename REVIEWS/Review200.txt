		<fullReview>These are the immortal words spoken by SIXTEEN CANDLES heroine Samantha Baker (Molly Ringwald) in the ultimate 80's teen comedy. This movie has become a classic to those born in the 70's, like myself, and I now consider it a "guilty pleasure". Its a movie we all grew up with. Didn't we all know a person like 'Farmer Ted', or a hot queenie like the blonde he hilariously gets. It was every young freshman's fantasy. This funny flick is also a relic of the 80's that is not all that dated.The jokes still work (as long as you see it uncut) and it is neat seeing things of the not so distant past be on display. Floppy disks, headgears, leotards, etc... Time has not been so good to the featured stars. Ringwald and Anthony-Michael Hall, who was born to play this role, and this one only, have all but disappeared. The biggest stars now are blips on the screen here: Joan (in a headgear) and John (a geek) Cusack. The film is like a toy you can't put away.Some situations are beat, but at least Paul Dooley adds an extra dimension to the father. Too many of John Hughes' teen-angst comedies of the era feature tissue-thin parental figures. This was the first and best of the so-called "brat pack" movies, and will always hold a place in 1980's filmmaking history. Girls learned never to lend their underwear to a geek and we all learned that high school is just a phase, easily forgotten as time goes on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am shocked to realise this hilarious film is now 30 years old! Films from 1964 seen in 1988 looked a zillion years apart.....how can a 1980s film like this one still be so new and play so fresh in 2014? ...Apart from it being funnier and truly inspired I really now appreciate more the legacy of John Hughes in his series of films that were released in that 5 year span 1984-89. Anthony Michael Hall is rightly celebrated and gorgeous Molly Ringwald deserves her fame in the teen hall of Stardom. Whatever happened to Michael Schoeffling (Jake)....anyone know? It seems incongruous that so many future stars got their start in this film yet he seemed to go nowhere. I am also very surprised it got a PG rating.......given the swearing and the nudity..but I guess in the spirit of it all it was a perfect pic for anyone 12 - 112. Very clever and very funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The eighties were great weren't they</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films like Sixteen Candles personify what the eighties was all about. And if you were a child of the 80s, you will probably identify with this film a lot more than the now younger generation. The story is simple enough, but it works so well. Molly Ringwald is particularly likeable in this, and she is almost irreplaceable in her part. There are heaps of familiar faces, including small parts from many of the present day 'movie stars' ie John Cusack, Joan Cusack and Jami Gertz. It's kind of daggy though, and when you tell people you watched it their response is usually "Oh My God. That is so OLD." But that's what I like about it. If you want to watch a film that reflects the eighties, forget the nostalgia trips of The Wedding Singer and Romy and Michelle. Hire a true eighties product, such as Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, St Elmo's Fire.... The list goes on and on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the most quotable I've ever seen. Everyone who has ever seen it knows this is true. Along with "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" and "The Breakfast Club", this is the best of the John Hughes 1980's movies. The acting is perfection, down to the smallest parts, too. Standouts are Blanche Baker as the bride-to-be on too many painkillers, Justin Henry as the pain-in-the-neck little brother, Michael Schoeffling as hunk-deluxe Jake Ryan and last but never least, Anthony Michael Hall as Farmer Fred....I mean Ted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A difficult kiss.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The final shot of this film can in some ways mirror the difficulties of adolescence. We see Molly Ringwald finally getting to kiss the boy she's been after since the film's outset. However this kiss doesn't look like it would have been particularly easy for the actors to pull off. Both Ringwald and Shoeffling are sitting "Indian-style" on a tabletop facing one another. They both have to lean forward presumably using their wrists for leverage while their lips meet over the flaming candles on her birthday cake. A difficult kiss, indeed.Sixteen Candles is one of the best films John Hughes gave us in the 1980s. The young cast full of so many extraordinary talents gives us one memorable scene after another. Anthony Michael Hall is particularly effective as the leader of the nerdiest students on campus. Listen to his voice crack as he reads many of his lines, and try not to laugh. Good luck! The plot, as many of us know, centers around a young girl (Ringwald) whose parents forget about her sixteenth birthday in the midst of the chaos surrounding her older sister's wedding. At the same time she tries to win the affection of the most popular guy in school who happens to be dating the most beautiful girl in school. Ah, the trials and tribulations of high school.The film is well-paced, never drags, and has its characters pegged pretty well. The obnoxious grandparents are particularly well-drawn. Of course things are eventually resolved in a manner that could never possibly happen in real life, but that's why we go to the movies.I miss those destructive house parties!!! 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an 80's classic!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This John Hughes film is one of the best romantic teen comedies in history. Starring 2 of the Brat Packers, Molly Ringwald, playing the lovesick Samantha, and Anthony Michael Hall who plays "The Geek", he pratically stole the entire movie with his one-liners. His friends were the best, it's funny to see John Cusack as one of his geeky friends, and I just noticed Joan Cusack makes a small appearance in this as the girl with the neck brace on. That's funny. I recommend this classic to anyone who likes romantic teen comedies. Oh and whoever said that "Sixteen Candles" was perverted, all i have to say is WHAT? What is perverted about this movie, American Pie was perverted, this movie is a classic. There was ONE scene of nudity and it lasted about 3 seconds. I give "Sixteen Candles" 10 out of 10!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to write about this film after seeing the last 10 minutes of it on TV last night. I didn't miss much after all cause I had seen the film countless times when I was younger. Man I remember how much I enjoyed it. This has to be the most 80's character driven film about high school I have ever seen. It is just plain out stupid funny and heartwarming.While Breakfast Club tries to handle the seriousness of social peers, and Ferris Beuller just solidifies the ultimate 80's experience with some great performances and total hip coolness, Sixteen Candles is just a crazy fun romp through the perils of being a teenager.Ringwald is at her prime as the overburdened teenager, and Michael Hall is at his greatest as the ultimate schemer-geek. The party aftermath always cracks me up everytime I see it, plus so many more things.Also, there's a scene where the geek gets unloaded out of the trunk of a car, and i SWEAR it's not a human person but a dummy cause the guy does not move but stands like a broomstick.. It's just one of those bizarre movie qwerks I wish someone could explain to me. And who can forget those alligator shirts.... I laugh now at the way everyone and the bands look in these 80's movies.Alas it seems, Hall and Ringwald got stuck in stereotyped roles that they never seemed to shed or outgrew them as they became adults, which is to bad cause Ringwald, and particularly Hall's comedic sense of timing in this film is just amazing.Rating 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my opinion of it....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>movies in the 80's were really cool, nice story lines, very real people and cute guys too! 80's movies were so musical, full of dance and laughter, really good acting and good use of props. I wish movies were like the old classic movies, movies nowadays are somewhat a rip off, i'm not saying all but most movies made in this era are all computerized, there's so much plastic surgery happening, drastic diets, if you look back at the old movies, the ladies are really beautiful naturally, nice hair, and the spark in those eyes, men were romantic. I watched Sixteen Candles for the first time, and i enjoyed it. I liked Pretty in Pink better though. Sixteen candles is a really funny yet in a sweet romantic sort of way....the geeks and the Duck guy, hilarious! i enjoy watching classic movies, eg. dirty dancing, ghost, gremlin, pretty in pink, ghost busters.... I wouldn't recommend this movie to kids 14+, especially if you don't like watching classic movies. But to those out there who were teens in the 80s, this might bring back your high school memories. Truly hilarious, you can predict the ending, the geeks took the spotlight for me</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading all the comments about how funny and amazing and "true" this film is, I hope that the world has progressed a LOT since it was made or that the people who commented didn't actually see the vast majority of this film. When I first saw it as a child, I thought it was great too.I recently had the chance to see it again, and I cannot believe how awful it actually is. This film is racist, sexist, classist and homophobic and not in a satirical way. It casually condones and glorifies rape (yes, having sex with someone who is too drunk to even know who you are is actually rape).The only good thing about this film is the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes the Cake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Most films are about other films, and few invent new stuff in the film world. So when something new comes around, it is remarkable. The big deal with this film is that it DOES add something to the cinematic vocabulary that wasn't there before.It references the movies we invent and carry in our minds from high school. `Fast Times at Ridgemont High' was the originator of this idea, but the manner used there never caught on (unless you could Kevin Smith). Here, the idea is to be fantastic, so amazingly so that we agree with the direction of the fantasy. It is precisely the direction we were already going with the exaggerations we play with in our own memories.A house is not just trashed by a party, it is decimated and defiled. A foreign student isn't just out of touch, he is from outer space and this Earth just gobbles him up. All this frantic fantasy wouldn't work without an emotional anchor. The `rule of twos' says that you need a girl and a boy, here Molly and Hall. These are characters who live in that chaotic mess and who you can see knowing it and devising strategies to get by.Michael Hall is terrific, but Molly Ringwald interests me more. Nowadays, a director would find a 20's something actress to play a teenager (like dePalma had with `Carrie'). Molly was actually younger than her character but understands the notion of trying to find a lighted path in a funhouse.She is only asked to do one thing here. Her subsequent career shows she is limited as an actress to this one thing, but she does it so extraordinarily well, it anchors the fantasy. We relate to her and use her a springboard for our own remembrances. No shrinking redhead can appear in film now without referencing her in some way. (I'm thinking directly of Lauren Ambrose here.)It is a touch of genius. This is her best work, and that of Hughes as well. It added something, something that stuck. Now, many movies are about this one.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

All you have to do is say a line like: "Oh look, Frank, she's got her boobies"; or "Thanks for lending me the Donger here, he's totally bitchin'"; or "What's happening', hot stuff?", to anyone between the ages of 30 and 40, and I guarantee they'll know what you're talking about.Molly Ringwald raised teen surliness to Shakespearean heights; Anthony Michael Hall channeled hormonal distress; and Joan Cusack brought acceptance to head-gear wearers everywhere, proving that kids with bad teeth are humans too.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Samantha Baker's 16th birthday and her family are so wrapped up in her sisters impending wedding, they have completely forgotten Sam's big day. Not only that but she has the hots for school hunk Jake Ryan who, apparently doesn't know she even exists. Her existence, however, is noted by freshman Ted "The Geek" who lusts after her at every opportunity. Being 16 really isn't all it's cracked up to be, maybe?John Hughes directs his first feature film and sets out his marker for the career that was to come for the astute observer of teen angst and coming of age drama.Featuring Hughes faves Molly Ringwald (Sam0 &amp; Anthony Michael Hall (Ted), Sixteen Candles is frothy on the outside but not without cunning substance on the inside. It's the sort of film that is easy to forgive its obviousness on account of its understanding of its characters, something that Hughes was a master of. Even as we run through the staple requirements of the teen comedy movie (dance, party, making out etc ) Hughes manages to avoid the cliché pitfalls of such sequences by fuelling them with believable patois. His cast, with the exception of the dull Michael Schoeffling (Jake), are sparky and engaging throughout. With the Cusack siblings, John &amp; Joan also showing up in the strong supporting cast. There's an Asian exchange student thread that some have tried to paint as stereotypically offencive, but that is nonsense! Gedde Watanabe ensures the role is the fun and harmless one it's meant to be.The soundtrack is kicking and very at one with the story (another knack of Hughes), it features the likes of The Specials, The Revillos, Billy Idol, The Stray Cats and The Thompson Twins. And the Evanston, Illinois location work really fleshes out the feeling of the piece.Not just a film for 80s nostalgists then, one for pretty much anyone who was 16 and had their emotions pulled all over the place. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It may look like cheesy teen romance, but it was the birth of teen comedy as we know it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As weird as it may sound, "Sixteen Candles" is an important film. It's true: a film about a high school girl who has a nightmarish sixteenth birthday played a significant role in shaping movie comedies as we know them today.To start with, "Sixteen Candles" was written and directed by John Hughes. Hughes had written a couple films prior to this one for the group National Lampoon's, namely the classic comedy "National Lampoon's: Vacation." "Candles" marks the directorial debut of Hughes, his first complete film. Why is this of any significance? Well, Hughes followed up this film a year later with a little movie called "The Breakfast Club." As if that wasn't impressive enough, in the 1980s, Hughes produced more hit sequels to the "Vacation" series, a movie called "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" and created some of the finest films of the careers of Chevy Chase and John Candy. He's the father of 80s comedy and the grandfather of comedy as we know it today.So how does this all ring true in "Sixteen Candles"? To start, the film takes place in the span of 48 hours. That seems insignificant, but how many classic teenage comedies take place in a short time span? The model even holds true with today's films like the praised Apatow Productions film "Superbad." That's just one small example. The real contribution of this movie is its depiction of the teenage lifestyle. Samantha is a typical teenager with typical teenage thoughts and problems on her 16th birthday. Molly Ringwald is a name no one forgets despite her only major films being this and "Breakfast Club" because we see a little of our teenage selves in her candid performance. With Hughes help to create such a real concept (getting neglected by her family on her birthday), Ringwald communicates all those dizzying 16-year-old emotions and issues like self-confidence, being misunderstood and of course hopeless romance.The comedic genius plays its way in to all the things that happen to Sam and the completely relatable and/or goofy characters that surround her. The film is one of the first to take what "Animal House" did for college movies and apply it to the high school scene, being unafraid to handle the sex and drinking and generally irresponsible behavior. While this idea has since exploded into untold number of movies both good and awful, what makes it stay fresh today is that it doesn't over-stereotype. There are nerds and popular girls and what have you, but Hughes doesn't play up that hierarchy. Sam's love interest, the seemingly unattainable Jake Ryan doesn't have jerk-off friends pressuring him not to fall for the unknown quiet girl. them coming together is the film's goal, not it's plot. While the believability there isn't the film's strong suit, it's not as weak and cheesed up as similar films that followed it.The best part of "Sixteen Candles" is how unmistakably real it is. The family drama and goofiness that plays out (the story takes place the day before and of Sam's sister's wedding and the family's in town) is so dead on. We all have grandparents like Sam's that treat us like they treat Sam. We all have embarrassing but necessary conversations with our parents, even if we don't like seeing them on the screen either. Hughes taps into our inner or (depending) outer teenager with sacrificing the humor of the whole situation. If nothing else, "Sixteen Candles" could provide anyone with a camera and some confidence to create a movie. This is proof that movies about life in the suburbs can in fact be done well.Complimented with a killer soundtrack, freshmen who look like 12-year-olds paying money to see women's underwear, some great cars and plenty of empty cans of "Old Style," "Sixteen Candles" is classic in every sense of the word. There's no denying that it's cheesy and most of the acting is poor outside of Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall (also of "Breakfast Club") as the socially courageous geek who is a sweetheart of a troublemaker. (Oh, and appearances by the young Cusacks.) At the same time, it's the nostalgic, lost but hopeful teenage feeling the movie evokes that makes it timeless. It can't be underestimated how much of an impact this film really did have on the future of comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>**One of my all time favorite movies** Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one movie that I remember watching as a young girl and as a teenager and later as an adult. Early on I spent most of my time fantasizing about Jake Ryan and now I get most of my kicks from laughing at Long Duk Dong. John Hughes is by far the most talented director of all time. He has a knack for striking the chords of youth and presenting teenage material in a way that anybody can relate to. I mean how many of you can remember "loathing the bus?", or knowing a geek somewhat like "Farmer Ted?" My favorite part of the movie is when Samantha's parents and grandparents find Dong passed out on the front lawn stinking of "Canine Cologne" and giving grandpa a rendition of what happened to his "aut-o-m-bile". It is too funny for words!! The party scene where Farmer Ted and his friends knock on the door and Dong answers it while hanging on the door with his legs wrapped around the frame saying, "come on in and party hard, dude-people", his new All-American girlfriend then proceeds to pick him off the door frame and carry him into the party is absolutely hilarious! The entire movie is full of humor that I can appreciate. I also could relate to the "Jaws" or "Twilight Zone"(depending on what movie version you have) musical theme that played as Samantha came across her grandparents raiding her bedroom to stay for the weekend. You will laugh as her grandpa eyes her chest and says to grandma,"Let me go get my magnifying glass!" And what girl doesn't love a happy ending, especially with the ever-so-handsome Jake Ryan? If you grew up in the eighties and need a good love story or a good laugh rent this movie. Just be sure to keep an eye out for Dong, because he uses his forks as chopsticks while eating his American meals.......too cute!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great portrayal of teenage angst, but partly lacking in believability</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This being John Hughes' most popular teen comedy, I was somewhat disappointed. Sixteen Candles is about high school sophomore Samantha Baker's struggle to get through her 16th birthday. Busy preparing for her older sister Ginny's wedding the next day, Sam's family has completely forgotten her birthday. At school, Sam is crushing on a senior who seemingly has no idea that she exists. On the bus home, a dorky freshman, Farmer Ted, pesters her for a date. Her grandparents show up the house and take over her room. To top it off, even the Vietnamese exchange student manages to find a date at the school dance faster than Sam. Unknown to her though, things are about to take a turn for the better.The parts of the script relating to Sam were excellent. All the things that could go wrong on a girl's Sweet Sixteen went wrong. Molly Ringwald put in an splendid performance as Sam, conveying all the angst and desires that her character experienced. Michael Hall was perfect as Farmer Ted, trying desperately to be cool but unable to shake off his dorkiness. However, the entire storyline relating to Sam's crush was not very believable. Apart from picking up the balled-up 'sex quiz' in class and seeing his name, there was absolutely nothing to draw him to Sam. Also, most guys wouldn't pursue a girl to that extent without first having a decent conversation with her in school. The whole after-the-after-party episode was also rather ludicrous. While I doubt things in America are that crazy, perhaps they are crazy enough for all this to be not so much of a stretch for viewers there - this might explain why the movie had such wide appeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Samantha Baker (Molly Ringwald) has her 16th birthday but her family are so wrapped up in the impending wedding of her sister Ginny (Blanche Baker) that they have completely overlooked this ('they've forgotten my f******g birthday!'). Her parents (Paul Dooley and Caroline Glynn) are nuts, her grandparents make remarks about her breasts and embarrass her. To add to that, Chinese exchange student Long Duc Dong (donggg!) played by Gedde Watanabe is staying with them.Ted 'The Geek' (Anthony Hall) hits on her at every opportunity. She meanwhile has the hots for school hunk Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling) but he is in a relationship with Carolyn Mulford (Haviland Morris) who is perfect, and we get graphic evidence from the shower scene! The school dance section is beautifully observed. The dialogue between Sam and Ted is wryly constructed ('A lot can happen in a year ? you could come back next fall as a completely normal person'. 'Yeah?') and there are some wonderfully surreal moments.This film has a lot of similar elements to John Hughes' later film Ferris Bueller, though with not such strong leads. Ringwald is good but the others not so good. The scene between Hall and Schoeffling is weak and once Ringwald drops out from the action, the drawn-out end of the film drags a bit.There are almost too many comedic elements and so most don't get fully developed. However, I did like the recurring character of the girl in the neck brace. And the music is very cool, even thirty years on (Bowie, Paul Young, Kajagoogoo, Spandau Ballet, The Specials, Nick Heyward, Patti Smith, Altered Images and The Thompson Twins).I watched it, enjoyed it and would happily see some scenes again. But viewed as a whole ? not as good as Ferris.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10 out of 10 Early John Hughes Comedy Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sixteen Candles was written and directed by the late great John Hughes and has withstood the test of time to become a comedy classic. Molly Ringwald is a funny sympathetic character that holds the viewers attention and she is supported by a strong cast. Anthony Michael Hall steals every scene he is in as the freshmen 'king of the dipsh*ts' and he definitely hits his mark with his delivery of very funny dialogue. I saw this film in the theaters when it was first released as a rather low budget comedy and you could actually see the boom mike hanging down from the top of the screen....especially in the scene where a weeping Molly is on the sofa discussing her problems with her dad....the boom mike was somehow edited out of the later prints. To be clear this is a must see 1980s comedy and is one of the top 20 films of the entire 1980s....from the sick partying of 'house parties' to the innocence of high school dances this film is non-stop laughs and moves quickly without any real slow spots. The film has barely begun before the viewer realizes that Molly's all important 16th birthday has been completely forgotten by her entire extended family and her own home has been taken over by crazed relatives here for her sister's wedding. Viewers should keep an eye out for both a young Jon Cusack as one of the nerds who gets locked in a car trunk and also his sister Joan Cusack who dates Long Duk Dong the wild exchange student. You need to seek out this comedy and get some great laughs...you can thank me later. Tom Wilson, New Jersey, USA, (HardToFindMovies)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic film, guaranteed to put a smile on your face.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Sixteen Candles in 1985, i was aged 18 years old. I loved the film then and i still love the film. For me this is possibly the funniest teen comedy of all time. Every other teen comedy worth watching since has used 16 candles as a template. I love American pie but i wonder if it would have come to fruition without the existence of 16 candles. One of the things that made 16 candles so great in my opinion is the performance of Anthony Michael Hall, his performance was certainly worthy of an award of some sort, maybe even an Oscar! I've often wondered why the Oscars don't have an award for the best actor under 18 years category. If, like many of us, you found your teen years a little confusing and sometimes painful then perhaps this film is for you. I would suggest most teenagers, certainly in the western world if not the whole world, will be able to relate to this classic film. Superbly written, cleverly observed by John Hughes and stands the test of time, this is a film worth watching and guaranteed to put a smile on your face if not make you laugh out loud. Watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

The script is both funny and smart with a keen ear not just for the idiom of teenspeak, but also genuine sympathy. The pacing is good, and the direction is solid, while the acting I have no qualms with either. Anthony Michael Hall is perfect as the nerd who tries hard to impress, but to me this is Molly Ringwald's movie as she adeptly personifies the sulky sweet teen whose day goes from bad to worse. Overall, charming, funny if slightly uneven. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute Idea, But Crude</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the initial idea of Sixteen Candles. I myself am sixteen, and I could relate to Samantha (Molly Ringwald) in many ways. However, was all the language necessary? The plotline involving Sam's dream boy's girlfriend &amp; the geeky boy was also unbelievably awful (essentially condoning rape) and, for that matter, the whole plot with the geeky guy (Hall) was uneccessary and crude. It had real potential, but did not live up to what looked like a sweet movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the movies of the 80s... I really like a lot of brat pack flicks.... John Hughs' other film made around this time, Breakfast Club? It's great, Four Stars! But 16 candles is not very good. Initially, I liked the humor; it was more shocking and contemporary than I expected, with an ironic twist. But the film's premise degenerates quickly into a huge nonsensical mess... NOT good old 80's fun mess, but stupid, racist, sexist drivel. At times, the attempts at humor made my jaw drop, they were so inappropriate and extremely unfunny. Breakfast Club similarly toyed with audience expectations and broke rules concerning the handling of subject matters like sex, drugs and society in high-school; it ended up being a very honest, poignant film that made you laugh your ass off.... it's no Citizen Kane, but Breakfast Club = good flick. If you are in the mood for a night with the brat pack, my suggestion is to skip 16 Candles, a film I found offensive and devoid of anything entertaining, in favor of the far superior Breakfast Club. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teen classic, not as good as I remembered it 24 years later.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Molly Ringwald really was 15 going on 16 when she played Samantha Baker, whose 16th birthday is overlooked by all her family members who are focusing solely on her older sister's upcoming wedding.Ringwald is, of course, good in this role, but the real star seems to be Anthony Michael Hall as the 15 year old, geeky Farmer Ted, 'The Geek'. He sits next to Samantha on the bus, and leans over to smell her. He matter of factly tries to talk her into a date with him. In a very memorable scene they end up in a car in the school's shop area, and he talks her into loaning him a pair of her panties so that he can collect a bet.The funny scenes are stolen by Gedde Watanabe as the foreign student staying with Samantha's family, Long Duk Dong.Even a young John Cusack and his sister Joan Cusack have roles.There is a lot of entertainment in this teen classic, but it has not held up well since its release 24 years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Hughes made better films than this in his career, but this one still has enough to make most of it work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was born in the 80's, so I obviously didn't get to see any of the teen movies of that decade when they were new. "Sixteen Candles" is one of those films, and I finally watched it over 25 years after its release, knowing it was from John Hughes, who made several of these 80's teen movies, including "The Breakfast Club" and "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", both of which I had seen and thought were good. I also knew that the cast of this directorial debut from Hughes included Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall, who would both appear in "The Breakfast Club" shortly after this. When I finally watched this 1984 romantic comedy, I didn't think it was as good as the other two teen films from Hughes which I had seen, but it still has its charm.It's Samantha Baker's sixteenth birthday, but her family is so distracted by the wedding of her older sister, Ginny, which is coming up the next day, they forget all about Samantha's birthday! When the hapless high school student wakes up that morning, it is soon clear that nobody else in the family has remembered the occasion, as nobody mentions it before she goes to school that day, and everybody in the household talks to her as if it's just another day. Obviously upset about this, Samantha then goes to school, and unfortunately, life isn't treating her too kindly here, either. She has a crush on an older student named Jake Ryan, but does not seem to have much of a chance with him. This is not helped by the fact that another boy in the school has a crush on her, and he happens to be a geeky freshman who really gets on her nerves! Worse still, it seems Samantha is headed for further trouble at home! At first, when I started watching this particular John Hughes effort, I wasn't sure exactly what I thought yet. At this point, there are some mildly amusing scenes showing some dysfunction in the Baker family, but I didn't know if anything in the film would make me laugh very hard. The part where Samantha takes a sex quiz in class is pretty funny, though it certainly isn't hilarious. Another memorably funny scene is Samantha's first conversation with "The Geek" (Anthony Michael Hall's character), especially when he asks her if he's turning her on, when he should know the answer! This might be funnier than any gag that comes before it. The "Geek" character contributes a good amount of humour to the film, and another memorably funny scene is him trying to dance with Samantha. There were parts of "Sixteen Candles" which I didn't really care for, as it isn't always entertaining watching Samantha having her constant bad luck and getting all sulky, and I wasn't sure how funny I thought the main character's grandmother "feeling her up" was. However, for the most part, this is somehow an intriguing movie with memorable conversation scenes. It has some funny moments and also some pretty good serious ones, even if they're not super-touching.Apparently, this "Brat Pack" film was originally rated R, but the rating was then changed to PG on appeal. There's some strong profanity at times in this film (not just MILD language), and even a scene showing the Caroline Mulford character in the shower, in which we are shown a close-up shot of her breasts and then a view from the side which reveals her buttocks! I believe this is the most explicit PG-rated movie I've ever seen, and if it had been released just a little while later than it was, I'm sure it would have at least been given a PG-13 rating, though I'm sure many wouldn't even consider that to be enough, due to that shower scene! So, even though many PG-rated movies are family ones, "Sixteen Candles" obviously isn't. This 1984 romantic teen comedy is not for kids, but for teenagers and adults who can take some swearing (including the f-bomb, which isn't used much in this film, but isn't completely avoided) and one scene of graphic nudity, it could be worth watching if you like this kind of film.</fullReview>

The story is about Samantha. A teenage girl who has a crush on a boy who, she thinks, doesn't know she exist. Not only does the boy know she exist, but KNOWS she has a crush on him and has been thinking about her A LOT. Her friends are at a lost of what to do. Some geek wants to bag her to show his friends he's King of the Dip Sh*ts. Her family is going crazy because her sister is getting married to a RiceChex. Relatives are swarming all over the house in their underwear(gross me out to the max!). There's a horny Chinese guy running around. To make matters worse, it's the Samantha's birthday and NO ONE remembered! Like gag me with a spoon!!What a crazy 24 hours where anything that can happen, and does. Geeks are supreme and sex is everywhere! This is a fun ride down 80's memory lane.PS; Does anyone remember Molly' fav band of the eighties?? (HINT-Check out her notebook)</fullReview>

He was up tight at the start who knew no one and once he hits the dance floor with a beautiful woman he starts to open up becoming a party animal.Michael Anthony Hall didn't do to bad and showed his acting chops becoming a ladies man instead of the typical need who can't find a date. His comic timing was top notch.Join a few familiar faces for a comedy that will have you rolling on the floor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a John Hughes teen movie, so even during the opening scenes many will have sketched a good idea of how Sixteen Candles will conclude. The usual archetypes are all there; the prissy older sister, the bratty, fast talking younger brother, the mopey middle child, the high school power couple and so on. Hughes would build a career from these - in fact he subscribes to these roles so much that he would later cast Hall in practically the exact same role a year later in Breakfast Club, as the brain, or, as he is constantly referred to here, the geek. The two would have the climatic scene in the car, where they realise they are more than their labels. Conventionally we expect that they will somehow end up together romantically after Jake is found to be less than the noble pretty boy; you know, the whole 'what you were looking for was right beneath your eyes' shtick. But Hughes doesn't fully commit to these expectations, but flips them around, winking slightly. The father is not stuffy or stuck up, and remarks that it is good that his son is being educated in the areas of female sexuality, albeit crudely. The whole film seems to conspire against Sam, with even the grandparents forgetting her birthday. She shows a sarcastic awareness: "They live for that sh*t!".So there is decent groundwork. Hughes sprinkles these little knowing touches, which are familiar and make sense; the sex quizzes that teenagers pass around, still all the rage these days, and in the way that two jocks can only hold an even slightly in-depth conversation whilst alternating on the pull-up bar. Even the geeks, the lowest of the low on the proverbial food chain, make crude sexual wagers amongst themselves. Sexuality for them is a strange, scary and curious thing, and Sam's laughter is a gentle mockery of sorts, transcending the boundaries of the screen. The audience too can giggle at how inexperienced they are, and how they are completely ruled by these expectations of them. But we also understand, and sympathise, which is what Hughes is known for. The secondary character, however, are a different story. The queen bee is predictable enough, a blonde bombshell that holds the star quarterback type in her claws and smiles sweetly to the rest of the world. But the mistake is to afford Jake the exact same personality. He knows nothing of Sam except for a little note she wrote in, and the phone-calls to her grandfather, whilst humorous, ultimately just confirm our suspicions that this power couple is exactly as they appear: shallow as a kiddy pool, in both characterisation and attitude. So no one cares when they break-up amicably. The worst of the film is easily the Asian exchange student, Long Duk Dong, whose every word is followed by a loud and distracting gong, and whose broken English, hideous haircut and lack of social etiquette immediately brands him as the designated punching bag. This is not only lazy stereotyping (yelling "Banzai" as he falls from a tree, the way he flits from Chinese to Japanese) but also Hughes contradicting his own mantra. Characters are more than their labels, except when you need to make vulgar, derogatory jokes. Dong is immediately shackled with another similar stereotype, the large, unattractive man-beast. The act is supposed to be eye-opening and subversive but only reinforces the respective stigmas. Even Hall, lowly as he is, barely gives neck- brace girl a second thought. There's something very mean-spirited about the whole thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Odd, Sometimes Awkward Combination of Sweet and Sour, With a Genuinely Hughes-Infused Beating Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part sweet-hearted teenage romance and part raunchy National Lampoon comedy, which makes sense as this film represents a transition for first-time director John Hughes. Fresh from a post at the Lampoon magazine, where he penned the seminal classic Vacation, Hughes was about to revolutionize teen-geared filmmaking with his deep understanding of emotional roller coasters and accurate portrayal of the high school social structure. What results is a spotty picture that experiences triumphant highs and... well, not lows per se, but a shocking disconnect with any shred of political correctness. Long Duk Dong is the worst of these offenses, of course, as a blush-inducingly ugly Asian stereotype, while a major plot point in the second act involves handing off a passed-out prom queen for not-so-subtly hinted sexual escapades. At the time this was made, I'm sure, these seemed perfectly acceptable choices for a teen comedy, but it's impossible to imagine most of it surviving the filters today. But if we can forgive all that (or maybe just move on from it), Sixteen Candles remains an intrinsically charming (and often laugh-out-loud funny) film. Molly Ringwald is responsible for a great deal of that, at her blushing, grounded best, while Anthony Michael Hall deserves a nod for his work as her suave-as-he-thinks-he-is wannabe suitor. And I'd completely forgotten about several baby-faced cameos from John and Joan Cusack throughout the story. It spirals out of control at points, especially during the expansive, scattershot school dance, but regroups nicely in time for a touching, classically Hughsian finale. Matched, of course, with the perfect scene-setting new wave tune.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Samantha Baker" (Molly Ringwald) is excited to turn 16 because she knows her family has something special planned for her. Unfortunately, because her older sister "Ginny" (Blanche Baker) is getting married the next day, everyone has totally forgotten all about Samantha. So as she heads off to school, instead of being happy she has become very depressed. Unfortunately, her day is about to get much, much worse because not only is she being pursued by the biggest geek in school (played by Anthony Michael Hall) but the senior she idolizes named "Jake Ryan" (Michael Schoeffling) doesn't even know she exists. At least that is what she thinks. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fairly good comedy which suffered unnecessarily from a few crude scenes here and there which, quite frankly, could have easily been left out. But I liked it overall due in large part to the excellent performances by the aforementioned Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. Likewise, having a gorgeous actress like Haviland Morris (as "Caroline Mulford") certainly didn't hurt in any way either. Be that as it may, while I wouldn't recommend it to a general audience, all things considered I rate this movie as slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ms like Sixteen Candles personify what the eighties was all about. And if you were a child of the 80s, you will probably identify with this film a lot more than the now younger generation. The story is simple enough, but it works so well. Molly Ringwald is particularly like able in this, and she is almost irreplaceable in her part. There are heaps of familiar faces, including small parts from many of the present day 'movie stars' i.e John Cusack, Joan Cusack and Jami Gertz. It's kind of doggy though, and when you tell people you watched it their response is usually "Oh My God. That is so OLD." But that's what I like about it. If you want to watch a film that reflects the eighties, forget the nostalgia trips of The Wedding Singer and Romy and Michelle. Hire a true eighties product, such as Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, St Elmo's Fire.... The list goes on and on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but not Hughes' best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the John Hughes films I've seen, this is probably the worst. It tries to have some slightly deep messages like Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Planes Trains and Automobiles, but kind of falls short. It was entertaining much of the time, but some of the more off color stuff like the gags involving Long Duk Dong failed to be amusing. As they go, John Hughes is great when it comes to making off color jokes that don't completely turn off certain audience members, but I guess he was still working on it at this point.The story centers around a character that deserves sympathy, but complains a lot about it. Not that she doesn't deserve to complain, but it just makes her a little less likable as a character. Certainly it's an accurate portrayal of sixteen year old girls with Sam's polarized emotions and evident insecurity about her appearance. In some ways, this makes Jake Dyer a less realistic character. I think the point of his character was to show that it's okay for teenage guys to have a heart. However, this results in the story becoming something like the inverse of the cliché where the loser guy ends up with the dream girl (examples include but are not limited to Spiderman, Transformers, Alladin). It's an unfortunate thing, but I do not see any real-life 18 year old's making the same decision that Jake does. I suppose this accounts for the presence of the Geek/Farmer Ted, who I'm sure more of the male presence in the audience relate to.The plot has more layers to it than the usual comedy, but is not at all hard to follow. What is a little surprising is how passive Samantha is in context of the plot. After all, she doesn't go to Jake's party, which is a pretty big part of the story. I can't think of one thing she does to motivate the eventual concluding scene. I suppose her one quality that makes her deserve the rewards of her suffering is her honesty. She's not that shy about her feelings for Jake, but never acts on them exactly.Despite some of its other flaws, it is consistently amusing with jokes surrounding the Geek, Samantha's dysfunctional family, Joan and John Cusaks' characters, and the general awkwardness of being in high school. It has a similar feel to Breakfast Club because of the actors, but the comedy is much more situational here, whereas it's more verbal in Breakfast Club. There are some classic lines in Sixteen Candles too, but not that many.If you like John Hughes or the Brat Pack, this should satisfy, though it's not his or their best. Don't let the PG rating fool you into thinking it's a family-friendly movie, especially if Ferris Bueller does not fit that standard either. By modern ratings, it would be a fairly high PG-13. Also I'll warn you that it does not take place over one day. I was expecting this and it kind of worsened the experience. Finally, I will add that the portrayal of Long Duk Dong could easily come off as offensive to the Chinese exchange student stereotype. But if none of that deters you, give it a shot. Overall Rating: 7.6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than "Pretty in Pink" but inferior to "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1984, "Sixteen Candles" stars Molly Ringwald as teen who must enduring her family forgetting her 16th birthday due to the activity surrounding the wedding of her beautiful older sister (Blanche Baker). Anthony Michael Hall plays a geek wanting to have sex with Ringwald's character, but settles for false evidence and the corresponding respect of his friends. Michael Schoeffling (who looks like a young Matt Dillon) plays the girl's romantic interest while Haviland Morris plays his hot girlfriend. John &amp; Joan Cusack have small roles.Unlike the okay-but-unremarkable "Pretty in Pink" (1986), "Sixteen Candles" is a fun and quirky teen dramedy. While not great like 1982's "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" or 1995's "Clueless," it's a solid high school coming-of-age drama/comedy from beginning to end. The movie was written &amp; directed by John Hughes, also known for the more popular "The Breakfast Club" (1985) and "Ferris Bueler's Day Off" (1986). I can tell Hughes wasn't a rocker because all his teen dramedies contain soundtracks consisting of bland new wave music as opposed to the awesome rock/metal soundtracks of "Fast Times" and 1993's "Dazed and Confused." The movie runs 93 minutes and was shot in suburbs north of Chicago.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An unrequited crush, your obnoxious grandparents are staying over, your sister's getting married, and your parents forgot your birthday. Could anything get worse? Sixteen Candles, released in 1984 and directed by John Hughes answers this question and proves that no matter how bad it gets, a happy ending is always possible. Samantha Baker, our heroine is a high school sophomore who happens to be having the worst week of her life. Jake Ryan, a senior, has every girl in the school's heart, including Sam's. Through trial and error accompanied by a foreign exchange student's wackiness, being stalked by a geeky freshman with a huge crush on her, and attending a school dance nervous and alone, Sam's attempts to woo Jake make for one of the most influential movies of the 1980s. The cinematography of Sixteen Candles is flawless. Soundtrack from timeless media makes its way into the picture. Perfect camera angles capture the emotion of the scene perfectly. Through twists and turns, the plot weaves itself into a classic love story. The need for acceptance is a primary theme in Sixteen Candles. Sam is unassertive about her appearance and place in society, Caroline flaunts her beauty out of insecurity, and the Geek feels a need to stand out. Many teens will find Sixteen Candles uplifting and relatable. An absolutely perfect movie by one of the best directors of the decade. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The prototype of the 80s teen comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not an exaggeration to say that John Hughes created the mold of the 80s teen comedy, and it all began with 'Sixteen Candles'. Starring his muse Molly Ringwald and a host of now familiar faces, it has many of the things we would come to take for granted in the genre during the 80s and beyond. It doesn't quite click on the same level as 'The Breakfast Club' or 'Pretty In Pink', lacking the dramatic elements that helped to set them apart, but it sails by on the breezy charm of its cast and lighthearted story.Looking back, many have made a note of some of the film's un-pc elements, but honestly I found them to be a bit over-exaggerated. The film is filled with stereotypes, but it's only the ones surrounding Long Duk Dong that we're sensitive to looking through 2016 lenses. There are a few other instances that don't pass the PC test, but honestly, the film doesn't have a hateful bone in its entire body.Though I rank it near the bottom of Hughes' golden age, I still give 'Sixteen Candles' more than a passing grade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After feeling forgotten by family and friends, a teenage girl finds love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Get ready for laughs, loves, and relatable teenage angst. John Hugh's Sixteen Candles tells the unforgettable story of Samantha's sixteenth birthday, which goes from bad to epically worse in just a few hours. Although this film is older, it still grabs the attention of the appropriate audience. Sixteen Candle's is a classic teen comedy that in numerous ways establishes many of this genre's conventions such as a teenage girl going through an awkward phase. Despite occasional flaws and gated attitudes towards race and sex, the film has a number of relatable situations and applicable messages.Molly Ringwald stars as Samantha, a sixteen year old girl with a classic crush on the senior jock played by Michael Schoeffling. Schoeffling's character, Jake is the dream boat of the movie. He is sweet, sensitive, and will steal the heart of every teenage girl in the audience. You also have the classic side character Ted, played by Anthony Michael Hall, the goofy, annoying school nerd who wants so desperately to be cool and ends up throwing the occasional wrench in Samantha's already bad day. This film contains both sharply observed moments and now-dated stereotypes.Sixteen Candles falls under both comedy and romantic films. It fulfills and challenges romantic comedies expectations. One way it challenges the genre is that Samantha isn't your typical pretty girl getting the guy she wants, nor does she transform from the nerdy girl to the pretty girl overnight. She has a unique look and eclectic style that she stays true to throughout the movie.Although this film is older, it still applies to our generation. While the storyline appears to be a little cliché, it is still very relatable and grabs the attention of a younger audience. The film is more realistic and rather inspiring as it teaches the audience that you don't have to change yourself in order to get the guy; Samantha doesn't change a single thing about herself and still prevails in the end.</fullReview>

Yes, most films made thirty years ago or further back in the river of time could never be made today- though I have to say it would be hilarious to see the uproar if they released a Bond film with 60s gender politics today- but this film especially sticks out. It got out with a PG rating. Think about that for a second. Pixar movies get PG ratings nowadays. Even if this film went uber-light on everything- which I can tell you it doesn't- it would earn a hard PG-13 on subject matter alone. I don't doubt that it would get an R if it were released today, and even then, some things would likely need to be changed.Now, whether it should be rated R is another matter all together (I don't think I need to argue that some things would need to be changed for a release today either way). If a film like Mockingjay Part 2, one of the tonally bleakest movies I have ever seen in my life, can get out with a PG-13, then a film that drops a slurs and gives a few shots of breasts should definitely not get an R. But I'm getting off-track, aren't I? This film is, at its core, about a sixteen-year-old girl named Sam. It is her birthday, but everyone has forgotten it, as her older sister is getting married. She sneaks off to a party and tries to get the popular boy she has a crush on to notice her. Following her around is a sleazy freshman who plays like he's about ten times bigger than he really is. Hijinks abound.I should really show this movie to a bunch of politically-motivated SJWs just to get a rise out of them. The thing that sticks out the most is how casually and pleasantly they throw around the idea of rape, but there are many more. I should write an article where I pretend to be so offended and list out all the 'terrible offenses' this film makes.Yes, I do agree that a lot of these things shouldn't be in a film like this today and were frankly shocking to see so callously tossed around. But I also say that anyone who cannot see this as a product of its time is missing out on a fine film.If anything, the moral dissonance makes the film more interesting. This is just my opinion, and you don't agree: so be it. But hear me out. Characters that are supposed to be near-entirely sympathetic become more gray, adding layer and texture to the film. It becomes a fundamentally more interesting film than it was back then, just like how every period of history is far more interesting after it's over.But then again, this film doesn't really need help to be interesting. Molly Ringwald as Sam (does it say something about how much I've watched The Breakfast Club that I want to keep writing 'Claire'?) delivers a well-rounded and interesting performance, and the rest of the cast makes sure not to let her down. Anthony Michael Hall is particularly energetic as the pervy freshman.What separates this film from its contemporaries and even from the other teen films of today is the weight it gives to the characters and subject matter. No, it does not slow down to an Oscary movie pace and slowly angst over all that's happening (for the better); and yes, the insensitive aspects of it do let the air out of that sentence, but there is no doubt that Hughes' gift for getting inside the mind of the teenager and pulling out some smart, thoughtful material is alive and well.People can say what people can say, but this film should be seen be everyone at least once. I don't think many other films represented the state of Americana in the eighties, both for better and for worse, as much as this one.And yes, unless you have a heart of stone, you will laugh at least a few times. Embrace this film and the blood, sweat, and tears put into it; I don't think there is any other way to view good art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You would feel sorry for Samantha!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been the craziest yet the loneliness film I've ever came across. It actually was really to do with loneliness because Sam's family was all over the place with planning the sisters wedding and herself feeling pretty much left out. I felt so sorry for her and the fact, it was unfair that her parents didn't remind her that the grandparents will be staying in her room. I would honestly be so cheesed off with them! Molly Ringwald was really good at playing a girl who wants the best for herself. At least this wasn't pathetic as the film "pretty as pink" she was in! I found this film kinda funny too, I loved near the end when the sister was pure drunk and on the wedding day. It really would lighten up your mood unexpectedly! Also I'm glad she ended up with Jake all along!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An odd mix of overearnest and bawdy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught up with this John Hughes movie after reading that it was a direct influence on his later Pretty In Pink, and also is more highly regarded.It's something of a surprise, given that the comedic elements here are broad and garish, and the emotional elements are really without payoff. This is the world of the 80s, where drink driving, taking advantage of drunk girls and racial stereotypes are all just everyday occurrences. (Of the latter I can't complain too much as Gedde Watanabe does seem to be genuinely enjoying himself, bless him).Having just rewatched Pretty In Pink (and rated it a perhaps overgenerous 8) I was astounded that it not only stands up as a guilty pleasure, but a genuinely decent movie. You may have small niggles, like Andrew McCarthy's eyes continually opening so wide it looks like he's having an aneurysm, or wondering how you ever thought Duckie was straight, but it's a well constructed film with emotional pay-offs.Sixteen Candles, in contrast, has only shallow thrills. There's no real reward with the relationship between Ringwald and Schoeffling as they don't even speak until the end of the movie, and their dialogue consists of trite lines like "Make a wish." "It already came true". Away from the stilted romance, and Anthony Michael Hall as unlikely friend/borderline sex pest, we get comedy sound effects to cement the overplayed comedy elements, such as a Chinese cymbal noise every time anyone talks about Long Duk Dong(!)This isn't a bad movie. In many ways, it's quite a good one. But it features two disparate elements that don't gel together all that well: while I can see how it went on to be vastly improved in the guise of Pretty In Pink, the other 50% of the movie went on to be Weird Science. Not that Weird Science is a terrible picture, but it's a diametrically opposed one, and this - complete with a topless scene and a blowjob reference - jars badly with the core subject matter.John Hughes was just in his early 30s when he made this, his sixth movie but the first he directed. The follow-up, The Breakfast Club, went for overreaching earnestness, and I received many a heated private message when I criticised it in a 2001 review. But fast-forward two years and you get the run of Pretty in Pink/Ferris Bueller's Day Off/Some Kind of Wonderful, three solid movies that deserve to be revisited. John Hughes was able to tap into teen concerns and was known as one of the masters of the coming of age movie... he just needed to come of age himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beginning of a golden age of teen movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Samantha Baker (Molly Ringwald) is turning 16 and nobody remembers. Everybody is busy dealing with her sister's wedding. Everybody is freakishly embarrassing. Her grandmother feels up her boobs. They bring a weird exchange student Long Duc Dong. (Let's face it. That was racist even at that time.) She's infatuated with the attractive Jake. There's a dance, a party, and all kinds of hijinx.This is the start of the golden age of John Hughes teen movies. It introduces the wonderful charms of Molly Ringwald. She would personify the girl next door type for that era. It would also introduce Anthony Michael Hall as part of the Brat Pack. It's also great to see the Cusack clan get a couple of roles.The comedy is broad and goofy. The best part is that it comes from a sense of good humor and a nice soft spot in his heart. It is a more innocent time in suburbia middle America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crushes Can Be Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Molly Ringwald's starring debut makes for one of the 1980s' most distinctive cinematic moments, as Samantha Baker, middle daughter in a family who struggles with a forgotten birthday and a boy she's crazy about who, she thinks, doesn't know she exists."You need four inches of bod and a great birthday," she tells herself, not knowing how great it could be.Before it can get great, however, Samantha will run a gauntlet that includes grandparents invading her bedroom (and feeling up her chest), an insulting brother, awkward stares at a teen dance, an embarrassing note winding up in the wrong hands, and a geek charging freshmen a dollar to see her underwear.Writer-director John Hughes launched his run of popular teen comedies with this high-energy charmer. Frankly, I found his later "Brat Pack" movies to be occasional fun done in by a mopey sense of teen entitlement, but "Sixteen Candles" shows how affecting a filmmaker he could be by focusing on the laughs and letting the drama and story take care of themselves.Hughes knew youth culture, and here plays up its kooky side for all it was worth. A senior party lays waste to the young hero's house. A bus ride turns into a geek-fest complete with a gazoo medley. "There must be more dignified modes of transportation," Samantha whines.Anthony Michael Hall is the film's main scene-stealer as Farmer Ted, a squeaky-voiced freshman with eyes for Samantha even as she does all she can short of a macing to ward him off. Watching Ted dance with himself at the big dance, telling off his gang, and ogling Samantha as "fully aged sophomore meat" is something that never gets tired for me. It's also funny to see John Cusack as one of Ted's hangers-on, saying lines like "to the max" and "take off" without a hot tub in sight. (Cusack's sister Joan has a largely wordless role as a girl wearing an ungainly night brace wherever she goes.)Over time I've begun to really enjoy Gedde Watanabe as Long Duk Dong, the Asian kid who is staying with Samantha's grandparents and thus becomes another guest at her house. That is, until he meets an big-breasted Amazon who makes him a better offer. Out of control, he's the same kind of walking id John Belushi played in "Animal House," swinging from doors and totaling Grandpa's car with careless glee. He's brought up a lot as a bad Hollywood stereotype, but he's really just another comic button Hughes keeps pushing in strategic moments, with Watanabe getting all and more out of lines like "Now I have a place to put my hand!" and "Au-to-mo-bile!"The whole film has a wonderful lived-in look, with backgrounds that are constantly alive and often funny in their own right. Yes, the characters are all pretty much stereotypes, but they are also vividly played and presented. The jokes are not all clever or well-thought-out, but they keep flowing so freely that it's easy to miss the weaker ones unless you listen for them. Samantha comes across as cold and surly much of the time, but Ringwald makes the part work with her charisma and her way of selling the comedy of her character's predicament. Especially when she finds out about her underwear.The biggest weakness of the film is it starts off rather slow, establishing its story and characters in broad strokes with zero subtlety. But as the film goes along, it becomes something surprising for a teen comedy, a funnier and more involving experience that finds room to probe some deeper emotions. For all the funny lines, my favorite is the advice of Samantha's father: "That's why they call them crushes. If they were easy, they'd call them something else."Crushes aren't easy, but watching this one is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stand-out film that stands the test of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps nobody understood the plight of the average teenager quite like John Hughes did. Afterall, there's a reason why films such as "Sixteen Candles" have sustained relevancy long after the careers of its stars have faded. Mainly, it's because the humor in it is universal and timeless, but also because even teenagers today can relate to its central character, her wacky family members and her sometimes trivial social short-comings.Molly Ringwald plays Samantha Baker, who is mortified to realize that nobody around her notices or acknowledges that it is her sixteenth birthday. Compounded by the fact that her crush, Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling), barely knows she exists and the fact that she can't shake lose a horny and over-enthusiastic nerd (Anthony Michael Hall), Sam just can't catch a break, and the film essentially chronicles a day in her shoes."Sixteen Candles" is far from just being a relic of the 80's or simple nostalgia. At its core, it's a film that appeals to almost everyone, young or old, and with each and every watch, never fails to earn a chuckle or two. It's not too over-the-top to be unrealistic, and it never loses its human touch. Whatever gender or generation you come from, it's sure to win you over time and time again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I too remember seeing this film in the movie theater with my dad and sister. The film is typical John Hughes fare. It's about a 16 year old girl played of course by Molly Ringwald. She does a superb job as the girl who is never really embraced in the high school life. She is rather treated more like an outcast than actually accepted. She is part of the crowd but not as popular as her sister Ginny played by Blanche Baker. She is lone and forgotten on her sixteenth birthday. Her family is too busy dealing with the wedding of her older sister, Ginny, and out of town relations crashing for the weekend. What a cast too, you have Carlin Glynn playing Mom Baker and Paul Dooley playing Dad Baker. Justin Henry plays her annoying younger brother, Mike. The in-laws are played by Billie Bird and Carole Cook. The laughs just roll in too. Liane Baker plays Sam's best friend. Anthony Michael Hall plays the Geek. Havilland Taylor plays the girl of every boy's dreams, and Michael Schoeffling plays the beautiful Jake. Anyway, the writing is pretty good, the cast is excellent, and the scenes are unforgettable. Also John Kapelos plays the hunky groom and Zelda Rubenstein plays the pianist. ALl in all, it's a great film with a happy, unrealistic ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Classic From John Hughes!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Hughes has yet again created a wonderous '80s flick for the world to enjoy. Samantha Baker (Molly Ringwald) has a crush on the most popular boy in school Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling), but he doesn't notice her. The only problem with that is the geekiest boy in school Ted (Anthony Michael Hall) has a crush on her. But with her sister getting married, her whole family has forgotten her "sweet sixteen". Could life get any worse? And it does. Sixteen Candles is a classic JH film with '80s stars Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall (they also collided in "The Breakfast Club" a year later). And her parents (Paul Dooley and Carlin Glynn), younger brother Mike (Justin Henry), and foreign-exchange-student (living with her grandparents) Long Duk Dong (Gedde Watanabe) getting drunk and destroying Grandpa's (Max Showalter) car. It's one movie that'll keep you laughing throughout.</fullReview>

From the subtle things like Long Duck Dong using a fork and spoon like chopsticks at dinner and Joan Cusack's facial expressions throughout the whole movie to the goofs like Jake's car being a stick at first then ending up a automatic after the wedding. Classic "Brat Pack". If you like the great casting in this movie (it was nominated for a casting award0 then you need to check out "The Breakfast Club" and "St. Elmo's Fire". These movies hit on every 80's kid's worries and dealings in life. I think that a lot of what is talked about is still very true today in High School. Thanks for the memories...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best John Hughes Movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked the Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day Off or Weird Science, Sixteen Candles is the movie you'll want to see next! It is everything you'd want in a teen movie--wait, scratch that, everything you'll want in a movie PERIOD. It's funny, interesting, has a great cast and, come on, it's from the 80's AND by John Hughes! You really can't beat that.The premise is simple enough. A teenage girl named Sam realizes, to her horror, that her family has completely forgotten her 16th birthday. To make things worse, her crush doesn't even know who she is and one of the geekiest boys in school, "Farmer Ted", has a immense crush on her. Although it might sound depressing, it isn't. The geeks and Long duk Dong, (The foreign exchange student) provide plenty of laughs and I don't know, maybe some of you former geeks out there will be able to relate. : ) There are no excuses for not seeing this movie. I swear, although I am too young to remember 1984, this movie is a trip back to a 1980's high school!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long Duck Dong Steals The Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sixteen Candles is a classic 1980s teen flick starring some of the usual suspects, Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. The premise is a great idea; amidst the confusion of her older sister's wedding, Ringwald's family completely forgets her 16th birthday.Along the way, Ringwald is embarrassed at a school dance and continually harassed by the lovable dork played by Hall.Perhaps the primary bright star of this film, however, is the absolutely hilarious Chinese exchange student Long Duck Dong, played by Gedde Watanabe. Long Duck Dong is the life of the party, making out with his "hot American girlfriend" while at the same time riding an exercise bike (unbelievable hilarious scene) and waking up drunk outside Ringwald's house on the day of the wedding.The movie is not Shakespeare. You are not going to get an epiphany watching it. You are not going to learn a damn thing. But, it is a cute romantic comedy with that 1980s flair that we all know and love. John Hughes directed. Rating 10 of 10 stars...it's a classic in this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real coming of age movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few teen movies that have been made were really about teenagers. I'm personally not too fond of the teen movie genre, but I've watched several of these movies in the past. If everyone agrees that John Hughes has produced some of the most accurate portrayals of teenage life, it's because there's a good reason to believe this. John Hughes has done several "silly" comedies such as "Weird science" or "Vacation". Even though these movies weren't intellectual films, they're true classics in my opinion. The same humor that was present in these films is present in "Sixteen Candles", but it's never overpowering like in some other teen films. Also, unlike most modern teen movies, it doesn't involve popular kids acting like idiots or trying to find a girl to sleep with, but this is irrelevant here.This movie is about Samantha Baker. Her family completely forgot her 16th birthday. This is also a day in her life. We learn what she goes through in high school and about her family life. It's very hard not to relate to Samantha because she has so many insecurities that teenagers have. She never comes off as a hero or as a phony character. This is what is so good about the movie. Her personality and her reaction to her surroundings are so genuine that it's hard to criticize. Farmer Ted, the geek, is another very real character in my opinion. I would definitely recommend it. *** Spoilers ahead! ***The only thing that personally bothered me was the ending since it wasn't very realistic. It was supposed to be a realistic movie after all.. I wasn't expecting Samantha to end up with Farmer Ted, and I'm not quite sure if an ending like this would have been better. However, it's possible that a girl like Samantha would end up with the popular boy even if it's a little unlikely. This is why I'm choosing not to let it ruin the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young just-turned-16 year old (Molly Ringwald) is madly in love with a high school senior (Michael Schoeffling)...unaware that he has his eye on her too. She's also being constantly annoyed by the Geek (Anthony Michael Hall) and has to deal with with her conceited, obnoxious older sisters wedding and her truly rotten kid brother (Justin Henry).Ringwald is just perfect in her role, Schoeffling is tall and handsome (but no actor--he appears uncomfortable all the time) and Hall is uproarious but I didn't really like the movie. There are some very funny lines and moments but they're overshadowed by some truly cruel jokes (the scene where her grandparents joke about her body--and her grandmother feels her up--is beyond belief), some very unfunny jokes, racist jokes (Long Duck Dong is NOT funny), and some very crude ones. There are good chunks of this movie that just don't work--they just lay there and get very dull.The only saving graces are Ringwald and (especially) Hall. He's hysterical as the Geek and gets laughs just by his body movements. Even during the serious scenes you can't take your eyes off him. Also there's a very funny sequence when he's talking to Schoeffling in a kitchen--it's all serious but you see him casually making martinis while talking! Also this film does show pretty accurately what it's like for a girl when she turns 16--I have two younger sisters so, believe me, I know! Paul Dooley is also very good--especially in a touching sequence where he has a heart to heart talk with Ringwald.So--it definitely has its moments but it's too cruel for my tastes. Also there's a surprising amount of profanity and even a brief topless scene for a PG movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I loathe the bus."I first remember seeing this film in a theatre and laughing so much my sides hurt. I also remember the great soundtrack, the true spriritedness of the characters, and feeling so happy afterwards. I admit I was surprised to see a PG rating since it was loaded with language and had some brief nudity, and was stunned to see boom mics showing up in many indoor shots (like the film The Four Seasons). But it was such an endearing film that I forgave all that, and thought it would be great when it would come out on home video.Something went wrong then....due to legalities, some songs on the soundtrack had to be dropped and replaced with other songs, or just silence (in one scene, the David Bowie song Young Americans is taken out and the scene is sans music). And one thing really perplexed me, and I have never ever seen any critics comment on this, the scene where Billie Bird kicks the drunken "Long Duk Dong" and calls him a scumbag is completely cut from the videocassette version!To confuse matters more, on television broadcasts, the score is the theatrical version, but the Billie Bird scene is still cut!Here's where things get a bit better: Now that Sixteen Candles is on DVD, the re-issued DVD (not the first batch) has the scene with Billie Bird kicking is back in! The music score and songs are restored and all the footage is back and intact. It's the widescreen version and matted right so the boom mics don't show this time.Now that all the technical points have been made, on to the story.... Well written, snappy pacing, and characters we love in all their weird ways, this is far superior to films like Fast Times At Ridgemont High or American Pie where the aim is to be as lurid and basically sexist as possible. Sixteen Candles handles issues in a heartfelt manner. There are moments of pure inspired comedy, like when Molly Ringwald's grandmother notices her breasts and says "they're so perky" and proceeds to reach for them, with a stinging music cue conveying Molly's horror of the incident.I hate to call this a "teen comedy" because it can be enjoyed by anyone, but it at least far surpasses any other "teen comedy" I've seen since. Alright, I'll go so far as to say this is a classic comedy. Aces!!</fullReview>

I had never seen a Molly Ringwald film, after all I'm only 20. But the girls were still incredibly shocked when I told them, they told me that they will not respect my movie opinions until I saw all the teen flicks from the 80's. We're talking crazy here people: Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink, The Breakfast Club, Say Anything, Weird Science, etc.So far now I have seen the major Molly Ringwald films. Pretty in Pink, The Breakfast Club, and Sixteen Candles. Sixteen Candles is a very cute film that came before the cliché 90's teen flicks. It's original and very funny. I think the reason why it's so popular, is because everyone can relate in some way to the characters. Molly, a shy ignored outcast, The Geek, well, he's a geek, the jock, he's expected to date and act a certain way. It goes on and on. I really enjoyed Sixteen Candles, well, I guess it's on the way to Say Anything! Wish me luck, y'all! :D 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is still popular, and it's easy to see why. It has lost none of its endearing comedy and heart-tugging sentiment.As a child of the late 80s and early 90s, this film was beyond entertaining. Molly Ringwald as Samantha Baker was so authentic, as a teen whose sixteenth birthday goes unnoticed as her somewhat chaotic family prepares for her older sister's wedding. A quartet of grandparents arrive, much to her chagrin ("I can't believe my grandmother actually felt me up!"), one set which brings a Korean exchange student in tow. On top of this, she easily has the most smart-mouthed, obnoxious little brother on the face of the earth (the superb Justin Henry), who delivers the best sarcastic one-liners, some sample lines: "Dad, I didn't hit her! I'd like to very much, and I probably will later, but you know my method! I don't hit her when you're just down the hall!" "Hey, birth defect!" and "I wouldn't go in there, if I were you! Grandpa Fred was in there for half and hour - it's totally polluted!"Then there's school, sweet school. The guy of her dreams, the hunky Jake Ryan (the gorgeous Michael Schoeffling)is the property of the prom queen Caroline (Havilland Morris), while Sam has to fend off the attention of resident geek, Farmer Ted (Anthony Michael Hall, brilliant), and show exchange student Dong around town. Some of the best scenes occur during the school dance, with Sam failing to get a dance with Jake, Farmer Ted attempting to make it with her (but they end up having an interesting conversation instead), Dong finding a girlfriend, and then it cuts to the seedy restaurant where Sam's parents (Paul Dooley and Carlinn Glinn) and sister Ginny (Blanche Baker) meet with her slightly sleazy fiancée Rudy (John Kapelos) and soon to be in-laws with the love theme from "The Godfather" playing in the background."Dong's here for five hours, and he's got somebody. I live here my whole life, and I'm like a disease!" Sam sulks for the rest of the evening, until her folks finally remember her birthday. More is going on - Dong's at a party at Caroline's house, where everything's getting pretty rowdy, and Jake tires of this endless cycle, and tries to call Sam, not knowing that her grandparents are sleeping in her bedroom (let's just say it's very interesting). After the prom queen passes out, and sub-humans have departed, Jake and Farmer Ted having a touchingly humorous heart-to-heart, with the classic Frank Sinatra tune, "Strangers In The Night" as a musical backdrop. There are some very funny revelations and situations that I wouldn't dream of giving away.All the actors excel in their roles, which seem tailor-made for them. Sam's dreams come true, something every teen girl dreams of - the boy you crush on, who seems unobtainable, miraculously notices you, and you're on cloud nine . . . . . . And I love Paul Dooley's speech to Sam after he remembers her birthday.John Hughes gets his target audience: he obviously hasn't forgot what it's like to experience teen angst, and he gives it the most humorous and charming touch! A winner!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My So-Called Life meets...Porky's?! Is this movie for girls or boys?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Funny, I saw this as a young kid and the only thing that made an impression on me was the beginning when Molly Ringwald's parents forget her birthday, and the final scene where she gets her happy ending. I must've blocked out everything inbetween because I didn't understand it at that age... Watching "Sixteen Candles" again as an adult, I was stunned by how racist, sexist and crass most of the movie is. How can it be so revered, I wonder? Crude sex-jokes, over-the-top humour, cringe-worthy Asian stereotypes... yikes. Most offensive is the scene where Molly's older-man crush hands his unconscious girlfriend over to The Geek and encourages him to have his way with her while she's passed out. What the hell? Is this movie actually condoning RAPE?! Unbelievable. And we're supposed to root for an innocent young girl to hook up with this creep?I know many teen comedies from the early '80s still had that '70s sensibility, and nudity/vulgarity was common. But I just didn't expect Porky's-style hijinks from John Hughes movies, which are often acclaimed for their realistic portrayal of teen life. This particular film seems to get many positive reviews for being groundbreaking in it's realism. But this ain't *my* version of reality.I dunno, maybe "Sixteen Candles" was, at the time, a step up from previous teen movies. Still, it's definitely my least favorite Hughes film, and I wouldn't recommend it to any impressionable youngsters out there who might pick up some very bad messages...if they have a better memory than I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now right off the bat, I've been noticing the directing style I've been seeing of the late John Hughes recently and it's very distinct and different. With his use of jump-cuts, sound choices, and angles, you can tell right away that it's a John Hughes movie. Some of the supporting characters in the movie are (at times) straight-up unlikable and a tad provocative, but thankfully the ones that are obnoxious and unlikable are not really in it that long. Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall do an okay job as well. I feel that their motives are kind-of clichéd and not really explored enough, but their still functional. So in conclusion, is it as good as The Breakfast Club? No, but I'm glad I saw it and I liked it enough that might even give it a few more viewings in the near future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent,Hilarious Classic Teen Comedy From John Hughes And One Of The Greatest Teen Films Ever Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sixteen Candles is an hilarious and funny Teen Comedy and one of the best Teen films of all-time. Filled with great direction,a wonderful cast,a well-written and funny screenplay,fantastic laughs and a memorable soundtrack,Sixteen Candles is Teen films and John Hughes at their best.Sixteen Candles tells the story of a teenage girl named Samantha Baker(Molly Ringwald)who is ready to celebrate her sixteenth birthday,but unfortunately for Samantha her family has forgotten her birthday which is the day before her older sister's wedding day. Now with the addition of dealing with a forgotten birthday,Samantha has to deal with liking her High School crush Jake Ryan(Michael Schoeffling)and the pestering of a smooth talking nerd Farmer Ted/The Geek which have hilarious results.Released in 1984,Sixteen Candles was the excellent hilarious and funny Teen classic that started it all,the first of six great Teen films from Teen movie master director John Hughes. By 1984 Teen films were being dominated(with a great deal)by two sub genres:Teen Sex Comedies and Slasher Films but John Hughes gave audiences an alternative with the film Sixteen Candles a Teen movie that is hilarious but has great heart and is a classic that holds up to this day. One of the main reasons Sixteen Candles is such a wonderful movie is because John Hughes takes the simple concepts of teenagers such as growing up,sweet sixteens,love and awkwardness and makes them funny and over the top but with some honesty and truth taking the Teen movie genre to a much higher level. The Comedy and Humor in SC is funny and wild whether it's the film's characters,the dialog or the slapstick Humor that happens throughout the movie and there are times when you watch SC that you bust out laughing at the situations that happen in the film and you are not sure if SC is set in the real world or in a surreal world where anything and everything can happen. I love the fact that SC takes place over the course of two days as we see not just Samantha dealing a forgotten birthday but other characters going through insane and funny situations that are driven by dialog and jokes that are very subtle and in the background. Teenage life in SC as well as other Hughes films is very stylized but realistic because the Teens in Hughes' films feel real and accurate and not cardboard cutouts but real flesh and blood even the hilarious and over the top world that SC is set in. John Hughes loved the world of teenagers and with SC Hughes was just warming up and setting us up for what was to come in his other Teen films. Samantha Baker is classic character in the annuals of Teen movies and is a character we can all relate to because like many male and female teenagers Samantha goes through the many things that adolescents face and experience:falling in love,growing up,feeling awkward and being sensitive. Samantha is a timeless character that could've existed in the past,present and future and will still be relevant and relate to teenagers. The screenplay by John Hughes is well-written and funny with Hughes giving the main and supporting characters hilarious and truly memorable dialog and with scenes that are fresh and exciting. Hughes was a master at giving Teenagers realistic dialog in his films and he does it with greatness here giving the Teen characters dialog that will make viewers laugh but also resonate with viewers. The ending of SC is classic and iconic and is one of the best endings in any Teen movie that will put a smile on many viewers faces because of it's beauty and power. A classic ending to a great film.The whole cast is amazing. Molly Ringwald is excellent as Samantha Baker,with Ringwald bring humor,depth and sympathy to the role. Michael Schoeffling is wonderful as Jake Ryan,Samantha's crush. Anthony Michael Hall is brilliant and hilarious as Farmer Ted/The Geek,,a Geek that likes Samantha and is a smooth talker. Gedde Watanabe is funny and memorable as Long Duk Dong,a foreign exchange student. Haviland Morris is fantastic and sexy as Caroline,Jake's popular girlfriend. Paul Dooley is great as Jim Baker,Samantha's understanding Father. Justin henry is wonderful and funny as Mike Baker,Samantha's younger brother. Edward Andrews(Howard Baker),Billie Bird(Dorothy Baker),Carole Cook(Grandma Helen)and Max Showalter(Grandpa Fred)are hilarious as Samantha's grandparents. Blanche Baker is great as Bride-To-Be Ginny Baker,Samantha's self-centered older sister. Liane Curtis(Randy),John Cusack(Bryce),Darren Harris(Cliff),Carlin Glynn(Brenda Baker)and John Kapelos(Rudy)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for appearances by Joan Cusack(Geek Girl#1),Jami Gertz(Robin),Brian Doyle-Murray(Reverand)and Zelda Rubinstein(Organist). The direction by John Hughes is excellent,with Hughes moving the camera and bringing style and energy to the film. Great job,John.The score by Ira Newborn is wonderful,memorable and lighthearted and matches the film's tone. A great score by Newborn. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs by The Thompson Twins(If You Were Here),The Stray Cats(Sixteen Candles),Billy Idol(Rebel Yell),David Bowie(Young Americans),Spandau Ballet(True),Oingo Boingo(Wild Sex In The Working Class),The Vapors(Turning Japanese),Frank Sanatra(New York,New York),AC/DC(Snowballed),Darlene Love(Today I Met The Boy I'm Gonna Mary),Wham!(Young Guns),Patti Smith(Gloria),Stevie Ray Vaughan(Lenny),Kajagoogoo(Kajagoogoo)and more. A fantastic soundtrack.In final word,if you love John Hughes,Comedies,Teen Films or Coming Of Age Films,I highly suggest you see Sixteen Candles,a funny and hilarious Teen classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot can be said about John Hughes's directorial debut, but subtle and sophisticated it isn't. Hughes employs every cliché and every stereotype in the teen-comedy rulebook to full effect, from the nerds with braces referencing Star Trek to the silly and out-of-touch foreigner to the masculine but sensitive jock falling in love with the unpopular, "plain" girl (played by Molly Ringwald, mind you), including some very un-PC gong sounds whenever said foreigner is on screen and even one blatant 'Gilligan's Island' cut, complete with sound effect. Hughes uses, in a completely straightforward way, the very same stereotypes and prototypes that he'll dissect and deconstruct only one year later in his second feature and his landmark work, The Breakfast Club, but for now there's no subtext and no substance.And yet, somehow, it all works. MollY Ringwald is charismatic enough to make her completely unbelievable character believable, and the film's pacing is near perfect and makes sure that you never stop to think about it for too long. And the humor, shallow and predictable though it is, is often pretty funny. Sixteen Candles also strikes a solid balance in its sexual humor, handling it pretty liberally and earnestly but not excessively like 'Porky's' and other such sex comedies. It's, on the whole, a comedy that still works, is still funny and pretty constantly entertaining. It's not a masterpiece, but that's more than could be said for the large majority of comedies I've seen since Hughes's time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny little film from John Hughes, who was basically the master of the teen dramedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I said in my review of "The Breakfast Club" that it was my favorite Brat Pack movie and I did not really like any of the others. Not sure if this is considered in that set of movies or not, it does feature two of its stars that appeared in some of those movies, maybe more, but I think of this one as more of a comedy separate for the most part from the Brat Pack mold. This one is also less drama and a whole heck of a lot of comedy. Which is why I like it. It is not as risqué as say "Fast Times at Ridgemount High", but I think it is almost as funny. Just nowhere near as sexy as that particular movie. The story is simple enough, a girl played very well by Molly Ringwald has just turned 16. She gets up expecting a fuss over her, but she does not have to worry about them making to big a deal over her sweet sixteen as none of her family remembers. How can her entire family forget you ask? Apparently, her sister is about to get married and the ensuing chaos of planning and in-laws and grandparents coming over makes everyone simply forget. Though I find this a tad unlikely I do not let this highly improbable amnesia deter from the overall enjoyment of the movie. For my money Anthony Michael Hall steals the show as kind of a king of nerds type guy. Out of all the people who belonged to the Brat Pack his resume is one of the more impressive. Molly does good too, but this is a role she did repetitively during the 80's. Not really a departure for her. So a funny movie with a bit of drama thrown in, just not as much as other John Hughes movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Molly Ringwald's sweet "Sixteen"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a die-hard fan of John Hughes (1950-2009), but I've always admired his work. Anyway, here are 16 great things about "Sixteen Candles," the teen-comedy hit of 1984:1) "Sixteen Candles" was the directorial debut of the late filmmaker John Hughes, and it's an exciting, funny, sweet, highly quotable, and ultimately touching portrait of a teenage girl's "sweet sixteenth" that is really anything but sweet.2) That girl is Samantha Baker (a then-16-year-old Molly Ringwald), and on the day of her 16th birthday, she encounters just about every single embarrassment imaginable.3) Nobody in her big, big fat suburban Chicago family seems to remember her birthday, because they're all more concerned with her older sister's wedding, which is the day after. So you can see why she's understandably upset throughout the rest of the film.4) To top things off, she's got a huge, huge crush on a hunky classmate named Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling), who doesn't even know that she's alive, or does he? Either way, he's about to call it quits with his current squeeze, a blonde bombshell who's more accustomed to partying and getting drunk than having anything to do with romantic relationships.5) To add insult to injury, Samantha is being stalked by The Geek (Anthony Michael Hall), a young wannabe-Lothario who also has the hots for her, and one of her greatest embarrassments throughout the entire picture is at his hands. By the end of the night, however, he ends up getting what he wants - try to guess who (he does make a shocking discovery about who does seem right for him).6) "Sixteen Candles" is a remarkable coming-of-age teen-comedy. It's not perfect, but nonetheless it's a promising debut for Hughes, who probably redefined the era of teen films during the '80s.7) The movie isn't just about Samantha and her huge, huge crush. The film does appear to be almost episodic in nature, alternating between Samantha &amp; Jake, and The Geek &amp; Samantha, and a few other minor characters.8) Molly Ringwald was pretty much born to play this part and this is probably what got her career started and helped to define her image as the "teen queen" of the '80s. One of Hughes's greatest talents was casting about actors and actresses who looked the age of their part, and casting a then-16-year-old Molly Ringwald in the lead role of his film was one of the smartest casting choice Hughes could have ever made in his remarkably short career.9) Hughes would continue to redefine teen films with his next feature "The Breakfast Club" a year later in 1985, my personal favorite film of his. That film also featured Ringwald as the stereotypical high school "princess."10) I'm a guy. There aren't many female characters that I can personally relate to on film, but Samantha Baker was one character I personally identified with. I guess it was the whole thing about not being recognized on your birthday, feeling like nobody cares about you and you've been forgotten, and pining for the heart of someone that perhaps you know that deep down you can't have. I also felt somewhat of a connection to The Geek as well; I was The Geek in high school, but I wasn't a wannabe-ladies man, like Anthony Michael Hall's character was here. That's too bad, even though I did like his character and he got some of the funniest lines. I was his character in "The Breakfast Club" - the brain, plus a little bit of the rebel and the loner/weirdo. Try that on for size...11) But I guess that last part (about Samantha Baker, not The Geek) is negated by the fact that the guy, Jake Ryan, is interested in her the same way that she is interested in him. (I'm sure we've all been there before.)12) Even if the movie is a little rough around the edges - say, I don't know, the uncomfortable Asian stereotype of Long Duk Dong (Gedde Watanabe), which is perhaps an intentional swipe by the filmmakers at Hollywood racial stereotypes or not, I don't know - the enduring sweetness and identifiably real performance of Molly Ringwald in her star-making lead role at such a young age definitely makes this film a winner in my eyes.13) I'm really not sure how and why John Hughes just seemed to fade away from the Hollywood limelight at the end of the 1980s, but nonetheless his films have an enduring and lost-lasting appeal, sometimes 24, 25, years after the fact. He was able to cast top-of-the-line talent in most of his films; here, there's a small early role from John Cusack as one of The Geek's buddies, Bryce. As well, Cusack's sister Joan also appears in a small role as a fellow geek.14) We were all saddened by Hughes's passing last year, which incredibly enough was this film's 25th anniversary, and this year marks the 25th anniversary of "The Breakfast Club."15) "Sixteen Candles" is a great and funny debut from John Hughes. It showed great promise for a career that for some reason never really panned out the way that it should have. (Ironically, according to some sources, Hollywood is to blame for that.) Many feel that teen films have become incredibly typical and without Hughes's unique insight into the minds and lives of teenagers, the genre seems lost and nobody seems willing to give teens dignity, respect, and humanity anymore. He will be dearly missed.16) "Sixteen Candles" - 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few hilarious scenes make up for the uneven story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not that you should expect an artistic masterpiece when watching a John Hughes film, but you can expect to hear some very quotable dialog as well as themes involving high school drama, crushes and trying to be cool. With this simple-minded story about a girl turning sixteen, Hughes creates a reality that is not reality but seems like it to some teenagers, perhaps even today. Molly Ringwald established herself as a teen star of the 80s with this role as Samantha Baker, who dreams of having the best sweet sixteen birthday. Of course, nothing goes right with her family forgetting and the love of her high school life seemingly ignoring her. The kicker is the school geek is relentlessly hitting on her and she seems to have lost any decency in the high school society.John Hughes always made films that had a distinct audience following, so it isn't a stretch for some people not to like this movie. Nevertheless, if you have been in high school not too long before like I have, you still can remember some of things he discusses here and relate to these characters. And there are some wild characters here, not including a foreign student named Long Duck Dong, the beautiful senior Caroline, and of course, the Geek Ted. The acting is very good with Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall perfectly capturing the feeling of angst and hopelessness we all get when we are pressured into being a certain way. There are some major flaws here, including the subplot with the foreign student, as well as the portrayal of the family Sam's sister is marrying into. Nevertheless, Hall makes up for it with his hilarious turn as the Geek who is cool to his associates but he knows differently. And on top is Ringwald, sweet, pretty and totally in control of her character. Certainly one of Hughes' best works, it is still considered a classic of the 1980's teen genre and established what would become Hughes' next film and perhaps masterpiece: The Breakfast Club.</fullReview>

So Samantha goes to school and goes to the dance and deals with it. She is also trying the get the attention of Jake Ryan, her crush. The nerd in the movie is awesome too. There are two scenes near the end that I liked. I liked the part where Long Duck Dong was drunk in the grass and grandpa asked where the automobile was. Automobile?

		<shortDescription>Hughes got it right the first time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Hughes' first film is one of his best, and it holds up quite well almost a quarter-century later.Molly Ringwald plays Samantha, who is both naive and jaded as her 16th birthday comes and goes without any recognition from her family. The supporting cast is excellent, particularly Anthony Michael Hall as the geek who loves her and Justin Henry as the hunk she loves. Too bad none of them had the careers they deserved. It's also a treat to look back at John and Joan Cusack and Jami Gertz early in their careers.While some may find "Sixteen Candles" needless course in some regards and politically correct in others, it's a film that perceptively captures the angst and aspirations of teendom during the more innocent, more horny era of the mid-'80s. The film also contains some of the finest music of the time, including tunes from Nick Heyward, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Tim Finn, Oingo Boingo, Spandau Ballet and the Thompson Twins.A good one for the time capsule, "Sixteen Candles" could never be made today and should never be remade.</fullReview>

But, apparently, the movies understand us."Sixteen Candels" is a gorgeous teenager comedy, classic of the 80's too. Tell us the story of a girl who loves a boy, but she doesn't know how go to him. She has good friends, a drunk sister, and lovely family (even so forget her birthday). I think this is a good comedy. And i talk about good comedy of teenagers, because now, seems to me the teenagers films are not so funny, are more unpleasant. For laugh we can see crazy things. But, for example, "Teen Movie" and that horrible scene of the class and the bathroom. Come on, we can see movies more decent.And that thing has "Sixteen Candels" and other good comedies from the 80's. Are funny, unhinged and comfortable. If you want great and rare parties and drunk brides ... watch "Sixteen Candels".

It's a good teen party movie. Great cast including the two 80's brat pack members,amazing writing, funniest story line. It's one of those 80's hits you never grow tired of.

		<fullReview>John Hughes has a way of writing very intelligent teen films. In my Opioion he created the genre and has done the best compared to the films that have been recently released that try to hard to be what his films were. Sixteen Candles in my opinion is pure perfection. Molly Ringwald is so wonderful as this girl coming into herself who just wants to be noticed. I'm still in love with her, after all these years. I wish she would have taken Pretty Woman and Ghost, she would still be around, but any who. John Hghes cat perfectly every time and especially here with the casing of the geek and Jake Ryan. now I'm a guy buy Jake Ryan is dreamy(he he), and the guy is not bad looking at all. If i was chick i would be answering on my questionnaire him as who i would do it with(he he again), and i cant say enough for Anthony Micheal Hall, who is just perfect. now i promise I'm not one of those fake John Huges fans, i truly enjoy his films all of them. He writes his films with such intelligence and they are still so funny. My favorite thing in the whole movie is when the bus is riding down the street and the band is playing the instruments. Every time i see it it kills me. It is the little things that count in John Hughes movies, and i really hope he brings back some more movies because i miss you john and your films that make you feel good inside(ya ya i said it). His films bring such a great feeling with them, and i love them and will never get sick of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! I was up late watching late night TV when this movie came on, it looked OK, and all the other channels had infomercials, so i decided to watch it... i started watching it from where the main character Sam drops her note behind her in class and her crush Jake picks it up... i thought the movie was so so so funny, and although it's a older movie, it really appealed to me. They are some real funny and shocking moments where there's an Asian exchange who gets drunk, and where Jake lets his girlfriend go home with another boy in his dad's Royal's Royce! I can't believe this movie was made before i was even born haha!! But still so hip, i didn't even think that this movie was made in the 1980's! Did any of you notice brother and sister John and Joan Cusack in the film, both as geeks haha? John looks to young handsome in this film! It's great how it all fits together in the end, everyone's happy! And the girl bags her man in the end! Such a sweet story, they should have named the movie Sweet Sixteen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So many clichés, so little time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love teen films but I've always thought this one highly over-rated. And just why was Molly Ringwald so coveted? I really think her acting extremely wooden and could the lusted after boy look anymore carved out of cream cheese if he tried? 'Breakfast Club' beats this film hands down and I even rate 'Pretty in Pink' marginally above this. Ducky is a far funnier character then Anthony Michael Halls' geek - although I think he's perfect in 'Breakfast.' It's still entertaining and is definitely up there in the creation of what makes a teen genre film - so many clichés, so little time! But if you want to sample John Hughes work don't make this your first port of call - you may be put off looking at his other work. One thing you are guaranteed of is a feel good factor - Hughes is a sucker for this. So all in all, it's a laugh but like most teen films it's not to be taken seriously - and it is not up there as the best in the genre. But you should give it a look eventually if you like the teen scene because it does have the kind of stereotyped teen Americana that makes you smile at the reckless, unrealistic, commercialism of it all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Movie Factoids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From "Backstory" on AMC: Director John Hughes was impressed by Anthony Michael Hall in National Lampoon's Vacation and cast him over a young Jim Carrey who also tried for the part. Hall was shy in person, but when they put a camera in front of him they were surprised at his outgoing talents. The guy who played Molly's father compared him to a young Woody Allen. Gedde Watanabe came straight into casting speaking like a Korean Exchange student in which he did an impersonation of his Korean friend. Everyone thought he was really foreign until he revealed himself later as a perfect English speaking Asian American. Pay close attention to that table scene where everyone was looking at Watanabe and laughing. Before they filmed the scene, Hughes had told Watanabe to stuff grapes in his nose while they filmed the reactions of the family so he could get their actual reactions. You'll notice as they cut to Molly during the scene that she laughs but kind of cringes and looks surprised. In another scene Watanabe was lying on the grass and laughing hysterically at the family but was running out of laughter and had a hard time keeping it going, so Hughes tickled his feet off camera to get him to continue laughing as the cameras kept rolling. Molly's little brother also played the kid in Kramer vs Kramer. Molly became a huge cultural icon for young girls after this movie came out and her career took off.An 80's classic, when the DVD goes on sale I plan on purchasing it. You may also want to do this as the basic cable versions are sliced up by Mormons with a ginzu.</fullReview>

However while I moderately liked it and understand why it was a classic I wouldn't put it in the "top 5" of teen movies ever-though its up there for many. In fact though many, if not most, will widely disagree with me I liked pretty in pink a wee bit better. Still I have nothing negative to say about sixteen candles. The reason its not in my top 5 is because a few scenes and characters were just to obnoxious. My favorite teen movies include "Fast times","breakfast club", "some kind of wonderful" and "clerks" to name a few. But I still think as far as warm sentimental unoffensive teen comedies go sixteen candles is right up there. The movie's a 6.5 for me in terms of deep enjoyment but a 10 of 10 for sweetness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie will forever and always be considered one of the all-time greatest teen classics in American movie history. It's sweet, naiveté captures a quiescence of youth and its ability to make you feel something for each and every one of the characters.First let's begin with the best looking geek of all time. Farmer Ted. Yes, it's true, my heart belongs to A.M.H., and let it be said, that if I had the choice between Ted and Jake, no contest, it would be "The Geek". Farmer Ted, who is loosely based on the writer of the film, is so sweet and well let's face it, horny, that you just want to squeeze him! The struggles he goes through just to get with Molly R. makes you feel sorry for him, and at the same time, once you put yourself in Molly's shoes, you wanna just slap him. Secondly, the biggest heartache on the planet, Samantha Baker. The girl who's sixteenth birthday has been neglected by her whole family on account of her sister getting married that weekend. Not only has her birthday been forgotten, but the guy she's in love with is dating the most popular girl in school, and Sam thinks he doesn't know she exists. "The Geek" wants Sam, and Sam wants Jake. The cutest boy in school. Little does she know, Jake does know she exists...If you haven't seen this movie, you are crazy, and you need to go rent it right now. No, wait, you actually need to go buy this movie right now, A.S.A.P.! Pronto!!! It's a funny flick, and it's not just for girls, guys! A definite 10 out of 10. Enjoy!!End of review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has gotta be one of the best "teenage films" ever. It still holds up well, despite the tragic corniness of 1980s society it was set in, partly because it shows, realistically, how lonely &amp; left out most teenagers feel some of the time. You really get to love the characters. Especially the brother...that little bugger really cracks me up. I've heard this film stereotyped as a "chick flick" but, even if you are a guy, you'll probably enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a total riot. All players in this are excellent. I can watch this over and over and still laugh at every punchline.Another perfect example of teens in the early 80s. Molly Ringwald is super in it. I can not imagine anyone else playing "Sam". Anthony Michael Hall plays the ultra-geek in this flick and he is so funny.When hes dancing alone at the dance is classic! Also , the original soundtrack to this is super if you like New Wave 80s pop music , this flick sure has it all! Hard to believe this movie has a PG rating because it seems a little racy for its time and even for today. What age group should watch this? Any how , this movie rocks , Hands Down!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beyond the shadow of a doubt this movie was kind of perfect......I mean there were very unfunny , very unhumerous parts in the plot, but it wasnt allllllllll supposed to be hilarious in every part, I do think though, this movie was inspiration to a lot of slapstick farce's like most of the farelly brothers movies and others...the thing though in this movie was it was a little far fetched and realistic about it. I mean long duck dong's character I believe is the best part of the movie....he was the essential character that had me in stitches and there are people out there like that, that's the part of the realism in the movie. It was eighties too and a lot of teen eighties movies back then was so horrible I think their in a special vault somewhere and moved to Egypt and they buried it 10,000 feet underground. I remember watching USA up all night with Rhonda Shears and Gilbert Godfrey and revisiting all those low budget slop, and to be honest I watched USA up all night nearly every friday and saturday night half for Gilbert, half for Rhonda and another , partial half for the movies....I mean I was only a kid in the eighties and in the early nineties of that show I was a teenager and just doing a little of my own navigating checking those movies out...they were drastically horrifying but it was a pleasant atmosphere....it's hard to explain, kinda like watching Saved By The Bell, even though it was cheesy it kept my eyes glued! Movie magic I suppose?Bottom line I wont ever forget this movie, I'm not going to give anything out of this movie because its too good to give one scene away. You just have to watch it and if you dont think its funny your at least going to grasp other concepts of it like Molly Ringwald's character especially....her parents forgetting her birthday, sure, that happens everyday in america and every other country, if you live in a busy household and especially if your sister is getting married. So the plot didnt really have any holes which I could see but I know too there were parts in the movie that tried to get a laugh and didnt, I just thought of them too revoking to laugh at...or serious to laugh at. But only being six when this came out I do remember it vaguely and after seeing it for the first time complete I loved it and I love it now, it's a movie that wont end up in Egypt, that's for sure and it's a movie that will keep on inspiring and delighting!!! And for the most part this movie didnt define a new generation or anything because the generation was already in progress while the camera's were rolling but I do think in a humbled opinion lol, is that if the film was made in 1979 it would've defined a generation or it might of flopped even too....who knows? Who cares? The movie ya, 4/5!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Molly Ringwald is very convincing as Sam, the recently turned 16 year old who her parents have forgotten her birthday. Anthony Michael Hall is also pretty funny as Farmer Ted (The Geek). Long Duk Dong had his moments, but he wasn't that funny (sometimes the jokes were just racist). I was fortunate to have seen this film 4 days after I turned 16 and I can easily identify with some of the issues Sam goes through, even though our situations are different, like I'm a boy and in the year 2003.*SPOILER!*Even though I found the ending corny and unrealistic (even the concept of Jake falling in love with Sam overnight is unrealistic), this is one of those 80s films that makes me think "I should've been a teenager in the 80s." In two words: Good Fun. Rating:4/5</fullReview>

I have to admit I liked it much better than Pretty In Pink(another one of Molly's movies). The geek played by Anthony Micheal Hall is very funny. He knew his part well. And Jake Ryan.... he is sooo dreamy (even though now he's probably like 50 years old). Samantha's life sounds like a normal teenage life unlike Crossroads or any Mary-Kate and Ashley film. The only thing I would change is.... NOTHING! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The teen movie to end all teen movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a devoted contingent of people around my age (30) forwhom Sixteen Candles is and always will be the greatest movie ofall time. I am one of them.I cop to the fact that it could be due to the "teenager effect": themovies you saw around 13 will always be your favorites. But I thinkit's more than that. Clearly John Hughes was, in 1982, an insanelytalented writer at the top of his game. He went on to write teenclassics The Breakfast Club and Ferris Beuhler in quicksuccession after this. Sixteen Candles was not his first script(Vacation, another comedy classic, preceded this) but it was hisdirectorial debut, and he's firing on all cylinders.I love the way that Hughes gives such respect to his teen subjects. He realizes that things DO matter more when you're a teenager,because you're experiencing it all for the first time.The second incredible thing about this movie is Anthony MichaelHall's performance as the geek. I challenge you to find anotherperformance by a teenager that is funnier, anytime, anywhere. Heis simply incredible. I think he deserved an oscar nomination for itand people think it's crazy but I stick by that.Hughes' sense of humor is appropriately juvenile at times, and hisuse of sound effects can seem a little bush-league. Of course, theracist caricature of Long Duck Dong is a blight on the movie (thenagain, most of the characters are drawn in broad strokes, butwhen it comes to race there are different rules of conduct).I've seen this movie about 50 times. And it still cracks me up. Icould list my favorite quotes... but there isn't room.Happy viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** As a veteran of the 80's I can honestly say I love this film, still, after all these years. For those of us that are thirtysomething this will bring back the days of that ole teenage angst, and in a place where we can laugh about it. This film was excruciatingly funny when it was released, and it is nice to see that it holds up over time. I think it is fair to say that any teenage girl today can relate to Samantha's situation in life. What girl among us has never been so in love with the "guy"...the man..you know..the Senior who doesn't know you exist? So what that it is campy and the humor sometimes falls flat (think the scenes with her parents. Get real. Noone had parents like that). All that matters in this film is you can laugh and enjoy it, and when the end comes, you find yourself smiling like crazy when Samantha gets her wish. Molly truly puts in a good performance here when you compare her other films, Anthony Michael Hall is perfect. Michael Schoeffling is the epitome of ideal (hard to believe he hasn't made a film in 11 years and is now living in the NorthEast somewhere making custom wood furniture). If you are looking for a film of dramatic substance and social importance, don't choose this one. It isn't about that and wasn't geared for such high expectations. It is a sweet romp thru nostalgia (for my generation) and is meant to be laughed at and laughed with. Definitely a keeper!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I watch this movie, I can't help but become overwhelmed with emotion. I usually either cry because I'm so happy for Samantha, or because it gives me hope that one day the guy I'm in love with will give me a chance to be his. 'Sixteen Candles' is one of the few movies I've seen that I can actually relate to. The similarities between Samantha and I are uncanny. Our personalities are very similar, our behavior, our families, etc. I just wish my situation could turn out as good as hers did. Oh well. A girl can dream, right?I've noticed that whenever I watch an 80's teen-movie, I get a euphoric feeling. It's like, "Why couldn't I have been a teenager in the 80's?". Things back then we're so incredibly fun. The music was amazing back then. And of course, so were the movies! Now, down to the review of this movie. I can't think of one thing I didn't like about it. Not one. The dialogue was hilarious (keep an eye out for Anthony Michael Hall and Justin Henry), the soundtrack was great, the story was so incredibly sweet, and the ending was almost too good to be true. At least for me. The last few lines are what make me cry. Molly's performance is so good. I really do start to believe she is Samantha. And she has great taste, hahah! Michael Schoeffling is a hottie. He's also great as Jake. I just wish more guys were as nice as he is (in the movie). Guys like him these days are one in a million. If you're a girl like me who's currently in love with a guy who barely knows you name (luckily, that's not the case with me), this movie gives you hope and just maybe the courage to go after the guy of your dreams. Oh, and one last thing.. The PG-rating confused me. There is partial nudity and quite a few swear words now and then. Nothing too excess, though.Rating: ****/**** stars (flawless)</fullReview>

Who's never been the wallflower? And, perhaps most importantly, who can honestly say they've never felt out of place and alone?No one.For that one reason, anyone can feel for Sam, our heroine who sees happiness as such a distant place, or "Farmer Ted" (^_~), the victim of misplaced affections and braces...and even Jake, stuck in a the rut of conformity.We've all been there...all of us. Everyone gets jealous, everyone longs for something, and everyone thinks the grass is greener on the other side.Sure, maybe not everyone has a flaky, self-centered older sister, or has had their panties on display in the boy's bathroom, but beyond it all, the common moral remains.See it, if you haven't.Thank me later. ^_~</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie. I'd forgotten how funny it was until I bought the DVD on a whim and saw it for the first time in years in an uncut form. This is John Hughes' masterpiece, a farce about a teenage girl's day from you-know-where and a geek's quest for manhood, framed by wild, raunchy, over-the-top cultural touchstones any 80's high school student will recognize immediately. Much funnier than PRETTY IN PINK, much less pretentious than THE BREAKFAST CLUB, and much cooler than FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF. Stick this movie in a time capsule; no other film captures the essence of all things 80's quite like it.</fullReview>

I think the John Hughes 80's teen movies are the best and basically defined a generation. If we weren't like the people in this movie, we tried to become them after we saw it. A lot of people were influenced by this and the other films, many new young directors credit John Hughes and you can see the Hughes influence in many current teen movies. I just wish they would include deleted scenes on the darned DVD version, what I wouldn't pay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute Best Movie of the 1980's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I admit it...I loved and I miss the 80's! Graduating from high school in 1985 and college in 1989 makes me a TRUE child of the 80's, and this film epitomizes the humor, the look and the feel of that marvelous decade. I've seen it probably HUNDREDS of times, and each time I laugh at ALL the key moments - "I dabble a little bit in personal loans and politics.." "I don't suppose it makes any difference to you, but there's a very weird Chinese guy in Mike's room", "Unbelievable. You make someone a bridesmaid, and they s*** all over you", "Now you listen to me mister....", and so on and so on and so on. SC just takes me back to a simple and happy time and it is one of my all time favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"16 Candles," my humble opinion, is one of the funniest movies ever. People of all ages enjoy it. I bought a copy for my grandmother for her 71st birthday! (She used to borrow my tape all the time to watch it with her friends...) My mom (50) loves it. My cousin (12) loves it. It's a fun film to watch when you just feel like a laugh. My sister and I have practically memorized all the dialogue, and it often pops up in our conversations. I guess everyone who's ever felt inadequate (and who hasn't?)can relate to Molly Ringwald's character, Sam. If you haven't seen it, you should give it a try. It is VERY 1984, but the 80s are in again, aren't they?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Funniest Tragedy I've Ever Watched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot count how many times I have watched this film (I think it must be 30 or 40). It is the typical John Hughes suburban teenage comedy and out of all of them this is probably the best. It plays off of every teenager's biggest nightmare - What if my parents forget my 16th birthday? - and moves from there. It also follows Samantha's, played wonderfully by Molly Ringwald attempts to win the affections of the school's most popular upperclassman Jake Ryan while simultaneously avoiding the advances of the school's coolest nerd (Anthony Michael Hall at his finest). There are terrific comedic performances throughout this movie (most notably, Gedde Watanabe as Long duk Dong). Ringwald is very appealing and shows the proper amount of angst, but it is Anthony Michael Hall who really steals this show. A good film that doesn't disappoint and can be viewed more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see for anyone who grew up in the 80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sixteen Candles is one of those brat pack movies that anyone who grew up during the 80s should see at least once. Molly Ringwald touches hearts as the downtrodden poor girl with enough self-respect to keep herself from falling for fools, but then she foolishly falls in love with a rich boy. Their first date is hilarious, and the scene in the gym with her friend is hilarious. I've seen this movie at least ten times, and I still cry at the end. It's a chick flick in many ways, but in the standard 80s fashion there are enough viewpoints from the male perspective that males can enjoy this movie and identify with the leading men as much as females can identify with Molly's character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, I admit it, I love '80s movies. Molly Ringwald gives her 2nd best performance in this movie (1st being The Breakfast Club). She plays the perfect drama queen. Now I am not a big fan of Anthony Michael Hall's other movies (who can forget Johnny Be Good and Weird Science) but this one is an exception. Sixteen Candles most memorable character is Long Duk Dong. The foreign exchange student loves his new girlfriend so he can "have a place to put his hands." I recommend this movies for teenagers who are going through that "gothic" stage and feel like watching an '80s movie. I give this 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this June is my graduation date, being born in the 80's gives me a sense of cinematic heritage to be proud of: Sixteen Candles holding one of the top honors. Along with Fast Times at Ridgemont High(1982), Ferris Bueller's Day Off(1986), and John Hughes' other teen-comedy The Breakfast Club(1985), Sixteen Candles is the most endearing comedy of that decade. Molly Ringwald was our favorite teen sensation and Anthony Michael Hall proved to fit well as the love-crazed Freshman. It's a very fun movie that characterizes teen life perfectly from the family dinner to the dance scene to the parents-are-away-time-to-party scene. It's a good twist, instead of guy chases girl, the younger sophmore yearns for the senior who is already endowed with a blonde bombshell. He finds a certain keen interest in her after he learns that she likes him(as guys tend to do) and fate starts to pull things together. John Hughes wrote this movie with an all too real teen touch and the warm-heartedness that made audiences applaud it for so many years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of my favorite teen movies when I was a kid, meaning, before I was even a teen. I remember watching this, along with Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller, and thinking it was clearly the best of the three due to it's wacky humor that never felt so absurd that it took you out of the movie.Cut to years later, watching this as a 26 year old. Wow, while it still stirs up some of my nostalgic emotions it also stirs up a lot of disgust.First, the racism. I always thought, as a kid, that the Long Duk Dong character seemed like an offensive caricature but as an adult I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt. I don't believe the character himself is offensive, it's more the way the character is presented. For example, a gong rings almost every time the character's name is said out loud. And the music that plays when his character is on screen is also stereotypical. As for the character himself, he seems like a nerd but is actually the life of the party, which isn't very stereotypical at all. Still, it's a shame they had to stoop to cheap sound racist sound effect jokes.Next, the gender issues. Ted the nerd sexually harasses Molly Ringwald throughout the entire movie, we're meant to think this is funny but really it's just kind of infuriating. Next, her romantic interest Jake says he could violate his drunk, passed out, girlfriend 100 different ways if he wanted to. Ted says something along the lines of "what are you waiting for?". WOAH, is Ted, this character that we're supposed to laugh along and sympathize with really condoning that Jake rape his passed out girlfriend? To make things worse, Jake offers his passed out girlfriend to Ted if Ted will help him pursue Molly Ringwald. So now Jake and Ted are using the rape of another character as a means of bargaining. It's insane to that this part of the script was ever greenlit. The whole thing is very gross and creepy but it doesn't ever feel like the intent is to say "look how creepy and awful these guys are" instead, we're just supposed to laugh along with them, which is pretty disgusting.I know what you're probably thinking, if I'm so offended by it then why did I still give it a 6/10. Well, when it comes down to it there is still a lot of content here that is relatable when you are a teenager and there is still quite a bit of comedic gold. It would be wrong to say that the movie is without it's merit so a 6/10 it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That most difficult poignant age, I loved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How could everyone in your family forget your birthday. They couldn't. But remember this is just a movie. It follows the trials and tribulations of just turned sixteen, (and no one else knows it) pretty gal, Ringwald. She's truly down in the dumps. She has a big crush on a Matt Dillon type stud, who's dating one of the finest girls in school, and we get to partially see her goodies too, rare for a PG film, where the F word is dropped once or twice. Apart from being constantly taunted by her younger brother, (Justin Henry, clearly a seasoned professional), she's felt up by her gramps, she's boarding a bus daily with eye ogling dorks, and among other things, she's being followed by a dork king, the great Anthony Michael Hall, whose twist of a much better fate, is something you don't anticipate. Ringwald, is just perfectly cast here, I don't think there's anyone who could better it. She's everything the role requires, and it's such a naturalistic performance too, among many other good performers too. Exchange student Watanabe as Long Duck Dong is one of the films perks. Ringwald's older sister who's getting married is a much different contrast, a snooty, slightly Kelly Preston lookalike, who's hogging the attention of little Sis. When choosing to use the word "a..hole" at the end of one sentences, shows classic facial expression if I ever saw it. This is part of the reason Ringwalds whole family, has forgot her birthday. C'mon, they'd still remember such an important date. Ringwald's parents in separate scenes, giving her an apologetic heart to heart, I really liked, more so Dooley as Ringwald's Dad. Me with so many others rate this as their favourite Hughes's film, where forget logic, and just get lost in the movie with undertones of real teen angst, where Hughes, like in his other written films, does it in exciting and much humorous ways, with a beautiful ending. I was weirded out with one scene involving Hall, stuck under a low glass coffee table. An eighties movie which is always going to be remembered as a favourite to JH's other films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a classic so I decided to check it out. The plot about this movie is about a girl growing up and dealing with things some girls go through and she reached the age of sixteen during this movie. Samantha Baker(Molly Ringwald) played her character very well in this and it was believable despite it being a comedy most of the time. What really stood out to me was how this comedy has elements that are ahead of it's time. I wouldn't be shocked if this is the movie that set standards for comedy even in modern time. Even now a lot of aspects of this movie still works, even the comedic elements. This is a movie that left a mark for teen comedies and is most definitely worth seeing.8.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Hughes' bouncy teen debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Chronologically you're 16 today. Physically you're still 15."Samantha Baker's opening line bemoaning her breast size. And that one dry observation is just the beginning of Samantha's hellish 16th birthday in Sixteen Candles, the debut feature from that king of the teen movies John Hughes.Sixteen Candles is very special for the simple reason that John Hughes showed other filmmakers of the day what a teen movie could be all about. Instead of an orgy of sex, booze and all night partying, films starring teenagers could be about real people. Young people with problems of their own. Fears. Insecurities. And a healthy dollop of angst.Sixteen Candles takes all of those qualities and makes a surprisingly fun film out of it. Even at the start of his career, John Hughes has made a film that's buoyant, brimming with confidence and delightfully dotty. Its everything a teen film should be.The film that put Molly Ringwald on the map shows off her budding talent. She really is quite wonderful in the role of Samantha because she must encapsulate a lot of emotions. Especially when the emotions of those around her are particularly running high.Even though its Samantha's birthday, her family are much more preoccupied with her elder sister Ginny's wedding. They completely forget that its her birthday. If that weren't bad enough, Samantha's high school crush Jake doesn't even know she exists, she's being hounded by "The Geek" (a sex-starved Anthony Michael Hall), she's been lumbered with a Chinese foreign exchange student, and there's a party to go to.Sixteen Candles is quite a breezy film. Its a very confident debut for John Hughes. There are touches that would become hallmarks for Hughes. Carefully etched characters. His ear for teenspeak. And quirkiness. Hughes is known for having a certain quirky touch but in Sixteen Candles it really goes into overdrive. And that may be the film's only fault.Yes its a very funny film to be sure. But sometimes it feels like Hughes is more interested in springing the next oddball quirk on us than getting on and telling the story. The film is downright crazy at times. TV themes on the soundtrack (if well employed). Surreal images. There were times when these little curiosities quite wore me out. Every scene has something odd about it. Except one. The scene where Samantha's father Jim (Paul Dooley) sits her down and apologises for missing out on what may have been the most important birthday in Samantha's life. Its the one scene in the whole film where Hughes forgets about being nutty and concentrates on the characters themselves. Hughes is always at his best when he directs his own scripts, and this scene in particular really shines.Jim and Samantha actually feel like a real father and daughter. He doesn't quite connect on her level, but he senses her problems and offers to be a sympathetic ear, if not a solution to them. A wonderful scene brilliantly written and performed to perfection by Dooley and Ringwald.There is an actual plot going on throughout all the wackiness Hughes has let loose. And Ringwald is at the centre of it. This may in fact be her best performance. Not only because it feels like her truest film character, but she is exactly the same age as Samantha. 16. And that's why Ringwald so completely identifies with Samantha so perfectly.The film also has a very appealing list of co-stars around the edges of the story. At the head of the line is Anthony Michael Hall, suitably geekish without actually looking like a geek. At least he doesn't wear the thick glasses and lots of zits that crop up in many a teen movie's list of stereotypes.Hall wants to nail Samantha, the girl of his dreams so he can score points with all his geek pals. But in a surprisingly sweet scene, the two open up to each other instead. Its a moment where Hughes changes tack, and their relationship rotates from testy to understanding. Samantha confides in Hall her problems and being unlucky in love, and "The Geek" quite surprisingly offers to help out in a way that doesn't feel contrived at all. There are lots of neat little cameos from a few early risers. Look out for brother and sister John &amp; Joan Cusack. John forms a part of the "Geek Trio", and although Joan walks through the film sporting an unsightly neck brace, she shows her considerable talent for physical comedy without having to do much of anything. Just the sight of her in that thing is worth the price of admission alone!Kramer vs Kramer star Justin Henry is perfectly horrid as Samantha's brattish brother Mike. Haviland Morris is perfectly bitchy as Jake's Prom Queen girlfriend Caroline, and Gedde Watanabe perfectly wacky as Long Duk Dong, the Chinese exchange student. His antics may seem offensive to some nitpickers, but since he looks like he's having so much fun, who cares?Michael Schoeffling is a bit on the bland side as Jake, but the way he and Samantha come together is still quite nice. John Hughes would continue to improve in the teen genre with greater and greater hits. But the sight gags, witty performances and sharp dialogue ensure Sixteen Candles will always remain a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sixteen Candles is one of my favorite movies of all time, and one that I consider to be writer/director John Hughes greatest films for the very simple reason that it is the most sincere.We can all empathize with love struck Samantha Baker (Molly Ringwald), high school sophomore who secretly has a crush on popular high school senior, Jake Ryan (played by the handsome Michael Schoeffling, hubba hubba!). Jake, too, catches on after picking up an anonymous 'sex tester' in study hall that Samantha Baker dropped on the floor. The letter, which contains Jake's name as response to the question: 'if you could do it with one person, who would it be?' Though, Jake is currently dating self-absorbed party animal senior, Caroline Mumford, he is wondering whether Samantha Baker is really the ideal girl for him: 'someone that he can love, who will love him back.' We've all gone through this awkward teen love phase, especially in our high school years, and probably on more than one occasion. Finding yourself suddenly smitten with someone that maybe you've only confessed to your friends, but never directly to that one person, just in case they don't 'like like' you back. It's cute, innocent high school romance and makes for a genuinely sweet film. Contrast this, of course, to modern teen films that seem to do little more than stereotype teenagers as hormone raging misfits with little sincerity among their relationships, even those who eventually get together at the end. Hughes has a nice touch here, creating appreciable characters and plot.But, this is not all Hughes can do--his ability to create this youthful sincerity, probably much more than among characters in his later films like 'Weird Science' and 'Some Kind of Wonderful' (the Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink still raise to high ranks of greatness among 80s teen films in my book). But it is always played against supporting characters and subplots that leave us with some very memorable, outrageously funny scenes. We are not overswept and confined to the Samantha and Jake saga, which though the ultimate ends, may seem too ordinary to be important and thus, lack much of the entertainment quality if it were to be shown by itself. But, played against this background unforgettable supporting sequences such as that of the family forgetting Samanatha's birthday, of Samantha's obnoxious sister (Blanche Baker) preparing for the wedding with her 'oily variety bohunk', of foreign exchange student Long Duk Dong's (a cult favorite played by Gedde Watanabe) wild all-American teen experience, or of the trials and tribulations of the geek freshman (young Anthony Michael Hall) who consistently tries to pursue Samantha, we get not only a nice love story, but altogether, a great comedy. There are so many mini-adventures and misadventures that take place throughout the course of the one or two days that the story transpires that provide such an odd, but nonetheless funny, concoction of characters that in one way or another lead up to the finale meeting of Samantha and Jake. Though sticking with traditional Hughes elements such as the setting of Illinios suburbs, of not-too-intuitive parents, and other commonalities, Hughes doens't get as overtly political as he does with his other films like the Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, and even the comedy, Career Opportunties (written by Hughes, directed by Bryan Gordon). This is just a feel good teen movie with enough going on to keep you entertained from beginning to end. I always smile when I see Samantha and Jake meeting at the end on the steps of the wedding chapel and in the finale as the two are sitting on the table, Samantha in her brides maid's dress near the cake and Jake saying to her 'make a wish Samantha,' and she responds, 'it already came true.' What can I say, I'm a sucker for that. How romantic.Happy Birthday, Samanatha.</fullReview>

Sam has a hopeless crush on him...throughout the whole movie he's trying to get to her, and finally at the end he reaches her after everyone has left for her sister's reception after the wedding mass. Seriously, this movie is so cute!!! It's my favorite out of Molly Ringwald's movies. She's perfect for this part, and Anthony Michael Hall is SO FUNNY. He's hysterical...Farmer Ted. I love how this movie shows that the blondes who are busty and popular don't always get the guys...it's uplifting...it's a movie for anyone whoever thought their love was out of their reach...it's inspiring.

		<fullReview>"Sixteen Candles", aka another 80's Molly Ringwald film, was very funny and had a great plot. I even liked it better than "Pretty in Pink." The characters were great; Sam, played by Molly, whose entire family forgot her b-day; her younger brother who is a trouble maker who has such funny lines; Sam's crush who already has a girlfriend; a desperate geek who wants to do it; and Sam's granparent's exchange student, a japenese kid who is a regular party animal!This movie is a romantic comedy, but mostly a comedy! I laughed so hard at some parts, like when Sam's sister's shoe flies off and breaks a window, and when a very young Joan Cusack is trying to drink a soda out of a can. Joan Cusack has no lines, but is my favorite character by far!This movie is so much of a good time, rent it to see what the 80's were about.My review: 8.5 out of 10</fullReview>

Especially neat are the scenes of a young John and Joan Cusack! (Does John put his relatives in every one of his films? I should check my family tree. Maybe he can get me a job.) Of course, the humour eases the tension of the moving, intense storyline. It's good to know the mousy girl can still win the hunk, but in the process, did she have to dump on the nerd who also liked her? The birthday cake scene is one of the most captivating in any film. What really rocked my world is the fact Ringwald looks exactly like my ex-girlfriend, who's probably dating a hunk right now. Watch this one with a big box of Kleenex.</fullReview>

This movie may want to be 16 but is clearly 8.Plot does not make sense. Characters do things because the scenes call for it and their actions and reactions bear few connections to reality.The acting...is sometimes tolerable, but any good attempt at acting is spoiled by the writing. People in this film utter some of the most cliché and dumbest lines I have heard in a long while. On top of that you get poop jokes, underwear jokes, only top of the line stuff right here, people.The music, oh the music we haven't covered yet. Let us not stay too long on that subject because it is the cheesiest 80s synth music.Is it a complete wreck? No, it is sometimes funny. And it is a feel-good movie, because it is just brainless messing around.

		<fullReview>Sixteen Candles is a watchable, paint-by-numbers teen romance. It's mostly interesting for early glimpses of actors who would go on to do later, better work (especially John and Joan Cusack). The story is too over-the-top to resonate on an emotional level, but it isn't clever enough to get more than the occasional chuckle. It doesn't even do a particularly good job of capturing the mood of the era, though it's inevitable, of course, that some of that comes through. Ultimately this film can't hold a candle to director John Hughes' next project, The Breakfast Club, which does a considerably better job capturing the exploits of mid-80's high schoolers without all the two-dimensional, misanthropic portraits of the older generations cluttering up the movie as they do here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie entered the theatres two years after it was made. The hair styles, clothes, and attitudes were very 80's. Farmer Ted was extremely funny; I loved how he danced. The actor who played the rich jock did it perfectly. The Chinese student was hilarious. It is nice to see good people actually get things there way. The world is far from this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Call me over sensitive, but I really hated this movie. From the racist caricature of the 'Chinaman' to the flippant treatment of rape (seriously, your romantic hero trades a night with his drunk girlfriend for another girl's panties...swoon), Sixteen Candles struck me as far more mean-spirited than funny. Yeah, yeah, "lighten up! It's just a movie!" I'll lighten up when race is more than a punchline, when boys learn that being too drunk to consent means no consent.Cheap humour.On the plus side, it's kind of a kick to see the technology of yesteryear. Floppy disks! Phones the size of your head!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm probably alone in this, but to me this the best of the three movies Hughes did with Ringwald (also counting Pretty in Pink).Of course the plot is ridiculous, but I think Ringwald in this movie does some of her best acting and I've never considered her to be a great actress or even a good one, this became painfully apparent in the Breakfast Club when she was paired against better actors such as Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy. But in this film she delivers a fantastic performance, she is almost the epitome of female teen-angst added with a touch of pathos and humour. Anthony Michael Hall's performance as Farmer Ted is pure genius.The scene in the car in the school garage(or whatever it was) is one of the greatest scenes ever made about adolescence. It truly captures everything it means to be an adolescent, the angst, the insecurity, the longing and also the joy. John Hughes, not renowned for his subtlety, I think we can all agree on that, handles this scene with such subtlety and compassion for his characters and a realness which lacks in most of his other 80s teen-angst movies (with the possible exception of Ferris Bueller's Day Off). He outdoes himself, it's the greatest scene he's ever done, I think. Another thing which makes the pic work is the great number of really funny supporting characters. Gedde Watanabe as the Chinese exchange student (although his depiction boarders on the racist you can't help laughing about him, we're used to racial stereotyping Hughes' movies anyway), Justin Henry as the annoying little brother and John Kapelos as the shady fiancee of Sam's sister to name but a few, all hilarious roles. In short, this is Hughes'best teen-angst movie because it lacks the pretention of the Breakfast Club, the bad acting of Pretty in Pink(yes, I know he didn't direct that one), the social commentary of Ferris Bueller(which just doesn't belong in these kinds of movies) and the uncharismatic actors of Some Kind of Wonderful. And besides that it's just a really funny film, great music, almost camp 80s fashion and great (adolescent) comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Issue-free teen comedy mixes youthful cynicism with old-fashioned sentiment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it isn't exactly Woody Allen, John Hughes' "Sixteen Candles" has some wild laughs and it's blessedly issue-free, but most of the big gags misfire and I wasn't sure how much more I could take of Anthony Michael Hall's squeaky-voiced overacting. Molly Ringwald, playing sort of an updated version of the '50s smart-talking honeybunch, can't believe no one in her family remembered her sixteenth birthday, and puts up with the persistent come-ons of a nerdy Don Juan while dreaming of a date with the class hunk. The subplot about Molly's older sister and her wacky nuptials is a laughless drag, and the sequence where sis is doped-up is a real loss. Better are the quieter moments where Ringwald contemplates her loveless future, chats with her dad on the sofa, and gathers her courage at the school dance to talk to her dreamboat. There's enough slapstick here to keep most people happy, but writer-director Hughes buries his strengths in cartoon gross-outs (and continued to do so: five years later he was still doing the same thing). ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is rarely a film I ever give a bad review on, but in this case I'll make an exception. This film was truly horrendous. Maybe I approached it in the wrong angle, not at all used to the idealism of the 80's, but this movie represented all that was horribly cliché and unrealistic about high school and typical suburban life.All the jokes were stereotypical, whether it was making fun of the freshman geek or the Chinese exchange student. The scenes that were supposed to be poignant and heart-felt were instead mawkish and completely fake. Who's to believe that a handsome high school senior, disillusioned by the party life, would ever take a second glance at a gawky sophomore? I couldn't even bring myself to feel sorry for the main character, whose constant 'woe is me' asides at the audience made me want to slap her and tell her to grow up.In all, a lot of eyerolling went on. I only watched it for some hope that the film would redeem itself. It ended on the worst note possible.</fullReview>

What's even worse is some total dork keeps hounding her with romantic innuendo when she has no feelings for him whatsoever as her attention is simply towards a high hunk named Jake.But in the end,she managed to celebrate her birthday with sixteen candles and a kiss from Jake.This is definitely a memorable and bittersweet comedy about two of the worst thing that can happen in a girl's sixteenth birthday.While the screenplay is far from being perfect,the cast is definitely appealing and they give life to the characters.It is a movie that that viewers from all ages will appreciate aside from teen-agers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great directorial debut from John Hughes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The '80s produced many great high school and this one is a lot of fun. It is Samantha Baker's sixteenth birthday and it starts badly? her entire family are so wrapped up in her sister's upcoming wedding that they forget Samantha's birthday. To make matters worse she is convinced that Jake, the boy she loves, isn't even aware that she exists; to make matters worse he is dating one of the most desired girls in school. Unlike most films of this type Jake actually feels the same way about her but neither can bring themselves to tell the other. The school dance looks like it might provide an opportunity but the only boy to approach Samantha is one known as 'The Geek'. He tells each of them how the other feels but it seems they are still unsure and seem unlikely to get together? especially when Samantha heads home and Jake goes to a party with his girlfriend.Before watching this I'd assumed it was a 'chick-flick'; more of a romance than a comedy. While there are obviously romantic elements it is also a very funny film; many of the laughs provided by Anthony Michael Hall who plays The Geek and Gedde Watanabe who plays Long Luk Dong an Asian boy who gets lucky at the party. Molly Ringwald does a great job as protagonist Samantha; it isn't surprising that she would work with Director John Hughes. Hughes does a fine job in a genre that will make him famous. The plot is fairly simple but it was nice to see it avoided the cliché of having a girl like popular guy who in reality isn't good enough for her then for her to end up with the unpopular guy who is better for her. It was more fun to see who 'The Geek' did end up with anyway. There isn't much to offend here but some may be put off by the occasional obscenity and a fairly brief nude scene. Overall I'd say if you enjoyed 'Pretty and Pink', 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' or 'The Breakfast Club' you will almost certainly want to watch this too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming Hughes Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sixteen Candles (1984) *** (out of 4)Molly Ringwald plays a teenager who wakes up on her sixteenth birthday only to realize that her entire family has forgotten that today's her special day. The rest of the day is going to be one embarrassment after another as she gets the unwanted attention of a nerd (Anthony Michael Hall) while the guy (Michael Schoeffling) she has a crush on finds out through a sex quiz she takes. I really wasn't sure what to expect from this 80s teen comedy but it turned out to be pretty good due in large part to the great cast and the nice screenplay. Once again Hughes does a wonderful job in terms of dialogue as it comes freshly out of the mouths of all the young actors who really do a nice job with it and help make this a minor little gem. I'm sure most people watching this film will be able to connect with at least one of the characters no matter if its the dork, the overlooked girl or the popular guy growing tired of the partying ways of high school. Hughes' screenplay allows each person their own personality instead of having everyone sound and act the same. That's the one thing I've noticed in these early films by Hughes but he clearly knows various groups of people and he brings them to life very well. This film did shock me in terms of some of its humor including the rather racist jokes aimed at the Chinese exchange student, Long Duk Dong. This racist humor will probably offend plenty but I don't think there was any cruelness meant by it and I must admit that I found actor Gedde Watanabe very funny in the role. Needless to say, Ringwald really does good in her role and she's easy believable throughout. Hall pretty much steals the film as "The Geek" as, again, you can't help but believe everything that happens to him. I found the rest of the supporting players, from the grandparents to the sister and parents, to be well acted and once again their dialogue makes them all their own characters. This isn't the greatest film of the genre but it does have enough going for it to make it very entertaining and that's really all that matters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where'd you learn that stuff? -- School ... -- Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Hughes -- RIP -- had the knack for capturing the essence of teendom on film, without pandering to his audience or becoming condescending. 16 Candles, Hughes' firstling, is a prime example of his art, and one that's still entertaining a quarter of a century (sigh!) later. The movie starts on the morning of Samantha Baker (Molly Ringwald) 's sweet sixteenth birthday, which is sadly, dramatically forgotten by her entire family because her elder sister's marriage is imminent. To make things worse, Sammy is being ignored by her highschool heartthrob, but pursued by a budding nerd who wants to get into her pants -- or rather, AT her pants. After a hughe (sic!) roller-coaster ride of a plot, everything eventually comes right, Samantha gets her guy and, and sexual prospects are in the offing even for the nerd (Anthony Michael Hall). Great acting by Hall and heroine Molly Ringwald, who was actually 16 years old at the time -- while some of her peers in the movie are already in their mid-twenties. What somewhat dates this otherwise surprisingly fresh movie are two facts:*a large part of the story revolves around a prize in the form of a packet of floppy disks, which were apparently prized possessions in 1984 (I don't actually remember them ever having been that expensive), but which have long become obsolete since then*what really made me suffer though are some of the movie's "sexual politics": it clearly suggests that it's OK to have sexual intercourse with a girl while she's asleep; the same girl is later put in a "compromising" situation with another boy while she's passed out, so that her boyfriend can get rid of her for sleeping around; and various other plot elements, which seem to stem straight from the 1950ies</fullReview>

I always like the way that Molly Ringwald acted in this movie. I also knew that Long Duk Dong was a comic-relief character (I laughed at him when I see him). The best part is when Grandpa Howard said "Dong, where is my automobile" and Long Duk Dong said "Oh-to-moe-beel?". I also liked the character named Jake Ryan. He's a neat guy. Only character I don't like is Caroline, because she's a snob. This is the only good Mr. Hughes film next to The Breakfast Club. You can't stay away from this movie.This is a sweet movie.

		<fullReview>I was a teenager when this movie came out so naturally I loved it. I watched it again last night (had seen it a million times) and it's funny, but honestly I don't think a movie like that could come out today and be successful or well thought of.First off; I kind of thought Molly's character was kind of a loser. She was very whiney and bratty and it would be very hard to believe that she'd end up with Jake or that he'd see anything in her.When I watched it as a kid I thought Molly was the best. I still like her, but not crazy about that character. I did however think Anthony Michael Hall was the #1 reason to watch this movie. He was so funny. He was an uber geek, but as he said "I'm kinda like king of the dipshits" and he played that so well. I loved when he met her on the dance floor and says "alllll riiiiiight" with the come hither look.I also loved long duck dong. Very funny. "what the hell are you bitchin about? I have to sleep under some china man named after a ducks dork". Ha ha ha. So funny.This movie was pure 80's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just flat out silly and funny. The very best of the 80's was in this film. Don't know what happened to Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling) but a lot of them lost out in the 90's. Anywho, Molly is your typical teen girl I suppose in most areas of the country who crushes a boy who crushes her back, but he's got a girlfriend who apparently everyone wants. I'm sorry, but Haviland Morris ain't all that. You couldn't convince me of it either. Anyway, I digress. You can get a plot summary from IDMB, so I ain't going into all that. Some great quotable things from this movie and you can always flashback when VH1 does in I Love the 80's. Gedde was hilarious and the entire movie was just what morons. The kid who played the little brother did a good job. I really wanted to hit him. The granparents, everyone who was supposed to do something was great. Pretty lame premise and all the succeeding scenes in support of the premise are unlikely and downright insulting to your intelligence, but it gave hope to young girls eerywhere. Come on: Your fam forgets your birthday in light of your sister's impending nuptials (believeable). Then you go to a highschool dance and try to help out a geek by giving him your underwear (not so believable). The senior guy you liked (who looks like 27 as do all the seniors) would rather "seriously" date than screw the highschool prom queen as often as he wanted to when Sam's a virginal sophomore. Yea, it starts to get dumb after that. Things like that would never happen, but somehow they do in Hollywood. Still, a funny movie. Ginny on Midol is a must-see, lol.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i love this movie. the fact that someone forgets your 16th birthday, that could really dramatize anybody's life. the movie starts out to have us see that another event is happening, and everyone in the household is focused on that particular event, rather than molly's sixteenth b-day. she dreams of being with the perfect dream guy, jake, and melts at the sight of him. oh course, i melted too. the guy that plays jake is a major babe, and i am pretty sure other females would agree with me on that one. but there is one problem: jake goes out with the prettiest girl in the entire school, and is looked upon by all of the girls, since she has the figure that all the girls are dying to have. so during the entire movie, while molly envies jake and the pretty girl, the class nerd wants to desperately date molly. so now the nerd trys and trys and trys (Breathe) to get the two, jake and molly together. i dont really understand why he would do this, since he likes molly, and why does jake want to leave the pretty girl in the school? sure, its not just on physical appearances that relationships are based on, but the majority of relationships in high school were based and are still based on popularity. so i figured that was the case in the 80's classic, but i guess not in this movie. the movie's moral is that dreams can come true and that families eventually do remember your birthdays, so dont give up hope, regardless of the situations that can happen in your teenage life for one day!

		<shortDescription>Cut The Number Of Candles In Half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sixteen Candles" is to teen flicks what "Steel Magnolias" is to chick flicks. I accredit the idea that "Sixteen Candles" is the direct cause as to why I was a fan of the teen film deluge of the latter half of the last decade. If someone watched this movie and couldn't find any bit of it funny, then that person has put their sense of humor into question. I laughed almost all the way through it and it was the very first time that I have seen it. It is a great film.Here are my reasons (spoilers): (1) John Hughes is a film-making savant. He writes with a subtle, kind hand and treats his characters with humility. He directed "Sixteen Candles" and it worked well. His talent is also evident in his other films. (2) The best performance of the film goes to Anthony Michael Hall as The Geek. He stole the movie away from Molly Ringwald and I think that move saved it. He was a fair balance of complete dork and wise old man and his other side helps him get the hottie in the end. He had the most comedic moments and they didn't suck at all. Hall's comedic performance is one for the ages. (3) "Sixteen Candles" is definitely a movie that suffers from a political correctness allergy. Gedde Watanabe is just funny as Long Duk Dong. I know the performance stereotypes East Asian males as oblivious to American culture but it was difficult not to laugh because the performance was stupid in the first place. I personally believe the character of Long Duk Dong was poking fun at East Asian stereotypes. I hate political correctness anyway because it is just another convienient form of lying. "Sixteen Candles" pokes fun at both PC and stereotypes and it succeeds immensely. (4) I love the scenes where the Geek was jousting with his buds (John Cusack as one bud in one of his first performances). The point that illustrates this line of logic is the scene where The Geek wants the picture of him and Caroline in the Rolls Royce. I was almost on the floor laughing after that. (5) The scene in the boys bathroom and the unveiling of the panties had me laughing so hard that my head almost became detatched from my neck. The dramatic music was an especially sweet touch. (6) Even though John Hughes isn't known for drama, at times he does a touch for it. The scene between Molly and The Geek is easily on the best scenes in teen movie history. I am sure that many adolescents knew what those two were going through when they first saw "Sixteen Candles". It is probably one of the few movie scenes that has also transcended time as well because adolescents will always be going to through same feelings and doubts in the years to come. (7) Molly Ringwald is a decent actress and her role in this movie shows that she does have talent. It is kind of sad that she didn't get to go on to superstar status but not all is ever lost. She is will always be remembered as the perky redhead who got felt up by her grandmother. (8) I felt that the denouement of the film was executed nicely. It was a nice surprise that the geek got the hottie and it was expected that the birthday girl got the dream guy. All in all, how else such a none-to-serious teen movie end? Eight reasons give a score of eight.One downer was (1) the unnecessary scene of the wedding dinner. I don't think it really had a place in all the teen angst. I may be wrong because I am not John Hughes, but it felt out of place to me. The other downer was (2) the nudity on screen. I like nudity on the screen as much as the next man but was that really necessary to? I guess it was just another way Hughes had to appeal to the boys in the audience and it worked. I guess that is why the PG-13 rating came into effect two years after the release of "Sixteen Candles".Overall, I think this a truly great teen film even though I rated it below some of my other personal favorites. Without this movie, I couldn't like "She's All That", "10 Things I Hate About You", "American Pie", "Loser" and even "Y Tu Mama Tambien". "Sixteen Candles" is the perfect 80's film that doesn't delve into any social issues or seriousness (watch "Risky Business if you want that). This movie will age gracefully with time and it will never be forgotten. Here ends my rant!</fullReview>

This movie is an absolute treasure for people like me who graduated high school in the mid 80's. Very, very, funny with a good sense of heart.I'll give it a perfect 10 rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It will live forever. I just watched the tail end of this classic last night on TBS, and I laughed as hard in 2000 as I did in the theatre in 1984.What a timeless movie! It is the quintessence of high school.Once every decade or so, it seems a film comes along that just captures and defines that particular time in American culture. Sixteen Candles is one of those GREAT American films. I lived it, and so did millions of others. The night of Farmer Ted, Jake and Samantha was not too far off of many that I remember!I lived and I love it! Thanks John Hughes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie a lot but it's not as good as the Breakfast Club. I really didn't think that much of Molly Ringwald in this movie or Breakfast Club. Anthony Michael Hall who plays the geek was the coolest in this movie. I liked that scene where he borrowed Molly Ringwald's underwear for ten minutes and then they had to pay a buck to get in the restroom. Long Duck Don was a trip. Great movie to watch especially if you're a teenager.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely one of the best movies of the 80's! It's the true high school of the 80's! It's hilarious, smart and touching! One question how did it get away with being PG it should PG-13 because it has strong language, nudity, and adult contact. I recommend it to an OLDER group.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I expected a little better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somehow I had missed this movie for years, and finally after its 12th or so year of existence I rented it. Coming from my writing mentor John Hughes and after hearing all the great word of mouth for years, I looked forward to it. But just plain and simple, it didnt make me laugh. I enjoyed Watanabe's character and little Henry's great line: "I'm not sleeping under a guy named after a duck's dork," but the rest of it was dull as Ringwalds family and friends overlook her title birthday. To top it off, she's swooning heavy over Matt Dillon clone Shoeffling. The film has a lot going on but it all depends on what makes you laugh. An average debut for Hughes in the teen genre he would go on to perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among Hughes' Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young girl's "sweet sixteenth" birthday becomes anything but special as she (Molly Ringwald) suffers from every embarrassment possible.There are some things to be concerned about when watching this film. There was clearly some level of racism with the Long Duk Dong character. And there is a moment or two where the movie seems to suggest that sexual assault is permissible when a woman is drunk or passed out.The second is really hard to defend. If Hughes is on record concerning it, this would be worth tracking down. The first, however, is intended as ironic -- we see the way the grandparents treat Dong and the laundry comment is meant to reflect poorly on them and their ignorance, not on the Asian community. Hughes may not be Mel Brooks, but he was able to turn the tables on occasion.Beyond those concerns, this is a pretty great coming-of-age movie, not all that different from "Say Anything" a few years later or "Can't Hardly Wait" a decade later. We get Anthony Michael Hall at his finest, and a wonderfully dorky John Cusack. High art this is not, but the epitome of a teen movie it is. Few before or since have reached its level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Hughes is one of those writer/directors that make naive people believe making movies is simple. There's really not a lot to "Sixteen Candles". It's a very simple story with very simple characters, but as usual with Hughes it's all in the execution. The dialogues in "Sixteen Candles" are just marvelously written, the character's traits are fully established within minutes and it all comes so naturally. Anthony Michael Hall's Geek (actual character name) might be the most perfectly build-up character in Hughes' entire filmography, never have I been so happy for a guy this creepy. Occasionally though, I got to say things get somewhat weird with the various "likeable" characters. For instance, the perfect boy of our main character's dreams is someone who tries to hook up with her while passing his current girlfriend (who for good measure is unconscious and drunk) to a 15-year-old who he forces to drive a car. Wow, get him while he's available ladies! But hell, this movie has such a sweet atmosphere and somewhere in there I heard the happy ending music so let's not nitpick. In the same category: the Chinese character might be the worst racial stereotype since Andy Rooney in "Breakfast At Tiffany's", but I dare you to see the "YES, MARRIED!"-scene and not laugh. You leave this movie with a great feeling, and that seems to be what they were going for.P.S: Also check out a very young John Cusack is his last role that wasn't an author. He mostly just stands in the back saying nothing, but still.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Hughes Teen Comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Hughes made a name for himself specializing in teen comedies during the 1980's, since this was really the first one of many(though they weren't sequels)Story has a girl(Molly Ringwald) having her sixteenth birthday being forgotten by her busy family, and assorted craziness going on between an upcoming wedding, unrequited love from a senior, and unwanted attention from the freshman(Anthony Michael Hall). There is also a wacky exchange student staying with them as well(sponsored by her grandparents).All these plot elements don't make for a particularly believable or funny film, which depends too much on broad stereotypes, rather than fully drawn characters. Has its moments, but doesn't amount to much, though it was popular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet film about turning 16</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back to 80's teen movies again! While this pre-cursor to the classic "The Breakfast Club" isn't quite as good, director John Hughes hits the mark again in giving us a fun microcosm of high school life, with punchy dialogue. Sweet redhead Molly Ringwald has just turned sweet 16, but her family has been busy with her vacuous older sister's wedding. Samantha's birthday really sucks, but the guy of her dreams Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling) may have noticed her after all. A relative to 90's teen gross-out comedies such as "American Pie", John Hughes' comedies are better because he doesn't rely on gratuitous nudity to get laughs. However, there is something very off-putting about Jake practically inviting Farmer Ted (Anthony Michael Hall, who played the geek so well) to sexually assault his girlfriend. And the laughs with the (now) obligatory minor Asian character get tired after a while. Watch out for John and Joan Cusack in bit roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, the '80s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's odd to see John Hughes commenting on high school through the eyes of a teenaged girl - one might think he is more apt to model himself onto another male, but it's a strength to his writing skills that he can just as effectively convey the trials and tribulations of a young woman. (Rather than just a man such as in, say, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off.") This is essentially the film that made John Hughes famous, and one of the most defining films of the 1980s (along with "The Brekafast Club" a year later, this gave birth to the modern teen genre and the stereotypes inherent and loathed in most of the genre today).Molly Ringwald plays Samantha, a blossoming girl whose family forget her big day - the Sweet Sixteenth when she finally becomes a woman (at least in her own eyes).Samantha has a crush on the school's most popular kid and a geek (Anthony Michael Hall) has a crush on her, and she doesn't return to the feelings.The movie is predictable, but that might have something to do with our familiarity with modern clichés of the genre based on this film itself. I imagine when it was originally released it wouldn't have had such a pre-existing familiarity with viewers, although then again, maybe it did...and that's why it was such a success.This is far from John Hughes' best film, but it is an effective teen comedy and one of the better ones to come out of the 1980s. It's good for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misfired teen comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Screen writer-director John Hughes has aimed his sights once again at the easily pleased young audiences, and it is surely the only target he is likely to strike with this rather misfired teen comedy.Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall, two Hughes regulars, star in this Cinderella story about a sixteen year old birthday girl whose parents have forgotten her special day because of her older sister's imminent wedding, and whose dream man doesn't even know she exists. And to make matters worse, poor little Sam Baker (Ringwald) is being vigorously pursued by the king of the school geeks (Hall). Unlike the dramatically sound 1985 hit "The Breakfast Club", both Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall fail to entertain whilst Hughes' flat and predictable script struggles to make us laugh, as it mostly resorts to tasteless or weak sex jokes and cheap shots. The funniest scene in fact would have to be at the church near the end of the film when Sammy's rather heavily sedated sister attempts to walk down the aisle with daddy.Otherwise "Sixteen Candles" is a disappointment from John Hughes and hardly a creditable teen flick.Saturday, August 20, 1994 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well it's better than The Breakfast Club</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Molly Ringlwald plays annoying miserable teen in a typical John Hughes filmHughes's usual middle-class dilemmas are dealt with here ("I love him/her but he/she doesn't know I exist...woe is me")Ringwald's 16th birthday is overshadowed by her older sister's wedding which is occurring the next day. As such, Ringwald mopes about because of this and because the boy she fancies (Jake) apparently doesn't know she exists.While it's infinitely more watchable than The Breakfast Club, it's still pretty dire. Nothing really happens. They go to a school disco, a house party and a wedding. Samantha (Ringwald) tries to get the attention of Jake while 'The Geek' tries to get the attention of Samantha.As usual, the 'cool' kids end up falling in love with the geeks by the end of the film, for absolutely no reason what so ever. It's common in Hughe's films for characters to act in a certain way and for odd situations occur regardless of whether or not it makes sense. E.G. in Sixtenn Candles, Jake, the cool kid with the Ferrari, dumps his girlfriend in favour of the unattractive Samantha, with whom he's never even conversed. At the same time, his girlfriend dumps handsome, Ferrari-driving Jake for gangly, squeaky-voiced geek. It doesn't make any sense but it happens just because John Hughes wants it to happen.As much as I hate to say it, because it's a totally racist aspect of the film, the best character is Long Duck Dong, who is played brilliantly by Gedde Watanabe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SIXTEEN CANDLES (1984) *** Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Michael Schoeffling, Haviland Morris, Paul Dooley, Justin Henry, Joan Cusack, John Cusack, Blanche Baker, Gedde Watanabe. John Hughes' first and perhaps most charming film written/directed by is about everyteen Ringwald facing every girl's worst nightmare: her parents totally forgetting her sweet 16th birthday as they obsess over older daughter Baker's upcoming wedding. To her rescue comes self-appointed "king of the dweebs" Hall (a laugh riot) as the moxied nerd who helps in her desire to meet hunky high school stud Schoeffling while romancing his gorgeous stuck up blonde babe-o-licious Morris (oh momma!) Funniest moment is Hall trying to prove to fellow loser Cusack his track record as a babe magnet by pulling up in a BMW with Morris comatose!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Move Along, Nothing to See Here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"16 Candles" is another in the seemingly endless group of teen films from the disappointing cinematic decade that was the 1980s. Molly Ringwald is about to turn 16, but no one seems to remember. Her family is pre-occupied with her older sister's upcoming wedding. Ringwald is also in love with high school senior Michael Schoeffling, but nothing she does seem to work to get his attention. Could it be possible that he has feelings for her too though? Geek Anthony Michael Hall has lustful feelings for Ringwald, but she is not interested at all. Also along for the ride is bratty little brother Justin Henry and Asian foreign exchange student Gedde Wantanabe. Overall there is nothing really special here. Everything has been dozens of times before and they usually did not work in the past so why would they work in this film? Look for John Cusack, Joan Cusack and Jami Gertz in small parts. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

It's like Porky's Revenge without naked women, nor action. I saw it with some friends (men and women) who took off before the end because they were falling asleep.Acting is bad (specially the 'pretty' boy), peace is slow, jokes are lame and too much of a fairy tale where the 'popular' guy notices the 'poor unpopular' girl out of the blue with idiot lines such as 'I'm tired of partying' which you would never hear from a 18 years-old guy.5 / 10.</fullReview>
