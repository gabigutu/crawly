		<fullReview>Whenever I see so much "Oscar worthy" tags/blurbs in an ad campaign I get nervous, see Cinderella Man. Usually you look closely at the fine print and see that the esteemed critic lauding the film is Joe Schmoe from the One Stop Light Bugle Press in Buttcreek, Illinois or a low level flunky who just happens to work for the media conglomerate that is distributing the film. So my heart sank a little when a film I have been eagerly awaiting was swaddled with such praise when the ads hit the air.But they're right for once.Joaquin Phoenix wears Johnny Cash like a suit. He isn't doing a Rich Little impersonation, you don't rub your eyes in disbelief, but he channels a man so distinct in appearance and voice to a level that is beyond admirable. One of the traits that made Johnny Cash a legend was that nobody sounded or looked like him. Short of a computer generated Cash walking around in his own bio-pic like one of those John Wayne beer commercials this is the definitive representation.And yet Phoenix may not give the best performance in the film.Reese Witherspoon more than holds up her end in a role that easily could have been reduced to a clichéd bumpkin. Witherspoon portrays the on-stage June in the way June portrayed her own "character", the stage persona that people adored, while giving her the resolve and inner strength to be the woman who tamed a hell-bent, grizzly bear of a man like John.The chemistry of Phoenix and Witherspoon together in any scene, but their on-stage duets in particular, are truthful in a way that resonates long after the credits. I know that unless you have been living in a cave for the past week you have likely been bombarded with the word that the actors sing themselves without use of lip syncing. I have never been a fan of musicals, or even musical performances in a film. They generally seem forced and uncomfortable to me, the moment when I stop experiencing the story and feel reminded that I am watching a movie. I never felt that in this film. I never felt that their singing took the focus of the film, but the performances work with the story like no other music bio I have ever seen. I never felt as if I was being led through the catalog, the songs felt as organic and natural as any spoken dialog in a great narrative.This film far exceeded my expectations and afforded me the first trip home from a theater with a true feeling of satisfaction in a very, very long time. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And The Oscar Goes To......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what a film. I had been waiting to see this movie since I read that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were cast in the lead roles. I was not sure what to expect when I heard they were going to do their own singing, but was I ever impressed. Their performances in this movie were brilliant, and I had chills down my spine. It was truly amazing how much Phoenix sounded like Johnny Cash-this was a role he was born to play, and he was mesmerizing. Totally sizzling. Witherspoon was positively radiant as June Carter, and talk about chemistry between the two actors. Talk about lightning striking! I only hope they are rewarded for their efforts come Oscar time. This was a truly amazing movie, filled with great music, a top-notch supporting cast and a terrific script which was wonderfully directed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best film of 2005</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've long thought that James Mangold was one of the most underrated American directors; while other acclaimed auteurs like Wes Anderson and David Gordon Green have made names for themselves by essentially repeating themselves with each film, Mangold has attracted considerably less attention for actually having the gall to show some range. Like the great directors of the Hollywood studio system, Mangold shows visual and narrative skill across a wide array of genres: character-driven crime (COPLAND); horror (IDENTITY); issue-oriented drama (GIRL INTERRUPTED), etc. What each of these films shares in common is a stunningly elegant and expressive visual style, an attention to character reminiscent of Renoir, and an economy of storytelling that would make Howard Hawks envious.Now Mangold has delivered his masterpiece, and it's the best studio release I've seen so far this year. WALK THE LINE, Mangold's story of the relationship between Johnny Cash and June Carter, is deliriously romantic, exhiliratingly entertaining (as a musical it invites and earns comparison with the best of Vincente Minelli), and profoundly moving--all set to a spectacular soundtrack. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are both brilliant as Cash and Carter, but not only in the ways you would expect. Their most impressive achievement is to convincingly portray two people falling in love in a manner that's sincere and sweet but never cheaply sentimental. This is the most unabashedly romantic American movie since THE NOTEBOOK, but it's totally authentic and lacking in melodrama; the subtlety with which Mangold and his performers delineate the one step forward, two steps back nature of Cash and Carter's love affair is staggering. Phoenix is particularly brilliant, not only in the romantic scenes but in moments in which Cash discusses his brother's early death; in these scenes the major tragedies of both the character and the performer's lives merge in a way that is heartbreakingly real. And the movie gets across the intoxicating nature of creative collaboration between two people in love better than any film I've ever seen--perhaps no coincidence given that Mangold and his closest collaborator, producer Cathy Konrad, are married. I could (and will) go on about this movie for hours, but let's just say that it's the movie to beat for the rest of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved it. More my dad's music than mine (I was born in 1960-am a rock-n-roller), but tapped my feet the whole way thru. It is funny, I grew up with certain songs of Johnny Cash, and heard about the legend of the "man in black" for as long as I remember, but this movie adds a whole new dimension to the man, his music. I think it's great maybe a whole new generation might come to enjoy his contributions too.J.Phoenix and R. Witherspoon were phenomenal and made this film a joy to watch. I have not enjoyed any movie so much in a long time. Judging by the applause and the grins on the movie goers faces on the way out-I was not alone in my whole-hearted enthusiasm for the movie.Gonna order me a J.Cash CD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joaquin Phoenix is brutally hot as Johnny Cash!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget North Country, Walk the Line directed by James Mangold (Girl Interrupted) and written by Mangold and Gill Dennis is the better 2005 Oscar contender.This romantic tragedy, which is based on the autobiographies of Johnny Cash The Man in Black and Cash: the Autobiography was actually written and perfected alongside the famous duo Cash and June Carter Cash before their deaths in 2003.The movie begins with a young, music obsessed "J.R." Cash growing up in a poor cotton farming family in Arkansas. Shortly afterwards, a family tragedy changes his life forever.Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) leaves for the air force, where he is stationed in Germany, buys an old guitar and proceeds to write one of the most recorded songs in history along with many others.Upon returning, Cash's obsession leads him to a recording studio and into the spotlight with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) as well as Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton) and the comical Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne.) The next emotional hour and 45 minutes is filled with great music, drug dependency, infidelity, and most of all love.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who sang every song themselves, completely shined in this movie. There are no better actors that could have filled the shoes of the Carter-Cash duo. Phoenix and Witherspoon had such great chemistry, by the end of the movie you actually think they might really be in love.However, if you tend to get restless in longer movies, the running time of 136 minutes can start to seem a little long towards the end, but it's well worth it.Overall Walk the Line receives nine out of ten stars. The movie did an excellent job portraying the life of the "man in black," his soul mate and their rocky path on the way to love. If Phoenix and Witherspoon are not nominated for their amazing voices and chilling performances, it will be a great disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the formula junk coming out of Hollywood these days, I was blown away by how good this movie was. The direction was perfect. Using close ups to get us in under the skin of Johnny Cash. And since it was a period piece, he could have bored us with lots of cgi of Memphis and L.A. to take us back in time. Instead he used the actors and the music to take us there. Biopics naturally have a formula to them, but the director and screenwriter did not take us down the track of overly sentimental scenes. These were real and done with a bit of well placed humor. Just like real life. Afterall you still have to follow the real lives of Johnny and June. You can't make it up, just to be original! The movie was also a movie you can take most of the family to. No nudity and sex to SHOW how in love they are, just real dialog...it's nice to hear REAL dialog and not just another chase scene, or four letter word. Yes, some movies need that to tell the story, this one doesn't. This movie goes onto my short list of great biopics, with "Ray". Not much else comes close to Ray or Walk the Line. The true test of any biopics is: can you still understand the plot even if you never heard of the people the movie is about. This movie is a great love story even if you never heard of Johnny and June Cash. Oscars all around I say! Plus I loved the Rockabilly music through out the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walk the Line is a great movie. When you watch it, you feel as though you are watching Johny Cash in person. Juaqin Pheonix is amazing as Cash, a man with so many regrets and self doubts. Reese Witherspoon gives an Oscar performance as the love of his life June Carter. The film is long, but worth every minute. But what is great is that T Bone Burnett chose the right songs to play. When I saw it today people in the theater were singing along with the movie. And what is great, is that Pheonix and Witherspoon sand the songs themselves. This movie should win several Oscars this year. Go see it. It is an amazing film, and it perfectly protrays an amazing man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances make this worth checking out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know about "Mangold the Auteur", and might need a bit more proof that this is really a director worth paying attention to, but this is a pretty watchable film. I found the story and film-making a bit predictable, like the usual bio-pic formula that you might expect if you've seen, say, coal miner's daughter, or any other bio-pic of someone you love. What makes this movie stand out is the two lead performances. Reese is unbelievably convincing as June Carter Cash. She almost disappears into the role. And her singing! Who knew??? And Joaquin! We've been waiting for him to deliver a really spectacular performance for some time, and this is finally it. I, for one, resisted the idea that ANYONE could portray the man in black, but he does a pretty fine job. Not just an impersonation, but actually a performance worth watching. Really fine. Watch for the Jackson duet. Really awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical performance by Reese Witherspoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Walk the Line" is without question the zenith of Reese Witherspoon's acting career thus far. Joaquin Phoenix IS Johnny Cash in this biopic, but Reese as June Carter Cash sets this film on fire. It is one thing to portray a person's life, with feeling and emotion, something which Joaquin pulls off effortlessly. However, it is quite another to make a portrayal bigger than life, and Reese makes June Carter Cash the central character of this film.To say that Reese steals the show is an understatement. Reese becomes a lightning rod for Joaquin's character, in a way that is actually quite scary. After all, Reese is from Nashville, and her Southern affect is flawless and absolutely winning. Suffice it to say that Reese will thankfully be present when the Academy Awards are presented next year. She might want to get a few words ready.This movie will not be everyone's favorite flick, if for no other reason than that it is a biopic of flawed, Southern characters. However, perhaps the very flaws that imbue these characters with vitality and realism can establish the acting of Joaquin and Reese with an almost spiritual meaning, as they live these real people on screen. But in the final analysis, Reese Witherspoon will become the greatest contemporary screen actor upon release of this film. See for yourself. You read it here first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk the Line is everything Ray was not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walk the Line reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com rating: 3.5 out of 4Director: James Mangold Cast: Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon Screenplay: James Mangold, Gill Dennis (based off the Johnny Cash autobiographies) MPAA Classification: PG-13 (language, drug content)To be honest, I've never been a fan of Johnny Cash's music. I listened to it every now and then when flipping through the presets in my car, stopping to sing along to the few lyrics I knew, but I never gave the musician much thought. Until now. For me, Walk the Line is everything Ray was not. Ray was plagued by an uneven screenplay, but got enough sentimentality and acting points for people to look past its flaws, and managed to nab a Best Picture nomination. Walk the Line, however, is worth all the press it's likely to get. With acting work just as impressive as Ray's, music just as affecting, and a screenplay that hits all the right chords, Walk the Line is a fine, fair biopic for Mr. Cash. The film faces the threat of what music critics call "same-songiness". A volley of biopics have been released in the past year making it only a matter of time before American audiences call it quits for the genre. Making matters worse, the story arcs for Ray and Walk the Line are essentially the same. A small time musician with tragic childhood memories goes on to become an international sensation, but finds himself wrapped up with extra-marital women and illegal drugs. Yes, it sounds like a re-hash of Ray, but believe me, Walk the Line's storytelling works much, much smoother. Also, what Ray lacked was romance. Yeah, yeah, I know, there was that cute scene with the hummingbird; but that little tidbit will be soon forgotten when Reese Witherspoon hits the screen. Taking on the role of June Carter, Witherspoon takes a page from her role in Vanity Fair (and not Just Like Heaven), and completely inhabits her character. Her pairing with Joaquin Phoenix yields beautiful chemistry and makes their romance believably realistic, something I frankly didn't feel with Ray. There's sure to be some trepidation over the fact that Director James Mangold used Phoenix and Witherspoon's real voices for Cash and Carter's songs. Again, I'm not really an authority on Johnny Cash music, but from what I've heard, Phoenix and Carter nail it. And Cash enthusiast Roger Ebert, who was in the same screening room as me and heard the same songs, stated afterwards that he was incredibly impressed by their mimicry. To extend my comparison between Ray and Walk the Line, I found James Mangold's directing style for Cash's biopic to be very similar to the formula used by Taylor Hackford in Ray. Each put a strong visual emphasis on the musical scenes and neither busied themselves with distracting camera tricks or visual pizazz. There are beautiful shots to be found in both films, but this is no Fernando Meirelles (The Constant Gardener) behind the camera. Instead, where each director plays his cards is with the screenplay. And this is where Walk the Line truly shows its colors.Biopics are difficult in that a coherent story must be told over a great span of chronology. Films often run into the problem of trying to fit too much into a two hour film, an issue Ray suffered from. For instance, when Ray starts his downward spiral with Heroin and begins poking himself with needles, there were often straight cuts to joyous scenes of his son being born, or him returning home to his wife from a tour. The story never let itself settle down with a mood and tell a coherent story. Instead, the film jumped around so much, it left audiences dazed and numb to the emotions on-screen. But Walk the Line avoids this problem with James Mangold and Gill Dennis' screenplay, which is based off of Cash's two autobiographies. The script gives Walk the Line a backbone for the story to follow, keeping a foundation for the sub-plots to wrap themselves around. This foundation is Cash's obsession with June Carter. His childhood story and even his music are motivated by this romance. She was the center of his life up until his death, and she's the center of this film. And with Witherspoon's performance as terrific as it is, the foundation is solid as rock.If the American public is still willing to pay money for a musician's biopic, then Walk the Line's their film. Of the recent four I've seen (De-Lovely, Ray, Beyond the Sea), Walk the Line's the finest. -www.samseescinema.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, if conventional.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just left the Press and Industry screening at the Toronto Fest I thought I'd pass along a few words on an Oscar contender.First, this is an excellent film. Second, it is formulaic, but not to a fault. The film is two great performances. Luckily, they're the right two. Phoenix has done an excellent job capturing Cash, the man. Not the legend and not what everyone thought he would be. What made Johnny Cash such an icon was that he was an "everyman" and Phoenix gives his all to not only capture every subtle nuance but also to make him believable as a flawed human being. Watch, in particular, the performance sequences, and I'd argue that it's equal to Foxx's Ray Charles without nearly as much caricature.There's no attempts on behalf of the filmmakers at the predestination of Cash as a superstar. They simply show how he learned to sing with a radio and a hymnal. The back story given before his career started is essential to the way his life unfolds and, for the most part, is kept in well-shot and brief sequences. There are few attempts to over-glamourize or over-dramatize the events that shaped Cash's life and career. Thankfully, as well, there are no attempts to recreate his drug use for the audience's benefit in cinematic terms.Reese Witherspoon's performance, as well, is surprisingly good. There are precious few points in the film where you remember she was in Legally Blonde, and her vocals and live performances are stronger than many I've seen from Hollywood actresses in recent years.So, with all this greatness, what could be wrong? Nothing, really. This is a solid film, but it is completely conventional. It doesn't go for the weepy Oscar moments that drown many films and it doesn't try to cover too much of the man's life focusing mostly on his years between his Sun Records contract and his "At Folsom Prison" album. If you have no love for the man himself, or his music, you may walk away underwhelmed, but otherwise you'll be pleased.It is a fairly standard biopic. All a filmmaker needs to make one work is a loved (or hated) subject, a decent lead performance, and as few distractions outside of that as can be managed. That is its flaw, if you must find one."Walk the Line" is a well-made movie. Mangold's direction is capable, and the script stays fairly true to the biographies upon which it was based. It does have excellent performances, but barring a groundswell of support for Cash's legacy (which could arise) I don't see it running away with any awards. It will contend for some due to excellent performances. Considering "Ray" was about a half-hour too long, I'd even go so far as to say it has an excellent shot at a Best Picture nomination. But a win may be difficult.I'd highly recommend it, but don't say I didn't warn you if following the rules is, in fact, a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.I've seen a lot of singer biopics: all the way from the Buddy Holly Story to Coal Miner's Daughter. This one can't quite make it to Coal Miner, but it's light years ahead of Buddy. I read a review today that said that Joaquin was too short and Reese was too pretty to play Johnny and June. The reviewer was right, but what the hell does that have to do with great acting. They got it right and this old hillbilly cried, that's right--cried--at every historical landmark they hit. Oscars for Joaquin and Reese--that's all I want.woody pulpsWalk The Line update 03/19/2006.A retraction is in order. Not only have I come to realize this movie beats all the singer biopics, in my opinion, it beats all biopics and, indeed, has become my favorite movie...period. Read Jack Shaw's comment below. It's worth your time.(I did exactly what you asked and resisted a comment on a comment, but I gave in even though I tried).Oh, and by the way, if Dan John Miller wasn't channeling Luther on the guitar, there is no such thing.Great lines from the movie:June Carter...June Carter...when will you be mine? (sing it to the tune of Hey, Porter). June: I surmise you haven't been to bed. An intoxicated Johnny: surmiiiiiise....Luther Perkins: It's in A....A (nods 'yes' to Marshall Grant).June: I got tangled!woody pulps</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent - review by Johnny Cash close friend and minister</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was delighted when John Carter Cash, invited me to attend the premier showing of "Walk The Line".I hope that those who view this movie will see the spiritual connections between John, his family, and those with whom he choose to associate. I am privileged to have been one of those who John called a friend. And to the producers and directors: It would be a blessing if the story of Johnny and June Cash's remarkable lives is continued from the point at which "Walk The Line" ended.Johnny Cash and I were close personal friends for over twenty years. I loved him as a brother and miss him dearly. In the early 90's he asked me to call him every day? and I did so, as much as possible, for the many remaining years of our friendship. I would talk with him daily whether we were traveling the world, with me as the official 'Johnny Cash Show minister (or evangelist)', or while off the road and at home. We would talk about the things that most friends talk about, but always? always, about God, the Bible, a new or a favorite verse or passage, life's many challenges? and encourage one another in overcoming them.John was one of the brightest individuals I've ever met? and, at times, as the film shows, one of the most troubled. John was one of God's sheep. He was, as the movie shows, living proof that redemption knows no limits other than our own refusal to accept it. Just as evening wolves stalk sheep, so the wolves of darkness pursued John. Yet, somehow, I believe he knew that even though a sheep cannot triumph over a wolf? he can beat it every time by staying close to the shepherd? and showed up at the feet of God quite often.June Carter Cash was also a treasured friend. She graciously laid aside the opportunities of her own career and gifted talent to become John's life-long soul mate and a fiercely loyal devotee to keeping him happy, and making him 'walk the line'. Reese Witherspoon portrayed June accurately. June was also a faithful gatekeeper for John, and taught all of us (who were allowed through that 'gate') the grit and grace of friendship? once a friend? a friend always. The world will never be the same without June? and, likewise; Heaven will never be the same with her there.I deeply enjoyed this film. Overall, I felt that the story was credible and portrayed accurately.I commend Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon for delivering 'believability'. This was certainly a far from easy task, drawing deeply from their God-given talent, when you consider the extraordinary lives of the complex and unique individuals they portrayed.I was appreciative of the spiritual content that was gracefully present for it was such a vital part of their lives. Joaquin Phoenix's insightful handling of the life-long struggle that John endured regarding his brother Jack's disastrous death, renewed deep emotions within me. John and I each lost an older brother in tragic accidents when we were young. This gave me an even deeper sense of, and identification with the pain he suffered, but rarely talked about.There is much more that I could express about this significant film regarding the unique and remarkable lives portrayed in Walk The Line, and the treasured friendship and fellowship that God allowed John and I to share. If John could, I believe he would ask me to help others understand how he felt about God and how he tried to live his life. Therefore, please allow me to share a letter that he wrote to me in Australia."Jack Shaw's ministry, in tandem with the Johnny Cash Show, may be a first in the entertainment business. The Idea came to June and me on a tour last summer. Jack has long been a close friend and prayer warrior for our group and family. Before each concert we form a prayer circle in the dressing room with our family and any other members of the group who wish to join in. Jack leads a five-minute service of scripture reading, sharing and prayer. The service is uplifting and has put a positive power-edge on our performances.Recently we took what I felt was a bold step, in that, toward the end of the concert I introduce Jack (who is positioned near the stage in the audience) and mention that he will be there after the concert to offer free counseling and advice on moral and spiritual matters. I tell them that he is a minister of the Gospel, and will talk to them about their personal problems, drug and alcohol addiction or simply about the Bible and what God has to say to them. As well as daily ministering to the needs of my eighteen-member group, many people have come down to talk to Jack after the concert every night.Lives are changed, souls are saved, spirits are lifted and light is brought into the darkness of many hearts.We are being led by inspiration, and I believe that God is guiding Jack in this great work he is now doing. The potential is unlimited and we feel Jack is just beginning in a great work. He gives us strength and peace through the Word and prayer. June and I feel supercharged, especially for the gospel part of our program. Jack's presence and his involvement in our work has given us an extra portion of joy and enthusiasm.Jack is a humble man, and it is obvious that he only wants to serve God. Believers and non-believers alike have come to know that and respect that. Jack Shaw Ministries has cut a new path and the fruit of the harvest from the seeds sown along the way will be bountiful."

		<shortDescription>Toe-tappingly good fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this film, I had my doubts. Johnny Cash is one of my favourite country singers, nay, singers of all time, and I was unsure as whether, as with other mediocre biopics, namely the flashy Ray, could do him enough justice. As it turned out, Johnny gets the film he deserves, and, what's more, Walk the Line got me extremely interested in the work of his wife, June Carter Cash.Covering 20 years of his life, including Cash's rise into fame and delve into near-self-destruction, James Mangold concentrates on the key things in his life ? his music, the drugs, and his all-consuming, untameable love for the very special June Carter Cash. It is as a romance that Walk the Line truly shines. In real life, Johnny and June didn't get together until 20 years since their first meeting, and that they could wait that long for each other, is quite poignant.Holding the film together are the Oscar-nominated and Oscar-winning figures of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and their chemistry pretty much carries the film. When they're together, they both dazzle, gelling perfectly, whether it's a bout of verbal jesting, they're doing a duet, or just chatting. Phoenix captures the tortured soul of Cash eloquently in one of his finest performances, and one that exudes that dangerous yet enthralling edge of danger present in Cash. His singing voice resembles that of Cash's, yet he never resorts to downright imitation, which only adds to the viewing pleasure.But the shining star of the film is Reese Witherspoon, as June Carter Cash. She plays the singer-songwriter-country music star that grabbed the attentions of Johnny Cash, but proved a hard win, forcing him to quit his narcotic dependence and violent self-destruction before she'd consider him. Although many have disliked Witherspoon's work her, I simply adore it. She makes June a truly memorable, Crouchesque, person. For the audience, she can be goofy and lovable, but alone, with Johnny, she displays a vulnerable side. Witherspoon here radiates a strong, feminist, yet effortlessly lovable vibe, and every scene she appears in, she steals.The look and feel of Johnny's time are captured well in the set design and T-Bone Burnett guitar-led score, and the costumes are nothing short of sublime. The dressing of Cash is inspired, but it is June's clothes ? floral print, pink, domestic, or snazzy, that, again, steal the show. Each of Reese's costumes captures the mood of her characters.There's also great fun to be had in the musical numbers. Ring of Fire and Jukebox Blues allow the audience to get their toes tapping, but my favourite number is the performance of Jackson, where their unmatched chemistry is showcased in one of my favourite songs of all-time. Like the film, this song is entertaining, sweet, and more intelligent than frequently given credit for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Ado Over Not Very Much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely has a biopic film made such a racket at the box office. After viewing the DVD version of WALK THE LINE the reasons for that success must be attached to some sort of homage to Johnny Cash, an American icon of sorts. Yes, his life and career are notable - the emergence of a legendary Country Western singer out of the elements of a warped childhood peaked by the accidental death of his older brother whom the father clearly preferred, and the torture of self doubt that haunted a man through an unsuccessful marriage and a thwarted love for fellow Country Western singer June Carter, his descent into alcohol and drugs, and his final victory over his demons - but isn't this the same story we see almost annually about famous stars whose backgrounds seem templates from this same mold? Joaquin Phoenix is a fine actor and has the courage to take on a variety of roles, succeeding in them all. And yes, he was able to sound like Johnny Cash (given the fact that even Cash's fans will admit it was not a voice of quality but of message). Much the same could be said for Reese Witherspoon's tackling successfully the equally mediocre quality voice of June Carter - again it was her sassy style that made her a star, not her voice. And perhaps that is the reason the writers and director elected to spend most of the screen time on the singing and concerts of Cash and Carter - leaving very little of the story of Cash's life except to outline form between songs.But if you condensed the actual acting time on the screen it falls into the overly familiar family clashes, drunken bouts, weaning off drugs, spats and eventual public displays of feelings that seem to be the formula for this genre of biopic. Though Phoenix and to an extent Witherspoon do well with the material they are given, does the result merit Oscar attention? That is up to the voters. It seems to this viewer that there have been many finer performances by less publicized actors in the smaller films more worthy. But then what are the Oscars for if not for PR for the movies. Just not that impressed. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night, and I've done nothing but talk about the movie and listen to Johnny's music ever since.Without a doubt, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon will be nominated for Oscars for their roles in this movie. Joaquin was just electrifying, and Reese, as the hard-headed but loving June, was simply wonderful. The music was outstanding. I'm glad Joaquin and Reese performed the songs, because I would hate to know that I'd missed hearing what wonderful voices they have. (I was especially happily surprised by Reese's voice. It's gorgeous.) I've read recent reports that the family of Vivian Cash (Johnny's first wife) was upset by how their mother was depicted in the movie, but I don't really understand that. Ginnifer Goodwin, another one who deserves an Oscar nomination, showed Vivian's grief of being alone, raising her daughters alone, and knowing in her heart that her husband was in love with June. According to the movie, Johnny was a horrible husband to Vivian, and I thought the movie did a good job of not sugar-coating that fact. I admit I cheered a little when she smashed the picture of June because you couldn't really blame her for doing that.The supporting characters were also wonderful. It was so nice to see Shooter Jennings playing the role of his father, Waylon. Another Waylon, Waylon Payne, played Jerry Lee Lewis with wide-eyed craziness. I thought Shelby Lynne, who is well-known in the country music industry, was wonderful as Johnny's mother.I didn't know a lot about Johnny's early years with Sun Records, so it was great to see that on screen. I also didn't know that June finally accepted John's proposal while they were on stage singing "Jackson." (I'm assuming that was true and not just movie magic.) This movie, and John and June's love story, was magical. I don't find it surprising that John died four months after June passed. It was obvious that she was the love of his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't Look Away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a country music fan at all. I always respected Johnny Cash and his huge influence over today's music, but I am by no means a big fan of his. That is, I should say until I saw this movie. When I got home from seeing it, I immediately ordered "Live From Folsom Prison" and "Live From San Quinten" on Amazon.This wasn't a movie at all really. It was a two and a half hour tour de force of incredible acting, great music and storytelling. You just don't get bored for one second, and can't look away the whole time. Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this film is one of the best acting jobs in recent years. He isn't acting like Johnny Cash, he IS Johnny Cash. Reese Witherspoon is also great as June Carter. The fact that Phoenix had never sung or played guitar before this movie was filmed caused me to wonder how he was going to pull this off. But his rendition of "Get Rhythm", and "Cocaine Blues" in the Folsom scene are some of the best music performances in movie history. He takes over the screen and just kicks your ass. It is hard to believe that he is not a professional musician.The music performances are enough to make this film worth seeing. But the love story between these two, the way that June and her family helped him back from his drug addiction are what gives the film its heart. I would recommend this film to anyone, Johnny Cash fan or not. If you don't like him now, you will when the movie is over</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walking The Line With Johnny (And Ray)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie yesterday couldn't help but remind me, in a number of respects. to "Ray," a film out a year earlier. Both were biographies of singers of a similar era, the main difference between the color of their skin, Ray being Ray Charles, of course, and this movie about Johnny Cash.Both singers (and films): 1 - had a brother who died early on in their lives which affected them for years and years; 2 - were made to feel guilty about those deaths even though there was no reason for that guilt; 3 - had adulterous affairs as their singing careers began to take off; 4 - became addicted to drugs and beat that addiction; 5 - made bold decisions regarding their careers that went against prevailing thought but turned out to be the right decisions; 6 - movies featured outstanding music and slick photography; 7 - movies were fast-moving and interesting to view all the way through despite being over two hours long; 8 - featured wonderful acting performances.In Walk The Line, Joaquin Phoenix, who plays Cash, goes one up on Jamie Foxx, who played Charles, because Phoenix did his own singing....and he was very good. The same applies to Reese Witherspoon as "June Carter." Her singing talent surprised me. It makes the film all the more believable when you know the actors are actually singing.I am not familiar with Ginnifer Goodwin, who played Cash's first wife, but I think she gets unfairly ignored in the publicity of this film. Perhaps the biggest surprise was seeing Robert Patrick as Cash's father. Wasn't this the same young, trim villain in Terminator 2, which wasn't out that long ago? How can this be the same guy?!!I think this was the better of the two films, not just because of the realism but Charles seemed almost cold, no love in him, no commitment to any woman or his own kids, while Cash has a lot of more heart to him, even if it was misplaced at times.That seems to be the major theme of the WTL movie: the romance between Cash and Carter. Unfortunately, that's my only complaint about this film. This movie glamorizes this affair between Cash and Carter just a little too much, manipulating the audience to the point where we all want this couple to live happily ever after forgetting that Cash was married to another nice woman with two kids. Yeah, some of the ugly parts of adultery are shown but not to the degree the sweetness of this illicit romance is portrayed. The movie does not send a strong enough message that the right thing to do is for Cash to be a good father and husband in the first place and for Carter to stay away from him - period. The worst scene in the film might be Cash's two kids crying their eyes out watching their parents fight. Adultery always kills the kids more than anyone, which is one big reason I was sorry to see the Cash &amp; Carter affair so romanticized.I'd have liked to have seen Cash's prison ministry detailed a little more since he was so faithful in that area, and his Christian testimony in general, which was very strong his last few decades, but the film didn't deal with those last three decades. Too bad, but understandable since there is just so much you can show in two hours. The filmmakers took the tried-and-true road of a romance story instead, which makes sense business-wise.With all the goods and bads, the film succeeds on being a great piece of entertainment with fantastic music, acting, visuals and a guarantee to please a lot of people, almost as many as Cash did in his eventful life. He was an amazing man and a four-hour film about "the rest of the story" would have been fine with me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At one level, this is the same old thing: success, booze, redemption, comeback. Nothing new at all here and the history changed to fit the formula. At another level ? the one most moviegoers will see ? is a concert with background intended to make the concert richer. If you had ever seen John and June perform, you will know that this movie version is a whole lot better. And you may also admit that the reason you went to see them wasn't because of their music, but because of the whole story of them and what they symbolized -- and how that colored the music.In other words, their lives were deliberately part of the show. They made it so, even punching up John's ex-con status and other tough guy attributes. The whole Carter family developed this as a marketing strategy long before John appeared, though their lives were artificially made in the mold of wholesome, white Baptists.So, if you follow these things, what we have here is a nice construction: Two stage performers who make their lives part of their performance, portrayed in another performance (the movie) that features the reverse: lives illustrated through stage performances. Managing all those layers as they have makes this mildly interesting.And the surprise of Reese is something too, though it makes sense if you know the type that southern women played as roles in those days.What's missing is all the interesting stuff. John's obsession with the devil, the theories of his brother being murdered or committing suicide, the long-term weaving of paths with Bob Dylan ? holy and otherwise. The debauchery. The deliberate manipulation of religion in the 70s as part of the public relations of his comeback. His phenomenal loss of weight. The rivalry among his touring mates. Deep, deep, rivalry.Now wouldn't all that real stuff have made a better movie than the formula script we have here?As with all big movies these days, you have the movie proper and you have the beginning sequence. Studios (meaning financiers) take these very seriously and bring in a separate creative team, usually uncredited. This opening is far, far better than the movie itself. It has a whole different feel, obviously a different director and cinematographer. Obviously edited by a different crew.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phoenix Mesmerizing in a Raw Portrait of Masculine Power and Vulnerability</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Walk the Line" is a good movie, but what makes it well worth going out of your way for, even if you are not a country music or Johnny Cash fan, is Joaquin Phoenix's raw, mesmerizing performance of masculine power and vulnerability. Phoenix deserved the Academy Award for this performance, and more.Early in the film, music producer Sam Phillips, in a wonderful speech encapsulating the power of pop music, demands a great performance out of the then unknown "J. R. Cash." Cash, who has not yet sung professionally, and who could have crumpled after Phillips' challenge, slowly emerges out of himself, like a snake emerging out of its skin. Phoenix communicates both the power and the risk of this performance. You heart breaks for what he's going through, and you get goosebumps for what he's about to become. That scene is worth the price of admission.But there's more: success, sex with groupies, drugs, onstage triumphs and embarrassments, near death, and resurrection. Phoenix just knocks every scene right out of the park.Phoenix is unforgettable as a man in love. I've never seen an actor communicate "in love with" a woman as profoundly as Phoenix does here.As for the singing -- Phoenix does his own singing. His voice is close enough to Cash's to work, but it's more than that. It's also arresting and beautiful and worth listening to on its own.There are some weaker performances / underwritten parts in "Walk the Line." Perhaps the filmmakers did this in order to make Cash, a drug addict and adulterer, more sympathetic to the audience. This was a mistake. Cash's story is compelling enough; we could handle placing Cash in a world populated by real people rather than cardboard cutouts."Walk the Line"'s Jerry Lee Lewis and Roy Orbison are not as hyper and unique onstage as they were in real life. Lewis, onstage, was about five times more electrified than he is depicted here. "Walk the Line"'s Elvis Presley is about junk food, trash talk, and drugs. The real Elvis was about those things, too, but he was also something more; that's not even hinted at, here.The worst example of making others look like less so Cash would look like more is the film's portrayal of Vivian Cash, Johnny's first wife. She's just an unbearable horror show of a woman: unsupportive, grasping, snappish. She's not given one sympathetic moment. Vivian and Johnny's daughters have protested that Vivian was not well served by the movie. And Cash's mother is played by an actress who is roughly the same age as Phoenix, and that shows.Reese Witherspoon won the Academy Award for her depiction of June Carter Cash. She is good. The script didn't make as clear her role as Cash's savior as Cash's own comments have.I'm not a huge fan of country music, so I delayed seeing this movie. When I finally saw it what made it worth it, to me, was Phoenix's performance. He's just riveting, in every scene, and well worth seeing this movie for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love saves the day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been very fond of his music but in truth knew pretty little about the man, so i learnt a lot about him when watching this movie. I never imagined that behind his tough cowboy image he was so fragile, delicate and weak. This is a story where love saves the day, otherwise God knows. Although even June Carter seemed prepared to have him once he gets a grip on himself alone first, and I don't blame her. From a troubled childhood, we were taken through an unhappy first marriage, the rise to fame, the hits and the heartbreaks. The movie really finds its feet when singer June Carter shows up and the pairs relationship provides the movie with a heart. Some great performance acting I must admit, pretty outstanding. The story is gripping, with Cash's life providing plenty of juicy material, but ultimately what is revealed is much more fascinating. It was not just the hard times but also, if not mostly, his love of an amazing woman that fuelled most of his musical genius.</fullReview>

I am a big Johnny Cash fan, I grew up listening to him. To tell the truth I feel a little cheated on this one. I was hoping to at least hear some Jonny Cash music. Instead you get a couple of hours of someone else's idea of what Jonny Cash sounded like. If you're interested in relationship movies then you'll probably enjoy this one.

		<fullReview>I don't necessarily want to be spoon-fed a basic story, but some actual interesting events would have been nice? Possibly the only interesting thing in the whole film is Johnny's brave decision to play in the prison as a way of giving himself an identity as someone who gives hope to those who have lost it (and thereby giving himself reason to live). The endless live performances by the cast just frustrated the hell out of me, if I wanted to listen to the man in black live, I could just have bought the recording from Fulsome which would actually have been much better? His father randomly has an element of respect for him at the end of the film? How the hell did that happen? He just woke up one morning and decided 'son, you're the one with all the stories'? I just think the hyperbole which surrounds this film is totally unjustified. The plot is boring, the script is tepid and the cast, Witherspoon aside, totally forgettable. I don't even think it's a case for different people, different tastes, it's just an awful film with so many gaps in the story (which could have been filled by taking out the musical sections) it's just a waste of time to watch?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Dad and Johnny Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My introduction to Johnny Cash's music was when I was eight years old. My father started collecting his albums (8-tracks actually) and whenever we were on the road he'd pop one in and we'd listen to I Walk The Line or Ring Of Fire or Folsom Prison Blues; those were the main ones anyway. My dad wasn't a big music fan back then ? he was extremely selective ? but Cash was his exception. Not knowing what Johnny's music was all about, I really didn't give much thought as to why my father should or shouldn't like the singer ("He sings real good, doesn't he Dad?" "Yes he does"). This might seem more like a family reminiscence on my part but humor me for just one more minute.My father was pretty conservative: he paid his taxes on time without question, was a Marine, believed in the death penalty, enjoyed any kind of sports, and coached in a Pop-Warner football league.Fast forward to this movie, Walk The Line, and I have to wonder why my father felt so strongly for this man's music. Johnny Cash was anything but conservative. Joaquin Phoenix's excellent portrayal of Mr. Cash ? from his humble beginnings on an Arkansas farm to his nearly fatal brush with amphetamine addiction ? shows us all the flaws this incredibly gifted man had balled up inside him. He drank like a fish, womanized while on tour, supported better living standards for prison inmates (something my father would NEVER agree with), and enjoyed the rock-a-billy sounds that were just emerging onto the airwaves. Cash's worldviews were fairly extreme and this spilled over into the lyrics for his songs (just listen to his best-selling At Folsom Prison album and you'll see what I mean).So what was it about Johnny Cash that pulled my dad into his fandom? Well, this movie shows us. Johnny Cash's voice ("Like a freight train coming 'round a bend but sharp as a razor") is hypnotic, and Mr. Phoenix deserves all of the notoriety he's received for playing this role. It's stunning to learn that Joaquin didn't lip-sync any of the songs, but sung them all himself. And although Johnny Cash's voice was a bit coarser and deeper, Mr. Phoenix should be congratulated for his singing talent. He amazed me.The shining light in the movie, however, was Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. Who could've guessed that this Legally Blonde comedic talent could act so dramatically? Her singing voice was wonderful, too, doing all of June Carter's songs without lip-syncing ? just as Joaquin had.But I do have two complaints. First, I didn't much care for the ending. I felt it was abrupt and tried too hard to tie everything up into a nice "family package" in just a few minutes. Second (although not really a complaint but more of a comparison) is that there've been some really great character films done in the past few years, and although Walk The Line ranks right up there with the best of them, I felt that Jamie Foxx did a bit better job in Ray (but I think overall Walk The Line was better as entertainment).Still, this is a great movie with excellent filming and information about an American icon of the music industry. I'm sure my dad loved it, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you'd told me, oh, a year ago that there would be this big-budget movie about Johnny Cash, and it would star Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, there's no way I would have been looking forward to seeing it. Joaquin Phoenix, the bad guy in Gladiator, as Cash? Reese Witherspoon, the cutie pie in Legally Blonde, as June Carter? It would have sounded like a flop borne of hubris and greed.But Phoenix and Witherspoon turn in incredible performances, surely the best of their short careers and among the very best of the year. Phoenix IS Cash - singing the Man in Black's song in perfect imitation. Witherspoon is smashing in what's hopefully a breakout role for her, after so many fluffy, nondescript comedies.Like most biopics, this is a story of redemption, of rising and falling and finding that those who remain with you in your time of need are the ones that should be kept around, their reluctance to do so be damned. We follow Johnny from his early childhood, including the tragic loss of his brother and the rejection of his father, to his opportune recording for Sam Phillips, and his meeting, courtship of, touring with, and proposal to June Carter. In between, we get a pretty good glimpse, courtesy of Phoenix's stunning performance, of the ghosts that haunted Cash throughout his life.It's no surprise that the music is so good, since they're all old Cash tunes, but the fact that Joaquin Phoenix is singing them does offer up a bit of a curveball. Both Phoenix and Witherspoon so completely immerse themselves in the well-known characters of Johnny and June that one would almost expect some caricature, but there's nary a dishonest, insincere beat to their incredible work here.Director James Mangold, who previously directed Girl, Interrupted, hits no false notes here, where even the slightest misstep might have had rabid Cash fans clamoring for his head on a spike. Vividly shot, the film is highly evocative; you feel at times that you're crawling inside Cash's brain, the atmosphere is so intense.And although this is a movie about a man's rising from his own ashes, one of its core themes is also its most wonderfully realized, that of true love and friendship. June Carter stands by her man through all of the bad times, even when his family, particularly his shrewish wife, abandon him out of selfishness and spite. From the first moment Witherspoon and Phoenix share the screen, you can tell they're made for each other, with dazzling chemistry that ultimately lifts the movie to its greatest heights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw it on a DVD and I think it was pretty good especially due to the magnificent performance of Reese Whitherspoon. She was really amazing as she managed to prove her role more leading than Phoenix's. Reese was excellent and allow me to say that I enjoyed her acting much more than Joaquin's. Even though he is an excellent actor the film was hers. Even though I haven't seen any of the other ladies in The ''Leading Role'' nominations I dare say that Reese deserved the Oscar given to her. They both sang very good and I also liked the costumes. I didn't like much the performance of the girl playing Johnny's (bitch) wife. My favourite scene is the one when June refuses to get on stage cause she's wearing her slippers and then finally they give a fantastic show.Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Cash and June Carter a wonderful combination!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1950s was an important period for the popular music that was being created in this country. It was the decade that brought forth the likes of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, June Carter, Patsy Cline, Bob Dylan and the rest of those innovators that sent the popular music of that era to the stratosphere. The music was created by poor rural people that grew up hearing the blues and gospel music in church and at home. The white music stars stole shamelessly from the black artists they admired, but because of the racial climate in the land, they had no chance to make it as big as the white performers.Johnny Cash was an important figure that came out of that time. As portrayed in "Walk the Line", the biographic picture created by its director, James Mangold, and his collaborator, Gill Dennis, they present us an aspect of the man as he was starting in the music business as he goes from poverty and tragedy, early in life, to become one of the most influential exponents of the music that came out of Memphis in the fifties.The film showcases Johnny Cash and his involvement with June Carter, a figure that was legendary in her own right, and through her family which was involved in music. The film shows a man who had the talent, the charisma and the good looks to make it big in the music world with his own material. The film concentrates in the life of Mr. Cash and Ms. Carter prior to their marriage as their lives interconnected with one another because they traveled in the same circuit and usually paired in a lot of those venues. Theirs was a relationship that started on a friendly basis until Johnny messes his life and his marriage to the patient Vivian because he falls in love with June. On the other hand, June didn't want to get involved with a married man and was battling her own demons.The best excuse for seeing the film is the terrific performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who, as Johnny and June, make this film come alive and make the viewer enter their world. Both actors do some of the best work in the movie. In fact, it was a surprise as how well these two dissimilar actors blend so well together, no mean feat for director Mangold.The film offers some of the best songs associated with Johnny Cash. The best part, and the wisest decision for the movie makers, was to let Mr. Phoenix sing the classic songs in his own way. Joaquin Phoenix, who has a good singing voice, also bears an uncanny resemblance with Mr. Cash. Reese Witherspoon makes a splash playing and singing songs that Ms. Carter made famous, although she was eclipsed by the stronger personality of Mr. Cash.The film will not disappoint thanks to the great treatment James Mangold gave the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really engaging and enjoyable biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up Johnny Cash's ambition was to make it onto the radio with his band but as an adult the reality is different. His wife and family are stuck in poor housing and he is frankly terrible at his door-to-door sales job. Unable to turn down his wife's wish to move towns and for him to take a job her father has offered, Cash turns to a local recording studio in desperation. The band's audition is unimpressive and Cash's delivery uninspiring but, giving them one last chance, the studio manager lets them do another song ? which they deliver with much more passion and interest than their weak spiritual material. With a record under his belt Cash begins touring with many other rising rock and country stars as he begins a successful but storming personal and professional life.Without a great love for country music or for that matter biopics, Walk The Line took me some time to get round to seeing but when I did I was glad that I had because it is just simple a good film that rises above the genre. The film starts with formative moments from Cash's childhood and very quickly jumps through to adulthood, marriage and a dead-end job with no future or money. From here we know where the story is heading ? even if some of the viewers may not know the specifics as they apply to Johnny Cash. So we have the career rise of Cash matched with his personal fall ? much of his own making in regards women, drink and drugs. However this content is presented in a solid and engaging way because we care a lot about the characters and what is happening to them.Style-wise Mangold is relentlessly sturdy but never dull in his portrayal of the characters and he does well with the most important part ? his actors. I do recall some questions being asked of the casting and for my money anytime Reese Witherspoon is cast I do ask questions myself. However the cast are roundly impressive and make their characters convincing and engaging. Phoenix is really good and he has great chemistry with Witherspoon, who is also excellent throughout. Robert Patrick was one of the few other faces I recognised and it made me realise that, for a "big" film, there are hardly any established stars here and yet this never even occurred to me till after I finished watching the film. In terms of the musical numbers I'm not sure who was really singing and who wasn't but they are all really good and well filmed to be engaging and exciting.Walk the Line is a really good biopic and I know this because it engaged me as someone with little interest in Cash or his music. In regards narrative it ticks all the boxes that you know it will but yet still manages to make it interesting and never once was I thinking "heard it all before". Of course it also helps that both Phoenix and Witherspoon deliver really effective performances to draw the viewer into the characters from the start and throughout.</fullReview>

I made my decision entirely upon the critics making a fuss of this 'movie epic', not knowing what to expect i decided to take a chance not expecting much greatness.However I was blown away by this touching, personal and painful portrait of Johnny Cash's life. He is a musician i know little about and have been recommended by many others but never have been adventurous enough to buy his LPs And CDs. With fantastic performances from both Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon, Walk The Line was brought to life. Telling the tale of his life starting on a cotton farm in Arkansas to worldwide fame. Through love, through pain, through the music Walk The Line is a sure winner for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>perhaps best movie scene i've ever viewed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Walk the Line" has one of the finest scenes i've ever seen in any movie. toward the end, we see Johnny hosting a family gathering. now that he's been off substances for awhile and been behaving like a responsible husband and father, Cash and his pappy are finally reconciled.Cash's two young daughters are trying to talk to their grandfather through styrofoam cups attached by a string. but, neither they nor their grandfather can hear anything through the cups, because the string is hanging loose.Johnny explains to his pappy that the string has to be pulled taut for it to conduct sound between the cups. Johnny then walks away, suggesting his pappy tell his granddaughters a story.the father, looking utterly perplexed, says he doesn't know any stories. Johnny shoots back: why don't you tell 'em about the time you built a boat and saved your family from a flood? (the incident inspired the Cash tune "Five Feet High and Rising".) this scene revealed the source of what had up until then been the father's lifelong resentment of the son. every boy in America knows the string has to be pulled taught to carry sound between two cups. the only conclusion to be drawn from the father's ignorance of this simple fact of childhood is that he had been too poor to have had a childhood. growing up in the Mississippi Delta, the father probably started working in the cotton fields around age 5 (the same age as his son Johnny later would).but, by contrast with his father, Johnny had never wanted to do anything but play. he was fishing instead of helping his brother when the older boy (their father's favorite) was killed in an accident cutting wood at the saw mill. as an adult Johnny hadn't worked at a regular job -- he played the guitar instead. when he wasn't playing the guitar, he was playing around with alcohol, drugs, and women he wasn't married to.being of Scottish descent, the father was the sort of man who'd have preferred having boiling oil poured into his ear, rather than ever brag about himself. whereas Johnny's career was about self-promotion, to the point of wanting fans to think of him as some kind of career outlaw, which disgusted the father.so, even though the father was the kind of man who, like Noah, had saved his family by building a boat with the flood waters rising, when asked he couldn't think of any story to tell -- just the opposite of Johnny.an incredibly rich, yet economical, scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story of Johnny and June</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not expect much of this bio-pic because I think it is almost impossible to make a good movie about an artist which not only shows the events of his life but also lets a viewer to take a peak inside that artist's mind to show the creative process with all its tension, uncertainty, selfishness and self-centering of an artist. In this regard, "Walk the Line" is nothing special but as a love story, it is wonderful from the first time young Johnny Cash and June Carter met during the show and she got strapped in his guitar until his proposal many years later on the stage (the only place she allowed him to talk to her). Both Phoenix and Witherspoon deserved the highest praise for their performances that were heartfelt, beautiful, sincere, and emotional. I never been a huge fan of Reese even though I always admitted that she had the acting talent ("Election") but with her role in "Walk the Line" and with her acceptance speech, she has earned my respect and admiration. Phoenix was as good as Reese and the chemistry between them was absolutely real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Cash's story is unique, or is it? Country boy goes to the big city and then follow fame, money, sex, drugs and the obligatory decline, but finally love overcomes all obstacles.Yes it's well shot, yes the leads are good, care has been taken to the minute detail in the technical department, but, well, you just know it's gonna flow like this. And mind you, not being from the States, I haven't had a clue about JC's life beforehand. It just seemed to follow the recipe.Now I know a lot of people expect exactly that from a biopic. It generally won't let you down, so it makes a good rental, but there's nothing ground-breaking in there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phoenix Walks the Line into Film History.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Mangold's 2005 film about the early career of Johnny Cash and his enduring courtship of June Carter is a thoroughly entertaining, wholly involving film that bridges a rare gap in being both an introduction to a life lived and a real cinematic joy--a pleasure even on multiple viewings.Clearly a labor of love and effort, Walk the Line was in production for roughly ten years before it was filmed, made by people who sought to tell an accurate story without ever losing respect for their subject.Director James Mangold deserves a lot of credit for taking a tried and tired genre -the biopic- and creating a two hour plus film that never feels too long, too slow, or exploitive in any way. The musical sequences in particular, are fantastic. They are spaced out enough, and electrifying enough that whenever they start, you don't want them to end. Shot on stage behind or next to the actors as opposed to filmed from the audience's point of view, the numbers performed create a truly intimate and breathlessly exciting experience. When Joaquin Phoenix turns in profile and the camera swallows the spotlight's glare that has been illuminating him ---it raises the film above any preceding musical or biopic standard.An immeasurable attribute to these sequences is that Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon (as June Carter) sang and played their instruments themselves. Both are impressive, but it is knowing that the voices are actually coming from the performers themselves, that makes the movie feel like a more impressive overall accomplishment.Even with all of the other merits of Walk the Line, the movie would have certainly failed unless the right person was cast as the lead. Joaquin Phoenix is not only amazing in his singing and guitar playing (the actor lowered his voice several octaves to sing in Cash's key and learned guitar from scratch, playing in Cash's unique style), but the quality of his acting can simply not be overstated. While many rightfully remark on his musical accomplishments (His version of 'I Walk the Line' was recorded in all five keys, in one take--the pros don't even do that) his performance is an exquisite exercise in acting becoming art right before our eyes.There is an acting adage: "If you can say it here (eyes) you don't need to say it here (mouth)." But few actors have ever really accomplished this. They go through the motions, saying lines and moving facial muscles. What is remarkable about Phoenix's performance is that when you watch his eyes, everything is reflected--from within. When June asks about his deceased brother in the diner, you see the flash of pain across them. When his first wife utters that dreadful phrase, "that's my new rule" you feel the chill of contempt. And when he pleads for June to marry him for the last time, you understand his need for her. You never just see his love, his pain, his fear, his dependence--you feel it. It is utterly and deeply convincing and smacks of genuine artistic genius. Perhaps it stems from his "becoming" his characters, in that it never feels fake because it never is fake. He is Johnny Cash in Walk the Line and it is as true a portrait as has ever been committed to film.Witherspoon won an Oscar for what I believe, will be in a few years, widely seen as a vastly overrated performance. She is certainly not a bad singer, though she sounds nothing like the woman she is portraying. But that is okay, few could come close to Carter's voice. The problem, the heart of the mediocrity, lies in her acting. It certainly comes as no surprise that she is spunky, cute, perky, and sassy--she always is, it seems her trademark. But she never transcends, she never ceases to be visibly acting. She seems completely conscious of her performance and as a result, so are we. When she catches 'the boys' drunk one morning and reprimands them, she overworks her face; she is trying too hard. As a result we never see a real person living, we see an actress trying to act. Through the quality of the writing and the fact that she is playing a warm, engaging woman, she didn't have to do much to be likable, certainly. But her performance feels all surface, and in her eyes--it's Reese Witherspoon. Her Oscar win would seem undeserved, but when you know how they are decided and how people win, it comes as no surprise. The highest praise I can think to offer Walk the Line is to admit that I knew very little about Johnny Cash, and now I own some of his music and one of his books. It did more than entertain--it made me care. Phoenix's performance has been called effortless, maybe this is why some viewers seemed to miss the immense acting achievement it truly was. For it takes much more skill to appear effortless than to be labored under the weight of the role. He actually managed to make slipping into the mind of Johnny Cash look effortless.Really, that may be what I remember most about this film. But as a biopic, it feels like a fitting portrait of the Man in Black. Though Cash fans already have the memory, the mental picture of the legend, Walk the Line shows us how he became one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite "Ray...with white people",but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...the similarities are there. This biopic of another music legend,this time Johnny Cash, uses about the same map of storyline: popular-but-troubled superstar comes from very poor backgrounds(Ray Charles from rural,tenant farming Northern Florida,Johnny from rural,dirt-farming Arkansas),both witness traumatic events involving their brothers(Ray's brother drowns to death in front of him,Johnny's brother is sawed in half and bleeds to death in front of him),both take up music as somewhat of a pipe-dream,both find love with women who are far more straight-laced than they(Ray's wife Della Bea and Johnny's second wife,June Carter,are singers in gospel traditions. Johnny's first wife,Vivian,is a conservative,non-entertainment involved housewife),both endure spiraling drug addictions,both bottom out,both reach "defining moments" and both rise above their lowest moments with the help of family and TRUE friends.Director JAmes Mangold's movie is something that frames the man and legend of the Man In Black very nicely,period. Throw in Reese Witherspoon's subtle,pained performance as June Carter(soon-to-be Cash) and nice turns from Robert Patrick and Shelby Lynne as Johnny's folks,RAy and Carrie Cash. It,also like Ray,is almost entirely a film built about and around the main character,so it seems to be tough to separate it from its star,so Joaquin Phoenix has a HUGE burden of carrying this film as Cash,and while he isn't quite as indistinguishable from his character as Jamie Fox seemed to be from Ray Charles,he still fills out Cash's shoes more than adequately and gives you some emotional depth that is necessary to make this film feel right. Fans of Cash will especially feel edified by this picture,but even people who may not quite be fans of the legend should get something out of seeing this,too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK Biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie seemed like a remake of "Ray" with a touch of "The Doors." It seemed to have elements of just about every biopic about a pop musician ever made, including: What's Love Got to Do With it, The Rose, Coal Miner's Daughter, Stardust, Almost Famous, That'll Be the Day and Velvet Goldmine.It starts with Cash's poor tough childhood on a farm and the tragic death of a brother only a year or two older. He doesn't get on with his Dad and later on his first wife doesn't understand him. Both are recurring causes of angst and friction. Cash has talent and success inevitably follows. Cash has a period where he does everything to excess, including drugs, drink and groupies. There are a lot of concerts with time spent on tour buses. He meets June Carter, falls in love and is eventually saved by the love of a good woman. The story was so predictable that I didn't really care about the characters.Reese Witherspoon's June Carter is sweet, perky, sensible and very likable. However, I didn't understand why she deserved an Oscar or why she would like the person portrayed by Joaqin Phoenix. Cash seemed confused and behaved like an irrational little boy lost. I saw Cash on TV in the late 1960s and he was smart, funny, confident and very much in control. Phoenix lacked the charisma and vocal chops the role demanded. Overall the movie was formulaic, and given the hype I was disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a Johnny Cash fan or even if you're not, this is one entertaining movie. The movie chronicles the life of Johnny Cash from his early years up to June Carter agreeing to marry him in my home town of London, Ontario. This movie doesn't really take a lot of liberties like some true stories, but instead sticks squarely to the facts. Johnny Cash would be proud of this film. Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon (though they don't really look their parts) do a phenomenal job as Johnny Cash and June Carter. Every actor in the film put their all into the role and it made it great.This movie has just the right amount of balance between Cash's personal life and his professional life, and it keeps the viewer entertained. Joaquin Pheonox did his own signing for the role, and though it wasn't dead on like Johnny's it was eerie how close it was. Reese Witherspoon was also surprisingly good at singing. She really deserved the best actress win at the Golden Globes, and Joaquin deserved his win as well, and I think that they might have a chance at the Oscars. It really is a shame that Walk the Line isn't nominated for Best Picture, because I think it might have won.This is one of the best films of 2005, and one of the best biopics I've ever seen. Definitely see this movie. It's a good time.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ladies and gentlemen, Johnny Cash!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Cash gets the big screen treatment a year after Ray Charles. I must admit, though, that initially I had reservations about this film. Honestly now, I feel that it's very much the kind of film we're subjected to every now and then. You know, that based on a true to life story of someone who rose to top after being down that's bound to jerk the tears out of you.So somehow I entered the theater having the wrong expectations but went out getting a different impression. Yes, considering its Hollywood nature, it can be manipulative at times and it still has to follow a certain formula, but director James Mangold ("Girl, Interrupted," "Identity") manages to make "Walk the Line" more than its narrative of a celebrity who stumbles and rises up again. It's a film featuring superb performances and some nice crooning.As I've said, "Walk the Line" is the story of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix). It follows his childhood days in rural Arkansas, through his early music career, through his obsession with future wife June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), and through his inevitable downfall.Of course, the thing with biopics is that if you've seen enough of the genre you'll presume you'll know how the story will unfold up until the credits and then you can figure out the theme of life-affirmation. But that's hardly fair with the point of the movie. The film is about the character of Cash and how his humanity has failed to cope with everything that's happened in his story. Mangold and his co-writer Gill Dennis brilliantly stayed faithful to the story of the man they were paying their respects to."Walk the Line" is set in the post-World War II era, with culture in general and music in particular experiencing a great transition. It's underlined with a cinematography that borders on retrospective. There's one gorgeous shot during one of Cash and his band's performance which I think was done somewhat in high contrast, and it added a touch of sophistication and subtlety to the scene. It's this great use of technique that gives the film its emotional impact.Of course, no review of the film is ever complete without saying something about the performances of the leads. Honestly, I think this is Phoenix's best performance to date. His authentic portrayal of the legendary singer is complemented with great crooning and such a delicate tenderness. Witherspoon's performance gives soul to the film, and her understated voice is a joy to listen to. She proves how talented actor she is and that she's more than the roles she usually plays.In the end, I liked it. It's still formulaic, but not in the same vein as most of its predecessors have gone through. Fans of Cash may be glad to know that Mangold has brought them their idol's time of his life with a film filled with nice writing, brilliant direction, and great acting and singing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're Going Down, Down, Down in a Burning Ring of Oscars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Walk the Line" is every bit as compelling and well made as last year's "Ray." Like that film it avoids the typical biopic trappings with straightforward direction and a lead player, in this case Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash, who totally immerses himself in the role to give a truly authentic and moving performance. This film also benefits greatly from Reese Witherspoon, who turns in a fiercely real and powerful performance as June Carter. She's even more of a surprise and delight than Phoenix, as the casual movie-goer would've never suspected such a raw and endearing performance like this for Ms. Witherspoon, who's usually regulated to throwaway rom-com roles. These two kids are without a doubt the Oscar front-runners for best actor and actress.The central storyline of this film, which uses flashbacks and stage scenes judiciously, is the slow, long, and genuine love affair that developed between Cash and Carter. The chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon is electric, and they make it easy to see how these two consummate performers were able to make their greatest music together. There's also great fun to be had in the revelation of the real stories that inspired the amazing lyrics and songs that millions of people came to love. Like all good biopics it shows us the good times and the bad, Cash's troubled childhood to his redemption at Folsom prison, and it makes you want to go out and buy every bit of Johnny Cash's and June Carter's recordings. With the great performances and amazing music, you can't really ask for more from a flick like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hello....my name is Joaquin Phoenix and I AM Johnny Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I watched this movie, Johnny Cash was just a name to me. I knew the name but if anyone asked me to name one of his songs or sing one of the songs, I would have given them a shrug of the shoulders and a blank stare. So when "Walk the Line" was released in the cinemas, I really didn't know if I was interested enough to watch it. But a friend persuaded me and so I went. That was May 2006 (or thereabouts). Now it's January 2007 and I have just watched it on DVD for the third time."My momma told me son, always be a good boy and don't ever play with guns...".The lyrics are now ingrained into my memory, his songs as familiar to me as my other favorite singers. Watching the movie for the first time made me go to iTunes afterwards and buy four of his albums! In other words, this movie is magnificent and you will have the words to his songs stuck in your head forever. Watching the movie, you'll be sub-consciously tapping your feet and your shoulders will start to sway back and forth...when Phoenix stops singing, you'll be shouting at the screen for him to sing another song."Love is a burning thing...and it makes a firey ring..." Some of the elements of the movie are fairly standard as with other movies dealing with the life of a famous person - the inevitable conflicts with parents, the marriage problems with the first wife, the affair with the woman destined to be your second wife, the alcohol, the drugs, a death in the family and how it all makes the subject stronger and makes them go on to bigger and better things (the saying that "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"). So in that respect, I found myself bored a little.But where it livens up is the music. Phoenix IS Cash. He looks like Cash as a young man and Phoenix gets the voice right and the music is top-notch. Reese Witherspoon delivers a knock-out performance as Cash's long-suffering singing partner, June Carter.The best part is at the beginning of the movie when we get a slow close-up shot of the deserted yard at Folsom Prison and then we hear the steady THUMP-THUMP-THUMP of the prison audience stamping their feet and patiently waiting for Cash, while the back-up band plays warm-up tunes and looking nervous, thinking the prisoners are going to go crazy and start smashing things. Meanwhile in the back, Cash is in a dream and when the prison warden approaches him, Cash is suddenly transported back to his childhood in 1944 and there his story starts.When you watch this, be prepared to be singing Johnny Cash songs for weeks afterwards! Then put aside some time afterwards to go shopping for a nice guitar because if "Walk the Line" doesn't inspire you to start playing the guitar yourself, nothing will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of country legend Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) is told through his ongoing romance with fellow singer June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) and how they get through tough times, from Cash's pill popping addiction to Carter's own marital troubles until finally agreeing to marry Cash.Walk the Line is an excellent look into Johnny Cash's life. It didn't shy away from telling the truth and most of the film was accurate. Before seeing Walk the Line, I didn't really like Johnny Cash's music. By the end of the movie though, I couldn't get enough of it. I still think Johnny Cash was an unlikable person but his music was fantastic. Even if you don't care for his music, the film is still worth checking out. James Mangold did a pretty good job behind the camera but it wasn't Oscar worthy. He moved the movie at a decent pace and it was hardly ever boring.The screenplay was good but it wasn't completely realistic. For example, they portrayed Vivian Cash in such a negative and selfish way. In the film, she didn't really seem to care about Johnny and his music. She also didn't really help him during his drug problem but that was completely untrue. The writing followed a pretty basic biopic formula and it wasn't hard to figure out where things were going. Also, the majority of the movie was depressing yet I still enjoyed the film. At least the ending was a happy one.The acting was fantastic with a couple of Oscar worthy performances. Reese Witherspoon was excellent as June Carter Cash. In some of her previous films, she was clearly just looking for a paycheck and she just phoned in her performance. In Walk the Line though, her singing was strong and her emotions never felt forced. While I think Felicity Huffman did a better job, I don't mind her winning the Oscar. Joaquin Phoenix was just as good as Reese. His singing was good and he had an engaging chemistry with Reese. Unlike Jamie Foxx's performance, they didn't imitate their characters, they became John and June Carter Cash. Ginnifer Goodwin was okay, a bit weak during the emotional scenes. Robert Patrick gave a decent performance, nothing special. In the end, this wonderful film is worth checking out. Rating 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie for me is so accurate to portray the real Johnny Cash and June Carter. I like when Reese Whiterspoon and Joaquin Phoenix sang by themselves so I can feel that they really sang that song, it is uncommon since the actor and the actress in many documentary movie usually sing by lip sync, you know that. Honestly, I don't know a lot about who Johnny Cash and June Carter really are because i am just 19 years old now, I just realize that they were two of the most famous stars in the United States at that era when i saw Elvis Presley. O.K. I can say that the story is touching me, I mean this is a very good dramatization of the real life of the real persons. For me, Reese Whiterspoon acting was outstanding and she deserved to get Oscar for Best Actress.</fullReview>

I didn't know anything about his past and this movie was not only great, but it also lets the audience learn about the past and what drives a musician. What I thought was great was the fact that Johnny had so much love and passion for June. It wasn't just an actor lip-syncing, he actually did his own singing and it amazingly sounded like Johnny. Reese also did a good job portraying June Carter. It is definitely a good movie to own. I usually don't watch these type of movies, but it was a really good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film; Great Acting/Chemistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow this is a great film. So good that I was surprised when I saw Cash's San Quentin performance this week on TV, I was struck by how very much unlike Johnny Cash Joaquin Phoenix's performance seemed to be, whether actually singing and playing, or say simply talking on stage. The real Johnny Cash seemed much more the exuberant extrovert, and, among other things, brighter, sharper, looser. Phoenix's Cash is darker and much quieter, but at the same time does not quite show us the Johnny Cash that wrote "I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die." But as to this latter point, it may be that no film is big enough to show the whole of Johnny Cash, a very complicated guy.No doubt that Phoenix truly captures much of essence of Cash. Because of that, and many other things, there is real magic in this film. Witherspoon and Phoenix simply crackle together. Their chemistry lights up the screen. Is this simply acting, or are these two somehow cosmically in synch. No one could doubt that these two as portrayed in the film would be together, and I sense that this is the essence of the Carter/Cash relationship, too. The sense if that if you meet folks that resonated like this in real life, you would know immediately that they quite a couple.Most of the cast provides acting of the very best kind. The director has to get credit for that kind of overall effort.The sense, too, is that the performances and the takes on the creative processes are spot on. This must be what is like to be this kind of celebrity/performer. I have only seen it once, so I can break it down, but I bet things like the lighting, costumes, colors, soundtrack (even apart from the fantastic vocal numbers), camera angles, etc., are a school for how to make a convincing film. I am sure that each contributes to creating an engrossing world on screen.I would say this is a real film, too, in that the narrative is not so important as the creation of a convincing universe, with individuals taking completely understandable actions within that universe. Thus, the movie explores and reveals something of the human condition.This one has Oscar written all over it, certainly for Phoenix and Witherspoon. Their performances are simply not to be missed by anyone that cares about film-making. I would expect Phoenix's efforts to influence lots of other actors. What he does is very effective with an economy of overt speech and movement. Talent by the gallon. Mesmerizinig to watch.I only gave it an 8, because parts of the story-line, the narrative, seem trite, as if playing to the larger audience. Too much bathos in places. Phoenix is utterly convincing as man that has had great sorrow in his life. The narrative is distracting to me by dwelling on specifics. The point is not what happened to Cash, but what man was created.But what is good in this movie, which is most of the movie, is tremendous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but Lacks a spark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good family movie. Good performances, good storytelling, good music ( of course if you like Johny Cash). It looks like many other autobiographic movies, but tells the story of Johny Cash instead of Elvis Presley, John Nash or anyone else. It lacks something that unifies itself from other movies like it. Walk The line follows a common formula of a Rise - Fall - Rise again,but except of the tragic opening, the movie isn't a tear dropping experience, and not too dramatic. Except this, the movie is abundant with good music, some funny moments and never boring.I didn't read the biographies of Johny Nash, so I don't know in which detail he portrayed his life, and what part of it the director did not show us. What the director focused about is the developing love between Johny Cash and June Carter Cash throughout a decade, until they got married. This part done exceptionally well. One can feel the true love between them. So if we don't look at it as a biography, it is a great love story.There are other aspects of Johny Cash's life that were briefly shown but weren't developed. One of those is the relationship he had with his fellow musicians in the Sun Records. We see brief performances of Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis, names that everyone know and that the main Character been close to (they toured together) for a while, but we don't see the interaction between them (or lack of interaction). We also see a brief scene with Johny Cash and Walon Jennings, when they shared an apartment together, also without too many words about them.My point in the last paragraph is, that we study people not only by their stories but also by their relationship with others, and how others see them. We also could learn something about Elvis or Jerry Lee Lewis from the way Johnny Cash saw them. That part of his biography lacked for me in this movie.The biggest surprise for me was that the main characters did all the performances by themselves. I think that Reese Witherspoon may start a singing career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to avoid the comparison with Ray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walk the Line is a good film, presenting some of the highlights of the life of the great Johnny Cash and the love of his life June Carter Cash. Reese Witherspoon is INCREDIBLE, and Joaquin Phoenix is as good as he usually is in this well made biopic. For me, the music was a real highlight of the film, and the distracting similarities between the life of Mr Cash (or at least the aspects of it chosen for display in this film) and that of Ray Charles sort of took away from the overall plot.Ray made me a Ray Charles fan, though I had been familiar with Mr. Charles music for about 35 years, until the film, I didn't appreciate him properly. I have been a Johnny Cash fan for about 25 years, but from my perspective, Walk the Line was simply not as powerfully done as Ray.The Parallels between the two men's lives are bizarre, and though I know it really isn't fair to compare two whole lifetimes, I can't help thinking that some of the choices made in the selection of lifetime thresholds for WTL may have been influenced by what worked in Ray.Mangold's direction creates a very polished though somewhat Hollywood film, and the editing, script and pace of the film are all very strong.Nevertheless, this is a solidly entertaining and well made film, worth seeing for Witherspoon's amazing and lovable performance and the music alone. I also very much enjoyed Joaquin's excellent imitation of Cash's stage presence and facial expressions, but felt that his vocal impressions were just a tad over-rated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is the epitome of Hollywood insult</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never felt so insulted after watching what I expected to be a simple, entertaining film. The writing in this film is terrible. The dialogue clearly explains every psychological reason for every one of Cash's actions. What happened to subtlety? Yes, I see that he was especially driven to drugs and alcohol because of his father and his love for June. The reality of his life tells us that. We do not need to see him cry as a child "don't leave me alone Jack." We also do not need to see him shoving pills and alcohol down his throat like a stoner eating doritos. I just feel like the writers and director of this film wanted to make Cash's life into a simple, formulaic love story that anyone could understand. Hollywood has, once again, wasted a perfectly good and interesting story. They feel they need to dumb things down and simplify them so much that they can cease to be fresh and interesting. That is a complete shame. This film is what most people will think of when they think of Johnny Cash and that is truly unfortunate. He is a terribly important musician and a man who led an interesting life. You've done it again Hollywood. And you cashed in. Thanks to everyone who thought that this movie was actually something good. Aside from the story, which is most important, the film was a technical disaster. The costumes were good, as were the colors, but the filming and editing were a mess. I'm so sorry for the state that mainstream film is in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joaquin and Reese were absolutely amazing!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still can't believe they sang every song in the movie. I stayed to watch the credits role to see who the actual vocals were done by and I was awe struck. I thought Joaquin a fine actor (extremely handsome too) before this movie and knew that his star would eventually shine once given the "right" script/movie and this is it. He brought Johnny Cash back to life and introduced me to this music for the first time. If Joaquin doesn't WIN the best actor Oscar for this, shame on the Academy!Reese Witherspoon should seriously consider a singing career, along with her acting career. There are so many other actresses out there that are and she has so much more talent. If she hadn't starred in this movie, this would definitely be the case of talent wasted. I wished the movie was longer! It touched my heart because the actors didn't seem like they were "acting"! I have hope once again that true love does indeed exist!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a WALK to a Different "Country"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...........................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA.....and ORLANDO, FL In L. A., California, in the 50s and 60s, my daily habit of listening to TOP 40 Radio exposed me to just about every kind of music genre, pretty much all of the time! Interestingly, I eventually acquired a taste for just about all of them, to one degree or another! Well, pretty much everything?Jazz, not so much, really, and definitely NOT at all: "Country" music. The ONLY Country album I EVER bought in my ENTIRE life (Well, at least before turning 50!) was "Johnny Cash: His Greatest Hits"! Upon realizing that they had released a movie about his life, it immediately went to the top of my "Must See" list! What was it about his music that gave it such widespread appeal? Exactly what made Johnny Cash so special? It would be nice to be able to provide a simple, straightforward answer to both questions, but in the film, Walk the Line, it is all too clear, that in real life, when it comes to a human being, things sure can get extremely complicated! So, here we end up with a movie that mirrors the life of its lead character: very interesting, entertaining, multifaceted, but at the same time, often dark, brooding and conflicted! WALK is a film I can wholeheartedly recommend no matter how you feel about Johnny Cash and/or his music.Quite frankly, for the role of Johnny Cash, Joaquin Phoenix (GLADIATOR) is not someone who would have made my short list, or even my long list, for that matter! Wow, what a surprise! This actor, who was born in Puerto Rico, demonstrates tremendous versatility, both as an actor as well as a singer... (Yes, that is Joaquin Phoenix's own voice in the movie!) However, I think that, at times, Mr. Phoenix comes up just a little bit short when it comes to his ability to project his voice firmly, but his performance, in general, was so masterful, that this point is quite easily overlooked.What really drives WALK, what gives it its soul and keeps it focused and centered is the repressed romance between Cash and the love of his life, June Carter (Reese Witherspoon - Legally Blonde, Cruel Intentions) Joaquin Phoenix, despite shining in the title role, is overshadowed by Witherspoon's overwhelming screen presence in the scenes where they appear together. Previously, she had never really flagged my attention that much, perhaps other than her notable characterization of Tracey Flick in ELECTION. In most of her roles she seemed to be type cast as the syrupy sweet, but at the same time, somewhat annoying girl next door! WALK is well worth any time and money you invest to see Reese demonstrate her considerable acting talents ... And how clearly she demonstrates just how stunning those abilities are! Surely, Walk the Line, for many reasons, invites comparison with another film about the life of another famous musician, RAY. Perhaps, there are many common elements in the life of famous musicians: A tragic childhood, years struggling in anonymity, problems with alcohol and drugs, a great deal of conflict and tension in their affectative relationships and great difficulty accepting and managing fame and money. But after all, each story is real and each contains many elements that distinguishes it from others! 8*...ENJOY!/DISFRUTELA! Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Espa?ol, are welcome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but unfaithful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me get this right out there - I am a Johnny Cash fan. So there are two aspects of this movie that are important to me: 1) Is it a faithful biopic about the man? 2) Is it a good entertaining movie? Look - I can live with this film as a great movie that tells a compelling story. The performances by the two leads are absolutely credible and at times they just blow you away.I really enjoyed this film. It is dark in parts, it does a good job at hinting at the wild man in Johnny Cash without turning him into a villain or anything, and June Carter Cash is portrayed as just a wonderful woman (and I am sure that she was).However - you do have to understand that there is artistic license here to make this stuff fit for cinema.The film is relentlessly unfair to Johnny Cash's first wife. Vivian (his first wife) has been described as devoted to her husband, supportive of his music, and faithful throughout their time together. She was with Johnny throughout all the hard times of financial struggle, they had two kids together, and according to most sources they had a loving happy marriage. Had Cash not become the icon and the star that he did, that marriage probably would've held firm. In the film Vivian is portrayed as a woman who is never happy, who nags her husband for more, as possessive, as jealous and materialistic. It also suggests that Vivian criticised Johnny's music, undermined him, and tore down his dream.In reality Vivian was supportive, hardworking, loyal and celebrated his love of music. I think Johnny Cash would be the first person to say that his own behaviour, his fame, his abuse of drugs, his time on the road, and his infidelity were unfair on Vivian.Johnny Cash and Vivian Cash were married 12 years before they divorced, although it seems that this film trivialises that and just wants to treat her as a mistake that happened before June Carter arrived.Let's be perfectly honest here June Carter really struggled with her conscience when it came to loving Johnny Cash. When they got together he was a very bad man - a drug addict, and a man with a wild and unpredictable temper. He got banned from the Grand Ole' Opry for smashing all the footlights. June herself was a married woman (twice previously) and having a religious background wrote 'Ring of Fire' to express how she felt about Cash - she thought she was going to hell.I'm pretty sure that Johnny Cash would have portrayed either his relationship with Vivian nor his relationship with June in such a lopsided way. Nor do I think that Cash would've portrayed himself as such a victim when it came to the drugs.Other scenes are made to fit the mood and the mojo of the film. For example when Cash saw Sam Phillips for the first time at Sun Records he didn't get signed and they didn't make a record.Phillips did warn Cash off gospel music (saying that he couldn't sell it) but Cash certainly didn't play 'Folsom Prison Blues' to him. The track that caught Sam's attention was the far less incendiary (and more duke box friendly) 'Hey Porter'.When Phillips did hear 'Folsom Prison Blues' he wasn't convinced by it immediately and didn't really look at putting it out until 'Cry Cry Cry' was done.What the film doesn't really reflect is that Cash didn't just write those dark moody tracks - he wrote chart friendly commercial stuff too, like 'Get Rhythm' and so on.You get the idea.Anyway - it's a superb film, even if it isn't a completely sincere telling of the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing job at recreating Johnny Cash's songs, he did it so well you almost couldn't tell the difference between the two. And Reese Witherspoon IMO didn't deserve the Oscar as much as Joaquin but she did an outstanding job as well.The film tells the life story of the man in black himself, Johnny cash. The film is overall great and entertaining throughout. Honestly I think some of the stuff wasn't portrayed close to the way things originally happened but they still portrayed it well enough.Film lovers, fans of cash, and most people in general could enjoy this film. Of course some people may not enjoy it but I can speak for most when I say it's good and worth watching. Check it out at least once to see for yourself. Thanks for reading my review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best pictures of all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewers notes: 1. The somewhat counter-intuitive idea that you could do a biopic of an iconic singer seems (other members can correct me) to have taken root with the 1978 Buddy Holly film, where Gary Busey did such an outstanding job that (irony) it is generally believed the work will be the only role of his remembered by future film historians; 2. On paper the idea of having Withersoon and Phoenix portray (and mimic) two of the best known voices of their era should not have worked but OMG it did -- Ritherspoon's press interviews emphasized how nervous she was, and how she had given up singing years earlier, but it still worked. If you listen to the "real" sound clip in the closing credits, you can instantly hear major differences, but (pardon me for repeating) it worked anyway; 3. Was Gil Dennis robbed? This was one of the tightest scripts I have ever seen (including the wonderful scene where, in the band car, a bunch of drunken men are considering the certainty they will each end up in Hell, and, out of the front seat, Witherspoon's character innocently asks if she will too, and gets an emphatic, no!, because (quote) "You're beautiful, June" (unquote). My guess is that, since the story was lifted from both an official and an unofficial biography, the award people were nervous about where the books ended and where the script started...? My guess is they messed up, and did not give the writers proper credit; 4. This is not merely a great biopic and simultaneously a great love story (with real sparks on screen) this is a great film. Have seen it 4 times and it gets better each time. 5. Did Witherspoon deserve the Oscar? Absolutely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a country fan all of my life, I grew up listening to Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, etc. All of the old greats. I was really impressed with how well Joaquin Phoenix played his role. Not only did he sound so much like Johnny, but his mannerisms were right on the money. You would almost believe it was Johnny Cash himself starring in his own movie. I remember the 60s and 70s when he looked so much like Joaquin did in the movie. I certainly hope he gets an award for the part he played. I don't believe I've ever seen anyone do a better job. Being a great Waylon Jennings fan, however, is the reason for this email. In the movie when it showed Waylon and Johnny living together, it portrayed Waylon with long hair and a beard. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty certain that at the time that scene was taking place, Waylon was still clean shaved and had wavy hair that he combed back. The movie ended in 1968 and that was when Waylon made his Hangin On album at which time he was still clean shaved and had slicked back hair. It wasn't until he was in the hospital a few years later, ready to quit, that he decided to try it one more time, "his way", that he changed his look, took control of his music and the rest is history! Was this just Hollywood or was there another reason for his appearance in that scene. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't detract from the quality of the movie at all. Most people who aren't lifelong Waylon fans, like myself, wouldn't even know what I'm talking about. Anyway, this was a great movie with a great cast and although I only saw it two days ago, I'm already looking forward to seeing it again. Keep up the good work!</fullReview>

How on earth were they able to get those 2 actors to sound like the real singers?? They might have average voices but somehow they were able to make this sound 100% real and authentic. I loved seeing the old Fender,Gibson and Martin guitars. The clothes, hards, cars, guitars, homes, hotels---everything looked like it came out of a time machine!!! I like movies that are historically accurate. I don't know too much about Mr. Cash but I hope they did his family and his life's story justice with the movie. I loved seeing the peripheral characters too--Sam Phillips, Elvis, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis.Hollywood knew what we wanted to see and hear. It's like they listened to Mr. Sam Phillips advice to Johnny Cash at the first audition--"you have to believe in yourself--play songs that make people want to buy them"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best biopics I have seen in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually don't go for true-life stories but I had to watch this because I like Reese Witherspoon and I like musical movies.Walk The Line is an Oscar winning biopic based on the country singer Johnny Cash who is famous for wearing black and his battle with drugs. The film centres on J.R Cash as a child who's father used to bully him over the death of his brother John Cash who died as he got caught in a saw when he was doing work. A few years later we see a grown up J.R (Joaquin Phoniex who left the movie business behind him to focus on rapping but fear not it was a hoax)who works in the RFA as a air pilot. While he is at work he writes a song called I hang my head and cry(dunno the name of the song)and it becomes an instant hit.He goes to a record deal in his hometown and his first single was the song he sang at the RFA. He later meets June Carter(played by the brilliant Reese Witherspoon who got an award for this movie)whom he falls for as she had 2 failed marriages one was with a stock car driver the other was a lorry driver.Of course John is married with 3 young girls from Vivenne who was a right pain as she was always moaning and sulking and he hadn't a life with her at all,whereas when he is with June she helps him become a better man as he is addicted to drugs and with her help he soon stops taking them.What I like about this film is that I like how it centres on Johnny Cash's life and on his childhood and the chemistry between Phoniex &amp; Witherspoon was very good I could watch them together in a different movie if they ever got the chance to work with each other again. Reese was fantastic as the feisty southern bell June Carter who looked unrecognizable without her blonde hair. Joaquin was brilliant as Johnny Cash even though he looked a lot like Elvis Presley in a way.I love the part where Johnny proposes to June on stage and at first she said no and then she said OK and he lifts her up in the air and says she finally said yes as they were kissing. My only downside to this film is that it was kinda hard to follow in some parts and the ending wasn't what I expected as I thought we could see Johnny &amp; June as an old couple before they died and they were raising their children.Having said that I truly liked it and if you are a Johnny Cash fan or a Reese Witherspoon fan then check it out cause it is very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Lives On In Joaquin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1955, a tough, skinny guitar-slinger who called himself J.R. Cash walked into the soon-to-be-famous Sun Studios in Memphis. It was a moment that would have an indelible effect on American culture. With his driving freight-train chords, steel-eyed intensity and a voice as deep and black as night, Cash sang blistering songs of heartache and survival that were gutsy, full of real life and unlike anything heard before. That day kicked off the electrifying early career of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix). As he pioneered a fiercely original sound that blazed a trail for rock, country, punk, folk and rap stars to come, Cash began a rough-and-tumble journey of personal transformation. In the most volatile period of his life, he evolved from a self-destructive pop star into the iconic "Man in Black" -- facing down his demons, fighting for the love that would raise him up, and learning how to walk the razor-thin line between destruction and redemption. As his music changed the world, Cash's own world was rocked by the woman who became the love of his life: June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Walk The Line 10/10</fullReview>

Both Phoenix and Witherspoon are excellent in their roles, giving fully-rounded portrayals and displaying the great chemistry that the real-life couple must have shared. Witherspoon is perfect as June, spunky, warm and strong, and her performance makes you wonder why she is still wasting her time doing crappy romantic comedies like "Just Like Heaven". I'm not saying she should do a Meryl Streep and go after every dramatic role in Hollywood (because, after all, her performance as June is really quite atypical of most of the Best Actress wins), but the lady clearly has talent and deserves better films. Phoenix also does a great job with Johnny Cash, he is intense and flawed, and deeply in love with June Carter. Both did their own vocals, and I'm very impressed! The songs are paced well, and the film really captures the feel of the era. I read a few average reviews of the film at the time of release, but heck, I LOVED it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walk the Line isn't another one of those ordinary films, its a masterpiece of epic proportions. From it's unforgettable screenplay to its majestic and searing acting, every level is raised to its highest. James Mangold (3:10 to Yuma) delivers his all, and quite certainly is his best. The stylish camera shots and motions all add tension to the films story and give real importance to the emotions of the main characters. Joaquin Phoenix IS Johnny Cash and there's no reason to question it either. He wears the role as if he were Johnny Cash, and conquers it throughout the film. Joaquin Phoenix is pure dynamite as Johnny Cash; the acting, the rhythmic style and of coarse the voice of a legend. Phoenix whilst also portraying Cash endeavours his own voice that to me sounds better than the real life Johnny Cash. Reese Witherspoon who won a Oscar for her bold portrayal as Cashe's love interest June Carter certainly doesn't let up. Her voice and soul of the character makes her more believable and intriguing for audiences to watch and definitely should highly be praised for winning the Oscar.Walk the Line is a fine masterpiece and best film of the year. The performances are electric and phenomenal as is the direction of a working genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie yesterday. Or rather, I should say that I saw the second half of it. I missed the first half but found the film so engrossing that I started to watch even not knowing who half the characters were. I've never been a fan of country music but I am now a fan of Johnny Cash. What a life he led and the love between him and June was made real and powerful to the viewer thanks to stunningly true performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon. I never knew that June had written Ring of Fire before and knowing that the song is about a painful love, it was clear that she was very deeply in love with Johnny Cash for a very long time before they were married and he with her, making their long tortured romance even more painful. Finally she consents at the end but I really don't know why it took so long. Maybe there was some truth in what Johnny said to her on the bus. The old saying, "the lady doth protest too much, methinks" (Shakespeare)Just wanted to mention that I intend to buy the DVD so I can watch the whole movie and I've ordered Cash's first autobiography. Very good film; very good acting, very interesting people!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This superb bio-pic may walk a tight line between fact and fiction...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but packs such a satisfying emotional wallop thanks to well-crafted storytelling from start to finish, that one easily forgives whatever inaccuracies might be noticed. "Walk the Line," carefully directed by James "3:10 to Yuma" Mangold, features a pair of finely realized performances by its top-rank leads, Joaquin "Spacecamp" Phoenix and Reese "The Man in the Moon" Witherspoon. Despite lacking any real resemblance to Johnny Cash and June Carter, both actors capture the essence of their characters with remarkable skill, having both trained intensively to sing as well as play their respective instruments with authority. Only Witherspoon took home the Oscar gold, and even though I feel that Felicity Huffman should have won that one for her role in "Transamerica," I still found Phoenix and Witherspoon to be utterly compelling. I haven't seen such a powerhouse combo since "Pollack" with Ed Harris and Marcia Gay Harden. It didn't hurt having a fine script from Mangold and co-writer Gill "Return to Oz" Dennis that outlined Cash's rise to stardom and eventual marriage (his second) to June Carter. Kudos must also be given to Ginnifer "Mona Lisa Smile" Goodwin as Cash's long-suffering first wife, a role she plays with great sensitivity; why she didn't garner an Oscar nomination for supporting actress is beyond me. The rest of the ensemble is equally fine, along with all the attendant production values one would expect in a film of this rank. Highly recommended not only to Cash/Carter fans, but to anyone who enjoys a well-told tale of the triumph of love over adversity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually didn't listen to Johnny Cash but after i saw this film i downloaded his album and never regret it. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give not just Oscar worthy performances but cinema history performances. The film's story line is pretty simple but still very interesting. Not only is their very impressive acting but incredible singing especially by Reese Witherspoon. The film only covers a short period of his childhood on when his brother died in an accident and a short period of before he became a big star. Most of the film is covered on when he became addicted to drugs and fell in love with June Carter even though he was married and had two children. It also covers his rivalry with his father Ray Cash(Robert Patrick) when he blamed Johnny for Johnny's brothers death. The film is great one of the best film since 2000 and clearly film you would easily find on a 500 top movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Movie with 2 Oscar worthy performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a fantastic movie, a real delight for music fans and fans of period pieces. I'm neither but I gotta say, Walk The Line is a well made movie. Beautiful direction, Oscar worthy performances and a soundtrack that'll get everyone tapping their feet. I especially loved the montages and the transition between scenes. They just made me wild. :-). A lot of people have been comparing this movie to Ray, for understandable reasons. I wouldn't say Ray is necessarily a worse movie than this, but I did like WTL a whole lot better. The story in Ray was all over the place most of the time. Just my 2 cents. I'll leave this comment short and sweet. See this movie, you will not regret it.8.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see biopic for music fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expect that one of the hardest roles for an actor today must be to play a recently deceased legend. There's little room for error since that person's image is still embedded in the public's consciousness.In "Walk the Line", Joaquin Phoenix does an admirable job of portraying the incomparable 'Man in Black', Johnny Cash. The film-makers apparently realized that imitation of mannerisms alone would be insufficient so they went with an actor who exudes the same kind of seething intensity. Reese Witherspoon's performance is assured as well and, thankfully, brings her talents to a picture that's actually worth seeing. The supporting cast is mostly unspectacular, though Robert Patrick is memorable as Cash's father.The direction is solid and produces some memorable images but the focus is clearly on the narrative, which is fine with me. The enjoyment gleaned from the music will be dictated by taste; personally, I thought that it was good but no substitute for the real thing.So, check out this movie if you're a Cash fan, a music fan or just looking for a good biopic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WALK THE LINE (James Mangold, 2005) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best of the recent spate of musical biopics - BEYOND THE SEA (2004; about Bobby Darin), DE-LOVELY (2004; Cole Porter) and RAY (2004; Ray Charles) - with excellent leading performances, period detail and individual dramatic sequences. While I'm not all that familiar with Johnny Cash's discography, his music is effectively utilized throughout - and surely one of the most impressive feats of the film is that we're hearing Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon's own voices during the songs! Still, even if the film is based on true events, the plot offers little variety and basically alternates between clashes with Father, touring engagements, the blossoming romance between Cash and June Carter, arguments with the wife (usually over the latter) and drug abuse. Also, Cash's guilt complex over his brother's death as a kid is perhaps given excessive importance (a similar episode in RAY was also milked for all it was worth).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching walk the line there was one thing that I learnt about Jhonny Cash ... he was a human being like the rest of us all and he had his faults as well . I know that biopics usually are glamorised to a certain degree but this was differently one of the best biopics I have seen . With Mr.Phoneix acting out the role with style , you just love it when he comes out on stage and says HELLO - MY NAME IS JOHNNY CASH !!! Hats of to him ! , the film kept me interested all the way the through - well just about it I missed the last few minutes , Reese Witherspoon does another fine job of playing June Crater she really does provide some good laughs . T-1000 Robert Patrick does a fine job of playing Cash's dad and the strained relationship between father and son was something that I found I could relate to . I knew very little about Jhonny Cash before watching the film but after watching it I was actually inspired to check his life out further . A must see for anyone who is studying music or is looking for inspiration on the guitar . Enjoyable , check it out !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I didn't see this movie I would never know who Johnny Cash really was. At first I thought this movie will suck because I don't really biographies. They always make it look boring (except the doors) so I was expecting a 2 hour long drama which I will forget very soon. But... after 10 minutes of watching "Walk the Line" I was stunned. I couldn't lay my eyes off TV. Songs were awesome, acting was perfect, story was real and there was no single boring moment. You know... those moments when you just go to the bathroom or take something to eat. When the movie ended I was under a lot of impression. I thought about the movie for weeks and of course, Johnny Cash was my new idol. I saw "Walk the Line" 2 years ago and I can still watch it every day if I have to. I think this is my top 50 movies of all time which is weird because, as I said, I normally hate this kind of films. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Whiterspoon actually performed all the songs by themselves and it really sounds good. Is there anything else I should say about this movie? I think not. You gotta see it for yourself. This movie could change your life or at least some aspects of your life. Get off the internet and get "Walk the Line" as quickly as possible. I recommend you watch it alone so you don't get distracted. Enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most inspiring movies that I have ever seen,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things that separates Walk the Line from other movies about famous musicians is that it tells what the artist felt through his life and what inspired him to write the music that he did. I saw it back when it came out for my birthday back in 2005, and just bought the Collector's Edition and watched it again last night. I had forgotten how good it was. It was amazing what Johnny Cash had to go through in his lifetime to get the girl, and I cried in the end because it was so powerful how Phoenix and Witherspoon depict these two lovers that can't be together is a perfect romance story with really good adaptations of Cash's music and a constant reminder that you can get what you really want if you just try hard enough. This movie has just entered my Top Ten List, hopefully it can find a special place in you heart too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I became a die-hard Cash fan after watching it, and I'm sure any of you other casual viewers out there will become so too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truth be told, I've never thought highly about Academy Award nominee actor Joaquin Phoenix, despite watching him in numerous films (The Village, Ladder 49, Signs, 8 MM and more). It was only when I happened to stumble upon the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line during a free screening I won on the internet, that I discovered this great, versatile, larger than life talent in all his glory. If I didn't know any better, I could have sworn that Phoenix was the Man in Black himself, singing and going through the complex notions of life on screen. The young actor literally became Johnny Cash, and the amount of electricity and enthusiasm that went into his role was enough to light up any Ring of Fire in sight.In Walk the Line, director James Mangold and actor Joaquin Phoenix took what could have been another routine retelling of a great musician's life (a la Ray or De-Lovely) and turned into a musical romp, with the help of Phoenix's dead-on performance and Cash's original songs, that helped introduce this recently deceased country music phenomena to a whole new generation of admirers.Now, enough about the Phoenix jabbering? There's one more cinematic god, I mean goddess, to thank for this musical masterpiece. Reese Witherspoon, previously famous for her dumb-yet-sassy-blonde role in the Legally Blonde travesties, made a gigantic leap into the big league due to her portrayal of the unstoppable June Carter in this film. Carter, a country music talent on her own right, was also Cash's stage and bed partner, and eventually became his long-time wife (after an endless period of courtship). Since both leads deliver the musical bits single handed, words can't express the awe I felt upon encountering Witherspoon's dramatic and vocal side. As much as the film chronicles Johnny Cash's rise and fall, it also follows the bittersweet love story between Carter and Cash, with some of the most powerful sequences feeding off from the tension and chemistry between these two alone.Walk the Line, to me, is an epic tale of fame, music and love; while at the same breathe manages to be something different completely ? an ode to one of the 20th centuries biggest musical talents. I became a die-hard Cash fan after watching it, and I'm sure any of you other casual viewers out there will become so too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it felt like a CBS Sunday night movie. Johnny Cash is interesting, but not a whole lot happens besides his drug/alcohol addiction. It just seemed like one of those Hallmark TV movies. I thought Phoenix did a better acting job than Reese. Reese was good but I don't think she deserved all the acting awards. The role didn't have an oomph to it. It didn't require a lot of emotions. But she can sing the country well. But her really southern accent was a little too thick and annoying. It sounded fake.FINAL VERDICT: Good, but not best picture material. Best part was the music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally when a biography is made about a person, in example, Ray, the movie was held by the performances. I felt this way again when it came to Walk the Line, a story about Johnny Cash and June Carter. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were terrific in holding each other up in this film and without a doubt Reese deserved her Oscar 100%. These roles took talent, they both dressed, acted, and sung exactly like Johnny and June.The film itself is alright, but in my opinion, it's just the performances that took the film to make it so big. So, I would recommend it for a watch, especially to fans of Johnny. I felt it was a good adaption of his life with his lovely wife.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is why movies exist. This is movie magic: It's alchemy, something that cannot come true without something unexplainable, and that something must be love. One other ingredient is story. Best stories, the only stories that matter, come from life. Life of human beings. Life of REAL people, LIVING people. And stories of real people don't get written down or made to any form of art too often. The reason is that real people are not too frequently any kind of artists.Artists themselves are not very often what I would call living human beings. In my experience they are many times more or less mentally "ill" people, who run away from their lives rather than people who would confront it and live it. Which is of course totally contrary to the idea, that at least I have, about what an artist should be. Personal therapeutic art is a different case, but that is not meant or made to any other person than the patient.But Johnny Cash is a real human being. And I say IS, because in this movie, he lives. I don't know or even care about who got the Oscars, Oscars are sh*t anyway, same as every other prices: Nothing more than politics, if not even less. But Joaquin Phoenix in this movie is something more than an actor: He IS Johnny Cash. If you squint your eyes just a little bit, there he is. And that's a miracle: I really felt like I went to Johnny Cash's living life. I don't remember ever having that feeling in a movie. At least not in ten years or something. And Reese Witherspoon... It's so beautiful.From Mangold I've seen before the movie "Girl, Interrupted", which I love (love, love). On the basis of these two movies, I say that Mangold is one of the three most important movie makers active and ALIVE today. I've seen maybe two thousand movies, but this is one of the few that matters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your average biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no expectations for this movie; I hadn't seen the ads or heard the buzz. I wanted to go to the movies, had the choice between Pink Panther and Walk The Line, and having seen the Pink Panther ads, I picked this one. I went in expecting another biopic: OK to watch once, not remarkable in any way, just a quick fast-forward through the biggest moments of Johnny Cash's career. I was wrong.The focus on Johnny and June is what makes this movie so compelling. It serves as a filter: every detail about Johnny's career doesn't have be shown, we don't have to follow his life until he dies, and so forth. Instead, we can focus on the topic of Johnny and June, and the movie has a story with a structure and a happy ending. It also serves to make this movie more intimate than most biopics: we see Johnny's personal life, not only in short clips, but as a continuing theme throughout. It makes him more human. Stellar performances from both lead actors, particularly Reese Witherspoon, who portrays June's compelling personality very well. The chemistry between the two lead actors is great.The childhood scenes also worked. In most biopics, these are very short and seem like gratuitous foreshadowing of the star's later career (see the otherwise brilliant Man on the Moon, for example). Here that was avoided by focusing on the brother's tragic death. That and the father's attitude served to explain Cash's problems later in life, and they weren't overdone. The death was touching, but not too dramatized; it seemed fairly realistic. We got to see just enough of Jack and the family dynamics to understand how devastating his death would be for the others.The only thing I wanted to see more of was the courtship between Johnny and Viv; there never seemed to be any chemistry between them, as all we saw were their marital problems. It would have been nice to know why Johnny fell in love with her and what made them get married. It would have humanized Viv a bit; as it is, she comes off as a rather demanding woman who doesn't understand Johnny's devotion to music. I'm not saying she had no reason to complain, but this aspect was overdone in my opinion.The music scenes worked well to set the tone and serve as transitions throughout the movie. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon shine on stage and their chemistry is especially good in these scenes.All in all, this is one of the best biopics I've ever seen. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than "Ray"........and that amounts to SUPERB</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When making the inevitable comparison between Johnny Cash and Ray Charles, everybody talks about the obvious things ? deprived childhood, rise to stardom, roller-coaster career (and life) due largely to drug addiction. The most uncanny similarity, however, is that how many people, musical celebrity or otherwise, have suffered the death of a brother and, what's more, been BLAMED for it? When it comes to the respective movies that depict the lives of these two musical giants, there are some differences, two of which I like to particularly mention. First, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did their own singing playing Johnny Cash and June Carter while Jamie Foxx lip-synced Ray Charles' sound track. (Kevin Spacey, by the way, also did his own singing in "Beyond the sea" instead of using Bobby Darren's sound track). In addition, "Walk the line" has something that "Ray" does not ? a love story. Mainly for these two reasons, I give an edge to "Walk the line" but will not forget to add that "Ray" is also a first-rate movie.I also like "Walk the line" better for a third (albeit not as important) reason ? its straightforward narration. "Ray" employs more flashback, as well as a "fantasy" sequence. "Walk the line", on the other hand, takes a very common (but not necessarily bad) approach - starting from a significant point in the protagonist's life, it utilizes a motif (an electric saw in this case) to move back to the very beginning. Then it's simple, linear narration going forward to where the movie started, and then follow through to the end. If you have a strong enough script and a good story to tell, that's all you need, in fact all that you SHOULD have, lest you distract the viewers' focus and emotional correlation with the protagonists.While we all have our Brokeback Mountain in our heart (quoting Director Ang Lee), Johnny Cash's burden was the "Boromir/Faramir syndrome", which a LOTR fanatic will immediately understand. If not, this is about a father who plays favoritism with his children (to the extreme extent of lamenting "losing the wrong child", in both cases), and Johnny is caught at the wrong side on the tilted balance. The other inner devil he faced was the frustration in not having his love for June Carter returned (in his perception), not fully appreciating Carter's predicaments. Although they were eventually both divorced from their respective spouses, the social pressure of Deep South Christianity was just too much for Carter to turn a blind eye to.Long repression gave Cash his explosive temperament while unfulfilled love finally drove him to drug addiction. But the moviemaker have not neglected to show us the child in him, as in the scene when going fishing with Carter, he playfully tries to balance the fishing rod on one finger. But in another scene ten minutes later, we see him smashing everything in sight, including a wash basin, plumbing and all.The love story is wonderfully told, balancing Cash's consuming passion against Carter's sensible restraint but steadfast devotion. The story of the rock music giant is just as wonderful, with Phoenix's splendid singing that Cash would have been proud of. Then when we combine the love story and the music together, in the legendary Cash/Carter duets, we begin to understand why these two singers feel the way they do about each other. When they sing together, they are at once in an intimate world all of their own and also a musical universe that they share with the audience, and it's such a joy to behold (and hear).We have the two absolutely best actors taking us into the inner world of Johnny Cash and June Carter. Phoenix brings to life on the giant screen every small nuance of Cash's emotions, be it subtle or explosive. The very first moment she appears, Witherspoon captures the essence of June Carter who has been on stage since 4, with her witty playful public persona springing instantly to life the moment the spotlight is on. But watch for that very brief shot showing Carter, after introducing Cash to the audience, standing behind the curtain watching him tenderly, almost stoically ? June Carter the real person. Then you'll understand why although this is Johnny Cash's story, she should win the Oscar. He should too, but is, most unluckily, pitched again a guy called Philip Seymour Hoffman, in a movie called "Capote".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Picture of 2005!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard about this film on the internet way back when it was announced that they were going to make the biopic of Johnny Cash. I didn't think too much of it and, as months went by, I started becoming more and more interested in it. I thought Joaquin Phoenix was great in a lot he had done since "Gladiator" and was becoming a fan. Reese Witherspoon I aways saw as a girl next door type so I was up in the air with her playing June Carter.When I finally saw a preview of the film, I immediately wanted to check it out do to my curiosity and speculation. Something inside me wanted this to be good so I checked it out. I was hooked from beginning to end and I even found myself toe-tapping to the music(I am not even a fan of country!). The performances are outstanding with both Phoenix and Witherspoon at their career defining best. I am pulling for both to win the Oscars for Actor and Actress, but am shocked to find out it isn't up for Best Picture! It's an outrage!!! Because whether the Academy agrees or not(apparently, not) this IS the Best Picture of 2005!!! See it for an entertaining story, music, drama and overall great film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot line issues slow the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When my mother and father came home from this movie, I asked "How was it?", expecting the real deal from people who remember some of the events portrayed in this movie. Besides my dad's opinion of how great Joaquin Phoenix was, they basically didn't tell me too much besides that. On their word, I was thinking that it's probably going to be a great movie.And so when I sat down with a friend to watch this movie, I was entranced by it. The performances of the main actors (Phoenix, Witherspoon), and a great supporting role with Robert Patrick were far and away the highlights of this movie, and merit going to see the film on just this.But the problems with the movie are the timing. There's a whole slew of things that just didn't make sense, was put together in a fast-forward fashion, and some scenes completely pointless. In this, it reminded me of the Doors movie, which also had great acting by the leads and some of the cast, along with a very important childhood event, but overall, the plot was what killed it.Don't get me wrong, Phoenix and Witherspoon save the plot enough because you're so entranced with their performances that most of it doesn't matter, but the fact that some of the other people are looked over (the Tennessee Two - and then Tennessee Three by far here, have no explanation), and some people are added to the movie for no specific reason (Waylon Jennings. Played by his grandson).Basically you're getting the cream (and the dirt) of a five to eight year period in Cash's life (I'm not even discussing the children part) with no real conception of time, and no thorough glance at any specific song.When you leave the theater and actually think about the film, you realize that they're basically just throwing things at you hoping they're going to stick, plot wise. And though a whole lot of it does, the overall feeling of it is not as good as I'd hoped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thumbs up for a love story which turned out to be a labor of love from cast and crew</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Walk the Line" is definitely one of the best biopics I've ever seen and one of this year's best films. In my opinion,its major breakthrough is that it appeals to all audiences- even to the European one which isn't familiar with country music or Johnny Cash in particular. I am Greek and even though my knowledge of country music is limited, I absorbed every detail of the film and I even rushed to buy the soundtrack! Biopics are a dangerous genre in the sense that it is always very difficult to recreate a person's life in full length and in full depth; yet James Mangold was wise enough to concentrate mainly on Cash's early adulthood and especially on his beautiful love story with June Carter. He managed to capture the essence of their relationship, approaching it from all sides without being tiresome or boring; and with the help of a really inspired cinematography by my fellow Greek Phedon Papamichael and with T-Bone Burnett's amazing contribution in music, Mangold made a really moving and unforgettable film. My comments, however, would be incomplete if I didn't mention the two "pillars" of the film, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. When I first read about "Walk the Line" in Premiere magazine I thought that the two would make an unlikely pair and I questioned their chemistry; R.Witherspoon is adorable but she had starred mainly in very "light"films,which didn't require great talent, whereas J.Phoenix is one of the best actors in American cinema, but there is also sth dark, morbid and disturbing about him. Yet I was curious to see the outcome, and I confess now that I stand corrected! There was an undeniable chemistry between them and they truly seemed to have been born to play their roles. And, of course, I bow before their courage and determination to take this huge risk and responsibility to perform the Cashes' songs, especially J.Phoenix who would be instantly compared to the legendary Man in Black.( Mind you, I like "Ring of Fire" by J.Phoenix more than by J.Cash!) I always considered J.Phoenix a very talented actor who has made excellent and diverse choices, sth which proves the vastness of his gift as an actor and I must admit that I was in awe when "Walk the Line" was over. What a performance! He displayed a rare sensibility and he rendered Cash's complex personality both when he was fragile and when he was strong with great empathy and respect. I would say that Phoenix submerged into Cash's soul, he intuitively understood who he was and, thus, he masterfully portrayed him. I believe that Phoenix, in some peculiar cosmic way, was J.Cash during filming. Phoenix proved himself as a great actor once more in this film, because he was able to balance effortlessly and beautifully between the profoundly wounded child and the unfulfilled man that J.Cash was. It was truly a shame that the Academy deprived him of this year's Oscar for Best Male Leading Role, because he was the one who lifted the film on his shoulders, the one who gave it its sparkle and above all, he is the one who transcended his personality and became the Man in Black!P.S. I saw the movie on Febr. 14th,it was a coincidence and I think an unconscious tribute to a really moving love story. Also, because of "Walk the Line" I sought a different way of creativity and I've taken up acoustic guitar lessons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WALK THE LINE (2005)directed by: James Mangoldstarring: Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Robert Patrickplot: The story of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), his rise to fame, and the love of his life, June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).my thoughts: I was just getting into Johnny Cash (I'm only 17) when I heard this film was coming out. I usually can't get into movies about a famous person's life, I don't know why. But this one pulled me in from the beginning.Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely amazing as Cash. He goes through so much emotion in this film and does really well in the music scenes, especially with Witherspoon.Reese Witherspoon was very cute as June Carter, also adequately showing her underrated talent. Her and Phoenix totally made be buy the love story, and not just because it really happened. Ginnifer Goodwin and Robert Patrick also lend their presence as Cash's wife and father.This film also includes other famous music stars of Cash's time such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley.Definitely check this out if you are a fan of Johnny Cash or June Carter, or just great movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie about a great man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Cash's whole life had movie material written all over it.From his time as a dirt poor sharecropper's son to his rise to become the greatest country music artist of all time Johhny Cash's life was just waiting to be made into a film.And this movie is a fitting tribute to Johnny Cash.Phoenix is simply perfect has Cash.No he doesn't sound like Cash,no one could,nor does he have the 6 foot 2 inch frame Cash had but he becomes Cash so much so that you have to remind yourself that is isn't Johnny Cash on the screen.Witherspoon is also good as June.With this role she will be seen as a serious actress and hopefully leave some of the sillier stuff she had been doing behind.The movie covers the period from Cash's childhood up until he and June marry.Its a great ride all the way.Cash is shown with all his faults---his addictions and his mood swings and his womanizing.But it also shows what made Cash the man he was and the things that shaped his music,such as his brother Jack's death,which seemed not only to shape his music but his whole life,and it also shows his enormous talents as he begins his recording career at Sun Records and touring with Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis back in the early 1950's.One last note, Phoenix and Witherspoon do their own singing for this film and they are very good at that also.They are as good or better than most of the junk that is called country music today.Don't just rent this DVD,buy it,because you will want to watch it over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This biopic blends music with persistent love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not really being a Johnny Cash fan; and not even noticing June Carter on my radar; it may be astounding that WALK THE LINE is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Worthy of Oscars are Joaquin Phoenix as Cash and the amazing Reese Witherspoon as Carter/Cash. I'm sure that John and June would have no qualms with Phoenix and Witherspoon playing them on the big screen...and definitely easier to look at.WALK THE LINE depicts Cash from his troubled childhood in the cotton fields of Arkansas to the infamous concert at Folsom Prison in 1968. In between, his career beginning at Sun Records in Memphis not unlike Elvis(Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis(Waylon Payne)and Carl Perkins(Johnny Holiday); finally meeting and falling head over heals for June Carter; as well as his problems with drink and dope. The music of course is very important to this film; but true love may have really been the main focus. True love sometimes travels on a gravel road and as equally on a newly paved interstate. Johnny and June were owners of an extraordinary love.Remarkably Phoenix ground out all his vocals with believability; as well Ms. Witherspoon. Robert Patrick playing Ray Cash instantly gives the movie a villain. I was really impressed with Ginnifer Goodwin as Johnny's first wife Vivian. Hilton as Elvis turns no heads. Shooter Jennings offers a fresh couple of minutes portraying his father Waylon.I personally choose the rock-a-billy Johnny over the country Johnny. Whether or not you are familiar with Cash's complete musical resume it matters not...WALK THE LINE is a must-see movie and comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a 14 year old adolescent from Australia (that decided to watch a movie. Before i did, i only knew Johnny Cash as the man that wrote the songs my Dad (38) always played on guitar.After i watched the movie, i was attached to Johnny Cash, i played his songs on the guitar and, even brought myself a harp. His songs are amazing but, the movie is what captured my attention the most.I watched Walk the Line with my father and found it to be the most best movies i've watched, my dad and me were singing along and in most parts so hooked by the story line. The drug addiction, the love. Trust me, if a 14 year old liked it you would as well. I don't think any one else could be a better Johnny Cash actor than Joaquin Pheonix. His voice suited Johns so well, it was unbelievable even.So, if you get the chance, watch this movie, Johnny Cash fan or not. You will be touched and, even in my case ...influenced...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Sanitized, Choppy Biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been so much better. While containing some great scenes, overall this biopic had a rough, uneven, choppy beginning with editing, continuity, and pacing problems that raised more questions about the script/plot than answers, leaving a lot of interesting transition questions lingering. The important relationships between father and son weren't strong. The way June Carter's role was presented in the movie almost screamed for having more emphasis placed on her life story as well (which occurred somewhat and belatedly later in the film). We seen Johnny Cash go from going fishing, suddenly working with his brother. We see Johnny Cash looking at a guitar and then suddenly later with a guitar. We never see how Johnny Cash learned to play, how he developed his music. The first half of the movie is composed of just snap shots of supposedly important events that never really provide a smooth and continuous understanding of Mr. Cash's early life story. We never seen if his tour with June Carter continued or stopped when she threatened to quit. Mr. Carter's dalliances were softened into suggestive affairs.Several great scenes included his fight with his wife that was actually one of the few gritty, graphic cinematographic change ups with photographic camera technique. His scene in at the cafe counter with June Carter, his scene with breaking up the sink are classic dramatic performances.There was good material, the music and singing delightful, but overall, the movie never obtained the greatest that a better script and selective directorial approach could have inspired. Seven out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More epic and substantial than I expected - a great tribute to Cash that also isn't totally biased in his favor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the previews and read the reviews for "Walk the Line," and knowing its director was James Mangold, I expected a light drama with great performances. I'm glad I gave the film a chance, however, because it is actually a strong drama with amazing performances.I wasn't too thrilled by Mangold's directorial decisions on "Cop Land" (I thought the acting there was superb also, but let down by amateurish handling). He has matured as a director since then. "Walk the Line" doesn't come across as being a formulaic or stale biopic - it opens with Johnny Cash's famous performance at Folsom Prison and flashbacks to his memories of childhood. It also doesn't portray Cash as a perfect hero - he's flawed, and his alcoholism, drug addiction and adultery is all exposed.Being a huge fan of Cash (although not by any means a fan of most country music), I've always thought it was Cash's rock n' roll attitude and blending of musical styles that attracted me. I didn't know so much about his personal life, but knew he had given his blessings to this project. It was refreshing to see Joaquin Phoenix do him justice. 2005 was a year of two great performances (Hoffman in "Capote" was also wonderful) and Phoenix really nailed Cash down to the notes he sang.Reese Witherspoon was impressive as June-Carter, Cash's wife. Their relationship was turbulent and the movie handles it tastefully. It never veers into unabashed sentimentality, yet it also doesn't become too bogged down with the negative. It provides a balanced perspective of their marriage.I found some of the co-star roles questionable (Tyler Hilton as Elvis Presley was a huge mistake - looks and sounds nothing like him), but that is irrelevant in the long run since this is primarily about Cash and Carter and both actors deliver in their roles.As a recently-converted Cash fan, I see this movie as a touching tribute to his life that doesn't seem artificial, tacky or biased. As a general movie buff, I see it as one of the rare biopics that achieves epic status and doesn't fall victim to excess.Yes, the film has a few flaws - but overall I thought it was one of the best and most surprising films of 2005. Really not at all what I had expected after reading reviews. I would take any critic who tells you it's a movie made ONLY by its performances with a grain of salt. It's a well-rounded achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the previews for this movie, I was very excited to see it. Little did I know that after I saw it for the first time I would see it twice more after that. I thought that this movie was the best film I have ever seen. I have always loved Johnny Cash's music and I think that Juaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon did a phenomenal job of portraying John and June in the movie. I have already seen this movie three times and believe me that I will see it several more times in theaters until it comes out on DVD. When I first watched this film, I was very touched. Watching someone else detox the way I did when I was in rehab was amazing. I honestly didn't think that the cold sweats and everything happened to anyone else but myself. Also I have never really seen anyone go so far down with drugs in person. I had always kept myself very secluded when I was using so I didn't really know what it looked like in person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherpspoon gave the most amazingly convincing performances. While watching the movie I totally lost myself in the story and forgot I was even watching a movie. When the credits started rolling I was depressed that the movie was over.First, I would like to let everyone know that before I watched this movie I virtually knew nothing about Johhny Cash except that he was an old time country singer and he wore black a lot. This movie made me feel like I know Johnny myself. I have gained such a new respect for Johnny Cash....and June Carter.....I will just say that I love my girlfriend more than anything in the world but I think June Carter exemplifies everything that I look for in a woman. I know that's bad but...what can I say. I wonder if that has anything to do with the fact that I am also in love with Reese Witherspoon. Maybe.Either way, their performance together makes you actually feel like you were in their lives. I would recommend watching this movie over and over again and let me tell you...JOHNNY CASH IS THE MAN!!</fullReview>

Don't believe the hype, it's *not* Reese Whiterspoon, not at all. She's just her usual self, that's it. It's Phoenix, that takes this movie from its standard biopic level to emotional heights. Laugh and cry. It's about a rock/country star's life so don't be surprised to see down waves but what's interesting is the up-beats, the heart of the man in black. Being obsessed by a woman, throwing away everything for a lifestyle, was it worth it? Well, I think it was. No matter how much a low-life you are if you can take a guitar and start singing a song that will take your breath away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie, But the Blue-Ray Stunk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted, before I ever saw the movie, "Walk the Line", I really had very little knowledge of country singer Johnny Cash's life other than a few songs he's recorded in his long career that spanned over five decades and that he was one of the very few to be inducted into the Country-Music and Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame. I was oblivious to know that Cash was a coeval with Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison and Jerry Lee Lewis, but that he also toured with them over a two year period. Nonetheless, the film caught onto me and I never once looked back as this was one of the best biopics ever made to a man who's contributions to the music industry will be eternally etched in our memories forever. A well structured film that's entertaining and beautifully crafted, surely I was hoping that Fox would treat its blue-ray disc with the proper respect it deserves.Sure the film clearly chronicles the life and times of the versatile performer Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) and later on his wife and soulmate June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), but the dimensions in the film exceed what its integrity really is. It boldly conveys positive messages about redemption, rectification, accepting that you have a good thing right in front you and to hold on to it while you can. These idiosyncrasies are what shaped the character that Johnny Cash had made for himself. A real treat to this movie was that it went into deeper liberation to showcase a period of time before Johnny and June were soulmates. This is really digging the archives indicating a time when they were performers in their late teens or early twenties. Aside from the Oscar-calibre performances from Phoenix and Witherspoon and the excellent script/direction from James Mangold, it was well fitting that the Cash family carefully selected these performers to play the roles of Johnny Cash and June Carter. Mangold must have struck gold with the Cash's to even film scenes that many would have deemed private to other celebrities. With a script that was well blessed by the Cash's the film industry and the Oscars, this movie was truly one of the best films of 2005. Even if you're not an aficionado of country-music, the characters depicted in this film are still a pivotal eye-catcher. Towards the last years together before their deaths one year apart from each other, Johnny and June were freely able to share some moments together and to open up some rather grim realities that are not very flattering towards the people who loved them dearly. The story is more complex than it seems at first glance, but to create a series of events with skill and respect to the family and the performers who portray the characters is another staggering initiative. This is truly a story of two individuals who walked into a burning ring of fire and eventually knew they were soulmates for life.Unfortunately, the Blu-ray was kind of hit-and-miss in terms of detail. The visuals were subliminally impressive in terms of colours and structuring, and when watching it at home, it feels like you're watching it at the theatre. The sounding is also quite stupendous where the dialogue, sound effects and the music is presented with direct accuracy. If you don't have the DVD or Blu-ray, well what the hell are you waiting for? Speaking of the DVD why was it that Fox omitted the DVD features from previous releases onto the Blu-ray? The previous DVD releases has everything you need like commentary and deleted scenes and everything in the package. What's angering is that the feature "Becoming Cash/Becoming Carter" are absent here and the "Sun Records and the Johnny Cash Sound" is also annexed as well. The feature where Cash's faith in God is also missing in action which makes it very disappointing. And sure those features are brief, there was no need to leave those out of the Blu-ray. It kind of lacks the respect the film deserves and the many fans who cherished the legendary Johnny Cash and June Carter-Cash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully engaging and entertaining biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Johnny Cash, music legend. From his time growing up on a small farm in Arkansas, to his time in the US Air Force where his musical talented first started to manifest itself, to the early days of his career, through the trials and tribulations of being a star and beyond. We also see his relationships, particularly with his older brother Jack, his father, his first wife Vivian, and, most importantly, with June Carter.A wonderfully engaging and entertaining biopic. We get to see the Johnny Cash story, warts and all. It does seem to concentrate on his relationship with June Carter too much, but this is necessary, as this relationship shapes his life, to a large extent. Well told, with solid direction by James Mangold. Is fairly linear in its telling, but there's a vibrancy and energy to it all that keeps it going.Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as Johnny Cash, perfectly capturing his mannerisms, especially those on-stage. Similarly, Reese Witherspoon is wonderful as June Carter. The chemistry between them is spot-on. To add to the brilliance of their performances, both actually sang in their roles - no lip-syncing to Cash/Carter recordings - and they absolutely nail it. Phoenix got a Best Actor Oscar nomination and Witherspoon a Best Actress Oscar for their efforts.Talking of the music, as you would imagine, it is great and captures well the genius that was Johnny Cash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the most part, I enjoyed Walk the Line. It was very entertaining, but it has its flaws. It really is a pretty cliché story, it shows the ups and downs in a man's career, nothing you haven't seen before. It shows his rise to frame, his introduction to drugs, his fall, his rising back up, and getting the girl in the end. We've seen this before in better movies. Not to say that it doesn't have redeeming qualities, though. If you enjoy Johnny Cash's music(and the popular music of that time), you'll love the music of this film. As a lover of all music I very much enjoyed the soundtrack, and all the musical performances are all very good. I had heard so many good things about the musical performances before seeing the movie but I always assumed that it was just digitally enhanced to sound good. After listening to the commentary of this film, I discovered that the director, James Mangold(a director I more or less respect), didn't want to have anything like that, because this is a film about people who wouldn't have any of that in their own music, even if their vocals were a little off, as long as it portrayed the emotion and message of their music, they sold it; so doing what these artists despised would really be incompetent of him. Also, Joaquin Phoenix's performance(not musically, just acting) was spectacular. A specific scene on stage is a shining example of not only this, but the direction as well, is one on stage with Cash on drugs. The performance, combined with the direction and camera-work made the best scene in the film. All-in-all, it is a very cliché film sprinkled with some great things, it's not all bad, yet not great, either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite musical biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walk The Line, James Mangold's loving, triumphant tribute to the troubled Man In Black, is my favourite musical biopic and a gleaming testament to the inspirational acting and singing abilities of both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. Phoenix plays Johnny Cash over the course of his rocky life with stern gravitas and an appropriate baritone drawl that personifies the legendary singer/songwriter impeccably. The film follows his path from humble beginnings on a rural farm with his family, to his eventual lightning in a bottle rise to fame, as well as his star crossed romance and eventual matrimony with fellow singer June Carter (Witherspoon). The main reason this works so well is the absolutely flawless singing by the two leads. They slay every number with uncanny skill that makes you nostalgic for all those songs. Phoenix captures the pent up, smoldering outsider in Cash, a somber outlaw whose dark impulses constantly waged war with his kind heart and magnetic aura. Witherspoon is a whip crack wonder as June, a woman so deeply in love with Cash that it scares her to act on her gut emotions, waves of complexity and intuition washing through her beautiful performance. Ginnifer Goodwin finds the understandable frustration in Cash's maligned first wife. Robert Patrick is a show stopping standout as Johnny's father Ray, a hard bitten man whose soul has been soured by an early family tragedy. Patrick delves deep and gives him a heartbreaking human spark that dulled by a saddened edge. Musical biopics don't often get as spot on as this, and the songs, performances, production design and direction, make the whole film pure magic.</fullReview>

Oh, this movie is based on real story so I am so in love with it. How Johnny has a very bad relationship with his father but still he didn't walk away. I'm not sure I can do that. Standing O for him. Not to mention his endless love with June The fact that John died 4 months after she passed away is really really impressive. And 35 years of marriage.

Reese Witherspoon was a really good singer too but again, she isn't June Carter.Anyways, I thought the story was very good and it really gave me a taste on what involved on Johnny Cash's life. I honestly didn't know he was a drug addict during his famous career and that his fashion sense was black after recovering from the drugs. That's what I loved, he was being true to himself and expressing his true colors. It's too bad that himself and June aren't with us but their legacy goes on</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walk the Line (2005): Dir: James Mangold / Cast: Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, Ginnifer Goodwin, Robert Patrick, Shelby Lynne: Compelling film about the life of singer Johnny Cash and his many demons he tread throughout his life. Story chronicles his childhood where acceptance from his father wasn't apparent and the death of his brother is permanently embedded in his memory. Also featured is his struggle to gain a recording as well as his battle with drugs and alcohol. Through it all there was June Carter who not only toured with him but also remain there when everyone else abandoned ship. Sometimes repetitious but directed with style by James Mangold as his best film since Copland. Joaquin Phoenix embodies Cash from his deep voice to his guitar playing. He wrestles with traumas but finds support with his wife. Reese Witherspoon is equally superb as Carter who struggles with her feelings towards Cash and duets on stage and in life. Ginnifer Goodwin plays his first wife who discourages him when he pursues his career. She ends up with the divorce papers. Robert Patrick plays his father who denounces his son when his other son dies yet gradually mends. Shelby Lynne plays his mother who witnesses the tension in the family. The result is a powerful portrayal of a life that walked a fine line and whose music gives image to the convictions. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

Goodwin (Once Upon a Time) plays his ex-wife, Vivian and Patrick (Terminator 2: Judgment Day) plays his father, Ray who has always been tough on him. Phoenix should've won an Oscar for this too because he was great and he &amp; Witherspoon had good chemistry. I recommend this good biographical drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joaquin Phoenix plays Johnny Cash in this biopic about the singer's life. It shows Johnny's young life watching the death of his brother, briefly shows his life in the military, and then focuses in on Mr. Cash's rise in music. Johnny originally played Gospel music before going to a recording studio and being told he could never sell records that way. So he recorded songs he wrote in the military. Thus started Johnny Cash on his way. He became famous for his Rockabilly style, and toured all across the US. Unfortunately the stresses of Johnny's constant leaving and the fact that he became addicted to pills put a strain on his marriage and his children. His divorce sent him on an even more destructive path, even as he fell in love with the woman he would love for the rest of his life: June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Johnny spent years trying to get with June and the majority of the second half of this film is Johnny's struggle with addiction and persistence of trying to get June to marry him (which she eventually did). This movie can be a bit repetitive at times. It drags in areas. But it is still a fantastic movie. Joaquin's portrayal of the Rockabilly legend is excellent. Reese's portrayal of June was also well done. There is no denying the chemistry between the actors. And the singing? Spot on! I was nervous learning the actors did all their own singing but their voices were beautiful and accurate. Plus, being a fan of Johnny Cash, I love the songs. The cinematography was fun as well. The concert scenes almost felt like backstage passes mixed with Hollywood seamlessly. An excellent biopic every Cash fan needs to see.8/10</fullReview>

Unfortunately the stresses of Johnny's constant leaving and the fact that he became addicted to pills put a strain on his marriage and his children. His divorce sent him on an even more destructive path, even as he fell in love with the woman he would love for the rest of his life: June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Johnny spent years trying to get with June and the majority of the second half of this film is Johnny's struggle with addiction and persistence of trying to get June to marry him (which she eventually did). This movie can be a bit repetitive at times. It drags in areas. But it is still a fantastic movie. Joaquin's portrayal of the Rockabilly legend is excellent. Reese's portrayal of June was also well done. There is no denying the chemistry between the actors. And the singing? Spot on! I was nervous learning the actors did all their own singing but their voices were beautiful and accurate. Plus, being a fan of Johnny Cash, I love the songs. The cinematography was fun as well. The concert scenes almost felt like backstage passes mixed with Hollywood seamlessly. An excellent biopic every Cash fan needs to see.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The early life of music legend Johnny Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of Johnny Cash from his poor childhood till he marries June Carter. It isn't an easy life; he loses his brother while still a child then gets married while unable to support a family. He dreams of becoming a singer but even when that dream comes true his life isn't easy. Constantly touring he is away from his wife and children for long stretches of time and finds himself falling in love with fellow singer June Carter. She is also married with children and constantly rebuffs his advances but that doesn't stop him loving her.Johnny Cash is the country singer people who don't like country music like so it isn't surprising that this film contains some great songs; performed not by Cash himself but by actor Joaquin Phoenix, who puts in a great performance as Cash. He is more than ably supported by Reese Witherspoon who puts in an Oscar-winning performance as June Carter. The two worked well together making their difficult relationship believable. While these two are the backbone of the film the rest of the cast is fine too; most notably Robert Patrick who plays his father and Ginnifer Goodwin who plays first-wife Vivian. Given Cash's drug taking and infidelity this isn't a happy 'rise to fame' story but it does entertain and we get a happy ending? although of course it isn't the end of the story as Johnny Cash and June Carter had thirty five years together and that was all after the film ended. I don't know how much was changed for dramatic reasons but I feel that whether one is a fan of Cash or not one can enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cash, a true Sun Records Legend, and the only one to have a decent, I mean great, film made about him. forget about the Jerry Lee and Elvis movies, entertaining but generally useless. Phoenix here gets into the *Soul* of Cash, even gets to "channel" him vocally...not bad RP! Reese Witherspoon is absolutely fantastic, what an actress and what a portrayal. my "complaint" is that she apparently was made into a proto feminist and not the person absolutely enchanted by, and ready to marry JC at the drop of a guitar pick.nutha small issue or two: movie runs 10-12 minutes too long. and this Reviewer does not think that June was a solo on Johnny's show for years but a member of the touring Carter Family which INCLUDED Johnny Cash! back to the good stuff: script, direction, acting, editing, cinematography &gt; and now viewers can get a much better perspective on those many, many youtube clips!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Succeeds largely due to its two powerful central performances and some awesome music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I'm not really a country music fan and have only ever listened to Johnny Cash in passing, WALK THE LINE is still one of the best musical biopics I've seen. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have great chemistry on screen that helps to sell the lifelong friendship and later, romance, that developed between Johnny and June Carter Cash. They also chose a good period of Cash's life to focus on that helps to establish a perfect narrative arc and deliver one of the best happy endings I've ever seen. Still, the road to that happy ending isn't easy. Johnny Cash wasn't the nicest person in the world and it really wore on my patience to see him making the same mistakes over and over again. But beneath it all, there was an admirable persistence that came through despite him being so unlikeable for so much of the film. The film also features some great toe-tapping music with Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon actually lending their voices to the timeless tunes. And again, it's partially this element which makes their portrayal of these people so good. The only issue I took with the film is that it was a little too long. After several times of Johnny Cash messing up with drugs and alcohol I got the point, so some of the later sequences bordered on overkill. Going into the film you already know how it will turn out and forgive me if I want to get to the happy ending a little quicker. There were also some genre clichés that are a little bit more noticeable now that a lot of these types of films (and parodies of those films) exist. But despite all of that, I can forgive these "sins" for the music and crowd-pleasing resolution to the story. Overall, WALK THE LINE is able to mostly transcend its clichés through its earnest and heartfelt execution. If you're a fan of good music and good films, you should enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A chronicle of country music legend Johnny Cash's life, from his early days on an Arkansas cotton farm to his rise to fame with Sun Records in Memphis, where he recorded alongside Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins. While growing up in the Great Depression era, Johnny Cash takes an interest in music and eventually moves out of his Arkansas town to join the air force in Germany. While there, he buys his first guitar and writes his own music, and proposes to Vivian. When they got married, they settled in Tennessee and with a daughter, he supported the family by being a salesman. He discovers a man who can pursue his dreams and ends up getting a record with the boys. Shortly after that, he was on a short tour, promoting his songs, and meets the already famous and beautiful June Carter. Then as they get on the long-term tours with June, the boys, and Jerry Lee Lewis, they have this unspoken relationship that grows. But when June leaves the tour because of his behavior, he was a drug addict. His marriage was also falling apart, and when he sees June years later at an awards show, he forces June to tour with them again, promising June to support her two kids and herself. Roger Ebert wrote "The movie fudges some on the facts, but I was surprised to learn that Cash actually did propose marriage to Carter onstage during a concert; it feels like the sort of scene screenwriters invent, but no. Other scenes are compressed or fictionalized, as they must be, and I would have liked more screen time for the other outlaws, including Waylon and Willie. Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis make brief excursions through the plot, but essentially this is the story of John and June and a lot of great music. And essentially that's the story we want." With all the goods and bads, the film succeeds on being a great piece of entertainment with fantastic music, acting, visuals and a guarantee to please a lot of people, almost as many as Cash did in his eventful life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my Top 10 movies of the year, this is an excellent movie filled with brilliant performances. Plot In A Paragraph: Based on the early life and career of country music artist Johnny Cash and his romance with June Carter. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are simply both outstanding here and Witherspoon totally deserves her Oscar, whilst Pheonix can consider himself very unlucky to lose to Philip Seymour Hoffman (for Capote) and to be overshadowed by the wonderful Witherspoon. Ginnifer Goodwin, and Robert Patrick both offer solid support too.I recommend anyone who is a fan of Cash's work, or people who know nothing About him to check this compelling movie out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'm not a Johnny Cash fan, and the prospect of seeing this film, never really interested me if for My late mum, God rest her soul, who gave me the pirated DVD. I took it home, I watched it. I've only seen it once. I watched it for two reasons: to see how the two fantastic leads played these real life people, and in no way, they lacked, delivering stellar performances, more amazing of course, being that of Witherspoon. She plays June Cater, the girlfriend of legendary rock great, Johnny Cash, seen in another great solid steered performance by Phoenix, only Witherspoon's performance is more notable and attracting. If you love this actress, this is one performance of hers you must see, where it's amazing to think when seeing her in Fear, that she would grow to become one of these great actresses, where in Inherent Vice, we await another great acting piece. As a youngster 7-12, I heard and liked Johnny Cash, though later I grew out of him, although I was intrigued to see the life story of this rock legend, with is steered by a fantastic script, as well as supporting players, the always great Robert T2 Patrick as Cash's Dad, who delivers one fine performance, it doesn't make you forget what this actor can do, even in films of not so reputable quality. In the 130 minute film that spans his life as a young kid, where he suffered a couple of blows, one which saw him, burdened with guilt, and blamed, on the account on one of his little brothers, in a tragic accident, to finally succeeding in asking his beloved to marry him, I must say I got involved in the story. The period was well shot, as well as the use of 50's attire. Of course, like always whether famous actors, singers, writers, it's great to see their strive to success story, and the obstacles that get in their way, that they overcome. Of course there are always pitfalls, which in anything, adds dramatic effect. Again, this real life story was well handled. Of course too, we can't forget the little jail time/incarceration, Cash spent, which I must admit to what had happened, I found it admirable. His fate and June's as well, dying in a close span of time together, I found eerie, but too it could be cause I never really invested much interest into them, although I had seen a documentary on Cash. You can't deny this guy has one country rockin' legendary voice, you'll never forget, like Elvis, where Cash was the god of country music. Excellent, solid, all the way, film making, you shouldn't miss, even you younger ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Written and directed by James Mangold, "Walk the Line" charts the life and times of renowned country music artist Jonny Cash. The film stars Joaquin Phoenix as Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, the woman with whom Cash has an elaborate romance.Despite likable performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon, "Walk the Line" is wholly formulaic. Unfolding like a superhero origins tale, the film watches as Cash rises from humble beginnings, dons a costume, becomes a star, drug addict and then lover. Fidelity and faithfulness are the film's chief preoccupations ? the "walking the line" of its title ? Cash called upon to be faithful to a wife he betrays and then a lover he gives up a serious drug addiction to be with. Though a by-the-numbers biopic, and though it completely flattens and simplifies a rich life, "Walk the Line" is entertaining, glossy and ends on a cute note.7.9/10 ? Worth one viewing. See "Tender Mercies".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walk the Line is a biographical musical drama that is based on the early life and career of country music artist Johnny Cash. The story focuses on his early life,his first family with Vivian Cash,his romance with June Carter and his rise to stardom as a country singer.It was based on numerous autobiographies.It features Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon in the leading roles as Johnny Cash and June Carter respectively.James Mangold co-wrote the screenplay and directed the film.The story includes Johnny Cash's childhood wherein he experienced his battering from his abusive father and tragedy after his brother's accidental death.Then we also witness his troubled first marriage with his first wife due to his financial and emotional instability.As a country singer,we get to see his ascent into stardom in the music scene. As his fame grew,he struggled with amphetamines,barbiturates and alcoholism.But upon meeting June Carter,it helped him overcome those struggles and her support provided him more success later in his career.This was definitely a great film due to the performances of both Phoenix and Witherspoon as they give us first rate work.Although the screenplay may be a boring and slow at times,we are definitely treated to an acting extravaganza.Both performers were able to capture what Johnny Cash and June Carter are all about and their devotion to each other definitely provided lots of intrigue to the movie in spite of their supposed personal weaknesses and life struggles.Also worth mentioning is the music played in the story as it allows us to hear the popular songs and remind us of the performances of both country music legends.These are two reasons why Walk The Line deserves the highest rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One does not often come across a film of considerable length that manages to keep the audience engaged at all times, but Walk the Line does so rather effortlessly, as the film successfully captures the chronicles of the legendary country singer Johnny Cash, largely due to the magnificent acting performances that are on display. Although the writing and directing is strong, it is the superior acting abilities of both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon in the leading roles that define this biopic, as the two actors shine individually while also sharing terrific on screen chemistry. Although the film may not be the most adequate musical tribute to Johnny Cash, it does successfully portray him as a man, capturing his intense and rebellious character, as well as the special bond he shared with his eventual wife June Carter. Walk the Line is a touching and passionate film that succeeds in somewhat exploring the enigma that was Johnny Cash, with perhaps the greatest testament to the film's quality being the fact that love for country music is not needed in order for one to enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joaquin Phoenix walks in the shoes of Johnny Cash outlining his life's ups and downs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only a few years after the unfortunate and heartbroken passing of the American country musician, legend, and icon Johnny Cash comes this chronicle of a motion picture biography from director James Mangold. It clearly tells the tale of one the most influential 'rock and rollers' of the 20th century ? from his early days as a dreamer with a guitar and an aspiring singer-songwriter, through the highlighted peaks of his career while performing with such contemporary super stars; Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, June Carter, and Roy Orbison, to the latter more darker chapters in his life filled with and dominated by alcohol, drugs, and relationship turmoils.Starting with the cast of the film, the actors entitled with the lead roles of Johnny Cash and his long-term on/off love-affair June Carter, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, don't just act the persons in question, they truly live them (on screen). All the liveliness, emotional turbulence, and extreme energy coming from the duo makes the portrayals that much more reliable and trustworthy to anyone, who have the least amount of intelligence on their real-life counterparts doings and performance in showbiz as well as the private sphere. Phoenix plays his notes to perfection when it comes to showing off the right amounts of all the darkness, hurt, and sorrow, which all undoubtedly were embodied in the late Mr. Cash. In fact it seems like he draws on his own personal experiences in order to fulfill the role and do justice to the man of this significant magnitude. Even on the musical side of things, everything is executed to perfection. Instead of putting in any and many a major Cash single here and there, Phoenix went out of his way to record the tunes himself, learn how to play the guitar, and ultimately become the American folk phenomena in every sense of the word. The story of this one very special man's life and his struggling through difficult times of despair clouded by smaller segments of personal joy and happiness, and widespread fame and fortune serves not only to entertain, nor solely to depict all the events already more or less publicly known.. No, it tries to piece together and decode the complexity of Cash's mindset, star struck paths, and deeply involving personal tortures, which at first glance could be believed to be unique to the great man, the living legend ? but after closer inspections many of us ordinary people will acknowledge and be able to relate to have had such same kind of psychological stress in our time on earth. (most not within the same scope as our idol) Of course if you're after nothing more, than what meets the eye, this flick also delivers a just tribute to a legend now gone, with twists of what made him still human, flawed, relatable, and so much more closer to one self, than what modern mass Medias oftentimes give the impression of.All in all with demanding presence and staggering performance from the acting crew, truthful to source material, and afterthought-imbued scene after self-reflecting scene after near tear-weepingly scene, I hereby conclude, that this great Hollywood production sets the standard for the year, and welcomes anybody to enjoy the show, whether they're looking to be enlightened, charmed, or dragged far within the brights and the darks of the personification of the multitude of aspects contained in the human psyche ? It truly walks the finest line!</fullReview>

The movie has a simple story: the life of a music legend; the actors put some good magic on while Mangold walks with the camera nearby. The director never lets the story or the actors take over the movie or slip away, and the time flows. Mangold doesn't take risks on screen and delivers (that will keep him in the world of blockbusters movies), but it doesn't make him - now - a director worth following.</fullReview>

Joaquin Phoenix absolutely nails it as the hulking persona of Johnny Cash. He captures the voice, mannerisms, and general personality quite well. Reese Witherspoon deserves the Best Actress Oscar for her performance as the lovely and charming June Carter. Her portrayal is on point and she plays the Southern lady who was a woman before her time and fell in love despite herself. The love story of Johnny and June is legendary and Walk the Line depicts it well. The events that occurred in the film are not 100% accurate, but the spirit of the story is preserved and is mostly true excepting a few details.The supporting cast in Shooter Jennings, Waylon Payne, Johnathan Rice, and Tyler Hilton to name a handful is superb. They're genuinely performing their characters' songs and are talented musicians themselves. Overall, a film that is more than worth re-watching.

		<fullReview>American screenwriter and director James Mangold's sixth feature film which he co-wrote with screenwriter Gill Dennis, is based on "The Man In Black" and "Cash The Autobiography" by Johnny Cash. It premiered in the Viacom Galas section at the 30th Toronto International Film Festival in 2005 after having been previewed at the 32nd Telluride Film Festival in 2005, was shot on locations in USA and is an American production which was produced by producers James Keach and Cathy Kondrad. It tells the story about an American singer, songwriter, author and actor named Johnny Cash (1932-2003) who grew up in a Christian family in a colony called Dyess in Arkansas, Mississippi in the United States in the early 20th century with his father named Ray Cash and his mother named Carrie Cloveree who were farmers and his six siblings. After leaving his family in the early 1950s as a 21-year-old man to serve in the U.S Air Force, Johnny began writing songs and met a 17-year-old girl named Vivian Liberto. Johnny and Vivian were married in 1954, but after Johnny and his back-up band called The Tennessee Three got a record contract with a record producer named Sam Phillips and begun touring, Johnny met an American singer, dancer and actress named June Carter whom he had admired since his childhood when he used to listen to her sing on the radio.Distinctly and intimately directed by American filmmaker James Mangold, this quietly paced and somewhat fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the two main characters viewpoints, draws an intimate and involving portrayal of a 20th and 21th century musician's life on the road and both on and off stage, and his relationship with his father, his brother, his wife and musician June Carter (1929-2003). While notable for it's naturalistic and atmospheric milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by Greek cinematographer and director Phedon Papamichael, production design by production designer and art director David J. Bomba and costume design by American costume designer Arianne Phillips, this character-driven and narrative-driven story about music, love and family relations which reenacts central moments in the life of a talented and somewhat conflicted son, brother, husband, father, Morse code intercept operator and a gospel, country and rock singer who toured with renowned American singers like Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley (1935-1977), depicts two substantial and interrelated studies of character and contains a great score by American composer T Bone Burnett.This romantic, literary, conversational and biographical period drama from the mid-2000s which is set in America, Germany and Canada during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and where a prominent guitarist from the American South meets a wife and mother whilst in the making of his career whom becomes the center of his attention, is impelled and reinforced by it's flash forward narrative structure, substantial character development, subtle continuity, use of music, excruciating scene where Johnny addresses his father about his older brother named Jack during thanksgiving, the accomplished acting performances by American actor Joaquin Phoenix and American actress Reese Witherspoon who shares a distinct chemistry and the fine supporting acting performances by American actress Ginnifer Goodwin and American actor Robert Patrick. A heartrending, endearing and timeless love-story inspired by real events which gained, among numerous other awards, the award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy Joaquin Phoenix and Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy Reese Witherspoon at the 63rd Golden Globe Awards in 2005.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Mangold's Walk the Line is a very powerful, accurate biography on the iconic country music star, Johnny Cash. This film boasts powerful performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. They both sang live and they both can sing! In fact, Phoenix sounded remarkably like Johnny Cash.This film tells the life of Johnny and how he led a troubled life that began with his drunken father blaming him for his brother's death. The movie goes through the times when he became an alcoholic and a drug user. The film also goes through his love life and his crooning for June Carter.The acting is very good. Phoenix and Witherspoon are excellent casting choices. They sang very well and had powerful performances. I liked Robert Patrick as Johnny's father. Patrick didn't hold anything back and he let his true father-like resentment come out on top.Overall, this is a very good film about the legendary Johnny Cash. I liked how the songs were used in the movie because many of them are my favorites. Honestly, I liked Phoenix's version of "Walk the Line" better than Cash's. I won't spoil anything here, but the last two scenes are the best scenes in the movie. I rate this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walk the Line is one of those easily watchable biopics where it's not hard to get invested into its characters and storyline. It's particularly light. I don't know if that's really a problem or that it needed to be anything more than this, but as it is, it's never too incredibly effective. Even in its more emotional scenes, it rings as a soapy sort of drama. You're never bored, but there's nothing all that special. Still, it's entertaining and definitely worth it for Phoenix and Witherspoon. To my surprise, I thought both were about equal and worthy of notices. Both were really good, but again, I don't think either are anything too special or amazing. That's the way the film is. Watchable, but nothing too memorable by the time you finish it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joaquin Phoenix takes on the early life and times of Johnny Cash, with something more than an assist from Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. It's great material, more factual than many dramaticized biopics, but seems like it's always standing just a hair away from fully embracing the man and his mythos. Phoenix emphatically pours himself into the role, but can't quite nail the man's authoritative, larger-than-life presence either on the stage or off it. That, along with his ever-so-slightly imperfect take on Cash's legendary singing voice, had me seeing the Oscar nominee as a tremendous impersonator but not a living, breathing character unto himself. Surprisingly, Witherspoon fares much better in a role that seemed on the surface to be terribly miscast. She's sweet, streetsmart and talented, and much of the trauma we endure from Cash's self-inflicted trouble is drawn from the toll it takes on her. An ambitious picture that has its heart in the right place, but can't fully recover from a few crucial, disappointing near-misses.</fullReview>

The film was on my to-watch list for a long time and when I finally got to see it, I was of course excited and to me, 'Walk The Line' is very much its own film because as a viewer the story got me involved and I wasn't thinking of any other film while watching. Now parallels will be drawn to Taylor Hackford's 'Ray' (and a few other musician biopics) and yes there are some strong resemblances especially in their childhood, their relationships with women and their struggle with drug abuse but there are bound to be similarities between most biopics based on musicians.James Mangold's film looks very nice. It has the eye-candy factor working for it thanks to the fine works of the art team, costume and makeup department. Phedon Papamichael's cinematography is remarkable as not only does it catch the beauty of the landscape but it also contributes to the mood of each scene. The soundtrack helps create energy and as is a keeper a standalone.'Walk The Line' is based on Cash's own book focussing mainly on his relationship with June Carter. The film wonderfully portrays the ups and downs of the passionate relationship they shared, a beautiful friendship built on love, respect, friendship and genuine care for one another, that eventually lead to marriage. The memorable dialogues are written amusingly with fine tongue-in-cheek humour. Both lead characters could have easily become biopic clichés but they are very richly defined and so the rest depends on how they are portrayed.Phoenix and Witherspoon breathe fire into their roles as they dazzle the screen capturing every nuance and are spot on with every detail. And, they can sing too. It couldn't have been an easy job as Cash and Carter have distinct styles but the two actors nail it. Ginnifer Goodwin is great and the rest of the supporting cast do a fine job (both in acting and singing).While 'Walk The Line' successfully displays the glamour, energy and wildness of the 60s, in the end it's about a man who overcomes his demons thanks mainly to the woman who's always been there for him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Date: 9 June, 2012 -First Time Watch- Whoa. That's about what sums up Johnny Cash's life. The things the man had to go through our mind blowing. After losing his brother Jack in a death that haunts him forever, Johnny joins the military and is stationed in Germany. For the next couple of years, Johnny climes the ladder of fame and hits every road block imaginable, from drugs to martial issues to struggling with his feelings for a woman he may not ever be able to have. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant!! He has an amazing voice and was definitely on the top of his game when he did this movie. Which is why it bothers me that the Academy did not give him the Oscar! He deserved it! He also sounded exactly like Johnny Cash! Not to say Reese Witherspoon wasn't good, but if I had to pick between the two I would definitely give the Oscar to Phoenix. Overall this movie is amazing and definitely worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performance by Joaquin Phoenix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joaquin phoenix is one of the most underrated actors of all time. His performances almost always outshine the films he's in. This film offers amazing performances by all the cast, including one of Reese Witherspoon's best yet. But for me it's Joaquin's sometimes subtle, sometimes explosive performance of the man in black that makes this film. One thing that is clear about Joaquin now is that he takes risks. He goes above and beyond to bring authenticity to his characters. He doesn't fall into the typical Hollywood trap just for the fame. That is definitely what made Johnny Cash stand out as a performer. His rebellious nature to maintain credibility in his music. Joaquin brought this legend to life with his colorful performance. In my opinion, the Oscar belonged to Joaquin that year. Definitely one of the best actors of our time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WALK THE LINE is a biographic movie about the country music legend Johnny Cash. It begins in Cash's youth and it goes until the moment he marries with June Carter. It describes some crucial moments in the artist's life and, as far as I learned, the film is quite accurate about them (about what really happened in Johnny Cash's life). I enjoyed it as I also enjoy Cash's music.The performances of Joaquin Phoenix (which plays Johnny Cash) and Reese Witherspoon (plays June Carter) are quite good and convincing, especially if we take in consideration that is not easy, for any actor, to play a role of a real character (someone that actually exists in real life)! I think that both of them did a good job as actors and also as singers! They both sing very well too! In fact I must I say I enjoy their versions of Cash's songs as much as the original ones!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Walk The Line" is as good as a biography as you're going to get about Johnny Cash. Cash's story is certainly unique, and the filmmakers take us step by step into what made the Man In Black. Joaquim Phoenix gives an excellent performance as usual, and Reese Witherspoon is great as June Carter, though I still disagree about winning the Oscar for it. Nicely laid out and quite involving, For shits and giggles, I would also definitely recommend "Walk Hard", the very bizarre-who-asked-for-THAT? parody of this movie, starring John C. Reilly just totally tears Walk The Line brilliantly. As a matter of fact. I saw Walk Hard before I got a chance to see Walk The Line, and well, I may need to see Walk Hard again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Congratulations to everyone involved in this production, which is a superbly made and fantastically well-acted film. Excellent acting by the whole cast is even more impressive because of the tremendous singing and musical numbers performances by the actors. Reese Witherspoon was quite rightly lauded with awards including a BAFTA, Golden Globe and an Oscar. However, Joaquin Phoenix's tour de force performance was the centrepiece and core of the film and easily on a par with Witherspoon's contribution. Surprisingly he only collected a Golden Globe for his performance.There are also excellent supporting performances. Most notably Waylon Payne is superb in a small part as Jerry Lewis, and Robert Patrick (in his second collaboration with director James Mangold) as Cash's father Ray.The film is runs 2 hours and a half hours (director's cut), and while not an action film is incredibly well paced. James Mangold is emerging as the 21st Century's version of veteran Hollywood director Robert Wise. Like Wise, his films are superbly well crafted, this film being no exception, with excellent production design by David Bomba and costume designer Arianne Phillips, which captures the period very well. Other highly competent technical contributions are fused with an excellent script and brilliant performances in a highly skilled but understated style by Mangold. He ensures you are totally captivated by the story and performances, and he ensures that competent camera-work and excellent editing by Michael McCusker help the story fly along but do not draw attention to themselves. Also like Wise Mangold's choices of projects have been highly eclectic, showing what a versatile director he is. The period of Cash's life that are used to form the story inter-mesh very well and drive the narrative along briskly. Despite characters having real flaws, you are drawn to them and Phoenix and Witherspoon always keep their characters accessible and sympathetic. T Bone Burnett's choice of music in the film fits the narrative perfectly.If you are patient you will find the experience of watching the film extremely satisfying emotionally, particularly at the climax. Kudo's to everyone involved for creating an excellent and outstanding character piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Becouse you're mine, I walk the line..." I seem that all great people have excellent stories about their past. The story Johnny Cash and June Carter not seems exception. Life of Johnny Cash was full of rise and fall and on this background June Carter seems like an angel for him. This movie shows you how life can be hard and every person, even for the most talented man like Mr. Cash. Those facts like his first song or his meet with his future wife and muse and of course fact about live record in prison makes you to admire this man. I wanna say thanks to Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon for this movie also cause you start believe that you see real Johnny and June on a screen. I really believe that every person who will see this movie though a little bit will become fan of country music and Johnny Cash. My estimate 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We're all going to hell for the songs we sing."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was somewhat apprehensive when I heard this film was being made with Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, along with Reese Witherspoon portraying June Carter. It's best to have an open mind about these things, and quite honestly, they both did a terrific job representing these legends of country music. The movie delves into Cash's early career, roughly the first decade or so following his youth, military service and first marriage. What I particularly enjoyed was seeing how the careers of other legendary singers and musicians paralleled Johnny's own - folks like Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Roy Orbison. If true, the sequence showing producer Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts) inspiring Cash to sing what he knows and feels was a true turning point in Johnny's life, one that might easily have gone an entirely different direction had their paths not crossed.The other cool aspect of the film were those subtle touches that would come full circle to show how they influenced some of Cash's best songs. The young black shoeshine boy turned up in the rockabilly vocals of 'Get Rhythm', while June Carter's challenge to Johnny to walk the line wound up as one of his biggest hits. Even a casual reference to Bob Dylan eventually resulted in the duo covering a surprisingly fresh version of 'It Ain't Me Babe'.What Phoenix does here with his characterization of Johnny Cash is pretty amazing. As far as his singing voice goes, there can only be one Johnny Cash, but Joaquin's was pretty close, even if a fraction of a beat slower on a number of songs. His mannerisms also added to the perception of Cash on stage with the guitar held up to his chest and holding it out to the audience for emphasis. The big surprise however was Witherspoon's take on June Carter, and if you were only listening and not watching the picture the second time they sang 'Jackson' together, you'd swear it was really Carter herself.Considering all the music biopics that have come down the line the past couple of decades - La Bamba, Great Balls of Fire, The Buddy Holly Story - I'd have to say this is one of the best, if not the best. Comparisons will be made with "Ray" of course, having come out a year earlier with Jamie Foxx in an equally superb performance as Ray Charles. I guess it will depend on your preference of musical styles that will determine your decision, but if it's a good story with good music you're after, you really can't go wrong with either one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Cash's music is truly unique. That legendary man will always be membered by as the one the greatest country singers ever. Johnny Cash's life was full of success. It was marred by personal problems such as drinking, drug addiction and unstability. Nevertheless, it doesn't reduce the influence he has had to the country music. Walk The Line follows John's life through tough childhood to the frenzied success all over the America. The film focuses mainly to his relationship with his beloved singer June. James Mangold does a great job here. This is just not a movie which circles around the love relationship. It still has space for music. The movie offers some great on-stage music performances. Joaquin Phoenix (Johnny) and Reese Witherspoon (June) does have a great match here. It works well.The man who sang that love is burning thing, really knew what he was singing about. Johnny Cash walked the line almost entire his life. His music is called classic nowadays. Watch the movie and listen to the music and you may get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favorites now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a biopic person. Mainly because most biopics tell me stories I already know (even if only by hearsay), so I don't sit through such movies biting my nails. After all, even if you didn't name your kids after people, whose eventful and adventurous lives make biopics possible, you probably know one or two things about them. The second reason is that it's rather painful for me to watch someone try and impersonate a famous and influential figure, for his or her failure would make me extremely uncomfortable.And still I decided to give "Walk the Line," which had received quite a number of favorable reviews, a chance to prove me wrong. And, boy, it did! Halfway through the movie, to my utter surprise, I found myself actually watching it and not leafing through a book or plucking my guitar (which is always the case when a movie doesn't agree with me).I'm not an expert on acting, but I think Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job (not to mention the fact that it was them singing the songs). Some people say Reese can't hold a candle to June Carter. Of course she is not June. But who needs candles? In fact, we would get ourselves an inexhaustible supply of electricity if June Carter and Reese Witherspoon - a regular powerhouse of a woman - could perform together. As for Joaquin Phoenix, his very own Johnny Cash turned out to be the person I could relate to, even though I have little in common with the actual Johnny Cash.And last but not least. Should you fail to grow attached to the characters created by Joaquin and Reese, there's a real chance you'll fall in love with the movie anyway. It gave me enormous pleasure to watch the dramatic but beautiful and compelling story of love unfold - the kind of story you usually sneer at, wishing secretly that one day something like that would happen to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a good film because it was interesting to go on the journey of Johnny Cash, his rise and fall and rise again. But for me the film really kicked in about halfway in the film. The first half was good as you saw his early life and the early state of his career but it just felt like we were watching someone live the silly life of a "rockstar" and it had no substance and i really felt for his wife when he was having affairs with different girls and how he was drinking etc. But after he took the pills and his life went downhill thats when the film had substance as you saw the emotion in the characters and you felt for Johnny wanting his life to get back on track, any developments with the relationship with his father and with June. There was now a reason to watch the film, to see the outcome of this rough patch in his life. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant, he played the role convincingly. Reese Witherspoon was superb. She had a great singing voice, and she looked the part and was amazing in this (no wonder she won an Oscar). I did like it but on the whole its not what i would call a movie of a lifetime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the life of late country music artist Johnny Cash, 'Walk The Line' is a fantastic film, that easily ranks amongst the finest biopics to have hit the Silver-Screen. Biopics never seemed better. Johnny Cash's life is hard to display on screen. James Mangold handles the biopic with utmost sincerity. The film never loses it's grip, it keeps you at the edge of the seat from start to end. Cash was a legendary figure and this is a legendary film in all respects! The Soundtrack is a pure genius. One of the finest soundtracks, that take you back in time, and make you groove. The songs are simply rocking! Mangold is at his best over-here. The filmmaker makes an outstanding effort! Cinematography by Phedon Papamichael Jr, is appropriate. Michael McCusker's editing is good.Johnny Cash comes alive on Screen with Joaquin Phoenix. Phoenix breaths Johnny Cash. He sings &amp; delivers by becoming the late legend. This is one of THE finest performances of all-times. Reese Witherspoon as Cash's lady love, June Carter, is remarkable. She sings beautifully as well. Robert Patrick as Cash's dad is excellent. Ginnifer Goodwin as Viv, leaves a mark. Others are perfect.On the whole, A must watch for each and every cinema lover.

		<shortDescription>More than just a biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Walk the Line' was definitely one of 2005's most precious movies and for me one of my favorites made in the last years, since I have watched it several times now. But more than a biopic, it's the tale of Johnny Cash and June Carter's true love. All of this much due to the leading performances. Concerning Joaquin Phoenix, he proves one more time why he is one of America's most talented actors with this absolutely complete (because he SINGS all by himself) interpretation of the legendary country singer, that deservedly got him the Academy Award nomination. As for Reese Whiterspoon, she achieves to make me smile every time I watch her as June Carter with this stunning and lovely performance, worthy of her Oscar winning. The rest is brilliantly well-crafted as James Mangold succeeds to mix the musical and the dramatical side of Cash's story. I have to say I find this movie magical thanks to the two actors wonderful and strong connection. I love it for what it is labeled, a loyal biopic of a true musical pioneer, but also for what it really portraits, an unconditional love story. A masterpiece - 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is very great. I normally do not review a movie. But this movie made me to review it as this is a really greatest romantic and drama movie i had ever seen. Thanks to the director and the actor Phoenix. Phoenix's act made this movie so much realistic. Also the sound tracks in this movie are so much good. Thanks to everyone in this movie. Primarily the story of the love that grew between country stars Johnny Cash and June Carter during the early years of Cash's career, WALK THE LINE is the result of intense collaboration between director James Mangold, co-writer Gill Dennis, Johnny Cash, and June Carter Cash. Though both Cashes died in 2003, they oversaw the script's development for seven years. Mangold and Cash's insistence that the film's stars would actually sing paid off. Witherspoon's singing (as June) is lovely, and Phoenix's contains the raw energy and soul that defined Cash's sound. Even as a child on a cotton farm in Depression-era Arkansas, Cash shows a strong interest in music, escaping from his no-frills life and strict father (Robert Patrick) through hymns and listening to the radio. When his brother dies in a freak accident, young Johnny feels responsible, and worries that he will never live up to his brother's goodness. The film follows Cash through his first marriage with Vivian Cash (Ginnifer Goodwin) and into the early stages of his touring career alongside such musicians as Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, and most importantly, June Carter. As Cash's success grows, so does his relationship with drugs, alcohol, and Carter, putting a strain upon his family life. From his initial audition with Sam Phillips of Sun Records on through his legendary 1968 concert at Folsom Prison, Cash is transformed from a hesitant singer riddled with demons to a man whose uniquely bold style would make music history. WALK THE LINE never attempts to paint a full picture of Cash's prolific career, but instead focuses on the passions that drove his music and on the woman who gave him strength. With magical performances by Witherspoon and Phoenix, a haunting and inspiring American romance is brought beautifully to life.(From Rotten Tomatoes)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This one's for the warden!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About a third of the way into James Mangold's Walk the Line, divorcée June Carter (Witherspoon) hands her touring partner Johnny Cash (Phoenix), then unhappily married to first wife Vivian, a copy of Kahil Gibran's 'The Prophet' as a parting gift. This is what Gibran has to say on the subject of marriage: "Sing and dance together and be joyous, but each one of you be alone, even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music." We never find out whether Cash ruminated on this passage at length but it's a pretty accurate summation of the heaven and hell relationship that will shortly unspool across the screen.A film of extraordinary merit, beauty and resonance: Walk the Line is a triumph. If the film follows the usual trajectory of all such biopics, from rise to fall to rise again, the veracity of the material (aside from a few contractions for dramatic license) isn't in question. This is a real home movie, adapted from a pair of Cash autobiographies, exec produced by his son John Carter-Cash, and developed over seven years in close co-operation with Johnny and June before their passing in 2003, four months apart.Though imbuing proceedings with suitably biblical conceits - black dogs and crows abound, foreshadowing doom - Mangold ties these tumultuous lives to a more earthbound plot; a ridiculously moving love story culminating in Cash's marriage proposal live on stage to a recalcitrant Carter in February 1968. "I've asked you to marry me 40 different ways and it's time you came up with a fresh answer." Fortunately for Cash, the answer was in the positive (always leave the audience on a high), but it took years of heated denials and tortured soul-searching to finally pitch up at this conclusion.Cash picked Phoenix to play himself, presumably recognising a fellow traveller, and it's true both men have history in common; a common intensity, religious upbringings and "good" brothers dying on them. However, unlike the majority of music biopics (notably Taylor Hackford's Ray or Alex Cox's Sid And Nancy) this is one where the leading man looks nothing like the musician he is playing. The same applies to the various characters who pop up on Cash's journey, including a pre-war Elvis (glimpsed backstage in shadow, gobbling chilli fries). Even TV's 'Stars In Their Eyes' has a higher hit rate than this. Phoenix, particularly during Cash's later years, neither physically resembles Cash (he's significantly shorter, for starters) and, though sporting a similarly deathless bass profondo, doesn't sound very much like him either. Yet, it's the actor's best performance to date.Phoenix appears to be all but channelling his subject; swaggering or hunched over his guitar in the classic pose. A scene in which Cash pulls a sink off a wall wasn't scripted: Phoenix did in fact pull it right off the wall. No surprise, then, that the actor was obliged to check himself into rehab when filming finished, emotionally drained, with a drink problem.For her part, Witherspoon, (a dead ringer, vocally and physically, for the big-haired vaudevillian) is astounding as June Carter, Johnny's muse, co-singer, carer and wife by turns; her on-screen chemistry with Phoenix, nuclear. The concert sequences, driven by that pure Sun sound ("steady as a train, sharp as a razor"), are fantastically exhilarating - and the legendary Folsom Prison gig, outstanding. If your eyes aren't leaking or your feet aren't tapping by the end, you're almost certainly dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not know much at all about Johnny Cash, his life or even particularly his music. From what I know, however, Phoenix completely becomes him, and sounds a lot like him when he performs(and I understand that it really is him singing, in this). Witherspoon is excellent, quite possibly her best work thus far. In general, the acting is marvelous, and they found the right types for the various musicians. I've yet to be taken by storm by anything I've seen which was directed by James Mangold, but this is definitely the best of them, the others being Girl, Interrupted, and Identity. The plot is great, engaging and keeps moving nicely throughout. Characters are well-developed, credible and consistent. The dialog is good, and well-delivered. This is well-paced, and the contrast between the normal home-life and the fast world of rock 'n' roll. The cinematography and editing are effective and never flashy, and this manages to balance being a tribute to, and biography of, the man in black rather well. There's not a lot of language, and the depiction of drug addiction is not as strong as it is seen elsewhere. I recommend this to any fans of anyone involved in the making of it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm no fan of country music with its corny "somebody done somebody wrong" lyrics, yee-ha vocals and gloopy strings, but Johnny Cash was definitely different. Although not quite the icon here in the UK that he undoubtedly was in his native America, his "outlaw" stance, along with his hard-living ways and honest lyrics for my money put him a country mile (ouch!) ahead of the current crop of mega-successful but anodyne superstars. Pop culture bio-pics have been intermittently successful at the box-office and "Walk the Line" was quick to follow the success of "Ray" in celebrating the wayward life of a one-time neglected but lately revered musical giant and there's no doubt Cash was deserving of the accolade. The film itself is fine to look at, capturing especially well in its early sequences, vistas of the American South, back-dropping young John's cotton-picking days with its attendant tension in his family life, particularly his strained relationship with his taciturn, hard-drinking father, exacerbated after the accidental death of his (and his father's favourite) adored older brother. The director seems to mix Cash's story up with blues-man Robert Johnson who surely cornered the rights to images about cross-roads, which recur frequently in the movie, in any case it's a hackneyed image at the best of times. The movie follows the parabolas in Cash's career up to his inspired and ultimately triumphant return to glory in 1968 when he recorded his seminal "Live at Folsom Prison" album, although I would argue his greater triumph was achieved at the end of his life when he collaborated with Rick Rubin even as he was dying of cancer. Interesting to compare the time-line of his career with another Southern boy, Elvis, whose stellar career was foundering until he too in 1968 made his comeback with his "From Memphis to Vegas" album and TV Special. Although enjoyable and well acted (and sung), the movie does suffer from Joaquin Phoenix's inability to convey the sheer presence of the man; wearing black shirts and dropping his voice a notch or two not being enough for me for him to truly get into character. A similar lack of veracity affects the depiction of Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and other rockers from that era, - I can't believe in a nation full of Elvis impersonators the casting company couldn't have come up with a better look- and sound-alike than we get here. Reese Wotherspoon is fine in the role of the elusive and effusive June Carter, the love of his life although I wouldn't have marked her performance as Oscar-worthy. Parts of the movie seem apocryphal too (did Cash really happen by Sun Studios just as Elvis was setting up?) but generous dramatic licence has been the watchword of screen biographies since the year dot so I'll let that and others of its ilk pass. In conclusion then an entertaining pass at a big man's up and down life, but in the end the real deal is Cash's heartbreaking video rendition of Trent Raznor's "Hurt", a life encapsulated in only four minutes. The man truly came around...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engaging and vibrant biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about the rise and fall of the popular singer Johnny Cash.Though I have never heard his music before, "Walk The Line" successfully captivates my interest to learn more about this singer. I admire his perseverance to succeed, and I am saddened by his downfall caused by drugs. Cash's relationship with his wife and with Carter are both engagingly portrayed. Reese Witherspoon is charming, showing off her trademark sweet smile in between her great range of acting skills. The songs are upbeat and vibrant, making the music performances on stage a pleasure to watch. The only one complaint I have is the accent which the actors speak in. It makes the film a little hard to understand, and it is hard to concentrate fully when the film is over two hours long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walk the line follows the same path as Ray does in telling the story of a larger then life icon. And in this case the story is the almost mythic story of Johnny Cash who approved of James mangold's script and he even spent time with Phoenix talking to him. Phoenix was Cash's first and only choice as to who would play him in the movie. Wise choice. The Wisest choice was June Carter's when she chose Reese Witherspoon to portray her. Both icons chose not to try and influence them when it came to the singing Johnny Cash told Phoenix relax find your own way it'll sound more better more real that way. And it does sound more real. Mangold pulls no punches here he delivers Johnny Cash warts and all as he struggles with the loss of an older brother loniness in the air force and finally a addiction to booze and pills that almost kills him. But for all of that WALK THE LINE is just a simple love story of Cash's love for June carter and the battles they had to fight before they could be together. And WALK THE LINE could also be called a love letter by James Mangold to the late Johhny Cash and the late June Carter Cash. The movie is the Johnny Cash Story and it details his life with unflinchingly honesty much like Johnny Cash did in real life. This movie is a classic that deserves to be viewed again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seriously watched this film 10 times now and I'm still not tired of it. It's a brilliant and mostly accurate portrayal of the life of Johnny Cash. It's such a shame that he wasn't alive to see it. I know many people who strangely had never heard of Johnny Cash before who managed to thoroughly enjoy this film, so even if you're not a fan I'm sure you'll love it.Most people agree, even those who rate the film negatively, that the acting is superb. The stand out performances are obviously of the two key actors, Joaquin Phoenix and Reece Witherspoon. I was sceptical when I learned beforehand that they did all their own music but I was extremely pleased with the outcome. All the vocal training they did clearly paid off, with both actors sounding like the people they represented. Their on-stage duets are a joy to watch and hear, but it's not just about the voices and the music though. The dense chemistry between them combined with their ongoing stories of troubled love means that it's very difficult not to become connected to them.Every other aspect of this film is beautifully done and the acting alone cannot be given all the praise though. It's a shame that I only saw it at home and never in the cinema, but it's still an excellent experience. Being a huge Johnny Cash fan combined with just how good this film is has made it my absolute favourite. I doubt many others would rate it as their number one film, but I'm sure most people who've seen it will rate it very highly and would be tempted to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding biography with excellent performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year was 2005 when Walk The Line had been released nationwide in the United States and in the time of Oscar season as well. The film is a biography about the ups and downs of country singer Johnny Cash which explores the path like musicians where fame gets in their head followed by the booze, drugs and women. Walk The Line, once released, was compared immediately to 2004's musical biopic "Ray" dealing with Ray Charles and his rise to fortune and fame with moviegoers looking at similarities from pushy parents, death of a sibling, love rivalries, and the pain of the main protagonist. But somehow Walk The Line managed to get some information correct rather than feel sorry for the main characters, like in Ray where months after Mr. Charles passed away, a lot of fans of either the movie or the musician wanted to do their homework on what was real and fake where at least sixty percent of the film was just made up leaving only to care for Jamie Foxx's performance. Walk The Line surprised everyone once they were on their computers to check out whether or not what they were seeing on screen was true.The performances of the actors shined throughout this film. Joaquin Phoenix did a kick-ass job as the man in black where even his vocals seemed to made me jump after realizing that he sang all the Johnny Cash songs in the film, even the ones that didn't make the cut for the CD soundtrack. Reese Witherspoon is hotter than a pistol as June Carter, Johnny's interest, who shows her southern roots by playing the late musician with such energy and spark that she is the heart and soul of the movie. Robert Patrick (Terminator 2) gives the shivering performance of a parent I've seen on screen as Johnny's hard-ass father who still thinks Johnny should have died and not his eldest son and also ashamed at how his singing son turned out to be with booze, drugs, and fame. Ginnifer Goodwin portrays Johnny Cash's first wife, Vivian, in which despite the fact that the real Vivian was supportive of Johnny, they turned her to be the somewhat rival in the film giving more space for the Johnny/June relationship, but shows how much of an actress she can be on screen with better roles coming to her in the future. Also look for musicians Waylon Payne (Waylon Jenning's godson) as Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Holiday as Carl Perkins, Jonathan Rice as Roy Orbison, Shooter Jennings (Waylon Jenning's son) as Waylon, and Tyler Hilton as Elvis Presley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biography of Man in black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biographical movies were always quite a hard thing to swallow. A lot of them are excellent (Milos Forman is probably the best director of biographical movies such as Man on the moon, The people vs. Larry Flynt), some of them were average (Capote, Sid and Nancy) and some of them suck big time.I walk the line, the biographical drama about famous "man in black" Johnny Cash, in somewhere in the middle. It's a good romantic drama with a good performance (in first line Joaquin Phoenix) and excellent music performances from Phoenix &amp; Reese Witherespoon. Johnny Cash was really a good and influential musician and I respect him and his works, but this movie wasn't quite good as I thought it would be. The problem is that the movie about Johnny Cash is focusing too much on his relationship to June Carter, also a famous country singer, and very little on his struggles with drugs and his life as a musician. I didn't found out nothing about his life, but almost everything about his relationship with June Carter. The love between them is also shown very unrealistic, sentimental and the whole movie looks more like a fairy - tale than a biography movie. Also; Johnny Cash is shown in very bright light and really idealistic, like a perfect man with some small problems (his problems with drugs are not shown as a serious problem). During the movie I didn't found out nothing about his musical career, only that he was in love with June Carter all the time.The actors in the movie were quite good: I liked Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash, his voice and performance was quite good. Reese Witherspoon? I don't know... she's cute but nothing special and her performance of June Carter is not worth of Oscar, if you ask me. The other cast in the movies was great, but nothing special. The movie is good only for the "die - hard" fans of Johnny Cash who can't forget him after his death. The movie is saying that Johnny was a good guy, deeply in love with June Carter and have some small problems with law and drugs. Average biographical flick.</fullReview>

Playing two much loved singers can't be easy, but they pulled it off. I thought Reese Witherspoons attempt at a country might be annoying, but she made it work.I liked the fact that people like Elvis featured, but they didn't make a major deal of it. It wasn't like "let's see how many impressions of famous singers we can fit into a film." It was a good way of showing how Johnny fitted into the music scene of the time.I would recommend this film to people who know of Cash's music, but know little about his life.

		<shortDescription>A Line Worth Walking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody dreams about attaining super stardom as a singer. Hollywood has been making movies about career-oriented crooners since Al Jolson captivated audiences with his warbling in the first 'talkie' picture "The Jazz Singer." Biographies about musicians either fictional or factual since "The Jazz Singer" (1927) have been a Tinseltown staple. The late 1940s saw Larry Parks portraying "Jazz Singer" Jolson in "The Jolson Story" (1946), but the template for recent bio-musicals grew out of the 1950s. The Susan Hayward epic "With a Song in My Heart" (1951) about songstress Jane Froman struggling for a comeback after a plane crash and the Frank Sinatra opus "The Joker Is Wild" (1957) about nightclub performer Joe E. Brown surviving gangsters who slashed his vocal chords represent two examples. The earliest country western vocalist whose ill-fated affairs inspired a movie was Hank Williams, Sr., in "Your Cheatin' Heart" (1964), starring George Hamilton in one of his few memorable roles. Basically, the thing that sets these biopics apart is whether the songster is still alive at the time of the film's release. Mind you, Williams died more than a decade before "Your Cheatin' Heart," but his accidental death gave that film an unforgettable air of tragedy. Sissy Spacek's Oscar-winning portrayal of Loretta Lynn in "Coal Miner's Daughter" (1980) serves as the most recent model for country western crooners, overshadowing Jessica Lange's evocative but overlooked "Sweet Dreams" (1985) about the doomed life of Patsy Cline. One theme, however, prevails throughout these bio-musicals; each performer pays a perilous price for fame and fortune. Despite overwhelming odds, they ascend the scales of fame only to plunge into a pit of addiction. The Billie Holiday story "Lady Sings the Blues" (1971) with Supremes lead singer Diana Ross emerged as one of the earliest efforts where drug addiction figured prominently in the depiction of a star's demise."Copland" director James Mangold's authentic but anemic biopic "Walk the Line" about the life and tunes of country music superstar Johnny Cash, illustrates the latest example of the rags-to-riches saga about a singer caught up in drug addiction. "Gladiator" heavy Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the notorious 'Man in Black' who rose to fame alongside the rockabilly likes of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Buddy Holly in the late 1950s. Johnny Cash fans should ignore the complaints against "Walk the Line" leveled by the singer's relatives. Ultimately, however, who would want to endure the trials and tribulations that Cash suffered to carve out his unique niche as a popular American musical icon. More often than not, "Walk the Line" qualifies relentlessly depressing. Some may complain that their favorite songs, like 'A Boy Named Sue,' got lost in the shuffle. Indeed, Phoenix looks like a dead ringer for Cash, and he mimics Cash's trademark mannerisms, including the way the Arkansas native wielded his guitar on stage like a weapon. Lightweight leading lady Reese Witherspoon of the "Legally Blonde" movies matches Phoenix note for note as sassy June Carter. "Walk the Line" amounts to Witherspoon's best performance since her trash-talking villainess in the forgotten 1996 crime melodrama "Freeway." Similar to Spacek in "Coal Miner's Daughter," Phoenix and Witherspoon performed the songs themselves without professional singers dubbing their voices. Scenarist Gill Dennis of "Return to Oz" and Mangold based their highly selective screenplay on Johnny Cash's autobiography. Undeniably, they had to take liberties or this gloomy 138-minute, PG-13 parable would have worn out its welcome. They chart Cash's life from his origins as an Arkansas sharecropper's son. Two themes form the emotional crux. First, Cash's saintly older brother Jack (newcomer Lucas Till) died trying to earn a dollar in an awful lumber yard accident. Our hero bore the burden of grief for his brother's death, because he went fishing while Jack cut wood on a table saw. Cash felt that his father blamed him for his Jack's death. Second, an unhappily married Cash pursued elusive vocalist June Carter obsessively from the first time that they met on stage. Like all singer biopics, "Walk the Line" shows Johnny Cash surmounting wholly impossible obstacles to attain stardom. The landmark album that Cash recorded at Folsom Prison where he serenaded murderers, thieves, and rapists turned his career around and made him a superstar. Mangold deserves credit for never sugar-coating this saga. Nevertheless, after two hours of watching Cash's tortured life, you'd have to be a masochist to want to follow in his footsteps. The least talked about performance in his superbly cast movie, however, is Robert Patrick as Cash's gruff father. Since his villainous debut in "Terminator 2" (1991), Patrick has been typecast as a tough guy in anonymous straight-to-video actioneers. As undeniably gripping as Phoenix and Witherspoon are, Patrick anchors the action as Cash's long suffering father. Uneven at times and predictably grim as all get out, "Walk the Line" still ranks as pretty powerful stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lately, Hollywood has spewed out so many pieces of movie junk that it's become very hard to wade through them all and find truly worthy films. "Walk the Line" is one of these films.The Music: 10/10 The greatest Johnny and June Carter Cash songs were chosen for this film, and the singing is not only worthy, but fantastic. Reese Witherspoon's singing was especially shocking and fantastic.The Acting: 8/10 Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Pheoix give Oscar-worthy performances, but the supporting cast is rather dull and un-talented for the most part.The Length: 7/10 The film drags on a bit at times and starts off very slow. It could have been condensed into an even finer film than it is.The Story: 8/10 It's very gripping for the most part, and ends appropriately. Perhaps a bit more focus on June Carter would have made it even better and a bit livelier.Overall, "Walk the Line" has a good message, good acting, and good music. Even people who've never heard of Mr. Cash will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joaquin Phoenix deserved an Oscar for his portrayal, but it was just his bad luck. Not only did he have to compete against Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but also against the fact, that one year earlier Jamie Foxx had won an Academy Award for the portrayal of Ray Charles ... two Oscars in a row for playing in a biopic about a musicians life? Not a chance, although it would've been more than appropriate.I didn't know much about Johnny Cash, before I watched the movie, I have to admit, so I'm sure other people can comment on how accurate this depicts the real events. But still I was amazed by the life and struggle of this man. Watch it, if you can (-&gt; have the time).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pleasant surprise: (re)discover the legendary 'Man in Black'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took a while to get to this picture. Cash is one of the few musical artists in recent history for whom I have the unqualified respect, first because he was a great songwriter and singer, but, more importantly, because he was real. He never hesitated to do what he thought to be the right thing, he always spoke bluntly and directly, he judged others by their natures and essentially without prejudice, and he never pretended to be other than who and what he was. His autobiographies are painfully honest. He was a simple man with an unfathomable depth. This would be a better, stronger nation if all American artists were this thoughtful and yet also this open. Cash, not Ginsberg or Dylan, fulfilled Walt Whitman's hope of an 'everyman' American poet.So obviously I wasn't expecting much from a film about Cash made in Hollywood, the capitol of masks, lies and hypocrisy.Thankfully, the Cash family was in on the production of the film. It turns out to be a pleasant surprise. It is as slick as any Hollywood 'period' picture - I would actually have preferred a rougher edge to the visuals. But it is still pretty much Johnny Cash up there. Phoenix - one of our best young actors - captures the strangely offbeat yet hypnotic charisma that glowed out at the world from Cash's eyes, a charm that could seem alternately homespun and mysterious. Something burned in Cash's soul, and while he was completely honest about it, it still remains an enigma; Phoenix captures that as well.All the other actors do quite well; another special stand-out performance is by Robert Patrick as Ray Cah, Johnny's father. Gosh, I really hate this guy! Yet Patrick manages to avoid slipping into stereotype, so the last moment we see son and father together, it remains believable that somehow they came to terms with one another.The musical performances are all pretty good, although they don't quite meet the Cash standard. And the background performances by the people playing some of rock's greatest early legends (jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, etc.) are somewhat uneven. But the show belongs to Phoenix, and he pulls it of very well.One note on the DVD release: it includes scenes cut from theatrical release. Usually I get bored with the 'deleted scenes' on DVDs because it's quite clear why they were deleted and ought to have been. In this instance, however, their deletion is completely baffling. Most are excellent, certainly as good as any in the released film, and some are even important in the way they tie certain ends together. I strongly suggest to the makers of this film that they restore these deletions for a second release, which would give a good film a new, perhaps improved, life in the theater.In any event, quite a good movie, and certainly an homage to Cash that invites audiences to listen to his music, and to (re)discover the legendary 'Man in Black'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit cliché but fantastic none the less.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I say cliché only because they probably stuck to the truth (the book) as much as possible and Johnny Cash's life probably was a bit of a cliché. You can see they went to the "Ray" school of biographies (right down the brother dieing). Although I'll forgive that because it's true. Maybe having a sibling die when you are young turns you into a fabulous musician and really really rich when you got older. I'm glad no one told me that when my sister was a pain in the ass for 10 years :). I digress.If you love music, you'll love this movie. I'm not a big Johnny Cash fan. I like his music, but have purchased no CDs/albums of his. But I like movies about musicians (especially talented ones). This one is well done. Probably the reason I gave it a 9/10 was the fact that Joaquin and Reese actually sing. Reese is really a good singer and I see why she got the Oscar. But Joaquin was robbed by Mr. Hoffman. Mr. Hoffman didn't have to sing nor learn to play the guitar. I felt I was watching Johnny Cash. I didn't feel I was watching Capote, but Hoffman doing a Capote imitation. Joaquin is fabulous in this movie. To make my point I'll reference one scene (no spoiler). He's playing a song at an audition that the other members of his band have never heard. When it gets to the part where a lead guitar is needed he turns to his lead guitar and gives a look of "dear god help me!!" that is priceless. That look alone made this movie for me.9/10 Own it on DVD. Watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2005's 'Ray'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The life of Johnny Cash and Ray Charles have some surprising parallels, Both men grew up in the south, Cash; born 1932 in southern Arkansas. Charles; born 1930 in Albany, GA. Both men lost a brother in their youth; Cash lost his older brother, Jack, in a wood saw accident at ten. Charles witnessed his younger brother's drowning at the age of five. Both have roots in gospel; Cash abandoned gospel early in his career only to go back to it in 1956 with a impromptu jam session with Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Roy Orbison (Carl Perkins was recording a new release. Producer Sam Phillips 'left' the tape running but the session remained in the can for 20 years). Charles brought gospel back in his music in 1954 with 'I got a women" A Gospel-Jazz infusion. Cash battled an addiction to amphetamines and barbiturates; Charles a 20 year battle with heroin. Both men have had careers spanning five decades. Now they have another parallel both have a big budget biopic, post-mortem. Jamie Foxx portrayed Ray Charles in 'Ray' (2004). Joaquin Phoenix takes on the man in black in 'Walk the Line' (2005). This is an Oscar bid from Phoenix, and he does a very good job as Cash, however I think Reese Witherspoon does a better job as June Carter Cash, Johnny's life long love and second wife. Robert Patrick (the bad Terminator in T2) plays Cash's father, Ray Cash. After the death of John's older brother, Ray Cash actually tells his ten year old son "the devil took the wrong son!", a chip that he holds on his shoulder for most of his son's life. Art direction was on target, I really felt I was looking back in time, costume design 100%. My disappointment was to find out that out of all the Cash songs that were featured; my personal favorite 'A Boy Name Sue' was not included. Phoenix has one ace up his sleeve and he is hoping it has Oscar written all over it: he and Reese Witherspoon sang all vocals themselves (Jamie Foxx was lip synching). Phoenix and Witherspoon may be unaware of 'Beyond the Sea' (2004), Kevin Spacey's Biopic of Bobby Darin, Spacey did all the vocals as the lead character and the film went un-noticed by the academy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Portrait of an artist's journey and his great love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Walk the Line" is the story of Johnny Cash, and it's based on two autobiographies of the great singer. Its stars are Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, Robert Patrick, Ginnifer Goodwin and Dallas Roberts. The story begins with Cash (Phoenix) contemplating an electric saw at Folsom Prison as he flashes back to what brought him there. The flashback brings the viewer full circle: through Johnny's young life with his family, who are cotton pickers; the horrific death of his brother; the resentment of his father who yells "The wrong son died." Cash, absent from the scene when his brother died, carried feelings of guilt around for years afterward. The film continues with Cash's military life, his first guitar, the beginning of his song writing, an early marriage, children, the odd jobs he did while waiting to make it as a singer; his audition with Sam Phillips who tells him, "I can't sell gospel" and Cash's singing of his own music; a back-breaking tour schedule and the meeting of his long-time idol, the vivacious, talented June Carter, already well known with her family on the circuit; alcohol, drugs, infidelity, his great love for June who is his rock, and finally, redemption.Thanks to superb performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who do their own singing and play their own instruments, "Walk the Line" soars, keeping the viewer absorbed in the life of this incredibly talented man throughout. Sam Phillips' unique ability to spot a superstar is unparalleled - Cash was his first discovery after Elvis. Early photographs of Cash at Sun Records show a thin man with a shy smile and 5 o'clock shadow at the beginning of his success. That beautiful baritone voice that sounded like it had endured life's tortures, the constant wearing of black, his songs that spoke to America, made him an icon. Predictably, success was hard to handle - there were women, there was exhaustion on the tour - so there were uppers and alcohol. And there was June, the bright light at the end of his black tunnel.This is first and foremost a great love story. It could have been a run of the mill biopic. Instead, it's beautifully directed by James Mangold, who gives great attention to detail and atmosphere and keeps the story going. Reese Witherspoon deservedly won an Oscar for her portrayal of June Carter. Tiny, energetic, and strong, she's like a magnet for the viewer. All eyes are on June with her sunny smile. Reese's accent is perfect since she's from New Orleans - it becomes part of her character instead of being a distraction. Though petite, she looms taller than Cash.Joaquin Phoenix is a fantastic Cash. What else can be said - it's nice to have a great June, but there's no movie without a great Johnny. He's very convincing throughout Cash's pain and struggles. One thing that is impressive is Phoenix's use of his energy. He would somewhat underplay and when it came time for Cash to lose his temper - WOW - it really hits the viewer and is a great demonstration of Cash's volatility. The actor actually pulled the sink out of the wall in an unscripted moment in one of the scenes.X-Files star Robert Patrick has a nice role here as Cash's father, and he's excellent as a violent man who shuts down after the death of his child and carries resentment with him wherever he goes. The little scene at the end of the film is a wonderful moment.I had only two complaints about this film. One, it ran just a little too long. The second thing is something I could be wrong about and probably am. One of Elvis' band gives Cash uppers while both he and Presley are on tour in the mid-'50s. It is my understanding from Peter Guarlnick's fantastic book, "Last Train to Memphis" that Elvis didn't start on uppers until he was in the army having to do night duty. It was then that he also noticed it helped his weight.Minor complaints about a brilliant film. Highly, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"hello. I'm Johnny Cash" and the cheers would fill the stadium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I live in the city where purportedly Johnny proposed to June on stage. I cant recollect that, but I do recollect the time he did a show here and heard about an easter fund raising event on the radio called the 'bunny bundle'. so he called in and gave 5,000 dollars. some loser called in after that denigrating it as a 'publicity stunt', so Johnny called back, gave ANOTHER 5 grand and canceled the show.so from that I concluded he was a generous and sensitive man of principles.his Folsom album was the first C&amp;W recording I ever bought. I even learned the lyrics.and then he played Toronto at the ontario place stage before it was torn down. a very intimate setting and you could see how he had aged but still got a great deal of enjoyment from performing, another aspect of his generosity.Jouquin Phoenix matches his voice and mannerisms perfectly, the wavy black hair and the way he would reach around the back part of his guitar and swing it around. and Reese was amazing too, especially doing the singing parts herself.I just picked up the DVD since it has now started to hit the second hand shops.a very outstanding film about the real life experiences of a very outstanding pair of performers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Johnny Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 16 years old and was listening to the radio and heard this funny song titled "A Boy Named Sue" and I have never heard of this singer called Johnny Cash. From that day until now, I have been a true Johnny Cash fan, I watched his ABC series on TV and had gone with my parents to see him 7 times when he had a show close to where I lived. I bought his records/8 tracks and even learned to play the guitar so I could play his songs. I idolized him and watched him on TV every time he was on. I watched very closely every movement he made and listened to every word he said.On "Black Friday" the day after Thanksgiving 2005 I went to see the movie "Walk The Line" - BUT - I went with the attitude that NOBODY would give a good performance trying to be Johnny Cash. He was a "legend" - and I watched Johnny Cash and listened to him on TV/radio/records/8 tracks and I was 100% convinced that whoever this Joaquin Phoenix was - he was going to "bomb". WAS I EVER WRONG! I had read about this movie before it was released and it said that both actors did their own singing of "his" songs. It wasn't long into the movie when I realized and said to myself "this guy is doing a pretty good job". By the end of the movie, Joaquin Phoenix got 2 thumbs up from me. He was wonderful. Reese Witherspoon did a good job too as June Carter. But I feel that he should have gotten the Oscar as well.The "only" thing I found that he did NOT do like Johnny Cash did while singing and playing the guitar was that the real Johnny Cash "often" played the guitar way up on the neck - which was not done ONCE in the entire movie. But the acting and singing and even the movements of his mouth and the way he stood at the microphone was SUPERB. GREAT JOB!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was amazed by the performances because the main characters were brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. The whole movie took me back to a place of wonderful memories. To everyone involved in this movie, thank you for an awesomely wonderful film. I think Johnny and June would have been very touched and pleased . God Bless you all. I happen to think there could have been no better choices to play the roles in this movie, and there was much that I personally remembered having read about Johnny Cash, though I didn't remember anything about June Carter until after the story broke about their relationship. I think an excellent job was done on this film over all and I wish Joaquin Phoenix could have gotten more recognition for the great job he did portraying Johnny Cash</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic portrayal of Johnny Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm watching this movie again and really enjoy it, I always liked these biographical type movies. I never liked Joaquin Phoenix much, he always seemed to play creepy roles, like in Gladiator and Buffalo Soldiers, but he was terrific in this movie. I'm amazed at some of the comments by people who don't like the movie because he doesn't look like Cash, or the guy who played Elvis didn't look like Elvis, etc. It's the portrayal of the person that should count, not the physical resemblance. Phoenix did an amazing performance as Johnny Cash. Did anybody hate Gary Busey as Buddy Holly, Sissy Spacek as Lorretta Lynn, Dianna Ross as Billie Holliday, Jessica Lange as Patsy Cline, or Larry Parks as Al Jolson? (That's going way back) None of those actors 'Looked like' the performers they portrayed but all did amazing and memorable performances. Everybody is entitled to their opinions, but I liked this movie. I always enjoyed Johnny Cash music, I'm old enough to remember seeing him, I have the Folsom Prison album on vinyl, who doesn't?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I knew that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon would play the leading roles in the Johnny Cash biopic I feared the worst. The so-affected Phoenix playing the man in black??? No way!! And what about the "legally blonde" playing June Carter?? It looked like a bad joke.Now, I gotta swallow my words: Joaquin has made an impressing work playing Johnny Cash and singing his songs. And Reese put aside her prissy look and makes a so serious performing, also her work playing the songs is awesome.So, once the two actors did their job it's time for the director for creating a respectful movie to the figure of Cash. That's exactly what Mike Newell did. Maybe "Walk the line" is not a thorough biography, but I think Johnny Cash himself would have liked it 'cause almost everything in the film it's about his love story with June.A brilliant and moving movie that honours the memory of one of the definitive personalities of 20th century and a music genius. We miss you, Johnny!! *My rate: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotionally triumphant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One reason that Walk the Line is so good is that I can watch it multiple times without ever getting bored (four viewings so far.) In my opinion, there are no flat parts in this story, and the music is always compelling, like a good album. What is so good about Walk the Line? A: The principal actors are completely facile, their characterizations are so translucent, that it's like knowing John and June personally. B: The editing is very tight and tells the story succinctly with no superfluous scenes. C: The emotions portrayed are those of real people, and are entirely convincing. The camera focuses on the faces a lot, and that is where the story is conveyed. D: Good character is proved to be triumphant in the end, and weak character is overcome, i.e. good morals, patience, and real love are rewarded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always loved Johnny Cash and the story of his life but watching this movie has made me love him even more. Joaquin Phoenix does a very good job when he's singing especially the way he holds the guitar and moves his mouth when he sings.. I don't know, I notice things! I love how you watch the movie and at some parts, you hate him for what he did and/or thought but in another way, you have pity for him. They show you why he became that way and kind of put you in his place for the story. I can't believe that Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix really sing and frankly, do it VERY well. I love this movie and I love Johnny Cash! R.I.P. J.R.! &lt;3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one and only man in Black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My trouble with this movie is that I have 20-30 albums with the real Johnny Cash so I know what he sounded like and how he looked like. On the other hand I have no clue what June Carter looked like, or how she sounded. (Except for a few duets with Johnny).The first scenes when the camera flies over the walls of Folsom Prison, and the famous boom-chicka-boom sounds grows louder and louder , and then goes inside the walls of Folsom, where prisoners clap hands and stamp feet, is one of the most powerful openings I'v seen in a movie recently.Then follows the usual story of childhood sorrows (Remenicent of other biography movies like "Ray" about Ray Charles), younghood backdrafts, a usual tour of Duty, to early success via Sam Philips Sun Studios, early marriage with kids, touring and drugs. Missbehavior, drunk or pills and a collapse on stage. What makes this work is the acting of Witherspoon, far beyond her Valley Girl image. From a country music hillbilly sidekick or an early version of stand-up comedy, to a caring friend and later wife.Phoenix doesn't look like Johnny Cash at all, but yet he makes a great role about a man named Johnny Cash, he might have learned the manners and how to sing, and Phoenix does a great job, no doubt about that, and sings well in his way, but since I have Cd's Lp's with the real Johnny Cash, something is missing. On the other hand I think the producers made a correct choice to use (or pay) an A-actor, instead of searching for a lookalike, and maybe find a look-alike in the c-actor, d-actor or even z-actor divisions, that might have looked like Johnny spot image, but with no talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Ray!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I bought the ticket for Walk the Line, I quietly said to myself, "This better not be Ray again," the Oscar-heavy of 2004. Unfortunately, a few too many comparisons can be made. Johnny Cash tragically loses his brother at a young age and feels guilty about the loss for a long time, as Ray Charles did. Drug abuse nearly ruins his career and life, again, like Ray. Walk the Line is a basic run-of-the-mill, making-of-a-legend biography, just like Ray. Big "However," this is where the comparisons end, and where Walk the Line morphs into a different genre to become its own film. It's more than a biopic - it's mostly the love story between Cash (Joaquin Phoenix, proving awesome devotion once again) and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon, restoring faith and making me almost entirely forget the Legally Blondes). My favorite scene is definitely Cash's first audition in a local studio, where he sings a truly in-the-moment rendition of "Folsom Prison Blues." The movie is terrific and really was robbed of a Best Picture nomination from the Academy this year, but it leaves you wishing you knew June Carter's past just as well as the Man in Black's... which is probably the strongest reason that Best Actress Oscar belongs to Witherspoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, two great performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever there were a case of two performers taking over a film and making it their own this is it. Walk the Line is elevated by two of the most brilliant performances you could ever hope to see from Joaquin Phoenix as the legendary Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, Cash's partner on stage and eventually offstage as well. The love Johnny Cash and June Carter had for one another was legendary and the performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon more than do their story justice. The story of Johnny and June is a great one and it's told pretty well in this film. The film takes a little while to really get going, showing Johnny's troubled childhood and his struggle to launch his music career. The film doesn't really take off until Johnny and June come together. There are still some lulls after that and some tough, painful moments as well as Cash's terrible addictions are honestly and at times rather brutally displayed. But throughout the brilliance of Phoenix and Witherspoon is constant. They are terrific in portraying the great love their two characters had for one another and also brilliantly express the frustrations they would have with one another as their relationship progressed in fits and starts. And where Phoenix and Witherspoon really shine is on stage as, yes, they do all the singing themselves. In this area Phoenix in particular is simply mesmerizing. In look and sound he is so believable on stage as Johnny Cash it is downright eerie. Close your eyes and you would be forgiven for thinking you were listening to Cash himself.As wonderful as Phoenix and Witherspoon are the film does struggle at times to keep the story moving. You get the feeling there could have been ten minutes or so trimmed out that wouldn't have been missed and that would have helped the film maintain a more constant energy. When it's good, this film is very, very good but there are too many moments when the story drags. The filmmakers take great pains to make sure we really get to know Johnny Cash but there are definitely some scenes which could have been shortened or eliminated altogether without taking away from our understanding of who Johnny Cash really was. By the end of the film it is obvious this is not just Johnny's story but the story of Johnny and June together and in retrospect it seems the film was just killing time until the two leads could be brought together. Other performances, including Ginnifer Goodwin as Johnny's first wife and Robert Patrick as Johnny's father, are fine and their roles are important in establishing why Johnny Cash became the man that he was. But this movie clearly belongs to Johnny and June, Phoenix and Witherspoon. Walk the Line is certainly a good film. If you feel it is something special it will have been the performances of Phoenix and Witherspoon which will have made it so.</fullReview>

As a viewer you can really feel with the character and it is very realistic. I am not surprised that he won an Oscar for this role The plot itself is about the life of Jonny Cash and how he lived. Furthermore the music in the movie is really good. I could rent the movie just to listen to the music. Jonny Cash would be proud if he saw this movie. I can strongly recommend this movie. You will not be disappointed when you see this movie. It is the perfect movie for a nice Saturady night!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Stunning Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There isn't much one can say about the creative quality of any biopic's story line. Either the original book writers, screenplay adapters, producers and directors opt to remain faithful to the facts or they don't. We in the audience trust them to sort out all the different data tidbits they are presented with and ultimately remain true to the facts. Serious Johnny Cash fans probably already knew this entire story line from its earliest beginnings; casual fans probably recalled the middle of his life and the outcome; but along the way everyone seeing this film couldn't help but become enlightened. What makes this marvelous gem so exceptional is the quality of everyone's performances. For baby boomers who grew up listening to Johnny Cash and for others who now follow them, "Walk The Line" wasn't a film "about" Johnny Cash. Instead, thanks to Joaquin Phoenix's phenomenal performance, it became a film "including" Johnny Cash. I will go to my grave believing that without question Joaquin Phoenix deserved the award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in 2005. It should be regarded as the gold standard for delivering all future biopic roles. For goodness sakes, this man used his own singing voice, and he was right on the money in sound, gestures and demeanor all the time. Kudos also to Reese Witherspoon for her performance that earned the Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, as well as to the entire supporting casting for maximizing the believability of this historical masterpiece, most notably: Ginnifer Goodwin (as Johnny's first wife), Robert Patrick (as Johnny's father), Sandra Ellis Lafferty (as June's mother) and Dallas Roberts (as Sam Phillips). Moreover, the set recreations of the period were very believable. Not many films achieve IMDb ratings of 8.1 or higher, which is the rarefied air earned by "Walk The Line" at the time of this posting. I think that says it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Musical biographies of the past 30 years have been absorbing. 'The Buddy Holly Story', 'The Rose', 'The Doors' and 'Ray' have all been successful and following in a similar path is this film with a simple story telling technique, stellar performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon as Johnny Cash and June Carter. 'Walk the Line' is not afraid to show the flaws in the greatest country/crossover performer who ever lived because Phoenix is allowed to balance the performer and the man equally in a way that seems memorable on both ends and the chemistry between the two leads in magical in the traditions of old fashioned story telling.</fullReview>

A minor letdown were Taylor Hilton as Elvis, who didn't even remotely possessed the power and charisma of Elvis.There is really not much else I could say about it. You got to experience it!

I really did enjoy the movie, it inspired me to buy Cash's Vinyls and really get into some great songwriting. It is hard to get into country singers today they are to commercialized.

		<shortDescription>A walk between success and failure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Mangold has proved himself as a diverse director, tackling crime and corruption within the police force (Copland), angst and suicidal tendencies amongst a group of female patients of a mental institution (Girl, Interrupted), and a horror whodunit mystery located at an isolated motel (Identity). Now, Mangold offers up the biopic genre which has recently been showcased as a guaranteed Academy highlight.The line which has been traversed by Johnny J.R. Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), hasn't always been a straight one. Beginning in childhood with the endless days working in his Kansas home's cotton fields, the tragic death of his brother, and the strained relationship with his father (Robert Patrick), Cash emerges from the ruins of his personal life by pursuing an entirely new persona.From the moment he purchases his first guitar and walks into a recording studio to sell his first song, down to his infamous performance for a crowd of inmates at Folsom prison, Cash's rags-to-riches journey is rife with highs and lows. He encounters initial rejections of his material, begins neglecting dull family obligations alongside his wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), and his children, in favor of extensive concert tours, and ultimately descends into a spiral of addiction, all of this happening, just as he begins to get recognized, and collaborating with newly-introduced legends such as Elvis Prestley, Roy Orbison, and Jerry Lee Lewis.Along the way, he finds his salvation, lifelong performer June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Carter is sweet as pie, which heavily contrasts with Cash's rough edges, but they nonetheless make a connection, both as a professional and romantic duo, as they embark on a ten-year road together before they can actually be reunited. Carter's strong will and emotional investment towards Cash's condition, soon begin serving as the anchor that kept him from sinking even lower.Both Phoenix and Witherspoon are an electrifying presence on stage, Carter's spunk serving to complement Cash's brooding demeanor, and their chemistry is highly palpable. It also becomes quite obvious that the only time Cash is ever really in control of his life is when he has his guitar in hand, using it as an outer expression of his inner feelings, commanding full attention from his audience, a feat that will no doubt be repeated with movie audiences, as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made docu-drama that deserved it's Oscar nominations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh A drama depicting the life of famed country/rock and roll singer Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) from his childhood days growing up on a ranch in Arkansas, where he tragically lost his older brother in an accident involving a saw, his time in the Air Force, trying unsuccessfully to cut it as a door to door salesman before striking it lucky and getting a hit record. From there, the glory of fame has it's highs and it's lows, including a dangerous drug dependency.So many films get released nowadays it's hard to keep up with them all, but James Mangold's drama of the late, great rock singer Johnny Cash Walk the Line is one I'd heard a lot of praise for but had yet to get round to getting up off my butt and going to see. It did well at the Oscars too, certainly getting a few nominations in.One thing it can boast is great performances. Phoenix captures the spirit and dash of Cash quite well. I don't know if he met the man before he died or not, but he's just as compelling as Jamie Foxx was as Ray Charles or Will Smith was as Ali. I liked Reese Witherspoon in the supporting role as well, very pretty and giving a colourful portrayal of the love of Cash's life.The film is a thorough re-telling of Cash's life, not done with as much emotional gusto as I'd have thought and dragging on a bit towards the end (over-stretching it's running time I'd have said.) But it's undeniably well-made and deserved it's Oscar status. Well worth seeing. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joaquin Phoenix. What can I say? He is such the amazing actor, and he stars as Johnny Cash in the greatest movie ever seen, Walk the Line. And, for all you folks who doubted he actually sang in this motion picture, well, think again. Phoenix actually took voice lessons along with fellow actress Reese Witherspoon, who played the beautiful June Carter. So, if you are stuck at home, go out and rent/buy Walk the Line. The moving story about Johnny Cash+June Carter, played by outstanding actors/actresses, written by a lovely writer, and directed by an amazing director. Not only did the story help you understand the life of Cash, but it helps you respect it, too. Most people don't think that actors in Hollywood can pull of the 1940's star's life, but Phoenix and Witherspoon proved them wrong. All I can say is, if you don't go out and see this movie sometime in your life, you are missing, a one-in-a-lifetime chance to see an adorable, unique, calming story, Walk the Line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History of Rock and Roll is Not What you Think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie with lots of surprises coming from someone who assumes that Johnny Cash is just a country music and had no idea other than someone with an over-sized guitar and a bass voice. The quality of the movie and the surprise of the beginnings of rock and roll totally surprised me and as a result I ended up watching this movie on the very first day I bought this video four times in a row. So this movie just moved me a lot, and this coming from a person whose favorite music is just only the Beatles! Johnny Cash is not just country, he is in a class unique, combining blues, gospel, Rock &amp; Roll, depending on his music.It is a movie about the early part of Johnny Cash's life as a humble cotton farmer, after joining the Air Force, married, settled down in Memphis, Tennessee to work as a unsuccessful door to door salesman trying to support his family.It totally surprised me that Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins' music has its roots in about the same time during the early 1950s, in the same region, the Deep South, and were discovered by what I call the Father of Rock and Roll, Sam Philips of Sun Records.It also revealed Sam is not only tactful and a visionary but can push people to perform his best and with tact and flexibility. Little did I realized that Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lewis all toured together! I wasn't even aware that both the lives of Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash both got addicted with amphetamines while on this same tour and both suffered greatly, where Johnny Cash addiction was saved by June Carter, while Elvis Presley died without anyone's help.You will learn that Johnny Cash's life was no easy matter either, his first wife can barely control him while it was June Carter personality was a different chemistry altogether, where the little lady through her own morals can achieve such control and charisma over Johnny Cash. There are lots of surprises in the movie, such as promoting his band through a prison and other interesting fact.The movie did eventually revealed that in year 2003, both Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash died that same year, but it is also noteworthy to pay respects to Sam Phillips, who also died that same magical year of 2003 also. It is as if it was the end for legend world of rock and roll and country that year.I highly recommend this movie more than just a mere biopic, while Joaquin Phoenix do resemble somewhat of Johnny Cash, it was Reese Witherspoon that the entire movie is centered. This is a sheer surprise for me as this movie represents the love of Johnny Cash's life for June Carter since his childhood right up decades later in what I believe to be one of the longest courtship uphill battle for June Carter, something so difficult to attain that success only is secondary to him. The fun thing about the movie is that success may be the only thing, but, in the words of Johnny Cash's father that he is just still "nothing" without a real family or a real love.Therefore the history of Rock and Roll is not what thought to be just Beatles versus Elvis Presley. It is much more than this. It is a movie that had a lot of substance. It is of course non-fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The man who wore black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know much about the life of Johnny Cash before I saw James Mangold's movie.After watching the movie I was touched. The legend of Johnny Cash was a survival story of the man who had so much sorrow in his life. Joaquin Phoenix was very good choice to portray the man in black. Phoenix's performance was very strong because he himself shares a tragic loss of a brother in his past. I felt like Phoenix made a touching tribute to his older brother, the actor River Phoenix who was taken from this world too early by a drug overdose.Another great fact was that Reese Witherspoon made an effort to prove she's more than a bimbo blond b-rate actress. The role of June Carter was her ticket to fame. The role was the perfect opportunity to win an Academy Award jury's heart. I think she swept all of us away by proving that she can act and sing, too.The story follows Cash's story pretty much in chronological order but in biopic's that kind of storytelling is better because you don't necessarily know all the facts of some person's life.The cinematography is a little bit dark but still beautiful. The music of Johnny Cash leads the audience and helps to tell the story as it was.The fact that Johnny Cash was a little bit violent side (maybe mainly because of all the heavy drinking he did) Cash was portrayed as a loving and tender father although he wasn't always there when they needed him. I truly think he also loved his first wife at first but when June Carter came in to the picture that his love for her was so powerful and strong that nothing could be done.Despite the mushy ending (be honest: you really wanted it to end like that!) the movie was enjoyable and one of the greatest biopics I have ever seen! Cash wore black but his future was still very bright. Very romantic fact is that both Carter and Cash died so little time apart. If that isn't a true love story then what is?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The love between him and June Carter was simply electrifying and this was one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever watched. From the minute he laid eyes on her, you could feel his emotions and that she had stolen his heart away. His life was a turmoil and such a sad and painful childhood he led, but all that I could feel through this movie was his love for June. I wanted him to run off with her the first time they met...but they didn't ....they kept it a friendship until the attraction between them was so strong that those around them could feel it as well. It's no wonder that he died just months after she passed away. I'm sure they're together somewhere making beautiful music together just as they did when they were here. I miss them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much to do with how his life really was, but very entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this 10 stars because the film is well done and highly entertaining, although upon reading a biography about Johnny Cash, I discovered the film is not very true to it.The film leads one to believe that Johnny Cash had no particular ambitions to be a performer when he first married Vivian. The facts are, he was not only writing his own songs by age twelve, but while in high school he performed on a radio station and he continued doing this after meeting and marrying Vivian.I don't know if Johnny ever tried to sell things door to door, but he did work in Detroit for awhile. He also attended college, something you'd never guess from watching "Walk the Line." He also went to New York in real life and completely left Vivian and his children behind when he did so. Again - not reflected in the film.Why Hollywood can't just tell the story the way it was really lived I've never understood. The man's real life was a highly interesting story and did not need to be fictionalized.There are, of course, some accuracies in the film. I do believe he and June Carter were each other's greatest loves.There is also lots of fine music in the film, which I greatly enjoyed. Both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon do absolutely bang-up jobs in their portrayals of Johnny and June.I was particularly impressed with Joaquin Phoenix, he is a very handsome man and gives off a sexual intensity that is almost palpable. I found him completely riveting.So don't go into this film expecting to see Johnny and June's real life stories, but if you just want to be entertained this film surely does that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine film with some perfect performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walk the Line tells the tale of musical legend Johnny Cash. It depicts his spiral through drug and alcohol addiction, his somewhat "affair" with June Carter and his effort to get his father to love him. It is such a good film. The performances are outstanding. Joaquin Phoenix was the perfect choice to play Johnny Cash. When you see him you truly think he is Johnny Cash, from the voice to the addictions and his love for June Carter, who is amazingly played by Reese Witherspoon who really deserved that Oscar. It was good to see her serious side for once. The supporting cast are all just as good.James Mangold does a fine job of directing. The pacing never lets down, which can be a problem in some biopics. He takes us through the major parts of Cash's life in a mixed up fashion. But it works for the better. He really got a lot out of the actors. Their vocals were amazing.Overall, this movie is not to be missed, especially if you're a fan of Johnny Cash. Or if you just want to see a great movie. Even though I never had heard of him until this movie, I still thoroughly enjoyed it.4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should start out by saying a few things. First off, I'm definitely a fan of Johnny Cash, and if you aren't you likely wont share my opinions on this fine film. Second, the isn't much in the review that hasn't been said before...but it's my review, so sue me.Now, let me get this out of the way: The actors are phenomenal. All the praise, awards and nominations were wholeheartedly deserved. Phoenix does an incredible job as Cash, as does Witherspoon as June Carter. They are very believable together and both do a great job. There was some great work in the supporting cast as well, for example Tyler Hilton as Elvis Presley. He didn't have very much time on screen, which I think is a shame.Next, the music! On top of being great actors, Phoenix and Witherspoon show that they really have pipes! Not only are they very good singers, the sound very similar to their real-life counterparts. I almost felt like singing along at a few parts...but then I realised that I'd probably scare everyone away.The only thing I didn't particularly care for was the directing. It seemed very bland, and on top of that the editing was pretty bad in places.All in all this is a great movie to see, even if you aren't a Cash fan. Highly recommended.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk The Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought "Walk the Line" was a great movie with great music. It is very rare in Hollywood when a movie is made with the actual actors sing and playing their own instruments. Unlike other actors who choose not to(won't mention any names, Jamie Foxx). And James Mangold was able to do just that. He was able to do those close-ups while they were singing and made the audience believe they were really watching Johnny and June. And that makes a great movie. Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix did an awesome job. I would like to say one thing on Joaquin's behalf. We (yes there are others who feel the same way) believe Joaquin should have won the Oscar for "Best Actor" Learning how to sing, play the guitar and act like the "One and Only Johnny Cash" is not easy and yet Joaquin made it look like he was a pro at entertaining people Well I guess if you look at it in a different way, he is a pro at entertaining people!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually I don't like a movie unless It has action and sci-fi in it, I also don't like romantic movies either, but this movie was an exception. Reese Witherspoon did an excellent job playing a country girl, and who would of thought she could sing country music. Joaquin Poenix's performance was quite impressive as well. There is one thing I did not like about this movie though. No matter how they try and sugar it up, Johnny Cash was still cheating on his wife and that is just flat out wrong. His wife was a good woman, she was not like that hag you saw in the movie. Anyway, besides that one downfall, I thought this movie was pretty good. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

Including the story of love involved with the music of JOhnny Cash as well as his professional career and personal life, this film shows everything about the man which is a country music symbol. Phoenix and Witherspoon both shine in their roles and both Oscar-worthy if they could give multiple ones out per year, but both were amazing to say the least.

		<fullReview>Some viewers have knocked this film because it fails to provide an interesting plot; some have knocked it for phoenix's acting.As a former professional actor I can tell you that phoenix and Witherspoon were inspiring and sometimes brilliant. In fact, the ensemble of cash's father, cash's first wife Vivian, and cash's suffering mother was top notch. However, the film was standard Hollywood product with the all important "narrative arc".-- By the way...when I was a kid in the fifties I heard jerry lee Lewis' music, I flipped. Nothing could catapult people onto the dance floor like a lewis tune with its pumping and jumping piano. Elvis may have been the KING, but Jerry Lee went all the way; his music penetrated into that primal area of Dionysian ecstasy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little over-the-top but well produced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Walk The Line" presents the early years of Johnny Cash, known as J.R. to his friends and family, who struggles with several demons as he transitions from childhood to early adulthood and becomes one of the best-known country music stars in history. In turn, those struggles and hardships become the inspiration behind his many memorable tunes. Joaquin Phoenix, previously known for his work in "Gladiator," seems to step into the role of the Man In Black and capture those struggles in convincing fashion, while Reese Witherspoon does a fine job playing June Carter, a woman who is not without her own struggles; while I'm not convinced that her performance justified an Academy Award, she plays the part well. Given that both leads needed to learn to (a) sing and (b) play their respective instruments in convincing fashion, you start to believe that they are emulating the spirits of the legendary husband-and-wife team. As I suggest, sometimes the drama goes over-the-top and the action seemed to drag some halfway through the film, but I was pleasantly surprised by the story. If nothing else, the music is enough to make it worth a watch.</fullReview>

Throughout the movie he progressed and got better and better.Really great acting, you can tell everyone really got into their parts and did an excellent job portraying the real people.

		<shortDescription>Stellar but grounded</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many others who saw this film, I was not a fan of Johnny Cash's music. That fact held me back from seeing this movie. So after I had viewed all the other 'top' films from last year, and being disappointed in almost every one of them, I finally rented 'Walk the Line' and was knocked out by the film, the performances, and ironically, the music. It touched me emotionally, and gave me a reason to believe that there are still great movies being made with honesty and no CGI effects to rely on.The film starts with a pulsating roar that keeps building while the camera winds its way slowly inward past nervous looking prison guards and nervous looking band members, until it is revealed that the noise is coming from a hundred pairs of feet, stomping on the floor. This audience is ready for their hero, however unlikely he is. Then just as suddenly the film reveals the beginning of where the story of Johnny Cash starts- in the poverty of the south, where everybody is poor and hard work the steady diet. There is his older brother Jack, with a heart of love who is worshiped by his younger brother, Johnny known as J.R. by the family. Johnny knows his older brother Jack is the worthy one in the family, just as he believes he is unworthy as his father makes sure he realizes over and over again throughout his life. The only respite from this tortured childhood is found in the music coming from the radio, and the hymns his mother sings.To escape from this father who will never stop with his "Where were you?" guilt routine John signs up for military service and the film shows how once away from home he finds his first guitar and humbly starts to write songs, the seed of creativity is allowed out and we watch as he finds music to become his sole reason for living. Juaquin Phoenix starts to wear Johnny Cash not only on the outside, but becomes the man himself, a transformation complete as it gets. Reese might have won for best actress as June Carter Cash, but if Jamie Foxx had not won for best actor in Ray the year before I believe it would have gone to this performance by Juaquin.When this film backs up the outstanding acting with the music (helped by T. Bone Burnnett) the feel, look and sound of this movie becomes complete. As the film unfolds the genuine attraction between Johnny and June only serves to underscore the unhappiness of his marriage to Vivianne, his first wife. The re-creation of the musical performances have every bit of reality as the originals. As the years progress and we see Johnny Cash hit his musical height, we also see him brought down to his lowest points, with the use of drugs to keep him numb enough not to feel the pain of his childhood, and his unhappy marriage.This film delivers on every level. By the end I felt my emotional investment in the movie worthwhile, done by the pure craft work in the writing, the filming, the performances and the music. Not bought by cheap CGI effects or a glossy overly produced high budget blockbuster. Just a satisfied feeling that the life of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash was well told, and kudos to the fine ability of the cast and crew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A social perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Why you all dressed in black? Looks like you're going to a funeral". ?"Maybe I am, maybe I am." Those famous words uttered by Johnny Cash almost seem poetic. Poetic in that sadistic lyric 'kind of way' that he was known so well for. Yes, I am a Johnny Cash fan. But like any Cash fan will tell you it wasn't just for his 'razor blades and bullet trains' style singing voice. It was respect for the trials and turbulence of his life. He 'felt' those songs? and he made you feel them to. That was his gift. In not so many words I can see why Johnny's children said the same about 'Walk the line'. It was a film, not a movie. That on screen 'pizzazz' is due not just Johnny's life, but to the actors who so fabulously portrayed it. "The pure and unbridled truth."Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were not just good, they were disturbingly play-full. Like two raccoons trying to get into your garbage after midnight, they were insistent and relentless. A wave of empathy suffocates you from a state of awkwardness to enthusiasm, to embarrassment and finally.. pure joy. Reese had the film 'Election' and Joaquin had 'Gladiator'. These films officially made them Hollywood stars, but this, this is their sunset?..no one will forget the 'the man in black'.Questions popped up during and after production of Joaquin Phoenix and his inspiration to play such a tormented soul such as Johnny's. 'They' say it may have been connected to the death of his own brother, River, who died on an overdose outside Johnny Depp's night club 'The Viper' one sad California morning. I admit the similarities are hard to ignore. Joaquin seems to have grown up in the shadow of his brother up until his death, as did Johnny Cash. Both had brothers who died tragically at a premature age before they truly had a chance to surf the waves people knew they could.Could either have come this far without this tragic psychological childhood trauma? Did it mold their character somehow? I like to think not, I feel shameful somehow for bringing it up?yet one cannot help be drawn to the aura of the tortured artist...the lost soul. Even today Phoenix rarely seems to sway into any kind of Hollywood limelight of self promotion and paparazzi shannanigans like so many of his peers do. Do we respect him more for it? As the 'mad leprechaun' in Looney tunes cartoons so eloquently put it?"we might rabbit, we might."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Should Have Won Best Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always said that Johnny Cash Is the only Country music worth listening to. The reason why is because Cash was heavy metal before heavy metal. Allow me to explain. Johnny Cash wrote and sang songs about killing people, doing drugs, and selling his soul. The guy was Ozzy before Ozzy. That's what made Cash so great. After seeing the very disappointing Ray (The acting was great, but even that didn't stop it from feeling like a made for TV movie on VH-1) I was a little nervous when I heard about the film on Johnny Cash, starring actors and actresses that annoy me. I can't stand Joaquin Phoenix or Reese Witherspoon. I did not hold high hopes for Walk The Line. Luckily I was proved wrong. Walk The Line was great, and it's a bio-film done right. It's the life story of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) who has a hard live growing up in poverty stricken Arkansas, during the '20's and his life didn't get Any better after his brother dies in a horrible accident. Cash spends the rest of his life doing anything he can to make his father (Robert Patrick, Terminator 2, TV's The X-Files) love him. Cash doesn't find happiness till he plays music, but when that's not good enough for his father, or his wife that does nothing to support his love for music. It's not till he's on tour with Elvis Presley (The only flaw in the film, the man who plays Elvis looks or sounds nothing like Elvis)that he meets the woman who he feels is his soul mate June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Walk The Line is a great film, that is more than worth seeing. Witherspoon took home The Acadamy Award for Best Actress and Phoenix should have took home the award for Best Actor. The film itself should have won best picture but sadly that award went to the very over rated Crash. Walk The Line is also fun and at the same time touching and sad. The best scene in the film is the reenactment of the live performance at Folsom Prison where Cash recorded, against the advise of all management at his record label, his best selling album to date. Plus unlike most bio-flick's Walk The Line get's it right. No artsy scenes, or dumb dream sequences like in Ray. This is the story Of Johnny and June-carter Cash plain and simple. I highly recommend this as a rental, and I wish that I saw this film in the theater. It will end up in my DVD collection much, much, much sooner than later. Walk The Line joins films such as The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction. Films that got robbed in the best picture category. On a scale of 10 I give Walk The Line a 10. Yet another great film that should have took home the best picture award and lost to garbage. That's a shame.</fullReview>

Witherspoon played her role as the comedic, talented performer, June Carter very well and deserved the Oscar she received. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the way they portrayed Viv.

Waylon Jennings later came to be a large influence in his life, which was not addressed.The drug issue was not covered as throughly as he did in his autobiographies. I would like to have seen more emphasis on his addiction and the hell he went through to kick it. After he wed June, he travel led a lot, including to Vietnam during the war, plus his own TV show. Then there were "the Highwaymen" years.J R Cash was much more than "the man who wed June Carter."

		<fullReview>I'm going to admit, I never really did ever listen to any Johnny Cash. Hell, Ring of Fire and The Man Comes Around are the only two songs of his I've ever even heard. Then again, I had never really listened to any Ray Charles, yet that didn't stop me from loving Ray in 2004. Especially with all of the awards buzz, this was one that I really wanted to see. So, does Walk the Line really walk the line or does it burn, burn, burn? Walk the Line, as we all know, is the life story of Johnny Cash, portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix. It starts with his child life on a farm, where his father Ray (Patrick) has become dismissive of Johnny since the death of his brother. When Johnny becomes eighteen, he signs up for the army during WWII. Upon his return, he marries his highschool sweetheart Vivian (Goodwin) and gets a failing job as a door-to-door salesman. His real passion though is his band, which he started with two neighbours. They manage to secure themselves an audition, and after using songs Cash wrote in the army, the get a record deal and Cash becomes a star almost overnight.That's how it begins, with Cash as a genuinely good person. Of course, as we've seen before in celebrity biopics, that goodness soon fades as he picks up a pill-popping habit and begins cheating on his wife with fans. He is almost never home to see his wife and children, which leads to the slow destruction of the relationship between Vivian and Johnny. It all seems like fairly standard stuff, which it is, but still is effective.While on tour, Cash also falls for singer June Carter (Witherspoon), whom he has admired since he was a child. This relationship ends up being the keystone of the whole movie, with everything else moving out of the way to concentrate on this aspect. The two of them obviously care for each other, though it is Cash's self-destructive nature that keeps them from truly acting on their impulses.The chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon is quite remarkable. Even from the first scene they share, you can tell that they are destined to spend their life together. Where they truly explode together is on stage, where the bond between them seems even stronger in their duets.Speaking of the stage, it should definitely be noted that all of the actors do their own singing. The songs in the movie are performed exceptionally well by all involved. Sure, they often sound nothing like the original singer, but this makes the movie feel much more real, with performances rather than what could arguably be called an imitation in Ray.The acting is what truly makes the movie. Phoenix is absolutely exceptional as Cash, making a very well known character his own as opposed to Foxx's approach in Ray, which was to get the character to the very last detail. Witherspoon possibly one-ups Phoenix as the incredibly radiant June Carter, displaying both the on- and off-stage persona with ease. She could have easily turned June into a cliché, but instead she seems like an incredibly real person. While the jury is still out on whether it was deserving the Oscar win for Best Actress, it was great nonetheless. Also, a special mention to Ginnifer Goodwin and Robert Patrick (the T-1000 himself), who were both very impressive as well.So, who would win in a fight, Johnny Cash or Ray Charles? To be honest, Ray is the better overall film in my opinion. Walk the Line still does stand tall as a great biopic with excellent chemistry, acting and music. The fact that everyone did their own singing is a definite plus. Walk the Line is definitely a great movie to see if you haven't already.Overall Rating ? 83%</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film all around.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really love this film. I never was a fan of Johnny Cash until recently and now I really like him thanks to this film. Joaquin Phoenix is great as Cash and he deserved every award he got. Reese Witherspoon deserved hers, but I think Phoenix had the more rigorous role. Would you rather play a sweet, innocent Christian gospel singer or a depressed, drunk, drug-dependent singer who had marital and family problems? See? I give all the credit in the world to Phoenix for playing the role perfectly. Of course, Phoenix and Witherspoon can both sing very well and I find it amazing that they did it themselves and Phoenix taught himself to play the guitar. The directing was good, but I think Mangold missed some important stuff when he failed to mention that Johnny Cash was truly saved by God. June had a hand in it for sure, but only God could save anybody from the mess Johnny was in. Still, a great film all they way around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressed with Joaquin as Johnny Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came away from the theater with a whole new respect for Joaquin Phoenix. I was amazed with his superb performance which was deserving of an Oscar, in my opinion. His acting was so natural and smooth that I became totally lost in his portrayal of Mr. Cash, which brought back memories of Johnny's performances on TV. I only knew bits and pieces about Johnny and June's relationship, but the movie left me feeling thoroughly involved in their trials and tribulations, and wanting to know more. I feel Reese Witherspoon was very good in her rendition of June Carter, but at times the wide-eyed cutesy-look and whiny voice of her "June" was distracting, leaving me feeling she had slipped out of character into one of her prior movies. Joaquin and Reese are outstanding vocalists, no doubt about that Walk the Line is a winner. I've seen it on the screen and rented the DVD twice.</fullReview>

Why?, the chemistry between them is so powerful, anything other than a sequel to this movie would be Joaquin stole the show in Gladiator from Russell Crowe,he is a talent to be reckoned with in the future. His good looks are just the icing on the cake, not to mention his low husky and great voice along with his eye expressions. He has Mr. Cash down to a fine tune.Angelica216@bellsouth.net</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Johnny Cash, always have since my dad listened to him, in our small home, in the 1960's and 1970's as I was growing up. This movie is amazing, even for a newcomer to JR cash, this is a MUST SEE movie. The acting was amazing. Reese did an amazing job, and was rewarded well with her award. The story telling was done in a concise manner, and appreciation for the difficulty that Johnny Cash had with Drugs and the toll it took on his personal life, is a story worth understanding. I was quite interested in the storyline in regards to the loss of his brother, and the influence it had on Johnny's life, in a personal way, and in a musical influence. His challenging relationship with his father was very surprising to me as well, previously unknown to me, and I am sure many others too. A well rounded story that came across as one of the finest movies I have seen. If you have any old memories of Johnny Cash, this will create a spark in your noggin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two and a half hours of pure greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of movies and even a bigger fan of movies that deal with music. One of my favorites is Almost Famous which takes us on a mind-blowing adventure through the early sounds of hard rock in the seventies. But this movie is a great movie with infinite depth.Walk the Line starts off with a heartbreaking preface on Cash's life as a kid. We see him go through hardships including the war and making end's meat early in his career. The movie just simply drifts into something I cannot explain. I have never seen a movie that took me to such a place. It's the kind of movie that makes you realize how great film-making can be.Joaquin Phoenix plays Johnny Cash as if it were Johnny Cash himself. When I saw Phoenix on screen, I saw Johnny Cash. And it's rare for me to see actors get in depth with the people they are playing especially in biopics. But Walk the Line gives us three very powerful performances. One of the heart-wrenching performances is given by Ginnifer Goodwin who plays Johnny's battered first wife who isn't all in tune with Cash's musical life. Goodwin is definitely an underrated actress who will hopefully get her due here in years to come.Now I must give absolute praise to Reese Witherspoon who plays the refreshing performance of June Carter who would be a hard role to play but Witherspoon nails it dead on. Before WTL, I wasn't a big fan of Witherspoon because of the movies she made but this proved me wrong. She gives one of the greatest performances to ever embrace the screen. I have never seen a performance so pure and so golden that it shattered what I thought of her. Her presence on screen is rare in cinema. I cried when she got her Oscar because I was grateful of what she had accomplished and what she offered to the audience.Walk the Line goes down as one of my all-time favorite films. It's a refreshing breath of fresh air that I really needed. Phoenix should of got the Oscar and Goodwin should of been nominated. I love this movie! Great soundtrack, too! ****/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Cash would have been proud of the marvelous job Joaquin Phoenix did. He truly lived and acted the part of Johnny. His actions so reminded me of the way Johnny Cash acted. He used to throw the guitar over his shoulder and his facial expression were like many of what I remember. His singing was marvelous as I feel no one could have sounded any closer to Johnny than he did.Reese Witherspoon did a great job singing, also. The love story between the 2 was incredible. There was never a dull moment and you just wanted to watch to see what was going to happen next. Have watched the movie 4 times and now want to buy it. The movie showed many of the Johnny's life's struggles I remember growing up as a kid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance done right!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say, up there with Leaving Las Vegas, Annie Hall and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, this is one of my very most favorite romantic movies -- and it has the added uniqueness of having a happy ending.That said, the movie is still primarily about the rise and near-fall of Johnny Cash, and while very sympathetic to the man, by no means paints the portrait of a saint. In fact, that June Carter sticks with him through all that she does for as long as she does might have stretched my credulity had this not of course been based on true events. Here some more background on June might have served to flesh out the dynamics of the romance, but Reese Witherspoon does indeed do a superb job of selling June's character as the sympathetic mooring that keeps Cash from drifting to the point of no return; because of her performance, the story works. And while she would seem to have earned her Oscar for this role, I do find it a bit ironic that Joaquin Phoenix was passed over of the two of them, as he has more material to work with, and delivers without flaw, singing and all. (According to IMDb, the two actors were each blessed by their real life counterparts before their passing in 2003.) Another key role in the movie is also played very well by Shelby Lynne as Cash's first wife, Carrie. Although her character, like Witherspoon's, is more reactive than fleshed-out, she is convincing as a 50s woman finding herself unexpectedly surrendering bit by bit her dreams of the ideal mid-century American lifestyle to her husband's ambitions and eventual physical and emotional philandering until she is stretched to the breaking point when he brings a symbol of the latter into their home. Rounding out the key characters is Cash's father, Ray (Robert Patrick), against whose deeply-set disapproval Cash is constantly straining against.Along the way are gorgeous sets, stunning costumes, and plenty of some of the very best music Americana has ever had to offer. Ultimately, here is a film that is larger than life because it needs to be in order to accommodate its subjects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was having a few friends over the other day so I went up to my local Blockbuster to see what movies I should get. My mom suggested Walk the Line, so I grabbed it and everyone at the party was very enthusiastic and wanted to watch it. I knew it was rumored to be really good, I'd read a lot about it. I knew Reese had won the Oscar (I had been jockeying for Keira the whole time), so I was eager to see her performance. We started the movie and almost from the very opening shots of Folsom Prison I was enthralled and I never stopped being enthralled throughout the whole movie. Though it does get a bit repetitive in the middle, it's still very good. Joaquin Phoenix was excellent (though I must admit, Johnny Cash was before my time so I've never seen him perform), I thought he gave a great performance, especially with the handle he had on the music. Reese Witherspoon was amazing. Her singing shocked me more than anything, I'd seen her be bubbly and vivacious as well as serious before, so that was nothing knew. I was a little disappointed in the portrayal of Vivian. I have no idea how supportive or unsupportive she really was, but it was hard to empathize with her right from the get go. She seemed like a whiny, spoiled Daddy's Girl, though Ginnifer Goodwin did an amazing job. I had to watch the movie again because the first time I saw it I missed the crucial awards scene in which June is seated behind Johnny and Viv and Johnny insults her and then chases after her. Missing that made the scene in which June meets Johnny's parents and his girls who are with Viv all the more unplesant. All in all, this was an amazing movie. I think I want to buy it. The acting is top notch as well as everything else. I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess all Joaquin Phoenix needs is just more patience on his road to the Oscar, although we have to admit that the academy award is somehow just a game and an Oscar is not the only way to prove one's success. Reese does deserve the award! I like the June carter she acts as: independent, strong and genuine...I was really touched by the love between Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, but I did feel a little bit depression after finishing this movie: It is much more difficult to find your soul mate in your life! Besides, you will never know when he/she will appear. Johnny Cash had listened to June's songs for twenty years when they met in person for the first time as wife or husband of others. It had been almost another decade when they ended up their own marriage and got married!Time Wasted--I did flash on that song!!But how can we say it is Time Wasted? Will they cherish the precious thirty-five years if it is not that hard-won? Will the happiness and joy be that great if it is not after such a hard journey?

		<shortDescription>Perhaps not totally emotional, but well-driven by great performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps similar to "Ray," "Walk the Line" is a documentary on Johnny Cash, a country singer played by Joaquin Phoenix.After a brief clip of Johnny's childhood, the main story starts off when he comes out with his record "Cry, Cry, Cry." So, he goes on tour with June Carter, (Reese Witherspoon) trying to make himself a country singer. He meets his partner, June and they become friends. But, Johnny wants to become more than just that. He does have a wife, but they aren't too close. "Walk the Line" is a story about character development and heart.I believe the title "Walk the Line" either stands for one of Johnny's songs or walking the DUI line. (A test to make sure you aren't drunk.) If it's the second one, then it probably because Johnny gets drunk at one point. You see, Johnny had a rough life. His brother died, and his dad blamed it on Johnny. From there on, Johnny takes anger pills for those rough times. He also makes plenty of mistakes when trying to get June Carter to fall in love with him."Walk the Line" has a lot of country music. Reese Witherspoon is probably the best singer out of all of them, because of the neat tricks she can do with her voice. It also features plenty of Johnny Cash songs including "Rock n' Roll Groupie" and "Ring of Fire." Joaquin sings them with a deep voice and all his songs sound good. My favorite songs would have to be "Get Rhythm (When you get the Blues)" and "Time's a Wastin'". Of course, if you dislike country music, you probably shouldn't see it.I found "Walk the Line" to be a little short in the storyline department. It has plenty of music, but the music takes up time for a story. It's simple. There are no major twists or turns. But, "Walk the Line" is about character development; not story.That's where the drama comes from. It's about how characters change and feel. If the emotion came from the dialogue, it would probably fail emotionally. I thought more heart could have been put into the dialogue. But, with pretty deep characters and great performances, (Reese won an Oscar for giving enough sass to June, and for excellent vocals.) "Walk the Line" succeeds, even if there are few scenes of powerful emotion. I wouldn't call it amazing, as so many have, but it's powerful at various points in the movie.Overall, "Walk the Line" may be a little short, but it's entertaining and occasionally powerful.7/10 Good: Music and acting Bad: A bit lacking in substance and dialogueFeel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the movie is anywhere near accurate, it's no wonder Johnny turned to drugs and alcohol. His father did nothing but torment him his entire life, and his first wife Vivian was a first class bitch. The only person who ever saw him for himself, was June Carter. I really enjoyed the actor who played Jerry Lee Lewis. You can't help but like the guy, even if he is a jerk! And my favorite scene was Johnny at Folsom Prison. I won't tell you what happens, but he sure let them know he related with his audience. I really enjoyed this movie, and with what I already knew about the "Man In Black", this offers a personal glimpse into yet another famous person that leaves you with more respect and admiration than before. Walk The Line is worth seeing, and for me being a Cash fan, worth buying the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intricate mix of emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to watching this movie I knew little, bar a few of the songs, about Johnny Cash and June Carter. An obvious draw-card of this film is it's cast, namely Joaquin Phoneix and Resse Witherspoon who are both excellent in their roles. I experienced a lot of emotion during this film. In the beginning you feel for Johnny because of his father's bluntness towards him, next he is a man torn between his family and the pitfall's of life on the road. His use of drugs and alcohol cause him to spiral out of control and further alienate himself from those around him. It is through the presence of June Carter and her eventual expression of feelings towards Johnny that he manages to pull himself out, salvage his career and make the most of his life. This film addresses sympathy, hatred and hope, all tied up in the music that fueled the lives of Johnny and June.</fullReview>

Having grown up seeing John &amp; June on TV and somewhat familiar with their music (although not really big fans) were truly blown away with the performances of Joaquin Phoenix &amp; Reese Witherspoon. As many have written already, these performances seemed so real. They don't look or sound exactly like the originals but truly became them on film with such honest and respectful homage. Joaquin was Cash! Reese was awesome portraying June's devotion for John...the vocals were incredible. As many have also stated - the performances were totally believable &amp; have got us completely hooked on Johnny Cash's story &amp; music (we will be buying the soundtrack very soon!) we will continue to watch this one for many years to come!

		<fullReview>This movie, which covers the period of Cash's childhood in Arkansas up to his public engagement to June Carter in 1968, among other things provides a good presentation of early Rock and Roll/Rockabilly/Country and Western music and its performance: it therefore will be of interest to anyone who follows these genres. The film is marvelously directed and acted with great sets, sound, and period costumes, however, those who like me find the typical music star lifestyle of "groupie" sex, booze, drugs and bad behavior tiresome will probably find much of it tiresome. Cash fans may wonder why his famous song about his dressing only in black is omitted, even if his color choice is commented upon in a few lines of dialog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this film for 2 reasons. First off, I am a long time Joaquin Phoenix fan. I remember him when he had to fit his tiny little body into a huge space suit and save the day in Space Camp, and when he was a troubled pre-teen having to deal with a deadbeat dad in Parenthood. As an adult, he conquered Rome. And now, he's conquered again. I must confess, I know little about the real Mr. Cash, so I can't comment on his portrayal, but the performance was stellar as always. His emotional moments with June(Reese) were moving. And his reactions to his father's rejections and humiliations felt so natural---and that piercing stare over the Thanksgiving table was wonderfully intense. I would have loved to see him get best actor (still not a Clooney fan). Oh well.Secondly, okay, you caught me...THE HYPE--- I normally HATE, and I can't emphasize this enough, HATE hyped up movies...However, if it involves one of my favs, whelp...I'm guilty.As far as my thoughts on the movie in general...It was enjoyable. The supporting cast was talented and did well. Although, I didn't see anything special about Reese's performance. Yeah, it was good, but, come on, Oscar-worthy? I didn't find the movie boring as some on the site have said. It's a story about a man's life. Honestly, and I've said this before, I'm not sure what those people were expecting to happen. maybe they thought they were there to see Crash and got confused.In summary, I liked it. It's worth the time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wish Ray did not come out in 2004, before Walk the Line. Because Line unfortunately suffers greatly at the hands of that overly boring and overly flawed film, which basically had an amazing performance by Jamie Foxx, some great Ray Charles music, and not much else.Line, while essentially almost the exact same story as Ray, but without all of the racist elements, and using Johnny Cash, is a much better film, and has a much better story. In fact, everything about it is better, even down to Joaquin Phoenix besting Jamie Foxx's Oscar winning performance (but unfortunately not Phillip Seymour Hoffman's).The music is of course, great, and as said, so are the performances. Phoenix is fabulous as Cash, and undoubtedly, will probably never be any better. While not really shining at first, Witherspoon makes a terrific performance out of June Carter Cash, and was rightfully given her Oscar. They are heartfelt (as is the rest of the cast, even though Robert Patrick is underused), and even though the movie is a tad bit long and boring (what's with these musical biopics?), it makes up for it in all of the technical departments.The mythology of the Man in Black is very well presented, and is very interesting as it goes on. And while Ray asked us to feel sorry for the main character at every turn, you can't help but feel angry at the main character in Line. The emotional impact is stronger, and it helps drive the heart of the film.The film could have done with a good few minutes cut right out of the film, and it would have been all the better for it. And if they missed out on the Ray boat, it would have been nominated as Best Picture instead of Capote.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly enjoyed this movie. I thought it had a lot of heart and several tender moments. Joaquin Phoenix captured that sad eyed Johnny Cash look. And Reese Witherspoon was sassy and spunky as June Carter.Phoenix's singing was excellent. He sounded very much like Cash and he took on many mannerisms of the singer without looking like a comic imitation. Witherspoon has a very pleasant voice. And in some ways her voice is prettier than Carter's, although she captured the southern twang of the original very well.I felt the movie was not as tightly put together as "Ray" in that "Ray" tended to cover more ground, over all, in the life of Ray Charles. However, it must be considered that "Walk the Line" is dealing with, to a certain extent, the life of Carter as well as Cash's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk The Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I thought Joaquin Phoenix was exceptional. I have been a Johnny Cash fan for years and I wasn't real sure someone could capture his essence but I was wrong. I was so impressed with Mr. Phoenix's work I bought the movie and watch it regularly. Reese Witherspoon was also very good. I was disappointed that Mr. Phoenix didn't win the award for his performance he certainly earned it. All in all I think it was the best movie I have seen in a lot of years and I thank everyone who made it and all of the actors who were in it. It's not very often that you find a movie that captures you as this one did. I have always felt that the love story between Johnny and June was one of the sweetest and most destined of any I've known and Mr. Phoenix and Mrs. Witherspoon managed to capture that feeling between them and portray it for the audience. I was really impressed with the whole movie. I was amazed to learn that they both did their own vocals and played the instruments. It just goes to show you how talented these two actors are. Again I thank you. You gave me a wonderful couple of hours in a beautiful story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed this movie and i love Johnny Cash, but as i was watching it i could not help noticing a lot of similarities between "Walk the Line" and "Ray". The story was very similar, but that cannot be helped much considering they are based on true lives. I just felt that the formula was the same for each movie, and i also felt that Ray was in fact a much better movie because i had not seen anything like it before. I also think Ray had more texture to it, it got me more involved with the characters and had a draper meaning within it. It also made me feel for Ray Charles and his addiction to heroin, more so then Johnny Cash and his addictions to speed. What i guess I'm trying to say is that in my opinion "Walk the Line" is a poor mans "Ray".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent performance by Reese, but thought Joaquin stood out more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a very good movie in telling the heartbreaking and beautiful love story of these two great people. Although Reese did a very good June Carter,after all she did win the Oscar for her role. I thought Joaquin Phoenix was outstanding as Johnny Cash. He should have won the Oscar for it, as it was well-deserved. The competition was too heavy this year, but the kind of movie that is not soon forgotten. I have the deluxe edition on DVD, which is wonderful. My family also found it a great movie, and one of them never liked Johnny Cash before, but is a big fan of Joaquin Phoenix. There aren't enough words to describe this wonderful. wonderful movie. Being a great fan of Joaquin Phoenix I am looking forward to more performances from him, no matter what it may be. He has gained a lot of fans via this movie I'm sure. For anyone wanting to see a great movie and great performances watch, and better still, go out and buy it on DVD. Try it, you'll love it.

		<fullReview>The best movie I've seen regarding the musical scene (and by far). This movie tries to portray Johnny Cash as the great man he was and with excellent results. The "Man In Black" surely deserves this movie and surely will deserve much more attention from the international media then he as received until now. This is the story of a believer in god, but a individual believer who was open to other ideas and accepted them. Joaquim Cash portrays him in a very close approach to the person he as been and Reese Witherspoon doesn't stay behind on her role. A pity not have been nominated as best movie of the year, because in my opinion it was (though I would accept a victory from "Crash"). If you are a music lover, whatever may be the type of music you listen to... PLEASE DON'T MISS THIS ONE! and this was almost real (136 minutes could never show a man's life, but many messages from Cash are shown with wonderful results)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walk the Line covers the story of the late great Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. Johnny Cash is one of the greatest musicians in music history and this is a well done tribute to his work. Joquin Pheonix is Johnny Cash and is a very good one at that. Pheonix had learned how to play guitar for the role and he also supplies the very convincing singing voice for Cash. Reese Witherspoon is June Carter in an award worthy performance.Witherspoon provides the singing voice for June carter as well. This movie is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time. It has great music, great story, great editing, great directing and great performances from everyone in the movie. The movie shows how cash toured with June Carter, Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presly. The movie basically covers the story of Johnny and June and how they came to be and the Folsom Prison album. This movie needs to be seen by anyone who likes Cash and music in general. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was excellent. Highly recommend!!! This movie has the best actors and Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon deserve several awards for this movie. They couldn't have picked more perfect actors for those parts in the movie. I bought the movie and will hope to see them win awards for the spectacular acting and movie in general. IF you haven't seen the movie you are missing out on a great piece of work. I give this movie a perfect 10. And the soundtrack is sold out everywhere i go so I would give a standing ovation to Reese and Joaquin for the incredible vocals and acting in general. Two wonderful actors who just showed that they are worth more than just acting..they pulled off singing so perfectly..they sound identical to the original Johhny Cash and June Carter!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steak, But No Sizzle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've avoided the film Walk the Line for the longest time, because I was such a fan of the life and music of both Johnny Cash and June Carter. But finally, I broke down and recently viewed the biopic.Let me say, kudos to Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who were 100% point blank Johnny Cash and June Carter. Their Oscar nominations were well-deserved.But, there is something about the film, especially in light of last year's Ray Charles biopic, that I cannot pinpoint as wrong, and yet is rather bland, given those of us who know the lives of these exceptional country performers.The best analogy I can come up with is this: it's like going to an acquaintance's house, and they prepare you a steak dinner.It's steak and it's dinner, but it's not as good as you thought it would be.If I were a young person never knowing the back-story of Johnny and June's life and seen this film, I would say, "So what? What makes these two any more special than Tupak Shakur or the Notorious B.I.G.?" And I think therein lies the problem: we saw their troubles, but we weren't engaged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's do it; let's fall in love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, every year, before the Oscars take place, I try to watch or catch any film that has anything to do with them; specially the five nominated ones. Now it's Oscar week, and as I do all that, I found myself sitting down and watch "Walk the Line", which is not one of the Best Picture nominees, but a strong contender in other categories.Let's say that when you watch a film knowing it is nominated for something, you do it differently. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Whiterspoon are nominated for their roles as Johnny Cash and June Carter?I was not that much looking at them, but more like studying them; their chemistry, accents and impersonation, channel or imitation or however you want to call it (it is ultimately a performance anyhow).These two persons were truly in love?I fall short. These two persons were deeply; madly in love?I fall short. These two hearts were united?I could be getting close. What Phoenix and Whiterspoon do to bring that passion alive is amazing. Beginning with their chemistry?We all know the charismatic blonde can feel the chemistry with any other actor, in her romantic comedies. But this is drama, and it gives a whole new depth to the matter.If you watch "Election" or "Cruel Intentions" or "Pleasantville" you'll find a young, ambitious and talented actress. But this is a turn; "Walk the line" shows us the character actor in her; the dramatic power she owns. She and Phoenix go to the highest levels, take the highest risks?And succeed. Johnny Cash's was a life of depression, uncertainty and craziness; but there was always one light in his life: the fact of knowing who his woman was?And that was June Carter.Phoenix laughed when receiving the Best Comedy Actor Golden Globe: "Who would have pictured me winning something about comedy", he laughed. He wouldn't laugh at the Oscars if he won; he would be grateful but probably uninterested. That's the way he is, that's the way he played Johnny Cash and another bunch of characters. But Cash highlights, of course. Because of his persona, his life?His music and songs, which Phoenix (unlike Jamie Foxx last year) sang himself.Whiterspoon also sang the songs, got the accent and the personality of her character right. I don't know what she's planning to say, but I'm betting all on her favor for this Sunday, because I believe she'll win, because I saw it when she was singing "Jackson" alongside Phoenix, looking at him with love and desire, as Johnny and June must have looked at each other during their lives.And James Mangold made all the right calls. I knew he was good directing actors because he got the best out of Stallone and the best out of Winona Ryder in a movie she didn't (but should have) get nominated for. Now I know he made all the right calls with this movie because he could have directed a film about Cash and his ups and downs, but he directed a film about his and June's ups and downs, which is a lot better.He made the right calls because his film could have been one of those VH1 episodes about the life of a singer, but he made a strong and centered film with a defined objective. I understand this was a personal project for him, so, had he done it for VH1, he wouldn't have got the recognition he wanted and deserved. Phoenix and Whiterspoon's nominations are also Mangold's.He made the exactly right calls because he based, together with Gill Dennis, his screenplay on Cash's own writings. It goes through the music career, a very good scene of his first audition, his first concert, and of course his love life. Finally, he ended up delivering us a story that's so, but so extremely potent, that it sticks with you for a while: it's contagious.You've got to feel something when Johnny walks from a town to another, all wasted, just to see June. You've got to feel touched when Johnny tries to kiss June, and after she denies he says: "It just happened", and June looks at him, recounting everything he does and demanding he should take credit for something.You can't stay still when John is about to touch bottom, down in the trees, about to fall into the river and June's mother looks at her: "You go with him June", and she replies: "I don't want to go down there?". "Honey", her mother concludes: "You are already down there".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** out of **** I was really doubtful concerning my vote for Walk The Line. Should it be 9 or 10? Then I realized there was no reason at all for me to rate it with a 9. This is a perfect love story. There are moments you really feel bad about this movie, scenes which you wish shouldn't be as they are. But that's what's so good about it! You cheer for Johnny, even though it's bad that wrong steps are made throughout the path. But the title synchronizes perfectly with the ending.This movie is even greater when there is the fact that you may not have listened to Johnny Cash songs yet. I, myself, just listened to two songs: "Ring Of Fire" (I only listened to that one because of the movie trailer) and "The Wanderer", a song which Johnny recorded with U2 in the album Zooropa. My only regret for Johnny's songs is that somehow they look all the same. The rhythm is always the same! There was this song I found remarkable, written by June Carter, "Time's A Wasting". Perhaps the best song in the movie for me.This movie is a story. You listen to Johnny's songs in it, but it's a story. And you don't really have to KNOW Johnny Cash in order to appreciate this movie the right way. For last, Phoenix and Witherspoon performances are simply great! Both of them! I really hope they do win the Oscar! At least, just Reese! Also James Mangold is a gifted director. I watched Girl, Interrupted, and must say: both movies are great! Walk The Line far surpasses Girl, which I rated 9.Johnny's life story is really a story to tell in a movie! It's a shame it hasn't been nominated for best picture, but I haven't seen the nominees yet! Watch this movie with your heart! It's beautiful!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was very moving and emotional and that is what makes it great! I'll be honest I am not a Johnny Cash fan per-say but I like him as a person and absolutely adore some of his songs. I think it did a wonderful portrayal and idea of what he was going through, but it did not cover all the bases, but how can it cover a life of a legend in two hours! The actors are fantastic in singing. There were parts where it gave me goosebumps and flashbacks of the past keep arising from Johnny's near death experiences and June to be there all the way. In the previews they did give the best lines away, which is a tragedy. I like that they put the movie in a story like direction. Absolutely fabulous - I just had a hard time wondering who the artists were being depicted throughout film and why were fellow singers calling him JR? -Sarah S Minnesota</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AWESOME! I grew up on country music and knew quite a bit about both Johnny Cash and June/ The Carter Family...I wasn't sure I wanted to see this movie since I know how Hollywood tends to treat country music... boy! am I glad I went with my husband that day! It was surprising/familiar, very touching and very tastefully done, from the young wife/mother ( Gennifer Goodwin) facing time at home alone with her young family, to the drug dependency, to the way June was so hesitant to become involved with him, to the way the Carter family rallied around John as "mixed up".... It was just awesome! And hilarious! And sensuous! And harsh! .... The constant thread of June in the background (from 12 year old boy onward) shows how she just was his true love all of his life... The music just floored me! I could tell the differences in the voices but the attitude and presence of both John and June was just dead on....Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are now my favorite actor and actress, simply for the fact that they cared so much for these characters (people) they were playing it shows! I never have been a huge Johnny Cash fan... I was more into the type of music played by the Carter family but I definitely enjoyed the whole experience....I am very impressed how genuine and believable the whole storyline is... nothing over-the-top or ridiculous...just very real and very very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk the Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't really a Cash fan, and I haven't listened to his music much at all. I was asked to come to this movie with a friend about a week after it came out. It was one of the best movies I have watched in a long time. About a week later I went to see it again and saw things that I missed the first time. The collectors addition came out yesterday and I bought it. The movie was still playing this weekend. I have never seen a movie run so long before. Even if you are not a country music fan, or a fan of Johnny Cash I think you should give this movie a chance and rent it or buy it. I grew up close to where some of the movie was filmed and I was telling my mom about it. She lived in Caraway and near Dyess Colony during the same time Johnny Cash did. She met him as a child, she died before the movie came out onto to video so she never got a chance to see it. I think she would have liked it as much as I do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story about real people leading extraordinary lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Walk the Line" is a tender story about two real people who lead extraordinary lives. Joaquin and Reese both give heart wrenching performances as they portray the legendary Johnny and June Carter Cash but it is story that makes it the most memorable.Reese's Oscar nomination is one that is well deserved the amazing thing about her performance is that she shined without glamour and without upstaging Joaquin. She brought great strength to the woman of courage who was always in the shadow of both her family and of Johnny's career. The rock of which he stood. It was quite refreshing.The chemistry between Witherspoon and Phoenix is wonderful and I whole heartedly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see it, a Johnny Cash fan or not. And if you aren't a Johnny Cash fan, I recommend picking up a CD you won't regret it.The one problem I did have with the movie was the lack of the mariachi band on Walk the Line.

He was the original alternative music star and walk the line chronicles how he made his own path in the world of rock and roll that was snowballing at the time.Johnny cash's story also provides interesting counterpoint to that of Elvis Presley. It really made me think what would have happened if Elvis had had a June Carter of his own would his tragedy have been averted.Walk the line is a poignant and uplifting story of overcoming your demons to reach the pinnacles of your goals and i would recommend it to anyone who has ever thought about quitting anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, its a good thing I don't think too much, otherwise I wouldn't have rented this movie. A 2.5 hour movie with Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon singing songs I don't know written by a guy I barely heard about? But I just saw it was out on DVD and wanted to see what all the fuss is about - and now I know its a fuss-worthy movie. Apart from being a tad to long, the movie is heartwarming (in a weird way) and most of all, shows you what a great cast of actors can do. Just to watch these two loving and hurting (and singing! Wow!) makes this whole experience worth your while, which is pretty impressive I must say. The same story with two different actors might have been turned off mid way, but these guys just remind you that acting is more than posing on the red carpet and being caught smooching on the beach. Its an art, and Witherspoon and Pheonix are two damn fine artists. If they made me sit still the whole time and then rush to my computer to download some songs - then sorry Hoffman and Huffman, my Oscar goes to Johnny and June.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Biopic of Start of Majestic Career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Mangold has displayed a great range of movies: from the indie Heavy (with Liv Tyler's best performance), the top heavy Cop Land (where Sly Stallone shines), the powerful drama Girl, Interrupted (with a magnificent Winona Ryder), the light but still very enjoyable rom-com Kate &amp; Leopold, the multi-layered whodunnit Identity (with the always quality John Cusack and Jim's signature actor Pruitt Taylor Vince (one of the best actors of his generation!) now there is the long awaited cinematic biography of Johnny Cash.Mangold could have gone the easy way and portray the settled-down and familial and grand person Cash became in the 90s and 00s (after struggling through his addictions and troubles). But instead he chose to show the hardships Johnny Cash had to endure as a child and how he became a recording and performing artist, while trying to grow up and keep in touch with reality.Some will say that Cash now comes off as a cheating and pill-popping maniac who has little empathy for his wife and that may all be true, but fighting his inner demons with June Carter at his side is exactly how he in the end became the icon that is JR Cash.Joaquin Phoenix is the embodiment of Cash, even though he doesn't look or sound like him, but that only shows his acting performance.Reese Witherspoon does an outstanding performance as well, maybe it gets enhanced if you offset this against her Legally Blonde-type characters.Kudos to both of them for performing (singing and playing), because this could have gone horribly wrong if Mangold decided to go with Joaquin and Reese lipsynching to Johnny and June's voices.The supporting cast is great as well as is the selection of songs.The story and tension arc is solid as a house and the 2 hours and 16 minutes fly by. All in all this is one of the best, most honest biopics I have ever seen.Go see this, even if you don't like country ... and I don't even think Cash is country, he is real rock 'n roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man in Black meets his toughest match</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this great film, and I thought it was a moving work of inspiration. Joaquin Phoenix plays a tough role as the "hard as nails" legendary persona, John R. Cash. As a great fan of country/western music, I love the spirited scenes of laughter and song. What is so heartbreaking and terrible, is that sense of abandonment and loneliness I felt John had hidden within his own heart. As surmised in the film,Cash has a father who left him and his brother without a role model, or any male guidance in Life.I thought that the disappointment his father felt for him cut him deep, and hurt. It is heart wrenching and moving,seeing this mature man pitifully beg like a child for his daddy's affection and approval.I also felt that the death of his brother Jack took away that sense of comfort, and shared "bonding" John felt as a child.Reese Witherspoon is memorable, as solid rock June Carter. Carter is the wall of strength and courage John needs in facing the "haunting" demons of his past. In the overview of the film, it is her songwriting talent that brings them fame and wealth.We see how tenderly June loves him, but also how she never backs away from his bearish behavior and wild ways.It is her critical quote, "you'll never walk that line", that becomes the main focal point of this biography.I recommend this film, and think it is a lesson of how great Love works in a Family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected a movie of finest quality when I sat down to see this and I'm glad to say it exceeded my expectations! Based on real life legend Johnny Cash, Walk The Line tells the story of his turbulent life of drugs, love and music.This is a well written film. Based on a couple of books and the real life of Johnny Cash it has a pretty dramatic and strong story to tell and it succeeds in telling this story really well. The characters are strong and you get to know them, love them and hate them. It's believable and touches you.Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash is a truly great fit. His performance is nothing less than wonderful. He is believable and he got the likeness to portray Johnny Cash in every way. Reese Witherspoon also delivers a rock solid performance as June Carter. As for the rest of the cast they're also very good. Most notably is Ginnifer Goodwin and Robert Patrick as Vivian Cash and Ray Cash. They do a fine job as supporting actors.When it comes to the technical there is also nice things to say. The cinematography is good looking and the lightning is really nice. It is a really good looking film. It spans a cross several decades and they do a good job in keeping everything is style. Hair, costumes and sets, all goes to the decade.As for the music, you'll get to hear a lot of Johnny Cash. No surprise there. However, they also make use of others like Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis. They make good use of the music and when the real music ends a good soundtrack by T-Bone Burnett kicks in.Walk The Line is without a doubt a movie worthy of Johnny Cash. It's all in all a rock solid film that I truly recommend. Whether you like the Man in Black or not, whether you grew up with his music or not, I recommend this movie because in the end this is a story about people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At this point in time I'm sure you've heard all you need to know about Walk The Line and don't even need to see yet another review from an English guy with a film studies degree on the Internet to make up your mind about whether to see it or not. I'm sure you know all about how stars Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Whitherspoon sing all the tracks themselves, how the story builds up a stark portrayal of the Man In Black's back story and the emotional turbulence that led to the creation of such classic songs, but the simple fact of the matter is this; all the hype is richly, justly deserved.But then Johnny Cash's life story was always perfect fodder for the biopic hungry crowd. He grew up in a poor rural area of America and blames himself for a childhood tragedy, carrying the self-loathing and rage tightly wound within the depths of his being for the rest of his life. He is at first rejected by studios who don't want to hear more gospel music and so sets out to craft his own sound, but as his success increases his first marriage deteriorates in a spiral of infidelities and drug abuse. He finds himself at death's door and on the verge of his entire life collapsing, turns things around in startling fashion tailor made for an uplifting, life affirming climax.So far, so very Ray with an acoustic guitar and better eyesight, but then Ray was such an incredible film in the first place, it's all too easy to just sit back and get lost in the saga until you realise you've been sat in the cinema for the last two hours with the same expression on your face staring open mouthed at the screen. And you can put that down to the magnetism of the stars.Joaquin Phoenix for starters is a revelation. He doesn't so much play Johnny Cash as wear him like a glove and commands the screen with a power that fixes your attention from the offset. Just watch the moments where he sings an impromptu version of Fulsom Prison Blues after the label agent ridicules his gospel songs, the combination of his whiskey-soaked voice and those sad, yearning eyes creating a truly dramatic turn, quite an accomplishment when all it really is is a man singing and playing guitar in a cramped recording studio. The occasional moments of awkward nervousness that impeded his role as Emperor Commodus in Gladiator are gone and in their place is a man who has ascended from a position as a movie star and can now stand toe to toe with the greatest thesps in cinema history.But good as Phoenix is, even he is outdone by co-star Reese Whitherspoon as his love interest June Carter. Unlike Phoenix, Whitherspoon did not have the aid of her real-life counterpart for inspiration, but nevertheless she encapsulates the character so fully you can't help but wonder if the girl who made the Legally Blonde movies wasn't a different person altogether. As June, she plays the sweet, wild west gal stage persona alongside the backstage position as the confident, strong woman that tamed Johnny Cash and does so with a great deal of conviction. Phoenix is almost guaranteed the Best Actor Oscar but with a performance like this, it's hard not to see the Best Actress statue going to this movie either.The end result is a film that is very frank in it's honesty. Cash does not get smothered in adulation, but is instead shown as a very human character behind the songs that gave him fame. With his recent passing, Walk The Line is an excellent tribute, showing us the troubled man without flinching and focusing on the truth of his life, just as his songs did when they were first crafted by a tired old man with nothing but a cigarette, a guitar and a head full of demons to draw from.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great film. What makes it is Jaoquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon's performances. Wow, absolutely amazing. They really put their hearts and souls into the roles, without them it could not have worked. Joaquin Phoenix in particular. He delved into the character so deeply. As a story, a dynamic first half. It falls into a slump midway and picks up toward the end. Excellent period detail. The direction was fine. Great music.Again, amazing performances from Jaoquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. They certainly deserved their Oscar nominations. And since this site ridiculously requires a certain amount of lines I will ramble on. A film can easily be summed up in three lines. It is called basic and to the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am touched. I am moved. It is all the more amazing that the two leads actually sang and played their parts without being dubbed. The chemistry between them is spot-on. I cannot fault this film.It has tragedy, it has comedy, it has love both true and false, it has fatherly reconciliation, it has success and failure. Oh, and it has Elvis.SPOILER: well, not really a spoiler because the story is known but the penultimate scene where Johnny halts a performance so he can ask June to marry him while they're singing on stage is probably the most romantic, the most warming and moving scene I've ever watched in a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film redeemed by a great story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Johnny Cash and June Carter. That would have been a more fitting title and sounds like something you'd watch on the Hallmark channel or something like that. The story of Johnny Cash is a great and interesting one that anybody with any interest, I'm sure, has heard many times. The problem with this film is that it's just being told again. The acting is brilliant, possibly Reese Witherspoons best performance ever and she deserves to get the Oscar. The scripts is, like Johnny's music "slow like a steam train and sharp like a knife". It's these two factors that make the film so good. There was so much possibility to make this a classic but instead it won't be remembered in 20 years time. There is a great energy on screen during the opening scene and the main scene at Folsom Prison. Some of the other concert scenes, particularly when he's in a bad way, are shot really well. Bringing to mind album covers and photographs of the man in black. I think what's happened here is we have the director making the mistake of focusing on the actors and not spending enough time directing the crew. This I find strange when you think of films like Girl Interrupted, an immensely atmospherics film throughout and Identity which, in my opinion, suffers on the acting front, is made good by the production and the story.Having had my little rant I must stress that I still rated it 8 out of 10. The film is very good and I would recommend it. I don't think you'll lose out by waiting for the DVD but if your reading this and the year is 2026 or later, I've a good feeling you'll think this is very average. Hopefully by then we'll have a Darren Aronovsky version of the life of Johnny Cash that will be darker and more mysterious.</fullReview>

Johnny Cash went through a tough time with drugs ,marriage and alcoholism.But,when he married June C. Cash he turned his life around. June, is truly a great person inside and out and even though I didn't meet her I would of loved too.

		<fullReview>basically this film is about the life of johnny cash. it starts as him as a boy and then travels over his life but mainly focuses on his time travelling on the Sun Records tour with other known artists like Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins. it then continues to deal with the problems he faced on the road and the issues he had to deal with off it.i loved this film. i thought the leads were played really well by both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. although Reese accent in it made me laugh a couple of times. i loved the songs and i loved the way they went with the films timing. in short i just thought it was an amazing film and i haven't stopped recommending it to people since i saw it! my friend who went to see it with me had never heard any Johnny Cash songs but really enjoyed it. she saw it as just a film rather then a biopic. plus i don't think the fact that the lead is played by the very handsome Joaquin Phoenix did any harm in it either. it was really nice to see him play a "manly" role as the only other thing that I've seen him in is Gladiator and he plays the character Commodus who's a bit wimpy.</fullReview>

I only wish I was a little older so I could have enjoyed Johnny when he was in his prime. My admirations also go out to Reese Witherspoon who I thought played a fantastic part and the chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon was one of the best I have seen between leading actors for years.

		<shortDescription>Bellissimo :-)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, excuse my baby-English. I really need to talk about this film in order to stop thinking of it.I'm Italian, never been in the USA and know American culture by films and TV shows reaching us here (almost 80% of cinema products however, I guess...) Heard some country music on the frequencies of the American air base at Aviano. No idea of who Johnny Cash and June Carter were, even if this may shock some readers here :-D So I had basically no idea of what to expect from this film, and rather the Italian title ("Quando l'amore brucia l'anima", when love burns your soul) made me think more of an operetta drama. Thinking of the distortion of translation, adaptation, and dubbing...Instead! The script and photography are excellent. The first part is, at the same time, the strongest and the weakest, very slow but focusing on the dynamic of a dysfunctional family and the disturbing role not only of Cash's father, who destroyed his self-esteem, but also of the mother who apparently wasn't able to stop this torture. The relationship Johnny Cash had with his parents and wife is very credible and their reactions understandable. Vivian Cash is not the "evil, selfish, un-understanding wife" one could expect from this kind of films (Ginnifer Goodwin, gosh, is she so young?). The second part goes faster and means to solve the cruxes created in the first one. The film shows Johnny Cash basically needed love and respect, and luckily he found it in June-angel, for whom he was able to catch a second chance to become a better person. I guess all the episodes have been fictionalized, but I'll retain in my mind the scene of the Thanksgiving lunch: Cash's hallucinated gaze at his father, Maybelle Carter urging her daughter to save him from his self-destruction drive, and above all, Ezra Carter chasing the pusher with a gun! Hilarious! And moving. I wonder if the "true story" is respected, but still I retained admiration for two exceptional people (the Carters) who went beyond puritan hypocrisy, represented by Ray Cash and other characters along the film, accepted their daughter could fall in love for the third time (in the 50's!) and clearly understood the pain John Cash had gone through. Joaquin Phoenix impressed me a lot in "The Gladiator" and "To Die For" (Il gladiatore, Da morire). I am also a fan of the sweetest Reese Witherspoon. And they really didn't disappoint me. The way they act their falling in love with each other, hesitations and pain is touching. Really. I'm extremely curious to watch the original version. And finally to listen to original John Cash's music. As to the soundtrack: I can imagine Americans can share much more in watching this film, because of the collective history linked to every song, but anyway, I can add that while hearing Phoenix singing I actually had goose-flesh, especially for the very first song, "Cry cry cry". It was also such fun for me to discover Elvis Presley, Jarry Lee Curtis and John Cash all together and... doing drugs together in tour! The very last scene, with the empty can serving as a telephone, is a nice link to Ray Cash's words at the beginning, "radio is nothing, music is nothing". It is just... communication.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How 'The Man in Black' learned to 'Walk the Line'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While most of us have heard of Johnny Cash, I'm sure only the true aficionados are aware of the background to the 'Man in Black'. I came to 'Walk The Line' in the former category; like those Amazonian tribes who have no radio etc but still know Johnny Cash.James Mangold's film charts Cash's life from a tough Arkansas upbringing to his career defining Folsom prison concert in 1968. A story that could have been clichéd and sentimental is stronger thanks to an understated script and strong performances. There are no earth shattering epiphanies for example which signpost his recovery from personal and musical abyss. Credit to Mangold for underplaying such moments like when Cash reads his fan mail from convicts and understands what he means to his fellow tortured souls.The performances also bring this story to life. It's well documented that Joaquin Phoenix as Cash and Reece Witherspoon as already established country star, June Carter, stuck their necks out and performed live for the concert footage. The film is all the better for their courage even though most of the time I felt Phoenix did'not quite reach Cash's distinctive growl. Physically as well, only on occasions did I believe Phoenix as 'The Man in Black; with his own dark broodiness you never forget you're watching Joaqin Phoenix. While those gripes may seem crucial for portraying such an iconic singer,Phoenix is still very commanding as this troubled soul. I have to own up and say I was not that familiar with June Carter but Reece Witherspoon ignites the film with both her sassy, warm hearted 'Country Gal' on stage and her own chaotic private life. Robert Patrick also excels as Cash's father Ray who is another source of torment for Johnny especially where both grieve for Johnny's brother Jack, tragically killed at a young age. Both Cash and Cash Sr carry the burden that "God took the wrong son".We can't forget the music of course and Cash's window on life comes through after some sage advice from Sun Records' Sam Phillips. Cash's connection with the audience also really comes to the fore at the Folsom Prison show which bookends the movie.I'm always sceptical about saying movie of the year or how many awards a film should receive as how can we really compare these matters. I just ask myself if I'm thinking about a movie a day or so afterwards then it's hit some mark. While not a bullseye,'Walk The Line' certainly hits Johnny Cash's 'Ring of Fire'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW!! What a film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm 22 so didn't really know too much about Johnny Cash except some of his music but this film left me wanting to know more. I've seen all the big films this year, king kong, brokeback mountain, munich but this film I felt pipped Brokeback as my favourite film in a long time, I did want Ledger to get best actor at the Oscars but I think Pheonix may just pip it for me. Witherspoone also proves she can do A LOT more than just Rom-coms she was brilliant! The film is brilliantly shot (how its not up for best picture i don't know!). The acting from the lead roles right to the lesser roles is brilliant and consistent. Pheonix is unbelievable on the guitar and has got Cash's voice as near as anyone could so deserves a massive amount of credit for that! Walk the Line kept me fixed from the 1st minute to the last and had me totally engrossed with some brilliant scenes with Pheonix and Witherspoone (serious chemistry). This may sound a bit far fetched but Pheonix goes up there with some of the best ever performances for this one, Crowe, Hanks I have always admired but I now look at Pheonix as a superb actor now rather than just a very very good one.Walk the line blends humour &amp; emotion brilliantly and neither overspill to become too much. I don't know how much of the film has been exaggerated or dulled but to me it doesn't matter at all. I may have been too young to remember Nash as a person but this film gives an exceptional account of what it may have been like for him and his future wife June. The film is neigh on perfect and although I can see some people my age and younger not relating to it so well, I think any fans of Cash or interested in autobiographies will love this gem. Deserves every bit of praise it gets! 10/10</fullReview>

Witherspoon can now command the respect to match her box-office earnings with the performance of her career. The script is fresh but very much grounded in reality - the harsh, jagged, glorious reality of Cash and Carter's life stories. And, best of all, the music is powerfully, invigoratingly performed by the co-leads. Even the background and incidental music is a feast for the ears. If it doesn't get your heart a-pumping, it'll get your toes a-tapping. Form a line immediately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film about Johnny Cash the legend? Definitely on my cinema books. A great film destined for Oscar glory? Well that's what i watch from December to early March. But a film where the music of legends is done by the actors? Oh, a line is put right there, and that conveniently and coincidentally lets me say that this film definitely Walks the Line, heck it even somersaults, moonwalks and air guitar riffs Under The Bridge by the Red Hot Chili Peppers on it, but it also feels Holywooded! Less talk about the pill-popping, more time attempting an emotional level which for me has only been reached by true masters of films, like Man on the Moon, a definite tear-jerker, Futurama's episode called Jurassic Bark, i almost cried! But yet through what felt like an hour and a half but i am told was two hours twenty i connected to these characters, by which i mean Johnny Cash and June Carter, not one iota! It's a shame that what could have been the single greatest film of the year seems less than some of the trailers, mainly Syriana and Good Night and Good Luck, and even the film i saw before it, the excellently underrated classic, Aeon Flux, of which is shamed to no definitely of no chance of a sequel. Walk the Line has some great moments and some really amazing musical talent from Joakuin Phoenix and the sassy southern style Reece Witherspoon used, but nothing really attaches you to a second viewing on the big screen, i'm so fed up, i'll have to wait till next week now for the next chance of a good film, the 5-stared big film Capote!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Ray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read about what other people wrote, but I must say that Walk the Line is in many ways similar to Ray. It's about a little-known musician turning into a big star; it's about a star's slow sink into drugs; it's about a star who's haunted by his past - the death of his brother... I understand that both Ray Charles and Johnny Cash were real. However, when the image of Ray has yet faded from my mind, an extra shot of Johnny Cash just inevitably leads me to make comparisons between the two. It's not that Walk the Line is not good. It's very well done, especially in terms of the performances delivered by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. Yet, the film just happens to suffer from a timing problem, making it a less attractive picture for me this year. But again, it's a very good movie and you should see it - just make sure that you don't see both Ray and Walk the Line within a short period of time and spoil the fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great acting overcomes standard storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because it is based on two of his own published memoirs ("Cash: the Autobiography" and "The Man in Black"), "Walk the Line" becomes, in many ways, the "official" movie biography of musician/singer/songwriter Johnny Cash - and it isn't really the movie's fault that it arrives so close on the heels of "Ray," the equally critically acclaimed film about Ray Charles. The similarities between the two stories are, at times, positively amazing: the meteoric rise to stardom, the unhappy marriage, the serial philandering, the substance abuse, the arrest for drug possession. Heck, there's even the death of a beloved brother in a freak childhood accident that comes to haunt both the men for the rest of their lives. Yet, "Walk the Line, " written by Gill Dennis and James Mangold and directed by Mangold, triumphs over its biopic clichés thanks to solid writing, toe-tapping musical numbers and superb performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon in the key roles of Cash and singing superstar - and future wife - June Carter.Phoenix pours his whole heart and soul into his performance both as an actor and as a singer, reproducing Cash's sound and vocal intonations with uncanny accuracy. Witherspoon captures Carter's sizzle and spunk perfectly, yet brings a real sensitivity and thoughtfulness to the character. Their romantic scenes together are some of the best in the film and it is as a romance, rather than as a cautionary tale of the perils of show business, that the movie really connects with its audience.We've seen a lot of this stuff before, but all credit to the actors, we don't mind watching it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a life-long fan of Johnny Cash I had to see this movie no matter what, so the day it premiered in B.A. there I was sitting in the theater trying, for the sake of neutrality, not to think of the Golden Globe Awards. I came out dancing and 5 days later went to see it again! After seeing every nominated movie except "Transamerica", this was the most rewarding and exhilarating experience of the season! James Mangold of such diverse gems as "Copland" and "Girl, Interrupted" has given us his masterpiece: a beautifully shot movie (there must have been something special about the camera or the lenses ? the feel of the period is so special!), based on a tight script that takes you up and away from the first minute and never lets up. The way he takes us through Mr. Cash's childhood and the trauma that caused the never-healing scar is so delicate, so unobtrusive, so without melodrama, it could not have been done more sparingly. All the more we are reminded throughout the film of the consequences of it. That Mr. Mangold did not milk the drama for all its worth, makes all the difference. Mr. Mangold shows us how less can be so much more. How a film can be unabashedly romantic without ever getting corny. How restricting the story to the two conflicts, the brother trauma and the family life versus show business, and building it around the love story (with the music thrown in for good measure in a totally unglamorous way!) makes for the best movie in a long time!! It is maybe unfair to make comparisons with last year's "Ray", but in my opinion WTL wins because the script is better. There are of course the wonderful flawless performances by both leads. Amazing to watch the transformation of the gawkish and shy young man into a seasoned performer. But I never expected less from Joaquin Phoenix since I saw him in To Die For and Quills! The big surprise turned out to be Reese Witherspoon who shows a wider range of acting chops than she had the chance to show so far. And above all: Hats off to both of them for taking the risk to do the singing themselves, given the fact that the real life person was an all-American legend who passed away only 2 and a half years ago. What a daring thing to do ? what a wonderful result! What a homage to Johnny Cash!! I have been a fan for a lifetime, but I am going to buy the soundtrack without feeling like an iconoclast. Some of my friends, serious R&amp;B and Rock musicians, maintain that Mr. Phoenix' singing is better than Johnny Cash's?.. Let's not forget a crucial figure in the story: the chilling portrait of Ray Cash by Robert Patrick, the irascible father who blames his younger son for the death of his favorite one ("Where have you been?" ? "God took the wrong son?!"). He needs only a few appearances to make us feel the full weight of the trauma on Johnny Cash's life. In the end, for him, too, there is redemption through the love of his grandchildren?. There is only one small flaw, and my finger points at the production team: in a guitar store in 1952 post-war Germany no German "Volksmusik" would have sounded from the speakers. At that time all things American were adored and revered, and most certainly its music which had been banned in Nazi times. Probably some Big band or country music would have been on, coming from the AFN Radio station, precisely the place where Mr. Cash works while in service in Germany?. I hope the film takes the Oscar for Best Film at the Academy Awards on March 5!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie certainly Walks the Line!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I entered the theatre, I sat in my seat and snored through the boring trailers. I almost walked out the cinema due to my immense annoyance at the trailers and adverts. However, when Walk the Line began, from the very second, I could sense what I was about to watch was going to rock my world. The style, the class and the storytelling is so articulate and magnificent. The directing is totally unique to that of the stereotypical biopic. As for the actors- Joaquin Phoenix growls his way to perfection as the uninhabited Johnny Cash. He perfects the voice to the stage actions to the private incidents with dignity and prowess. I really believed him when he sang the timeless songs. Who can forget Reese Witherspoon's performance? The Oscar for Best Actress is deservedly hers. June Carter was sensitive, amusing and caring. Reese's portrayal was honest and real to me. I truly felt as though these two young actors were in the shoes of both performers. The vocal coaching by T Bone Burnett really paid off- their voices were perfect. Walk the Line isn't over-hyped- the hype is justified. The Oscar nominations are not in vain. But I have one niggle- WHY oh WHY is the movie not nominated for Best Picture? If only it was, it would be the cherry on top of the tastiest cake in recent years. Brilliant, show-stopping! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I've been a Cashfan since 1966, and have practically all his available output on records, I was anticipating this film with excitement and expectation. I certainly wasn't disappointed. The movie is simply great. It even surpassed what I had hoped for. Brilliant! One of the best films in recent years, not only as a Cash documentary, but it is also one of the best films I've seen over all. Wonderful music clips, awesome acting throughout. You name it ! You really don't even have to like Johnny Cash to admire the final result. The film breathes quality. Do not miss it !Regards Mr Olle Hedstroem Sweden</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can hardly be called a country music fan and that's why I was at two minds about whether I should go and see this movie or whether I shouldn't. I expected some kind of a rather cheesy musical and the usual hollywoodish plot of a singer who starts out as a lowlife, finally makes a record and becomes a celebrity but gets addicted to drugs and alcohol only to get over this troublesome period of his life in the end. And although Walk the line has all these usual ingredients and, as a biopic, resembles the recent RAY, I was positively surprised when I saw this movie. I thought that Phoenix and Witherspoon did a great job on this and I still can't believe they sang those songs by themselves. The key to the surprising success is, according to me, the atmosphere of the movie. Phoenix is Johnny Cash, Witherspoon is June Carter. From the first second of the movie I was able to forget the performances of Phoenix and Witherspoon in their earlier films (such as Legally Blonde or Signs). The best Cash song so far is HURT. So there you go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Walk the Line' is one of the best movies I've ever seen!!Joaquin Phoenix (in particular) and Reese Witherspoon show extraordinary acting-talent portraying country legend Johnny Cash and love of his life June Carter. I was completely in awe through out the entire movie and didn't find even one little second tiresome or drawn out. The only little thing I will hold against this film is my disappointment (as a huge fan) with the character they've chosen to portray Elvis Presley... I see no resemblance at all!! But then again, this movie isn't about Elvis but Johnny Cash so it's only a minor flaw.'Walk the Line' is definitely a MUST SEE!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid biopic elevated by heavyweight performances and slick direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walk The Line doesn't quite reveal the full Johnny Cash story, and may have all the predictability of standard biopics that we've all seen before, but is executed with such skillful relish and expert performances that I really didn't care if I saw it coming. Like any good album it has you moving to the beat and miming the words. The film documents Cash's early life. As a child Cash witnessed the death of his older brother, which his dad always held against him. After leaving home, he then sets out to be discovered, despite having a band of mechanics who can't play for squat. Eventually he is discovered, and then goes on tour with the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presly - and this is where he finds June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), whose relationship with Cash provides us with the heart of the film.Johnny Cash loved Joaquin Phoenix ever since he saw him in Ridley Scott's Gladiator. So did I. Like his late brother River, he has this raw intensity that just grabs you in. He was certainly the finest thing in Oliver Stone's putrid yet compelling U-Turn, and stood toe-to-toe with Mel Gibson in Signs. This is definitely his finest hour. He walks, talks, moves and even sings like the "man in black". He is a tower of screen presence. And the most remarkable thing is Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash is even better. She is a fizzy mix of southern charm and sass, making June as likable as she is fierce. Phoenix is dead on but never astonishing. I still think Heath Ledger is the most deserving of the big Oscar gong, but Reese Witherspoon deserves all the awards she gets. When the film threatens not to work, their performances ensure that any liberties Mangold takes he gets away with easily.No it isn't a deep insight into Cash's tormented soul. It is well documented that his problems existed with him deep into later life. But this is a fantasy vision of his love for June. It's not, and never aspires to be, a documentary of his life. Joaquin Phoenix is great, Reese Witherspoon is amazing and James Mangold has regained the form he showed with the likes of Copland. Sure it's flawed, but I loved the characters enough that I forgot how easy it is to assume that it'll pan out the way it does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Mangold's warts-and-all biopic of Johnny Cash's early years, essentially up to the Folsam Prison concert, is no better and no worse than most movies of its kind. Mangold films it in a literal, conventional style, (it lacks the imagination and vision that Kevin Spacey displays in "Beyond the Sea"), but interestingly makes the high points revolve principally around the music. If the banality of Cash's first marriage, his drug taking and life on the road ever threaten to drag the film down there are always those songs, which to fans may seem like second nature. And at the heart of the film are two wonderful performances.Joaquin Phoenix is magnificent as Cash, totally inhabiting the role, wearing his mantle like a second skin. And Reese Witherspoon is his equal as June Carter, trying to disguise a well of emotion with a wise-crack and a mile-wide smile. Both players do their own singing which is fine by me, giving their performances added depth. While not detracting from Jamie Foxx's ability to lip-sync as Ray Charles in last year's "Ray", I always felt it reduced his performance to that of a consummate mime artist. There are no such problems with Phoenix and Witherspoon's remarkably lived-in performances. While neither player is in the Cash/Carter league they certainly don't disgrace themselves and, at best, make you want to rush home and listen to the originals.It's also remarkably free of sentimentality. If the heart-strings are ultimately tugged at Cash's on-stage marriage proposal it has more to do with their superb rendition of "Jackson" than with the proposal itself. And if it sounds cheesy, let me assure you it isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful! Deeply inspirational, thrilling love story. And, I was not a Johnny Cash fan, either!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen 'Walk the Line', and was very surprised. I expected a bio-pic, interesting, perhaps, but no big thing. What I saw was astounding. And I must point out that I have never been a particular Johnny Cash fan, either. So my total admiration for this movie comes from the movie itself, and not from any satisfaction at seeing the life of a personal hero. In fact, it was the reverse: my general distaste for Cash was an obstacle to overcome. And overcome it the movie really did. I am still not a fan of the music, particularly, but am now a fan and admirer of the people--- Johnny Cash and June Carter.First, Joaqin Phoenix was brilliant as Cash. I 'bought' his portrayal at all times. Whether he looks exactly like Cash or not is irrelevant, although he looked like him to me. His vibe and spirit were spot on. The fact that Phoenix did all his own singing was a bonus. What an amazing talent! Phoenix made Cash into a likable, complex, thoughtful, and 'deep' person. Given the Phoenix slant, I now have a genuine respect for the actual Cash.Reese Witherspoon was also astounding. Her Oscar nom was well deserved. As you know, she is a native of Tennessee (in the American South, and the state where Memphis and Nashville, the two capitals of country music are), so the Southern accent and old-timery Southern demeanor were natural and easy for her. More than doing a mere imitation of June Carter, though, Witherspoon also portrayed the loving and passionate woman Carter was in real life. With Witherspoon's portrayal, it was easy to believe that her love for, and belief in, her man could save him, turn his life around, and deliver him to greatness and peace.And the portrayal of the entire Carter family was also inspirational. The intelligent love, acceptance, and understanding of Johnny Cash by the Carter clan was truly heart-rending. I also enjoyed the scene where Daddy Carter appears brandishing a shotgun, chasing away Cash's erstwhile drug connection, while Cash was recovering in his bed, about to give up his drug addiction, go clean, and 'walk the line' for the woman he loved. Then, to hear the women's voices (Mother Maybelle Carter and June Carter) joining in with the Dad in chasing the drug dealer off, and then the camera shot of Mother Maybelle Carter also appearing with her own shotgun was breathtaking. With a family like that loving you and believing in you, when folks like that 'have your back', then anything is possible in this world.So, I was surprised and inspired by this movie, and Johnny Cash, and the Carter family. Who would have thought it was a great love story? Go see it, you'll love it! As a 'date movie', or as your once-a-year cinema experience. It's really worth the effort. I gave this a well-deserved 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, liking something or not is very subjective, whatever is written here, you should go watch the movie yourself and make up your own mind. In my view the performance of Joaquin and Reese as Johnny and June is fabulous and talent full! BUT i can't say that this is the best film from 2005...no, not in my opinion. The amount of dead performers in this movie is exaggerated...Elvis, Orbison, j-l Lewis + entourage... In a certain scene somebody encourages J.Cash to take pills and says, Elvis takes 'em too. I don't know why that sneer was necessary for.. So, enjoy Joaquin and Reese for their musical performance and the magnificent love story between them... The rest is a little "zombie returns"-show because of too much dead artists !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk The Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walk The Line is based on the true story of the late music legend Johnny Cash. The film shows Johnny growing up on a farm to becoming a musical success, his rocky marriage, his dependency on pills, falling in love with his singing partner June Carter and becoming one of the most popular musicians of all time. Winner of The BSFC Award for Best Actress (Reese Witherspoon, who plays June Carter) at The Boston Society of Film Critics Awards; The BFCA Award for Best Actress and Best Soundtrack at The Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards; The Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, Best Performance By An Actor In A Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Joaquin Phoenix, who plays Johnny Cash) and Best Performance By An Actress In A Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at The Golden Globe Awards; The NSFC Award for Best Actress at The National Society of Film Critics Awards; The NYFCC Award for Best Actress at The New York Film Critics Circle Awards; The OFCS Award for Best Actress at The Online Film Critics Society Awards; The SFFCC Award for Best Actress at The San Francisco Film Critics Circle; The Satellite Award for Outstanding Actress In A Motion Picture Comedy or Musical and Outstanding Motion Picture Comedy or Musical at The Satellite Awards and The Actor Award for Outstanding Performance By A Female Actor In A Leading Role at The Screen Actors Guild Awards. Walk The Line has good direction, a good script, excellent performances by both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, good set decoration and good costumes. The film is well made in just about every possible way and both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did their own singing for the film and each are so good in this film that they both deserve Academy Awards for their performances. They were two of the best performances I saw in a film from last year. The film is also very entertaining, full of spirit and energy, has an interesting and compelling story and is a fascinating look at these two lives of two music heroes. Some biographies do a lot for me and others don't have that big an effect on me. Walk The Line had a bit effect on me and I walked out of this movie loving every minute of it. Walk The Line is an excellent film and a great achievement from everybody involved in the film. One of the best films of 2005 and I'm sure that now all the studios who passes on this film are kicking themselves for doing so after seeing this great final product.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When everything works together...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I was incredulous when Ray was getting all the attention it was getting.I was incredulous when Walk the Line was getting all the attention it was getting.And what do you know but that is but an arbitrary and minor parallel that ties these two brilliant works of art together.While some people might complain about a formula developing, such a complaint is slightly unfair. Sure, the focus of the two movies are similar enough that the exposition of the storyline sometimes seems a bit familiar, something that in a time where originality is upheld as one of the highest virtues, might lead people in the wrong direction about regarding works such as these critically.So they both involve a death of a brother at a young age. Uh, those deaths? They actually happened. So they both involve drug addiction. Uh, that actually happened. So they both involve adultery and special love interest. Well, that actually happened. And you say it's a shame how both deal so much with post-traumatic stress disorder? Well... with the things they've gone through.But focusing on Walk the Line alone now, let us contemplate on what this movie so GOOD.For one thing, the acting comes readily to mind. Acting is one of the most readily apparent and focused on parts of film-making for the reason that it's basically what makes or breaks the story. The acting in this film? Brilliant, and I'm not just saying that. Joaquin phoenix's role isn't just unbelievable... it's really believable. Reese Witherspoon pulls of June Carter and honestly it's difficult to imagine an actress like her actually pulling the strings like that. Okay, so I'm biased because she's been in mainstream movies of little importance. But that's the point: she does really well, completely redefining my image of her.And then they can both sing, which I find hilarious considering most vocalists of modern bands can't even seem to sing yet two actors can and can also sing exactly like the people they're portraying. Ahhh, the state of modern music... but I digress.Secondly, the writing. As discussed above, the story follows the same rough outline as Ray, but it is different in this way: Johnny Cash is a different character than Ray Charles. Furthermore, the story they tell of Johnny Cash's life is very good, very touching, and very well presented. It made the music itself seem that much more powerful.Oh, and the music. I'm no fan of country music, and I haven't had much exposure to Johnny Cash besides listening to the live prison album alluded to in the movie, but this is some very strong stuff. It's easy to imagine that miming and overrecording would have been used, but the mere fact that it wasn't just adds one of those indefatigable aspects of what makes this movie work so well.Then of course there's the directing and the cinematography. Specifically, if anyone's doubting the impactfulness of the work behind the camera, I argue to rewatch that long shot where Cash tears apart the bathroom. Watch how everything possible seems to be at full work here, movement, zoom, acting, makeup, set design, music, atmosphere, lighting, all targeted in such a way that it does not feel reasonable to assume that such a take could ever be done again, even if all the same mechanics were at work.Okay, so I've basically just hyped it up a whole lot more, adding to that same hype that has people tired and sick of the whole idea of the movie before they've seen it. Admit it, the mere fact that it's been nominated for some Oscars means that it already feels overrated. I know exactly what you mean......afterall, what made me wait to see it so long? But whatever. Think what you want. I think this film is pretty darned great. I'm just sayin'.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now, this is first class acting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director James Mangold seems to be back in shape after the mediocre "Identity" and the awful "Kate &amp; Leopold"; the story of the love of country legends Johnny Cash and June Carter fits perfectly that old style Mangold displayed in earlier films like "Copland" or the award winner, "Girl, Interrupted".Mangold is not alone in this endeavor, the movie would not be the same if it weren't for the outstanding performances of Joaquin Phoenix as Mr. Cash, and specially Reese Whiterspoon as Mrs. Carter. They go beyond acting and completely capture the character in a way not seen since Jim Carrey's performance as Andy Kaufman in "Man on the Moon".Based on both Cash's autobiographies, the movie starts with the tragic even that killed Cash's older brother, and we get a glimpse of his harsh relationship with his father, superbly played by Robert Patrick. Years later, we follow Johnny Cash through his period in the air force and his time as a door-to-door salesman when he started composing the songs that would give him a contract with legendary producer Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts).During all this time the image of June Carter is constantly present in Cash's life, and when they finally meet each other the amazing chemistry on screen between actors Phoenix and Whiterspoon seem to mimic the real Carter &amp; Cash chemistry on real life.If Phoenix is amazing, Whiterspoon is out of this world, as her portrait of June Carter is what makes this movie special. She goes beyond acting and give a performance larger than life, that not only is appropriate in itself, it also serves a backbone for the whole storyline.Because this is not only a Cash biography, it is the tale of the love between two talented musicians that had to overcome hard times such as their previous marriages, June fading fame and most important, Cash's addiction to drugs. Director James Mangold makes the movie flow easily and takes enough time to show the several events in their life without compromising artistic value and historic realism.However, the movie is not perfect; its biggest flaw is that it follows the typical formula of a biopic, and even with the terrific acting of both Phoenix and Whiterspoon, the movie falls in the same sentimentalism trap as "Girl, Interrupted". Nevertheless, the movie is still superior to most biopics, as very few capture the soul of the real persons it portrays.While probably is not the best picture of 2005, the couple of lead stars gave the best performances of the year and probably, the best performances of their careers so far. 8/10. Really good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been waiting to see this movie since I first heard about it, around the summer of 2005. What originally drew me to it was the fact that one of my favorite actors, Joaquin Phoenix, was acting in it. I read numerous early on reviews, and after talking with a few of my friends, I could not WAIT for it to come out.Unfortunately, I didn't get to see it until early January due to some small difficulties. But let me say, it was well worth the wait. I was captivated by it from the moment that it started.The start of the movie came close to bringing tears to my eyes. I actually sort of predicted it. When I saw his brother near the saw, I knew that something bad was going to happen shortly. When the younger version of Johnny Cash watched his brother die, I was overwhelmed with an amazing sadness. It reminded me of how Joaquin had to watch his younger die just 12 years ago due to a drug overdose outside of the Viper Room.The entire movie moved me. I was singing along, waiting for his rise to fame, and just overall excited during the entire film.I guess that I'm just saying that I can't get enough of this movie. I loved it. I advise you to go see it. Now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Biopics are notoriously difficult subjects, but this film benefits not only from having such an enigmatic character in Johnny Cash, but his story is nothing short of compelling.The music performances are excellent, especially 'Jackson' which holds a candle to the original. And I love the way that the Luther Perkins character (subtly played by Dan John Miller) creates the riff for 'Folsom Prison Blues' during the audition for Sam Phillips.The acting performances are also exceptional throughout. Joaquin Phoenix captures the troubled spirit of one who lost his elder brother at a tragically young age (maybe drawing on his own experiences at the passing of his brother River). I have always rated Reese Witherspoon as an actress, but her performance as June Carter is a revelation. It's a shame she seems to settle for romantic comic leads, maybe an Oscar win might change that.Highly recommended for anyone, regardless of whether you are a fan (like I am) or not (like my wife). Word of warning though, don't expect strong impressions of supporting characters such as Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis. This is not Stars In Their Eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>life story of Johnny Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I admit I've never been a huge fan of Johnny Cash or country music in general, I really enjoyed 'Walk the Line'. While, plot-wise, it bears similarities to Jamie Foxx's Oscar breakthrough, 'Ray', what elevates 'WTL' above the other music bios is the performance of the two leads. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, as Cash and June Carter respectively, do all their own singing, giving the movie a more authentic feel.The story starts out in Cash's hometown, and the pivotal tragedy which would govern Cash's every action onwards. That is the death of his older brother, who appeared headed for the priesthood. He feels incredible guilt, not helped by his emotionally distant father, Ray (Robert Patrick). While in the air force, he begins penning what would become 'Folsom Prison Blues', and, once back home, forms a gospel band with an eye to cutting a record, much to the disapproval of his wife, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) When the eventually get recording time, Johnny gets berated for singing the same old gospel stuff. So, in a last-ditch attempt, he sings 'Folsom Prison Blues', and secures a record deal. From there Cash goes on tour after tour (while Vivian is at home raising the kids) with Elvis (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne) and June Carter, who he relentlessly attempts to court. A fight between Cash and Carter inspires the titular track, while Carter, in a period of loneliness, composes 'Ring of Fire'. Cash also plays a big role in lifting Carter, whom he admired as a child, from comedy performer to a serious singer.Cash's dependence on prescription drugs, as a way to block out the ever-present demons, aren't glossed over, as his superstar lifestyle, regular touring, and inner demons, takes its toll. All this anger comes to a head at a spiteful Thanksgiving dinner. Encompassing all of this is June. In a heartening display of true love, when Johnny stoops to his lowest, she feels compelled to get him back on his feet.As previously mentioned, the performances from Phoenix and Carter are what sets this apart. The live performances are very enjoyable, and Phoenix has a controlled stage presence as his seems to channel Cash. The performance at Folsom Prison, which was cut as a live album, (and pitched by Johnny when he realised the majority of his fan mail was coming from prisons) bookends the film. It also includes my favourite song, 'Cocaine Blues'Overall, 'Walk the Line' is a tremendously enjoyable experience. Part love story, part musical, and part look at how traumatic experiences and inner demons can destroy even the most successful man.</fullReview>

I have to say, it was awesome, and exceeded any and all of my expectations. I have to encourage you to see it in the theater, b/ c music is such a big part of the film, I don't think it will be the same experience if you see it in on TV. I plan on catching this in the theater again (yes, it's that good) and will buy the DVD. Joaquin Phoenix is not only spot on in terms of the singing (which is an amazing feat in itself) but plays such a convincing hurt and deeply troubled character. At one point, I was balling, and I don't cry in movies. I also bought the soundtrack and am amazed at how close he really came to capturing Johnny. I have both versions in my itunes and cycle between them, sometimes not really sure which one is signing. He got snubbed at the SAG awards and deserves the Oscar, a truly awesome performance in acting AND singing. Go see it NOW.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You don't see movies like this often. Movies that are based on true stories, are box-office hits, with music that makes you get up and dance and an emotion story line that makes you want to cry at times. It is pure movie magic.I've been growing up with a grandpa who loves Johnny Cash, and I'm one of those kids who sings "Ring Of Fire" every time she goes to a carnival and sees that ride, and my friends go "??". Johnny Cash has always had music I've liked, and when I saw this movie was coming out, I had to see it.Joaquin does an amazing job as the "man in black", and Reese shines as June Carter. They both have superb singing skills, and are an adorable couple that, even though at times they shouldn't, you just want them together the whole movie. They earned their Oscar noms, and I hope they get them! This movie is great and anyone who has loved Johnny Cash's music or just wants to see a heart-warming romance, go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director James Mangold did a great job with this movie. One of my favourite scenes comes toward the end, the scene showing how Johnny Cash connected with the prison audience at Folsom. Anyone enjoying Johnnys' music should pick up the new uncensored version of "Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison". It's great! Joaquin Phoenix was superb in his acting and truly came across as I'd imagine Johnny to. He and Reese Witherspoon both deserve awards for their performances. Their singing was great! One of the reasons I don't give this film a 10 is because they didn't use the Cash and Carter music. I'm guessing they may not have been able to get all of the music rights. But, it was still enjoyable. And, both Phoenix and Witherspoon got it right. Amazingly so.The other flaw was not showing the heartache Johnny's first wife went through. It was kind of glossed over to avoid reminding audiences of the pain he caused her. Audiences might not have walked away with as good a feeling about the man if that had been dealt with a bit more. But, I suppose being human isn't all bad. He and June were a better match. You just can't be on the road all the time and leave your wife home. It rarely works for any marriage. With this in mind, I do understand why the director chose to leave it out.Johnny's music has always made me think it is the original rap! Just with different beats and done with more class. He's had lot's of sad stories to tell and it comes across on the screen. Mangold did an exceptional job in creating Walk the Line. It wasn't boring at all.I enjoyed the film immensely and suggest it for all audiences. For the teens...there's a lesson in here on why to stay away from drugs. It's got to be a major walk down memory lane for all the baby boomer's that grew up hearing Cash and Carter music on the radio's constantly. I'm hoping it brings a resurgence in old style country back. It really is good for the soul. We all need a bit more music in our lives. And, this just reminded me of it. Johnny had a wonderful way of keeping his music real and it comes across clearly. Without all of todays vulgarity.I'm buying a guitar next week and taking up lessons. Writing music has be be better than a diary! ;) Even if no one hears it other than myself! ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man In Black Lives!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a traditional path to be trod in the pop bio-pic: the rocky road from impoverished childhood trauma and underestimation through the first flushes of success and excess, and thence to either redemption through the love of a good woman or untimely death. It's a deeply furrowed lane populated by the likes of 'Lady Sings the Blues', 'The Buddy Holly Story', 'Elvis Lives!' and last year's 'Ray'. 'Walk the Line', James Mangold's account of Johnny Cash and his pursuit of the love of his life, June Carter, follows this map step-for-step, yet still manages to be genuinely touching.Given that Judi Dench's cliché ridden performance in the awful 'Mrs Henderson Presents' is honoured in the recent Oscar and Bafta nominations we should, just perhaps, be wary of thinking that these lists are arbiters of quality. In the cases of the central performances given here by Joaquim Phoenix and the ever-dependable Reese Witherspoon, such plaudits are genuinely deserved. Witherspoon ups-the-ante a notch or two, giving us a quality mix of vulnerability and sassy Southern 'pep', and Phoenix has a troubled feral quality that does Cash proud. More importantly, there is a genuine chemistry between the pair on screen, aided no-end by Mangold's decision not to have his leads lip-synch to recordings of Cash and Carter. Theirs was a relationship based on music, and their scenes on-stage are amongst the best in the film, chiefly because we can see performers performing. They are hardly sound-a-likes for the real couple, but there's sufficient parity to make their characterisations convincing. Phoenix's rendition of the opening of the 'At Folsom Prison' concert is absolutely electric?and I say that as a big fan of the Man In Black.There are, I suppose, a few too many rapid-fire 'cameos' ? a cocky Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly and Elvis ("That Elvis boy sure likes talking' poon, Johnny!") ? but these at least capture the hectic pace of the 1950s touring programmes. More could have been made of Cash's truly long-suffering first wife: Ginnifer Goodwin gives a solid performance, but narrative emphasis being on Johnny and June, she is reduced in some scenes to being little more than an obstacle ? a plot-device to be circumvented to get to the happy ending. I, personally, would have liked to see more of (the continually underestimated) Robert Patrick as Cash's gruff, dismissive father. These are deficiencies, to be sure, but they pale to near insignificances in the light of the central performances by Witherspoon and Phoenix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lots of things have already been written about this movie. After I saw it yesterday I have read now a lot of statements and critics about it, many of them glorifying, some of them merciless and harsh.I do not know Johnny Cash too well, but what I know of him I really like and some of his songs I love. Those are simple and straight songs, getting a lot of their magic from his voice. I could write a lot about Johnny Cash and his music. But this entry should be about a movie.A film cannot be as detailed a biography as a book can be, it has to cut away parts of reality to give those things more space, that should be transported to the audience. This is where director James Mangold had to take some decisions and at least for me he took them well. The movie concentrates on the early years of Cash, it has two major themes in it: the love between J.C. and June Carter (also J.C.) and Johnnys problems that start in early childhood and partly cause his drug addiction. Don't expect more from this.And don't say "this does not show the whole Johnny Cash" - of course it does not. There are some hundred songs missing, most of his live is not told (the movie ends with the concert at Folsom Prison in the late 60s) and we nearly do not see any scene in which the singer Cash gets glorified into a supernatural being. Yes, there are some scenes like that, especially when he first time sings in the record studio, well - some episodes like that must have happened in his life. In general we are not witnessing the rising of a legend.The drug addiction is maybe given too much room and has a sort of pathetic taste to it - although I did not think so when watching the movie, I only came across this thought when reading some critics. Nevertheless the addiction was part of Cashs life and it was one that influenced him most likely until his late days. So it is - looking at the person we are talking about here - fair to give this subject room.What makes this movie more than just the story of a drug addicted hillbilly in love? For a Hollywood production there is a strong sense of reality in it, that mostly is transported by the women in the story. Johnnys wife, who blames him and suffers and June Carter, who never even takes a toe away from the ground and gives the great singer a hard but healing time.I was most impressed by the singing performances of the two main actors Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. Letting them sing the original songs and not dubbing that with Cashs and Carters voices was daring, but it works perfectly and makes the whole story more vivid. Both actors do a great job. I always imagined Cash as a man of at least 40, 50 years, never younger. After this movie, my view on him has changed.It is a good movie, that shows a part of the life and works of Johnny Cash. It does not pretend to tell you the whole story, it does not mystify too obviously, but it entertains you and seems mostly to stick to the truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walk the Line is the story of Johnny Cash. There's a strong focus on the relationship between Cash and June Carter. I wasn't really aware about their story prior to the movie and I did wonder how Carter was wearing so well bearing in mind Cash used to listen to her music as a child. A bit of research since watching the movie reveals she was a child star! The two central performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon are excellent and well worthy of their respective nominations by the academy. I expect Witherspoon may well walk away with the gong. As with most good bio pics based on musicians the real highlight of the film is the music and I've no doubt the music of Cash will see a revival as a result of the film. It's a cross between country and rock n roll and the film really captures the spirit of the 50's. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though the movie is long, it is definitely worth it. It might not be the best movie I have seen but the acting performances are truly great. Phoenix is very convincing as a lost soul. I was actually amazed to realize it is actually their own voices you hear. I am not familiar with most of Cash' work but Witherspoon and Phoenix were very convincing. One of the nicest things about the movie I found is to watch a man who can be loving and caring one moment and the next scene he can be as scary as only Jack Nicholson can be. Phoenix and Witherspoon deserve their nominations.7 out of 10 for the movie. 10 out of 10 for the acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I wasn't familiar with the life story of Johnny Cash before seeing this movie. I was interested about his music, though, so I had quite big expectations. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of Cash. Knowing he did his own singing in the movie makes me respect him even more. The same can be said of Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. The two have good chemistry on screen, and it's a joy to watch the story unfold when two actors in great roles carry it on. But I think the most important thing in "Walk the Line" is Cash's music. The songs are very carefully picked and fit in the story perfectly. "Walk the Line", in my opinion, is a near-perfect movie. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say? I went to the cinema today with my 15 yr old daughter. Even as we were queueing for the tickets I wondered if we were doing the right thing. I don't like Jonny Cash and I hate country and western music.... but the reviews were so good we thought we'd give it a try. And were we glad we did! It's a terrific movie - good storyline, brilliant acting and even the songs are terrific. My feet were tapping and some scenes moved me to tears. Reese Witherspoon is so versatile - she slips into this role effortlessly. Joaquim Phoenix is made for the part. He plays a charismatic flawed individual that your heart just goes out to. If you're looking to be entertained, and want a movie that's intelligent - and not full of f-words (unfortunately so many US movies are blighted by F*** all the way through)give it a try.. you won't be disappointed.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having followed the careers of both J.Cash and J Carter, the chemistry on screen between Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon would have done the 2 stars proud. It's extremely difficult to emulate personalities at the best of times. However, in this case it works wonderfully and this is one movie not to miss. It deserves all the Oscar nominations it received. To cut a long story short, the magic between the 2 actors goes to show that you do not need big name stars to take the part. Ms Witherspoon's stature stands out in this case. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal is outstanding, giving you an eerie feeling that JC is right there. Can't wait to see this again.</fullReview>

By this i mean, the chronology of the film seems a bit erratic for the first 30 minute, but gets better toward the end of this 2 hour film.The music in the films is fantastic and shared a complete likeness with Johnny cash himself. The film did not cover his entire life wish could be seen as bad, but i think the film shows the best bits of his life and captures his personality perfectly. i highly recommend this film to any Johnny cash fans,or film fans for that matter, you wont be disappointed.</fullReview>

I think Resse Witherspoon MUST take an Oscar for her acting because all my movie watching life i have never seen such perfect acting. i watched few videos of June Carter and Resse got the role perfectly. The life of these two marvelous musicians needs no introduction at all but the movie did perfectly show the obsessive love that Jonny Cash had for June Carter. Juaquin Phenix did an amazingly good job and i think he suited the role perfectly. I want back home and started listening to my Johnny Cash CD's over and over and over again and i guess all Johnny or June lovers will do exactly the same. RIP Johnny and June and you'll forever be remembered</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phoenix and Witherspoon are Untouchable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it very hard to find how anyone could come up with a reason to not like Walk the Line. James Mangold's biopic of American country music legend Johnny Cash is what the biography genre is all about, and certainly the credit that Cash deserves. Everything about WtL comes together with such heart and determination, that my wife and I were left in our seats saying "Wow, this is what going to the theatre is all about, what a fantastic movie!" Walk the Line starts us off with young Johnny Cash growing up on his parent's Arkansas cotton farm. Under constant fire from his father's criticism for not being as good as his brother, Johnny spends his nights listening to his radio, particularly the young country sweetheart June Carter. Johnny and his brother shared a very close bond, with his brother always helping him shrug off his father's drunken humiliations. When his brother dies after a freak accident, Johnny's drunken father naturally blames him saying, "God took the wrong son!" Having nothing left but a never-ending determination to please his father, Johnny heads off to join the service, where he will learn to play the guitar.Years later we catch up with Johnny Cash, now portrayed with uncanny perfection by Joaquin Phoenix, as he is about to leave the service. James Mangold's transition from the young Cash to Phoenix is beautiful. There is no wasted time of promiscuous growth, as we are streamlined through Cash's first guitar, the birth of Folsom Prison Blues, to Cash's first gospel band, who Cash's wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) disapproves of with no secrecy to Johnny. With his door-to-door job going nowhere, Johnny decides its time for him and his band to put out a record. As Sun Records producer Sam Phillips politely turns down the bands gospel, Cash's last hope for his dream is his solo work, Folsom Prison Blues, and Phillips loves it.This is Joaquin's most pivotal scene. Can he make it as Cash or are we as an audience walking the line out of the theatre? He nails it. Not only does he nail it, he IS Johnny Cash. You close your eyes and you hear the razor sharp voice of Johnny Cash cut right through you and you would swear that there is no way that Joaquin Phoenix did his own vocals, which he does, and does flawlessly.As Cash's success leads him to touring, Mangold gives a nice touch to the supporting cast as we are introduced to the young Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and June Carter, who is played to absolute perfection by Reese Witherspoon. While we don't see a lot of the others like Elvis and Lewis, their presence is a lot of fun. Mangold holds steady in keeping a good close eye on the main point of WtL, which is the ever-blossoming fight for love between Johnny and June through Cash's addiction to alcohol and pills and his failing fight to make amends with his father.As far as Phoenix and Witherspoon go on screen, you couldn't find better chemistry in a science class. These two, pure and simple, are dynamite. The struggle of love and friendship that they portray between Johnny and June is harrowing. As Cash's marriage with his wife slowly deteriorates from his time on the road and devotion to June, June tries to keep Cash at arms length. Reese doesn't portray Carter as a home wrecker, yet she is incredibly sincere in her devotion as a friend to Johnny in his period of drug and alcohol abuse. After several denied proposals of marriage to June, Cash's plausible perseverance climaxes, which is factually correct, with a full house on stage proposal The performances given by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are as good as you can ever hope to get in a biopic. They are both phenomenal. With both performing their own vocals, Joaquin learned how to play all of Cash's songs on guitar, while Reese learned to play the Carter's songs on the auto-harp. The dedication that these two stars put into their roles is clearly reflected in the scenes of them on stage, they are just mind-blowing. When these two look into each other's eyes while on stage you want to explode with delight, they are just that good While WtL does not demonstrate Oscar worthy direction or camera work, it is not to say they are not up to par. James Mangold knew how to tackle this film, and I agree with his approach. A simple straightforward look and such an involved story that would take care of itself. WtL is a serious contender in this years Oscar race for obvious reasons. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are so dead on in their performances, and have set standards so high, that any actor taking on a biopic role will have great expectations to live up to. Walk the Line is a story that is so successful and so fulfilling, you wont want the closing credits to ever come. Johnny Cash and June Carter can rest assured with such a triumphant telling of their love living on</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joaquin Phoenix virtually reincarnates Johnny Cash. I am not a great country western music fan, but I worked for the U.S. Senate in the 1970s, and the real Johnny and June came by on one of their periodic attempts to lobby Congress on prison reform. I have rarely met two more charismatic and wonderful people (and that includes Presidents, Senators etc). Phoenix caught perfectly the aura of command that Johnny Cash had, and the whole movie was magic. This should be the Best Film of the Year. (This is so close to a 10, that my hand trembled at 9.) That does not include the contribution of Reese Witherspoon, who, in my book, zoomed up from cute girl to serious actress in this film. The photography is spectacular. Very few movies catch the odd intimacy of performing -- the artists are in spotlights, the audience is more a big occasional sound in the auditorium than real people -- that's the world we see Johnny and June inhabit in this movie. It is fabulous.</fullReview>

There were things that were surprising and shocking about Johnny that I didn't know until seeing this. It prompted me to do some research on him. I found some of the details in the movie don't exactly match other sources. This is probably because they had to pare 30 years down to two hours. I will be buying Johnny's books for the "rest of the story"... This is a movie I will watch time and time again. I bought the soundtrack yesterday and have been listened to it many times already.

I teared up because I realized that he doesn't lie to June because they remain faithful until they die. I loved to hear Phoenix sing, and he sang just like Cash. The best part of the movie is the scene where he delivers Folsom Prison Blues. This is an excellent film and those are a couple of reasons. Go see it if you haven't. 9/10.</fullReview>

I thought since the actors did the singing themselves that it would damage the movie, but not at all. I do wish the movie had included more of his later life. It pretty much ended when he and June were married and actually that was just the beginning of his wonderful career. Of course, that would have made for a much longer movie. Maybe this will lead to a follow up and we can learn more about the years after the Carters converted him and not just the part about the drugs and booze.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walk the Line is the story of Johnny Cash and June Carter, two people I have never heard of.However, Phoenix's and Witherspoon's acting gave me an idea of who these two were.Speaking of acting, I praise this aspect of the movie. Joaquin Phoenix gave the performance of his life. I like his acting here, especially in the scene where he performs after being dosed with a lot of pills. His face alone spoke three lines of dialogue.Reese Witherspoon's tough cookie acting also got me there. She definitely got the spirit of the '50's and makes it look easy.One thing I did not like in the movie is that the vocals didn't match the lip sync. But anyhow, it doesn't matter.This movie is in the lead of great biopics such as Selena and La Bamba.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The JC legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did like Johnny Cash and his music and I did enjoy this bio-pic which focused on JC's divorce, recovery from addiction and second marriage to June Carter. I was disappointed that the JC story omitted a significant part of JC's career: his friendship with Richard Nixon which catapulted JC out of regional country western onto the rock and roll stations and the mainstream pop chart.Politics do blend interesting harmonies.JC's WELFARE CADDALLAC made JC a favorite at the Nixon white House where JC was often invited. Long before the fall of Nixon, Cash and Nixon parted ways when Cash started singing tunes with a more liberal flavor.This aspect of the JC legacy was entirely ignored in the story. Yet I find it the most interesting facet of Cash's career.There is one item I do note. Frankly the alleged controversy over Cash's Huntsville concert. JC is supposedly told by his manager that his church going audience would not approve of a prison concert.Regrettably much of the stories about Christians are written by other who do not understand them. Christianity was founded by a prisoner who walked the line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the movie walk the line, It"s the best movie I have seen in a long time. I think Joaquin Phonix and Reese Witherspoon did a fantastic job portrayimg June carter cash and Johnny Cash. I think Joaquin Phoenix looks a lot like Johnny Cash in his younger days,and I think sounded a lot like Johnny Cash and he did a great job singing his songs.Reese Witherspoon did a great job also.I really love the way she sang all of the songs, especially Wildwood flower,. I know they had to learn a lot to do this movie and they were fantastic.I think it really showed just how much June Carter Cash and Johnny Cash really loved each other. The movie was a great love story and a great musical all in one. I could watch it over and over again. Fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Your mum and dad,they f---- you up".Philip Larkin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr Larkin's best - known line proves its painful accuracy as his parents' reaction to the tragic death of Johnny Cash's older brother echoes down the years.He was killed in his teens in a sawmill accident that pushed the boys' father over the edge."The wrong son died",he shouts fraught with anguish as the young Johnny flees the house. Unsurprisingly this has a negative effect on their relationship,leaving Johnny spending much of his adulthood desperately seeking paternal approval. An admirer of Gospel music at an early age,he turns to rock n' roll apparently after hearing a young Elvis Presley at Sam Phillips' studio. Touring with pioneers like Jerry Lee Lewis and the King himself,he is happy to embrace the rock n' roll lifestyle. Meeting June Carter marks a turning - point in his life and the main thrust of "Walk the line" is the story of their time together. As a Brit I am not au fait with the "Johnny Cash - Country Legend" culture,I suspect most of the potential audience for this movie are far more knowledgeable about the man and his music than I and thus more qualified to talk about it. From a purely cinematic point of view I found it to be a little overlong but redeemed by the star performances,that of Reese Witherspoon in particular.Joaquim Pheonix I felt was a little monolithic,whereas Miss Witherspoon had light and shade.She appeared a fully - rounded person. The sound recording was excellent,the concerts - perhaps one or two too many - well staged. I left the cinema more concerned with the fate of Miss Carter than that of Mr Cash,proof - to me - that "Walk the line" is Miss Witherspoon's movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A First Class Biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great challenge with any biopic is to give some dimension to real characters rather than to simply join the dots of their lives. In WTL both Phoenix and Witherspoon deliver masterful performances, that absorb you totally into the story of Johnny Cash's and June Carter's lives. What makes this film so special though is that they do this both musically and with their acting.Witherspoon is simply mesmerising in what may be the performance of her career.Inevitably when a substantial number of years are crammed into one film, a lot of generalising takes place, and you are left to wonder how much has really been revealed (for example the Cash's relationship with his first wife - it went on too long to be all turmoil).The only shortcoming for me was that some of the actors playing bit parts as big time stars of the 50s and 60s don't come across that well, but they are secondary to the main story.In all a captivating film that will appeal to all music lovers of the period, even if country music "aint your thang". I know I'll be buying my own copy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bit late, but I finally got to see Walk The Line. Just a biopic of a flawed character who had the great idea to play a prison as his comeback gig? No. Beautifully directed, well-performed throughout, with a totally believable script, and two of the most stunning lead performances you could ever wish for.It's sad to check the awards this film received, and see time after time that Reece W won best female actor while Joaquin P was only nominated for best male actor. She undoubtedly deserved her awards - it's one of the finest performances I have ever seen in a movie for years - but he is pretty much up there with her in every way. I just hope he didn't go to many of the ceremonies, because his superb portrayal deserved equal success, not also-ran status. Gritting one's teeth and smiling for the eighteenth time could turn a man to drink and drugs.Great singing and playing, great acting, well shot, well scripted .... I loved this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** out of **** starsIt's difficult for me to refrain from making comparisons between Walk the Line and Ray. Both movies showcase a main character who is an innovative musician, an addict, and a "what happens on the road, stays on the road" Lothario. Let's also not forget the vigilant wife left at home with the kids as the consolation prize. One of the best films of 2004, Ray is more successful than Walk the Line on every level. But you have to give Director James Mangold credit for creating a film that has been so widely recognized only one year after Taylor Hackford's masterpiece.Walk the Line stars Joaquin Phoenix as a convincing Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as an even more convincing June Carter. Most of the movie focuses on the years of turbulence in both of their lives until their eventual union. Phoenix does a very good job of playing a sad, broken and numb Cash, a man who is easy to pick apart. He's hooked on speed, driven - sometimes to a fault - because of a castigating father, and in love with a woman who won't have him because her complexities outweigh his, which is why when Witherspoon enters a scene the movie belongs to her more than it does to Phoenix. June's marital problems span several years with several men, it seems, through little fault of her own. She has made bad choices, and lives with enormous internal guilt and embarrassment because of them. Reese portrays a June who's extremely likable because of her ability to bury her emotional grief and unflinchingly dazzle audiences with her exercised talent as a sweet yet smug entertainer. She's instantaneously forgiving to legalistic strangers who criticize her for her "sins", and too saintly a soul for the likes of Johnny Cash.But we still want them to hook up anyway.I felt there was a certain amount of conflict and urgency missing in the telling of this love story amidst a lot of meditative tranquility and brightness. The sun seemed like it was up a lot, without a cloud in the sky or a wind to stir the trees. I'm not one to wish for rainstorms or lightning, but it could have made for an appropriate and occasional backdrop to such an angry, desperate and damaged man. Cash wore black for a reason.Like Ray, Walk the Line gravitates toward the musical performances. It is now well known (and I didn't know this when I first saw the movie) that Phoenix and Witherspoon actually sang as Cash and Carter and absolutely nailed it! Their depictions were excellent but their voices were extraordinarily dead-on. After first seeing and hearing them sing together, I was consistently chomping at the bit for them to take the stage again, and again, while the melodrama behind the music unfolded. If Joaquin and Reese ever decide to book gigs as the legendary couple, I'll buy tickets, front row, and enjoy their show even more than I did the movie.</fullReview>

My favorite parts in this movie are when June Carter throws the beer bottles and Elvis, Jerry Lee...etc. say "We surrender", also when Johnny purposes to June on stage in front of millions people, by TV, live, radio, and so on. It takes a lot of guts to do something like that in front of millions of people. Yeah, he made mistakes in life between drugs, drinking, and a little anger, but inside he had a great heart. It's way too bad that June and he had to die. They were true love, weren't they? People have said He died of a broken heart, when June died 4 months before.

		<fullReview>Hello I'm Johnny Cash, the 4 words that send shivers down your spine and tell you that you are in for something special. Walk the line is a film with heart, passion and dedication without so much as a special effect or any CGI. Which is what you don't see nowadays, when I saw Walk the line in the cinema I was in awe, because I was watching some of the best acting I had ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as Johnny Cash, he gets every emotion perfectly and you feel that Johnny is embodying Joaquin throughout this film, especially during the music sequences and Joaquin shows how Johnny's confidence as a performer grows, from the first time he sings Get Rhythm to when he sings in Folsom Prison and knows how to taunt the crowd. Also Reese Witherspoon brings a great performance to the picture and you feel that this women could save a man because of her caring nature and determination.Overall, I think Walk the line is a fantastic film that Johnny would be proud of, you tap your feet when the music plays and you feel for when you see Johnny go down the slippery slope. It has become one of my favourite films that I can watch over and over and over again and not get sick of. I am a starting musician and this film made me want to follow that career path.Thankyou Johnny Cash, Because your mine, I walk the line</fullReview>

In this movie Joaquin and Reese do a wonderful job portraying this story of star crossed lovers.The music is wonderful, considering they sang the songs themselves. You would be amazed at the absolutely beautiful voice Reese has.This movie was condoned by the Cash family, and you can see why. It shows the good times and the bad, the happy and the sad, and leaves you knowing the pain on his face when he wasn't with the one he loved was real...Don't want to ruin it, but they did a great job portraying the story of not only two legendary country musicians, but two lovers who came together to be a wonderful couple after standing by each other through so much...If you haven't seen it, I suggest you do.

		<shortDescription>outstanding film, well-directed, and perfectly acted by Witherspoon and Phoenix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Mangold takes us through a basically true story (although there may be some exaggerations to make the film work) of Cash as he sees success, drug addiction and loses himself followed by the will to overcome his weaknesses. He needs and relies on the love and strength of June Carter throughout the movie. He asks Carter (Witherspoon) to marry him "40 times". And when she tells him the only time he can talk to her is on stage, Cash uses that opportunity to propose and what we get in that scene is a most heartfelt, believable performance with Witherspoon and Phoenix at their best. This is a movie that would have probably done okay without Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix. But what they do alone and more importantly in their scenes together is about as good as acting gets. There is something very special about Reese Witherspoon that is rarely seen on the big screen. She may be the best actress in the business right now. And Joaquin Phoenix is spectacular, as well.In a year of 8-10 excellent movies, "Crash" and "Walk the Line" have the lasting power. The scenes keep coming back around again and again long after you have left the theater. I know Reese Witherspoon won the Academy Award for Best Actress as well as nearly every other Best Actress Award offered for her performance. And Joaquin Phoenix was nominated for Best Actor by the Academy Awards and actually won the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Musical or Comedy. I highly recommend this movie to all adults. It is entertaining, historical, and perfectly acted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an excellent romance, but not so good biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walk The Line is a generic biopic about a great country star, Johnny Cash. The storyline is really predictable due to the fact that the film follows the same formula as other movies of that type. Thus, at the beginning we have traumatic childhood, then difficulties in the road to big career, development of the career, problems with drugs and numerous breakdowns and finally redemption, coming back to glory. Throughout the movie I had a feeling that I'm dealing with 2nd part of Ray. The flick, like most of the films which attempts to present the whole life of the figure, is very episodic and does not show thoroughly real dilemmas of an artist or creation of his work (songs in this case). In this respect Capote visibly surpasses Walk the Line. However, the film undoubtedly works as a touching love story. Not only do Jaquin Pheonix (Johnny Cash) and Reese Witherspoon (June Carter) play great, but there is also a real chemistry between them on the screen. There are also some marvellous scenes in which they sing together on the scene. Nonetheless, in my opinion Felicity Huffman for her superb performance in Transamerica should won the Oscar instead of Reese to whom I took a liking after this flick. Moreover, Mangold efficiently directs and the pacing is good. To sum up, the reception of Walk The Line depends mainly on your expectations. It's an excellent romance, but not so good biopic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deaf ear turned to Cash's spiritual journey.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's rare that I feel a biopic left out too much, but this one definitely made me want more.In particular, I was disappointed that Cash's spirituality was given such short shrift. I'm not saying I wanted it to be a conversion story with a neat progression from sinner through conversion to saint, but I think the script too pointedly ignored a significant part of Johnny Cash's life story.The story in the film was certainly well told. I greatly appreciated that they showed how much Cash wasn't a saint, that they highlighted the relationships in his family of origin that contributed to his struggles with painful addictions, that in Cash found a victim, enabler, and instigator his first wife, that his relationship with June Carter had less-than-respectable beginnings.Johnny Cash was not a perfect human being. That comes through very clearly. But what does not come through as well were the ways in which he was good. In a scene after Johnny's separation from Vivian but before his engagement to June Carter, June tells him that he is a good man. This is something I knew before watching the film, but it is not clear in the film. June's statement is unconvincing based on what we've seen up to that point. In a later scene when Cash is trying to sell the idea of a live concert recording at Fulsom Prison to the record label, the producers object that his audience is made up of "church goers." Really? I mean, yes--I know this because I've known the music of Johnny Cash my whole life, and he's the one musician my mother and I can agree on, but you would never get this from the film--not with the sheer zest and delight Joaquin Phoenix pours into "Cocaine Blues." I don't know any church folks who would have sung along with that one in 1968.The film has too strong an agenda to ignore the spiritual life of Johnny Cash. One scene in which June practically drags him to a Baptist Church does not cover anywhere near enough territory. Just because we did need to see what a sinner Johnny was doesn't mean we didn't need to see the place God eventually came to have in his life.He might not have been in AA (was he?), but those steps definitely seem to have happened in his life. He came to believe in a higher power. I wanted to see that and the change it brought to his life.</fullReview>

I wasn't disappointed.This film is highly enjoyable from start to finish moving very quickly and never becoming dull or boring. Writer/director James Magnold is right in focusing on the relationship of the two leads and their chemistry is wonderful to watch. This is largely due to the outstanding performances of Joaquian Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon who give 100% throughout and have several tremendous moments when they're singing their songs. They really do nail their impersonations and disappear into their characters. The soundtrack is also fantastic and I actually found myself singing along throughout.

Yes, there is the rise and fall from fame, but both are true stories: thus similarity should not be considered during comparison.You should know if you are musically inclined enough to watch this film; even if you are not, I can't see how it will fail to at least entertain.I could keep writing but there's no point ? just see it.

But I'm just surprised that Reese Witherspoon has received such praise for her portrayal of June Carter. Adequate performance, I guess. But I thought she was just a bit too genteel, too overworked, too well scrubbed for my liking. She never really seemed to LET GO. June was a salt of the earth, very natural, gravelly woman - with the voice to match. By the time she became involved with Johnny Cash, she'd already lived her own fairly turmoiled life. I just didn't get a real sense of that from Reese's performance. Maybe they should have gone with a lesser known actress who was a better match. More of a real woman than a Hollywood starlet. June just didn't really look that much like June, with her perfectly coiffed hair in every scene, and her higher pitched, thinner voice. June fully attacked a song, and she often wore her hair loose, thick and a bit disheveled. Sorry - I don't know what's wrong with me but it just didn't work for me.The first time I really came to know about Johnny Cash was when I was reading a fifth grade class reader. The story didn't reveal the actual subject of the story until the end. It told the story of how Cash, hopelessly addicted and lost in an open area one night, experienced a real sense of God and an actual moment of hope and conversion, when he was at his most desperate and at his lowest point. I always thought that that was the true 'turning point' of his life - though, no doubt, June played a vital role in supporting and helping him through the process. I was just disappointed that we didn't see a bit more of that in the film. Instead, they focused on the 'love story' aspect.Those are my two points of contention. But otherwise, a very entertaining and gripping movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie needs intelligence to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an intelligent movie, requiring the viewer to watch carefully and evaluate the significance of what is both said and spoken. I suggest you watch the DVD version so you see the deleted scenes and the director's comments. They're helpful and a guide to the art that went into putting the film together. In fact, I doubt that a book can be turned into a movie any other way.You need to keep this understated technique in mind to appreciate Reese Witherspoon's performance in the film. Her hidden agony as the religious June Carter in love with the married Johnny Cash is, to put it mildly, Heavenly. She's no longer Legally Blonde. I never fully understood the significance of "Burning Ring of Fire" until I saw Reese's interpretation of why it was written. Perhaps the movie should have been named The Passion of June Carter.I watched it on the recommendation of a friend and I recommend it to anyone, even someone who says they don't like C&amp;W music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one amazing film with brilliant performances. I loved it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of the young Johnny Cash and his love affair with June Carter Cash come to life in Walk the Line. It stars Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon with the best female performance of the year-no doubt. This movie starts how Johnny Cash got to where he is at, one of the most recognizable artists in history. With his popular country music to the love of his life, June Carter. Johnny meets June at a local concert and I liked the way this movie shows us how they met. Johnny grew up listening to June's music and the way he began to look at her, he saw beauty. Johnny and his band later begin to tour with June and go out there and perform and do they're own shows. Johnny becomes one of the most famous musicians and his singles begin to rise on the billboard. But Johnny takes a wrong turn and begins to pop pills every now and then and his career and his love for June begins to fall apart. June later wouldn't look at him or talk to him. He later turns into a big mess.I really loved this movie but this movie probably wouldn't be the same if the performances weren't there. Reese Witherspoon gave the best performance in this movie and I really think she is a real hot woman. After seeing all her other movies and seeing how she acts in this movie, she is brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix also gave a really powerful performance. I saw the horror film "Signs", in which he co-stars and it seemed like he was a different person in this film. This is one amazing film with brilliant performances. I loved it.Since the Oscar winner "Ray" was released 2004 and this was released 2005, I may want to compare it. Although Ray was more depressing in some ways and powerful, Ray beats Johnny Cash but these two movies are both wonderful pieces of work. I am very happy that Reese Witherspoon won the Oscar for "Best Actress". She really deserved it.I really loved this movie and I would wanna see it again. This was one of the best movies of 2005 and it is a wonderful piece of work. Everyone should see this movie. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better recent biopics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the better recent biopics. I had never paid much attention to Joaquin Phoenix before. But I must say now that he is an actor that must be taken seriously. He neither looks nor sounds much like Johnny Cash, but I don't think that is absolutely necessary to evoke the character, which he did very well. The middle sequence about addiction, and overcoming it, was a bit tiresome. I understand that it had to be there, that it was a big part of Cash's life, but it seems like they all go through it. Phoenix did that well, too, and I presume that he knows more than a little about addiction. Kudos to Ginnifer Goodwin for her performance as Vivian Cash. She was excellent in the role. I had seen her on a TV show (Ed) and am glad that she is getting quality parts. By the way, some of Cash's survivors have publicly complained about the portrayal of Vivian Cash. With one small exception, she (Vivian) never came across as a bitch, or a harridan, but as a real woman, a wife and mother, with real and serious concerns. I haven't read Cash's book, but I imagine that he would be the first to admit that he was responsible for Vivian's travails. And this brings me to Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. It seemed to me that she absolutely stole the show. She deftly mixed comedic and dramatic acting. Who knew she had this sort of range? A well-deserved Oscar for her. And while she may not look that much like June Carter, she was able to sound very much like her when she sang. I have a feeling that Miss Witherspoon might be quite formidable at a karaoke contest. This film is worth seeing even if you're not a Johnny Cash fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard that there was to be a "Johnny Cash Movie"... I was fairly skeptical. I grew up listening to Johnny Cash and I was horrified to think that Hollywood would/may/could destroy the legend as it stood in our minds. How wrong I was... This movie is awesome. The acting is flawless and believable, the music is great but not overdone and the created atmosphere of the 1950's and 60's is near perfect. It is a sad, funny, uplifting and demoralizing cornucopia of a story about a man who rose from a dirt poor and bitter childhood to become a music superstar to the world. Along the way he encounters the likes of Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis and Waylon Jennings, all introduced in a passing parade kind of manner. The drug issues that almost destroyed John's life are there in all their stark honesty. The failed marriage and an almost predatory pursuit of June Carter are skillfully handled. The whole thing just works. Add to that the fact that the actors actually performed the musical numbers in the movie can only been seen as a credit to their dedication to the project. It is a story and a movie to behold and to be long remembered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong powerful biopic of Johnny Cash's struggle with drink, drugs and the women in his life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biopics are always a favourite of award ceremonies, and Johnny Cash's story of rags to riches, from poor beginnings into major musical icon is one that was always going to be of keen interest. Story focuses on his struggle (and lack of effort at many times also!) to deal with his demons, be it the struggle to come to terms with his brothers untimely death, or to be able to properly be a family man to his long-suffering wife and daughters. Into this mix comes his love and obsession with June Carter (very well done by Reese Witherspoon), who herself is trying to come to terms with her life struggling to bring up her children as her own marriages fall apart.Drugs and drink spiral the whole movie into a whirlwind of a vortex, with Cash being his own worst enemy, but the man has a gift. I'm not into country music, but even I had to say that the music in this movie was exceptional foot-stamping brilliance. The tours were great, and the lyrics fitted the atmosphere well. Joaquin Phoenix was incredibly good, and was unfortunate not to have won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of the country and western legend.Some scenes may be harrowing for some, as it depicts the violent and difficult family relationship he had with his father, and then with his first wife, but it is worth watching through. Thankfully they did not whitewash over Cash's character, showing him to be pathetic as he was at times, but it was hard not be come over by his mite.Overall, a great directed, written and acted movie. One of the better (if not best) American movies of recent years. Will definitely be getting some of his music now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As musical bio-pics go, this is certainly superior fare, but how much you'll enjoy it might well depend on how much you like the genre and how much you appreciate the (country) music. This film was more my wife's choice than mine.It is the story of the early professional life of the American singer Johnny Cash, "The Man In Black", set mainly in the 1950s and 1960s with a soundtrack of no less than 16 songs. We already knew that Joaquin Phoenix is a superb actor (from movies like "Gladiator") and here he demonstrates a fine singing voice too.The revelation is Reese Witherspoon, as Cash's singing companion and future (second) wife June Carter, who makes it clear both that that she is fine actress (not self evident from films "Legally Blonde") and has a good singing voice.Considerable credit goes to James Mangold who laboured on the project for many years, working closely with both Cash and Carter (before they died within four months of one another), and then both directed and co-wrote it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This post contains MAJOR spoilers-Do not read unless you've seen the movieI loved this movie. It shows that you can't control who you love and love makes you do crazy things. Johnny is like most country artists born poor in Arkansas to tenant farmers, June best known from the singing Carter family. The two meet at Johnny's first big gig. Johnny instantly is won over by June's sense of humor and beauty. Despite both being wed to another, they develop a warm friendship.But fame has a dark side, Johnny begins using drugs and drinking a lot of booze. June tries anyway she can to get John clean, including taking all his medicine and flushing it down. Johns downward spiral continues. He gets arrested for possession, and his marriage (which has been failing for a while) takes a final turn, when his wife leaves and takes their daughters with him. Johnny then gets a spot by himself and pines only for June. She is disgusted by the sight of him but Johnny won't give up on the woman he loves. He shows he can change and that he loves her more than anything, the night of they sing together after a while apart Johnny has proposed over 30 times but she still says no.She tells him in the dressing room that he is only allowed to speak to her on stage tonight. While singing Jackson Johnny stops in the middle of the song, June is confused but continues singing, Johnny then announces that he can't sing the song until he asks June something. He then asks June one final time saying that he knows he did some bad things, but he only wants to be a part of her life, he just wants to take care of her. June finally says yes and it begins their life together.The acting blew me away. Joaquin Phoenix captured Johnny Cash. He showed his bad and his good sides with such dedication. Reese did amazing as June Carter, she hit every emotional note. Gennifer Goodwin won me over too showing a woman who was in love but the love died out. I recommend this film to anyone, it is a truly beautiful film and deserved to be viewed by all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a 60-something disabled man without transport, living 25 miles from the nearest cinema and a mile-and-a-half from the nearest bus stop, I bought "WALK THE LINE" on DVD because I wanted to see the movie. Wish I'd WALKED that Mile-and-a-Half to the bus stop: it would have taken me 30 minutes each way, but saved me the cost of a most disappointing DVD.I have always been a fan of Johnny Cash's music, and am a fast growing fan of Reese Witherspoon. But even with those two attributes in favour of the film (the two reasons I wanted to see it), I think I can honestly count the number of times I shall run this DVD in the future on the fingers of one hand.True to say that the film was very well acted by the two main characters: but if you take away the music, and take away Rees Witherspoon, there is nothing left in this film to either interest or admire. I found vast chunks of the film to be a total disappointment, and nothing to what I had been lead to expect.I have given this movie 7/10 primarily because of the Oscar Winning Skills shown by Reese Witherspoon as both a superb actress, and a great singer. I found her singing voice to be "Out of This World" with its wonder and beauty, and her acting in the role of June Carter was fully deserving of the Oscar that came as a result of it. In fact, I feel it would have been an injustice if M/s Witherspoon had not received an Oscar for this role.The Johnny Cash music was also very faithful portrayed; but not enough to hold my interest for very long.The music, and Reese Witherspoon ARE this movie. Take THEM away and there's simply nothing left to get excited about.Reese Witherspoon EARNED her Oscar here, and EARNED ALL of those 7 points out of 10 that I have given this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its difficult to comment on this movie because its almost impossible to decide where to start when describing how good it is! I'm not going to sit here and say its my favourite film or the best I've ever seen but there is very little in this film that i feel could have been improved. In a Biography,its is the acting and not the directing that is the most important, i feel anyway. The Directing is sufficient and consistent throughout and as has been echoed from professionals the world over, Joequin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon deserve Oscars for their performances. I read one journalists report on this film and they say Joequins too short to play Johnny and Reese too pretty for her role. I don't know to be honest, and it may well be the case. But ill say that if that is all they can find wrong with this film then i think that says it all. I didn't know a whole lot about Johnny Cash when i watched this film and it didn't embellish on his character or romanticise his persona like most Hollywood tripe, i wont go into details but there are times you feel sorry for him, angry at him or sometimes don't care. As I've said, everything in this film is excellent or sufficient for what is needed. The Music, excellent. Directing, sufficient. And the Acting and Casting, Superb. And Reese Witherspoon is gorgeous throughout! I give this film 9 out of 10 and would recommend it to anyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always been a fan of Johnny Cash, and as far as I'm concerned Joaquin Phoenix *is* Johnny Cash. The voice is uncannily similar, so that you forget you are seeing an actor portray Cash; it seems like the man himself. I never heard anything much by June Carter, but I am prepared to bet Reese Witherspoon's impersonation of her is equally good; it felt authentic, and the whole performance is a fine demonstration of her range as a very good actress, fully deserving an Oscar. They give tremendous performances of the songs and (in Reese Witherspoon's case) the playful onstage banter. Whether it is fair to June Carter to imply that Cash got even more into pills and drugs out of thwarted love for her, I do not know, but Phoenix does a great job of suggesting Cash's mental turmoil, and when she finally accepts his proposal, on stage ... wow! It was good to see fair renditions of Jerry Lee Lewis and a (very) young Elvis Presley as well. In fact, the performances were uniformly good. It may have oversimplified the facts, and Cash's first wife fades out of the picture without it becoming clear when and how they broke up, but overall this was a great picture.</fullReview>

Although I would definitely not recommend this as a family movie, it would be the bomb for any curious Teens or Johnny Cash fans. Joaquin Phoenix plays Johnny in the movie, and I don't think they could have gotten anyone better. He sings just like him and the things they do copy Johnny Cash's life nearly to the end of the string. After that movie, Reese Witherspoon has become one of my favorite actresses.

This movie shows a man through much poverty addiction &amp; a lot of pain over losing his brother but yet he manages to be mean and vulnerable. How this movie got left out for movie of the year is beyond me. But at least the Golden Globes got it right by rewarding both Phoenix and Reese and the movie.Academies are out for me a joke as far as I'm concerned.Can't wait to see these actors in their next role.

		<fullReview>I enjoyed watching the film, but wished for more depth in the story, and it also was deja vu to 'Ray' in seeing Cash plagued by guilt and the memory of a sibling's early death, which drove him to the brink of self-destruction with drugs prolific among tour members. Is this just the prototypical legendary musician's story? Did Elvis have a sibling who died, too? I think Joaquin deserved an Oscar more than Reese did, as well.I missed depth in the development of both Cash and June Carter as musicians. Cash's talent was taken for granted and more illustration of how music formed him, was a part of his early life, was lacking. Perhaps the movie was more about the rel'ship between Carter and Cash, but to have gotten more information about June's rel'ship to her own music and voice as well would have made it a more powerful as a love story. A love story about two musicians needs to show the depth of the passion they had for their music, which, I'm sure, was the driving force of their chemistry. I know it must be naive of me to expect it, but Hollywood movies don't ever capture the depth and power of great films anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feel-good, entertaining, and likable biopic that chronicles the life of the late Johnny Cash.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walk the Line is an entertaining and likable film in the tradition of good biopics for the awards season. This time, it is about the late country singer, Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix). The film chronicles the man in black who grew up in a flawed household. His brother died when he was young and his father was an alcoholic. Later, he joined the Air Force and then got married to a woman named Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin). He becomes a salesman but his mind was always on music, because well ? that was what he was raised on. The music he wrote about during the Air Force gave his success in an audition for a record company. The music was far from the gospel music he was raised on but was inspired by prisoners and inmates, based on a film he watched about Folsom Prison. On tour, he meets the flighty June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) whom he falls in love with even though they are both married to other people.This film is easy to follow, understand, and adore. Even though the characters are flawed, they are likable. For me, likable characters technically make for a likable film and that is what Walk the Line is. Even though there are scenes where it shows the darker sides of Cash through his time in jail cells and drug taking, the film honors him Hollywood style rather than really make him seem like a bad person. His mistakes seem minor to the film's whole and even June, who Cash falls in love with during his tour with her while being married, seems sensible (I swear, if this was any other film I would say, "You've a family at home!). Walk the Line seems to imply that these are lovebirds that met each other at the wrong place and the wrong time and they belong together ? and eventually they did get together. The film is almost more about their relationship than Cash's life, but that is really okay because every face of this film is likable ? from the obvious Elvis impostor (who plays Elvis) to scenes that probably should be brutal ? we seem to be enjoying ourselves.The performances in this film are pretty good. Phoenix has always been a great actor (see Gladiator) and he portrays the later singer well. Even though I don't find Witherspoon that deserving of an Oscar, she was good here too, not failing to meet expectations. There is also Goodwin, who turns in a respectful performance as Cash's first wife, Vivian. But something didn't really click for me with the performances ? they seem to be following too much of the script's likable-factor because sometimes the characters seem like they are from some fantasy land from the middle of nowhere. (Yes, I complain that the characters from The Last Picture Show are too shallow and now I'm complaining that the characters in Walk the Line are too likable.) The showy thing about this film is that Phoenix and Witherspoon have great chemistry with each other, and in this story, that is almost all that matters.Nonetheless, it is a likable, entertaining, enjoyable, delightful and good film. Phoenix and Witherspoon both sing quite well considering they are both not professional singers. I have a great fondness for this film even though at times it seem like a very tacky biopic that probably borrowed some ideas from 2004's Ray. I think I liked Walk the Line more than I liked Brokeback Mountain (in other words, I would of rather seen Walk the Line receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination rather than Brokeback Mountain). Good film, good cast, good music ? what more can I say?</fullReview>

The supporting cast are all great and lend to the tapestry of the film brilliantly. The film also gave me the chance to get to know Cash's music.

		<shortDescription>Excellent Stuff!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is simply great. Down to earth it is and the acting is really great. Pheonix (Cash) has done a great job and of course and as usual Reese Witherspoon has done a great job as well. The way Pheonix portrays the character of a broken/confused/upset man... I'd say he has done a brilliant job. The way he asked his dad, "Where were you?"... OMG it actually made me cry. Reese on the other hand portrayed a serene and patient person. Not to mention that she took care of Cash (Pheonix) for sometime which I found a really touching part of the movie.Not to forget to mention the fact that this movie has no nude scenes in it. It was rather a REAL romantic movie with only dialogues on the romantic part. Although a slow movie but that does not bother me in saying that it is one of the best movies I have ever seen! The movie just has you thinking about it the whole day and you want to watch it over and over again. A great movie I'd say and definitely more that worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional performances raise the level of excellent bio...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a long time since I've been privileged to see two such heartfelt performances as are given by JOAQUIN PHOENIX and REESE WITHERSPOON in this excellent bio of Johnny Cash. It's a bittersweet love story of how a good woman is able to handle the difficult, stormy relationship with a man and redeem him with her love. And around these two, are performances of such high caliber that the result is a deeply satisfying feeling that you've experienced the pain and love along with the characters.The supporting cast does wonders, each and every one of them is absolute perfection. Mention must be made of DALLAS TAYLOR as the man who auditions the guitar-strumming trio and makes a very important suggestion; ROBERT PATRICK as the callous, indifferent father who creates scenes of enormous tension when he clashes with his son's lifestyle of drugs and opulent living; WAYLON PAYNE as the frenzied Jerry Lee Lewis, doing a remarkable job in his first acting role and showing the kind of charisma that makes him stand out among the supporting cast of musicians.Admirers of Johnny Cash should enjoy the movie unless they want to quibble with the fact that Phoenix does not have the same deep timber in his singing tones that Cash had, except for certain moments where his lower register does get a chance to show. But Phoenix is an extremely talented actor who rises to the challenge here. His chemistry with Reese Witherspoon is especially powerful in a quieter moment early on when they meet at a coffee shop. And from that moment on, the chemistry is palatable until the final sweet moment when she finally says "yes" to his marriage proposal.An excellent film, even for those who are not at all familiar with the darker side of Cash's life. Well written and directed with the right kind of atmospheric effects to make it completely believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The man in black will live on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have loved Johnny Cash and his music since I can remember. This movie is a great way to memorialize the man and the great love of his life, June Carter-Cash.Joaquin Phoenix plays Cash with dignity and honesty, showing us everything, the good, the bad, and the ugly. And for a man who is not primarily a singer, Phoenix does a great job with Cash's songs.Oh, and who knew the Reese Witherspoon, known for roles like Elle Wood in Legally Blonde, and Melanie Smooter in Sweet Home Alabama could sing like that! She is a multi-talented actress and really shines as June Carter.I had known that Johnny Cash and June Carter had been married for 35 years, but I never knew what it took for them to get together. This movie gives a fair overview of the trials and tribulations that they had to go through before they could be together.One of the things I loved about this movie is that the background music, for the most part, is music from Cash and Carter. It helped tell the story almost as much as any dialog could.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know Juaquin and Reese had it in them. I saw Joaquin in Signs and enjoyed his performance but didn't realize he had this much potential. When I watch this movie I forget that this is Juaquin and Reese. You can feel the chemistry between these two actors. What's even more amazing is that these actors did their own singing. I'm glad they did this. It gave the movie a feeling of being real. You can since the insecurity in Juaquin voice when he first auditions and then gradually increase in confidence and power. This is how it is for a performer. Johnny Cash wasn't always the superstar and Juaquin portrays his humanity, insecurity as well as his strength and confidence as a performer. Juaquin grew his character up right before our eyes.Reese also made us fall in love with June Carter Cash. She was truly a wonderful woman who held John together. I always admired their love and devotion for each other. I'm glad that Johnny and Junes humanity and weakness were portrayed here. Beyond that fact that this out was about John and June Cash. It was a wonderful movie about overcoming weakness, insecurity and as well as our own demons.The music is fantastic. I'm going to go out and get the soundtrack. I'm also going to dust off my Johnny Cash albums. I have a new found appreciation for his music.</fullReview>

I could not believe it when the credits rolled and it was the first time we actually heard the real Johnny Cash and June Carter . It truly is a shame that Mr and Mrs Cash did not live to see this film . I think they could not help but be proud of the work these young stars put in .

We have always loved Reese Witherspoons movies. I have never seen many of Joaquin Phoenixs movies but will be watching for them now. Putting the two (Joaquin and Reese) together was magic. I also love there singing . The songs they sing together I love more than Johnny Cash and June singing together. This movie has really made me take a second look at Mr. Cashs life and music, and realizing how much he loved June just made my heart swell.

Joaquin Phoenix delivers and absolutely stunning performance and is even singing all the songs in the movie himself! Not to speak of Reese Witherspoon who is playing the best she EVER did, no wonder she won that Oscar! Even the small parts in this movie has great cast, and is all played with such a devotion, especially Robert Patrick impressed me with his play as Ray Cash, Johnny Cash's father!This movie is gonna be remembered for years to come, that is for sure. Whenever you get the opportunity to see this movie, DO IT. When it gets out on DVD, BUY IT. This will be something to show to your kids, and let them see the true legends of times passed.

		<shortDescription>For Kathy Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is for Kathy Cash, Johnny Cash's daughter who thought the movie portrayed her mother in an unfavorable light. That is not what I saw at all. I saw a woman and mother, trying to hold the family together amidst her husband's addiction and obvious obsession with June Carter. It was like the moment she got tangled into his guitar strap that he couldn't see anything but her. And in real life, I am sure and rightfully so, Vivian Cash had to be upset. She may have come off and being little spoiled by her family at the very beginning but I don't think she ever bargained for what she got in Johnny Cash. As for June Carter, I believe she tried her best to stay out of Johnny's marriage but since that obviously didn't work for him, if we are to believe the movie, she was nearly hogtied into marrying Johnny at all. I am sure she loved him. But sometimes love just doesn't cut it when you have a man in as much trouble as Johnny got into before he married June. And I believe that June knew this and that is why she was so reluctant to marry him. I think the movie was brutally honest if we are to believe it on the portrayals alone. Johnny didn't come off looking like a saint if the Cash sisters are concerned about that. I totally fault him for the break up of his first marriage. On a whole, I gave the movie a 7 because I hate where it finished at. They were never married in the entire movie. And I really thought that was the entire point of the show. To show their story not what happened much before they were married. I never expected it to end where it did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Portrayal of the Man in Black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Cash is, without question, a legend. One of the greatest singers and certainly the greatest Country and Western singer. Based on his autobiographies, this film takes us from Johnny Cash's humble and tough origins, the son of a poor farming family, neglected by his father, with a beloved brother who died when they were still children, to his superstar status, depicting both his passions for music and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) and his self-destructive appetite for drink and drugs.While the film takes on the typical structure of musical biopics, it is saved by superb performances from Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon, who deservedly won an Oscar for her role. The two actors did their own singing and playing and sound perfectly convincing. The film is well-made and hugely entertaining with, of course, plenty of great music. This is brilliant, and a must-see for fans of Johnny Cash, or Country Music (of which I am one).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an excellent film. I've never been a Johnny Cash fan, nor do I listen to that kind of music. But a friend said it was a great movie, so I rented the DVD. Now I wish I'd seen it in the theater! Fantastic cinematography, and actually great music too. But here's the deal....As far as actors go, Phoenix &amp; Witherspoon are amazing to watch in this movie. I'm fascinated by great actors as it is, but these two unleash some serious SERIOUS talent in this film. There are a few films I can watch just for the acting alone - Training Day (Denzel Washington &amp; Ethan Hawke), Gladiator (Phoenix, Russ Crowe) for example... and now this film, Walk the Line, I add to the list due to Phoenix and Witherspoon's performances. Great story too, and well directed. You won't be disappointed, even if you've never heard of Johnny Cash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong genre-movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joaquin Phoenix as the American legend Johnny Cash could be interesting I thought when I entered the cinema, and his performance here is absolutely fantastic. As Cash goes from being a upcoming-artist to becoming a superstar and then becoming a drug-addicted before becoming a rock &amp; roll legend. This way Cash' career is one of the most interesting in the history of rock, the way his gloomy personality hits the surface threw his lyrics and live performances.Walk the Line is definitely a genre-based movie, keeping itself very clean and straight-forward, though this could have made it a bit dull, this is not the case at all. Mangold makes a very strong and sharp drama movie, mostly because this is the biography of a man having such a deep personality that you can't avoid it being interesting. And with this Mangold doesn't make these big risks, instead he chooses being safe and classic. So; Phoenix gives the movie a double-kick with his fine performance, and with the fabulous Reese Witherspoon as June Carter this movie suddenly includes two performances so strong that the movie never hits a boring period. And there's a lot of smart supporting scenes here, as the movie features Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Roy Orbison for a second there (Bob Dylan's mentioned too), the movie is very correct having all of these materials mixed together. Showing off the differences between music then and now, which itself is highly entertaining.When you're going for such a heavy character as Johnny Cash, it's very difficult right from the outset, but Phoenix deserves a lot of honor for doing it the way he did. He puts the darkness into the country-pioneer, especially in the period of the movie where Cash is doing a lot of drugs, but in the same time he makes Cash very emotionally fine with his feelings for June and in the way he tries treating his wife, showing that he may struggle and do some failures, but in the end Cash really just want to be a good boy. It's one of the best genre-movies in a very long time, and Walk the Line will surely be a classic, especially among fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk the Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must tell you, I am not a country music fan nor am I a fan of Cash. But still, this movie was Excellent. Johnny Cash had a very distinctive style of singing and acting on stage ("Hello, I'm Johnny Cash"). Phoenix BECOMES Cash in this movie. I know it's been said many times before, but he really does become Cash. His singing style is the same, he has the same low singing voice, his mannerisms are the same, everything. Very impressive.As for Reese, I am not familiar with June Cash's singing so I can't really make a comparison. However, I have heard she like Phoenix was very close to how June acted and sang on stage. Oh, and Reese has a GREAT voice.For two people who have never sung before or played any of the instruments Johnny and June did and to have performed like they did is just AWESOME.Also, Witherspoon and Phoenix looked VERY good together. They looked like they were having a lot of fun making this movie. This is especially true during the concert scenes. They just work so well together.I can't help but compare this with another recent music bio-pic...Ray. Is this as good or better? I'd have to say no. But it is really close. I felt Ray had a bit more story to it. And I the music Ray Charles made more than Cash's. But, that being said, this movie makes me want to get some of his music from Itunes as I did when I saw Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Year's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always said that it is much easier to enjoy a movie if you think it will be bad, because the good moments will jump out at you. With Walk the Line, though, I had been looking forward to it all year and was worried that I wouldn't like it as much. But was I wrong!This movie is amazing! Every single bit of praise it has received is well deserved. Jaquin Pheonix does an excellent job at portraying Cash, and it really feels as if you're looking at the real thing. The show was truly stolen by Reese Witherspoon, though. From the first moment she ran on screen, you fell instantly in love with her. When her voice soared it was incredible. She truly deserved her Oscar and has definitely proved herself a truly wonderful actress. In my opinion, she has given one of the greatest performances of all time.All in all, Walk the Line was by far one of the greatest films of the year. The music is excellent, the performances great. It rocks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Has An Enlightening Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WALK THE LINE **** This biographical study of the life of country music legend Johnny Cash is both a musical and a drama as we follow through the hard trials of Cash's life, extraordinarily reenacted by Joaquin Phoenix. We see the ups and downs of his childhood, how he got to become a famous musician and a sex icon, what led him to start taking drugs, and how he ultimately overcame his battles. Phoenix's performance owes part thanks to the strong screenplay and solid direction that he worked with in this picture. Blonde-turned-brunette Reese Witherspoon contributed her most widely-acclaimed performance as the love interest. A powerful story that may leave you enlightened as well as entertained by its concluding act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am not a Johnny Cash fan but the movie won a place in my heart!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be able to offer a comment on this movie I guess I should know something about Johnny Cash but to be honest although I don't know much about him still I wanted say something on the movie.Because I read a couple of negative critiques on the movie. For example Jeffrey M. Anderson says "Every scene is a major turning point or epiphany; we never see Cash doing anything normal, we never learn his routines or what he liked or disliked. As with Taylor Hackford's Ray, we can easily follow what the character does but we rarely get an idea of who he is." Well he may be right but I suppose when you produce a biopic you are not supposed to make a movie just for the fans of that person or for people who have known his art. I am in my early 20s and as a foreigner I barely know anything about the American music then.When I finished watching the movie I must say I am very impressed. Even if it seems like an actor/actress showcase than a movie itself the harmony between Witherspoon and Phoenix is really awesome. Even though they just perform these roles they are like real country singers with their impressive mastery.Besides Withersppon must be at her best with this movie. I mean look at her other movies like "Just Like Heaven". She is more than sweet in this one. She looks intelligent,precise and full of friendly love tinged with a passionate radiance. Joaquin Phoenix's performance also deserves acclaim though he did not get the Oscar. In short "Walk the Line" is a great story of a guy who moved from rags to riches not just in term of material wealth but inner peace, love,parental affection and friendship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joaquin Scores</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joaquin Phoenix has intimate knowledge of the dangers of substance abuse. Joaquin witnessed the horrible death of his own brother, River Phoenix, from a toxic mixture of heroin and cocaine outside the Viper Room in Hollywood during Halloween night, 1993. And in this film, Joaquin is convincing as he brings to life the case of Johnny Cash, who was nearly finished by the abuse of prescription drugs in the early 1960s, the same sort of toxic stews that later finished the lives of Elvis Presley and many other musicians of that era. Walk the Line examines the life of Johnny Cash from his youth in the cotton fields of Arkansas to his marriage to June Carter. The tapestry of Cash's life is depicted faithfully and with great sympathy. Cash was acquainted with drug addiction and jail and recorded a live album in Folsom Prison in California to show his empathy with his fellow offenders. It is perhaps part of the authentic setting of this film that social interaction between the characters seems to be awkward and rude, as if physical and verbal violence in this setting is seen as the only way to get attention and respect. But it becomes obvious that the raw behavior and incoherence are sustained by the substance abuse depicted, as a method of attaining pain relief or to mask painful feelings of inadequacy. Joaquin and his troupe of fellow actors and actresses do a good job of depicting these dysfunctional relationships and their eventual resolution to a more stable way of living together. Reese Witherspoon is stunning as the steadfast friend and then wife who eventually showed Johnny Cash how to truly "Walk the Line" toward sobriety, the longevity that eludes even today so many musicians such as Kurt Cobain, happiness, and musical productivity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>completely wonderful portrayal of sensitive subject matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if you're not a fan of family saga, Walk The Line is worth seeing, just for the highlights of watching and listening to Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon perform musically. But this movie is even much more, at the heart, which will surprise the movie goer. Joaquin, as Johnny Cash plays the underdog country crooner with heart wrenching grit, style, and surprising sensitivity, sensibility, and sentimentality. His addiction to prescription pills never supports the happiness he truly desires and yearns for with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), who will later become his second wife, after divorcing his first wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), played passionately. June is not only perky and positive, but she's intelligent and firm with Johnny when it comes to her stance against his drinking and pill popping.Many of his lyrics reflect love, heart ache, desire, but also darkness, despair and even destruction. He's a man who is forever attached to man's anguish ridden, and often times, battling psyche. As long as he's wearing black, he's singing about such conflicts, "walking the line," between sobriety and inebriation, clarity and crime, punishment and compassion. He feels empathy and warmth, where most would feel finality and coolness. This story is so colorfully depicted, even though the man always dressed in black. A challenge succeeds and surpasses our preconceived expectations. We only wish that Johnny, himself, lived with greater multi-color from within himself.For communication lacking in his first marriage, he saves with music, a mutual passion, in his second marriage, to June. Sadly, his first wife never fully accepts that music is integral to himself and hence, their relationship, and marriage. She persistently sees his music as separate from the two of them, even attempting to stop him from hanging band photos on a room wall. At a loss, she is unable to accept him for who he is completely, a man who identifies with himself, others, and life, through lyrical stories, in music. For her own dreams to justly come true, their divorce is inevitable, as their goals, desires, and dreams are not one in the same or shared. June, a talented singer in her own right does understand and is the closest aura of light and color to shine around and within him. But, it doesn't mean that she doesn't have her own share of conflicts, with the man dressed in black. Her hesitancy to get involved with a married man shows her own struggle to remain true to her morals, and respect for herself, for him, and his marriage. When June finally weds Johnny, he is truly blessed to have a shining light to his personal sentiment, and his professional path, a singing and performing career, one she not only acknowledges and praises him for, but contributes with her own talents as well. When things are good between them, personally and professionally, things are great for all, especially their fans, but when things are bad, moments are embarrassing for themselves and their public. But even through the strife, Johnny comes out a survivor, realizing the significance of love he has with June. In a final scene, his father Ray (Robert Patrick) and grandchild are playing telephone talk, with can and string, in the Cash backyard. Johnny helps his dad out and says to him, "Pull a little tighter on the string," and we smile, thinking how Johnny is capable of tightening the meaning to his own relationships, especially the one between him and his wife. He can't change the past with his father, but he can accept the present and make the most of what good things his father can offer, as a dad and a man. What a wonderful script and touching film about such delicate subject matters, brought to life by two very thoughtfully and thoroughly engaged actors, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. The supporting cast is the glue that shapes the work, telling the whole story, in all of its trials and tribulations. Even if you're not a huge fan of family saga, this film might draw your own sensibilities tighter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't ask me why the academy chose not to nominate Phoenix for an Academy Award; I just watched the film and was hugely impressed with his depiction of Cash. Not only could he sing the famous Cash songs beautifully but he also had the stage actions down virtually perfect. I loved watching how he played Cash and his stage movements with his guitar-no other performer that I know carried his guitar behind his back and moved it around as he did on stage and Phoenix copied his moves perfectly.I have read reviewers that were disappointed in Phoenix and his depiction of Cash so I went to the film expecting to be disappointed-how wrong I was. From the opening at Folson Prison with the music's heavy beat leading to Cash's stage appearance, I could see Cash in the interpretation that Phoenix gave-I had no trouble, particularly by the end, thinking that Cash was still with us and I was watching a live performance. In my opinion the various reviewers missed with their interpretation this time around.Margold's direction and his script writing can not be faulted. All in all I thought the film was superb and much underrated, with great acting, great singing and set decoration right out of the period.Even if you don't like country music, make every effort to see this wonderful film.</fullReview>

I would have never expected Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon to make these characters practically their own while still seeming like the real actual people.Excellent movie except for the things it's missing.I am also stunned at some of the deleted scenes that should have been left in the movie.

		<shortDescription>Still good- don't let Ray dampen it for you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Ray was a really good movie, this one is almost as good if not as good if only for Joaquin Phoenix's and Reese Witherspoon's performances. Both of them are so electrifying as Johnny Cash and June Carter, the movie would just not be good with other actors playing them. The same can be said of Ray, and while some people are calling Walk the Line 2005's Ray, I really don't think that's true. Ray was sad and melancholy, and more of a full and broad portrait of Ray Charles than Walk the Line is of Johnny Cash. Walk the Line focuses in on his love for Carter and his addictions. Ray covers more of Charles' life while still feeling focused- Walk the Line actually is focused, and each works on its own terms.While the movie wouldn't be the same without Phoenix or Witherspoon, it supports its players well, connecting the different plot points well with each of their songs and allowing a glimpse of the characters past Johnny and June, such as Johnny's wife and father.A good movie- don't miss it because you've been told Ray's better. They're different and each one stands on its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never a huge fan of Johnny Cash or June Carter's music. It's not so much that I disliked either of them, I'd just never devoted much time to listening to their work... Until I saw this movie, that is. My boyfriend is a huge Johnny Cash fan, so he convinced me to See it. I went into the movie with no expectations, and came out completely impressed. There was incredible chemistry between the actors, and I was amazed by their singing their own parts. While their voices don't match John and June's exactly, their performances were totally convincing. Since seeing the movie I have become nearly obsessed with the music of June Carter, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, and the like. Phoeniz and Witherspoon are amazing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this film. Walk the line basically is a biography of Johnny Cash's life. The film was really really good.From start to finish the film flew pleasantly and the acting from Reece Witherspoon was absolutely outstanding!!! All of the cast acted really well, the film flowed magically and the film was just really good! The storyline was a very basic plot, however it was written very well into a 2 hour slot. The storyline flowed well, the acting was outstanding and everything about the film was just really good above standard and I hope they are honoured with a few Oscars too, come Sunday! Good Luck!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well acted but I expected more...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a late blooming Cash fan and did not fully appreciate his talents until his death. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, and both Juaqin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have you believing without a doubt that they are Johnny Cash and June Carter. The mannerisms and their chemistry work well throughout the movie. And even a day later from watching the movie I still am amazed at their singing skills. They nailed it! Where I was slightly disappointed was in either the writer, director, and/or the cinematographer's ability to really capture a moment with heightened intensity or gravity. For example, there is a moment of desperation where Cash is at a bank to cash a check, but there is not a feeling of desperation to the viewer at that moment. I compare this to a similar scene in Cinderella Man when Russell Crowe is requesting government relief and the viewer feels the impact there. It was never effectively communicated why essential elements occurred. What pivotal moment led him into the drugs? There were enough scenes to depict a problem but you never see it evolve. Did June have the same feelings as Cash for marriage? The movie implies she gave in to the proposal to some respect. There should have been an intimate scene between June and a secondary character to affirm her feelings. I guess the movie just has a feeling of going on a nice ride, but it never ratchets the emotional content from one scene to another. And while fiction, it would have been good to see a moment where the 'passing of the heart baton' occurs between his first wife and June. Maybe fictional, but it was effective in Sound of Music. I suspect that the creation team was trying to adhere to fact as much as possible per the family's advisory and may have been limited in taking some license in the story. It is an enjoyable movie regardless, and as much as a Cash fan as I am, I cannot see this winning Movie of the Year. With that all said, I hope they consider a 'sequel' to cover the remainder of their lives together. There is plenty of material, from the television shows, events in Jamaica, the Highwaymen, the lifetime achievement award in country music, the detachment from the industry, the efforts with Ruben, and then the final days together. This would be a totally different movie, but the actors would be perfect to carry on the line...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really barely even knew about Johnny Cash or his life before seeing this movie, but I knew just enough to see the movie and understand it; this is how detailed and in depth this movie is. Joaquin Phoenix's and Reese Witherspoon's voices both took over the screen. I still cannot believe that they really sang the songs in that movie; it was amazing, and it will surprise you too. The story makes sense and is easy to follow, but is not predictable either, so the movie always keeps you wondering. Even if you know nothing about Johnny Cash, this movie will keep you entertained from the start. See for yourself; Walk The Line is one spectacular performance after another!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the life of Johnny Cash based upon two books that he wrote.The things that makes this movie good are the music itself and the times June Carter (Witherspoon) and Cash (Phoenix) are together whether singing or just talking. They have great chemistry, but the singing part has the edge as far as I am concerned. The music might even over-ride all else, but when you consider who the singers were (in real life), this becomes really great. What a time it must have been for a young Johnny Cash to be on a circuit with June Carter, Elvis Presley, Waylon Jennings, Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Of course I am sure each didn't know how great each was to become, but it must have been good times nevertheless.Phoenix's singing was good and at times you almost heard (at the end of the movie) Johnny Cash, but the mannerisms were down pat and you know we looked for that. You just know.Now for the title. I would have put the title as Ring of Fire, or Hello, I'm Johnny Cash. Come on he didn't walk the line when he was still married to Vivian, his first wife. It was just wishful thinking on his part. Okay, the line was given to him by June. Still???.I still cannot help thinking that besides the music the person that puts this over the top is Reese Witherspoon. Without her, this still would have been good, but with her singing and portrayal of June Carter, this became great in my eyes. I had the best feeling when she was on screen with Phoenix, especially when she was singing. She may have been the friend, the girl friend as a secondary focus to Johnny Cash, but she made this movie. She was much more than an excellent Supporting Actress. She was the Best Actress and she has my vote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best true story musical since Sound of Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not since Julie Andrews wowed audiences years ago with the telling of the Von Trapp family singers has there been such a captivating, electrifying, or poignant film. I must admit, I was skeptical at first, not knowing a lot about Johnny Cash. But after seeing it, I couldn't get his songs out of my head. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were amazing together, and it really impressed me to learn that they both studied song and instrument to get it right.After seeing this movie the first time, I ran out and got the soundtrack. I'm sure you will, too. This is a timeless film, telling a melancholy story about one of America's greatest performers. I will watch this movie many times, and am rooting for it, as the underdog, to win at the Oscars this year.Anyone who says there were not impressed with any aspect of this film is either lying to you, or hasn't seen it, and is only going on the fact that they hate everything. This movie will make the career of Joaquin Phoenix. Audiences everywhere should stand up and cheer for Walk the Line, Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, and most importantly, Johnny Cash!</fullReview>

His performance is almost breathtaking. He is so interested in what is going on and makes me believe that I was actually sitting in that room. He is in other scenes in the movie, but this one was the best! Reese and Jaquin were very good too, but he took the show! I think that the directors should have given him a speaking part. I have done extensive research to find out who he is. His name is Danny and that is all that I could find. If anyone out there has any information on him, please, please, please send it to me.

		<shortDescription>Somewhat disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, saw the film this evening, and I have to say that I was really looking forward to it, being a bit of a JC fan.And my impressions are... well, certainly well acted, both the lead actors give excellent performances. The songs are pretty well reproduced, and there are some tender moments.And yet, and yet ... well, it really did feel rather formulaic, and the JC character really was pretty well sanitised for the (US) public. I would like to have seen the real Cash, I'm pretty sure we didn't see it.The other complaint is, why such brief examination of the JC career ? He was still making good records in the 1990s, and the 2000s. Listen to 'Personal Jesus' if you don't believe me. I was expecting to see the visit to the Holy Land, his baptism, the lean years in the 1990s. None of that is covered. Shame.In summary, I really believe that one can glean more about the 'Man in Black' by listening to the later recordings, than from watching this film, although it does add something to the legend.Entertaining, but maybe one day somebody will make the REAL J Cash movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this film I was sure it had something missing, that it was somehow floored. But on reflection, it's not. It's amazingly fulfilling and every minute enjoyable. The film is not a masterpiece. It rarely manages to delve into the subjects motivation and inspiration for his choice in music style. And I'm sure the Sun Records road show with Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis and the likes had considerably more to tell than merely Cash's introduction to June Carter and excess. In general coverage of the limelight and overindulgence seems scant. But it's not a documentary after all, it's a love story.Is it well rounded and complete? I don't know and I'm not bothered. As a film in its own right it is fantastic.Undoubtedly, in keeping with every other review, but it's so prevalent to the film's success that it has to be said ? the performance scenes are brilliant. Both Phoenix and Witherspoon sing their own songs and do an unbelievably good job. Their portrayal of Carter and Cash's romance is just as compelling and you just want to watch the character's appealing sadness with as many songs thrown in as possible. And that's exactly what this film gives its audience ? complete satisfaction.Watch this, watch The Buddy Holly Story, and watch Ray because they're all great. After the relative disappointments of Kate &amp; Leopold and Identity, James Mangold shows a return to form with his best film yet - 'Get Rhythm'.</fullReview>

It IS the story of Americana, not just Johnny Cash - or you could say JC IS the story of Americana -- rural poverty, hard work on the land, family tragedy, talent, more hard work risking everything, the fall from grace and descent into Hell, the resurrection with the help of friends, and ultimately redemption -- and all through Love, and above all Passion. It's like Hollywood is AT LAST standing up and saying, "Hey,World! THIS is what "America" and being "American" is REALLY all about !!!" This has GOT to be HOTTEST for the Ocars. In case anyone ever doubted which side of the line they stand, this is Highly highly highly recommended !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Storytelling, Performances and Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I certainly can understand why Rosanne Cash and her sisters were uncomfortable seeing their mother Vivianne's marriage to their father Johnny meltdown on the big screen, Vivian's only 'failings' seemed to be that she simply wanted security for her family and didn't think a music career with Johnny on the road all the time was the way to achieve this, and she objected to his alcoholism, pill addiction and his flaunting groupies letters. Seems perfectly understandable to me. However; one can't deny that having witnessed their father's alcoholism, addiction and putting their lives very much on the back burner to his desire for performing- and seeing their parents have a physical altercation (if true) must have been a terrible price for these girls to have paid in their childhood! If anything, this movie made Johnny not Vivianne seem the worse parent and spouse. It's a credit to the executive producer John Carter Cash that he was willing to have had his late father depicted this way- even to the extent of ending the movie before his OWN birth and childhood in which,by all accounts, he benefited from having, a much more attentive and present father than his older half-sisters had had in their childhoods. John Carter Cash didn't even have the end titles mention him by name but merely said that six months after the Ontario proposal, Johnny and June Carter were married and two years later had a son!It's not just the vocal range and guitar playing skills that Phoenix did an amazing job with while playing Johnny but also the fact he was able to convey the often desperate nature he had of needing to perform to feel alive and how he considered the other performers and audience audience to be his family that he always loved yet argued with. Excellent idea to bookend the movie with highlights of his innovative Folsom Prison Live performance in which he bonded with the inmates as though he was a long lost brother. Not a false note in Phoenix's performance in relating in that bond!Also,while Johnny rightly gave credit to June and her parents for rallying around him to help him deal with his addictions and put him back on steady ground. One must ask if one reason he accepted their help/intervention was due to him literally worshiping them from childhood onwards? No doubt Vivianne wanted to end these addictions and it's quite likely one or more groupies may have attempted to enact a 'salvation' fantasy by trying to get him quit- but Johnny didn't worship any of these women the way he had June! Not surprising that Johnny would worship June as a boy(named J R) because he was told that the one means he was able to feel alive(his music) was 'nothing' by his father and,on the radio, he could hear on the radio a child close to his age being praised and venerated by ADULTS for the very thing his own father constantly dismissed. And Reese was very believable as someone who'd more than held her own from an early age in what was then unquestionably a male-dominated profession- yet never lost her femininity or compassion. Reese definitely has earned her Best Actress Nomination here for capturing June's intense spirit- yet keeping her human and not letting her be a two-dimensional stereotype. Robert Patrick did an amazing job with a rather unlikable character of Ray Cash- and one can't help but wonder if the movie (and Johnny himself) may have toned down the REAL Ray Cash's hateful and belittling personality- though it must be said that even though Ray finally grudgingly admitted being envious of Johnny for being able to tell a story, he DID seem to be there for his granddaughters when their father wasn't. This movie may not have every picayunish detail of Johnny's life depicted with flawless accuracy but I think it legitimately captured the essence of what made him tick as best as any movie could have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good, but inaccurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this film, but there are some issues: 1. Jerry Lee Lewis recorded his first single "Crazy Arms" b/w "End of the Road" (Sun 259) way AFTER Johnny Cash already had hits with "Folsom Prison Blues"(Sun 232) and "I Walk the Line"(Sun 241). And it WAS NOT a hit!!! Jerry Lee's first hit was his second single "Whole Lotta Shaking' Going' On" (Sun 267) in 1957, and by that time Johnny Cash already had a contract with Columbia Records, as far as I know.2.Johnny Cash was never a Rock'n'Roll star, I doubt that he ever performed "Rock'n'Roll Ruby" live... a brilliant rock song but better performed by Warren Smith or Johnny Carroll. Or "You're My Baby", Roy Orbison with his band did a good version, but Cash just could not rock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never 'got' Johnny Cash, or knew much about him, so the maverick nature of the man, his inner (and often outer) violence and tragic scar baggage from his country childhood, came as a complete surprise. As much so as the extent of Ray Charles' darker side had been in WALK THE LINE's closest film relative RAY.And yes, the movie is every bit as good as you probably expect it to be. Joaquin Phoenix is every bit as accurate ? and not just his copy of Cash's awkward, uncomfortable style of holding a guitar that made even Gerry Marsden look relaxed. And Reese Witherspoon is every bit as convincing as he is powerful.The musical set pieces, of course, are tremendous ? from Cash's debut in Texarkana to the seminal Folsom Prison gig. Plus some interesting cameos of Jerry Lewis, Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley and Waylon Jennings (by his real-life son). Even Roy Orbison gets a glide-by appearance.But the suddenness of the 'coitus interruptus' ending was eased by the retired national newspaper journalist who went with me to the preview and recalled how his photographer colleague was once sent to photograph Cash during a stopover for a gig in Manchester. They did the pictures, then Cash asked where he could get a decent drink. So the snapper treated Cash by taking him for a few at his local pub in Cheadle Hulme just outside the city. Now just imagine that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As of Jan 12, 2006, I've seen WTL 62 times. Was at the last showing before the movie left my local theater (Sandhills Cinemas 10)as their guest because of my devotion to this great movie. I truly love, love, love this movie. It just blows me away that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon learned to sing and play along with their phenomenal acting to bring Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash to the screen. Each time I saw WTL, I enjoyed more than the last time. The superb acting by all the cast (especially Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon)deserves Oscar nominations and wins without a doubt. I was so thrilled they won Golden Globe Awards for best actor and actress and best movie and HOPE they are awarded deserving Oscars come March 5th. Jim Mangold did a wonderful job telling this very soul-touching story and I feel Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were perfectly casted in the roles of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. Joaquin Phoenix has always been a favorite of mine and now, he and Reese Witherspoon together have captured my heart. THEY WERE WONDERFUL! P.S. Also know that the young girl who played Roseanne Cash (Hailey Nelson) will go far as she was most memorable as well. Thank you for allowing me to comment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walk the Line: ***.5* (3.5)'Walk the line' opens in the dull and drab atmosphere outside Folsom Prison. A faint echo of music cuts through the air barely recognizable. We move inside and see the band play while Johnny Cash (Jaoquin Pheonix) runs his fingers along a saw blade. This sets the tone for the rest of the movie as we flash back to Johnny's childhood, and then move forward until we catch up with the beginning. Pheonix captures perfectly the spirit of Johnny Cash. This should be no surprise as Cash chose Phoenix to play the role in the first place. As a child we hear Johnny listening to the Carters on his radio, quizzing his older brother Jack on which Carter is singing. "Thats June" says Johnny. And, as we all know, Johnny meets June and is immediately smitten with her, if not in love with her. June Carter is played by Reese Witherspoon in what is far and away her best role yet, and possibly ever. That is just how good she is in this film. Phoenix also does some of his best work here, but its no surprise as he is a wonderful actor. Whats is surprising though, is that both Phoenix and Witherspoon sing every song. And they absolutely nailed it. That is part of the mystique of their performances. It is one thing to nail your character, its another to nail their songs. And, boy, do they nail their characters. Last years big music movie was 'Ray' which garnered a lot of attention for Jamie Foxx. Phoenix far and away out does him here. Watching 'Ray' I saw Jamie Foxx playing Ray Charles. In 'Walk the Line' I saw Johnny Cash on film. While both 'Ray' and 'Walk the line' are fairly conventional, 'Line' is definitely the better movie. Walk the Line overcomes its conventionality with spot on performances from Phoenix and Witherspoon. Its a conventional film without seeming so. The concert scenes are fantastic, whether you're a cash fan or not. This movie sweeps you off your feet and into the life of one of the greatest music icons of all time. 'Walk the Line' walks a fine line and never over steps it. This is one of the funnest movies of the year for sure, especially if you love Johnny Cash's music. 8.5/10</fullReview>

I am a "rockaholic," for lack of a better word, and was never a big fan of classic, early country . . . ANY country really, before I saw this film. But whether you knew his music or not, this film definitely spoke many truths to any aspiring musicians out there; any who appreciate all music as a beautiful art, a love that speaks to the masses, a "natural drug" which helps us through rough times . . . and so much more. I'm sorry. I just worship music. It is an amazing thing. Anyway, I hope others who attempt any bio-musician-pictures in the future will model theirs appropriately (in reminder of maintaining their OWN creativity of course) after this well delivered piece. I cannot wait to see a piece which carries similar aesthetics and original portrayal about one of the most legendary musicians, dreamers of humanity ever . . . Mr John Lennon. After twenty-five years on December 8th, I wish someday such a movie will be recognized not because it topped the charts in profit, but raised the awareness and changed the hearts John tried so hard to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"WALK THE LINE"(2005) Johnny Cash personally picked Joaquin Phoenix to play his character for this movie as did June Carter Cash when she selected Reese Witherspoon to play her character before they both passed away about two years ago. Their choices were both wise decisions as neither Phoenix nor Witherspoon disappoint in this film. Quite to the contrary, their performances are so perfectly nuanced that they both look and sound just like the real singers.There is a lot of great singing in this film along with a rather sweet tale about bad boy Cash finally getting June Carter to become his wife. Cash was tormented for years by the demons of booze and pills besides being married to another woman during the time he fell in love with June. Carter wasn't in much better shape with two failed marriages behind her and Cash offering little hope for marital stability. Their on again, off again relationship in both their singing and in their work before their eventual marriage forms the foundation for this film.I will gladly admit to the astounding verisimilitude of their acting and their singing. Phoenix and Witherspoon become Cash and Carter. Their singing, while not quite up to the caliber of the originals, certainly passes muster. If you close your eyes and don't think about it too much, you would easily believe that you are listening to the real Johnny Cash and the real June Carter. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon clicked with me both as actors and performers. This is a very well done movie.Grade: A-, Recommended?

		<fullReview>I have loved Johnny Cash's music from the moment I first heard it in my early teens, (even though I'm in my mid 20's and it's considerably before my generation) so I had a pretty critical attitude walking in to this movie and wasn't expecting to be impressed. Fortunately curiosity kept me from missing this jewel just because I was afraid of seeing a legend's life turned in to the usual Hollywood slop.This movie was accurate and well put together. It moved kind of swiftly especially at first, but this worked well. I honestly wouldn't have minded if it had been longer.(mark of a good movie) But it stuck to the most important events, while still portraying very plainly his state of mind and how he felt from day to day through these periods in his life.The casting of John and June as Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon was almost as incredible as their acting. Reese stole the show as June Carter. Even though the movie is supposed to be about Johnny, June was always the stabilizing force in his life. It's only appropriate then that her character captures the audience as the woman who's strength and friendship pulled his life out of a terminal nose dive.Not that Joaquin Phoenix does a lousy Johnny Cash. I am not exaggerating when I say that a time or two towards the end, when he was on stage singing a classic J.C. Song, I could swear they were using old footage of the REAL man in black! Not just because of his looks or acting, but his voice. Both actors did flawless jobs with the singing, and even though I know it's fact I can hardly believe that they didn't lip-sync.The development of the romance wasn't sappy or hokey but very real instead. The whole story is real, moving, gritty, funny at times and harsh at others, but always very real, straight forward and easy to identify with, exactly like Johnny Cash's music. I haven't seen a movie this good in a long time and probably won't again for some time to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surely deserves Academy Award consideration!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon make this a wonderful movie. They are equally superb. The story is also quite riveting as it covers the life of Johnny Cash including much of the dark side of his life. Both actors sing wonderfully and it is very much worthy of Academy Award consideration for the Movie and each of the lead actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid, well-made film about the life and times of Johnny Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Walk the Line' tells the story of music legend Johnny Cash and his journey to becoming a popular country rock icon. The film stars Joaquin Phoenix as The Man in Black and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, who Cash desperately tries to marry many times. Director James Mangold ('Girl, Interrupted') tells the story of 'Walk the Line' through flashback initially then moves into "present" time. The film shows Cash as a young boy growing up in a farm in Arkansas. His father (Robert Patrick) is tough on him, but seems to hold more love towards his brother Jack. Unfortunately there is a bizarre saw-blade accident and Jack is killed. This incident is shown to scare Cash as the responsibility for the death is blamed on him. After joining the Air Force and serving in Germany Cash moves into a house with Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) and has two kids. After an unsuccessful stint as a salesman, he goes into music and is sharply elevated to fame. This is where he meets June Carter, the woman who he falls in love with although it causes a problem for his marriage. The rest of 'Walk the Line' covers Cash going to places like Folsom Prison, singing his songs to large audiences, and doing several duets with Carter.Employing emotionally raw scenes, Mangold attempts to tell Cash's story honestly but not without heart. The screeenplay, based on Cash's autobiography, weaves together a narrative about Cash as a man who got into trouble his fair share but was ultimately honest with himself and who didn't care what other people thought. The screenplay is simple enough - it shows cause and effect and develops the relationship between Cash and Carter well. One can tell Mangold put his heart into the project and very much cares about the subject matter. His direction, too, is solid but nothing spectacular. In terms of technical elements 'Walk the Line' is richly edited and well shot. Even though the film is well made it's not quite great. As much as it tries to cover Cash's life, Mangold doesn't cover everything and the ending feels abrupt. The performances are very strong from both leads although the supporting cast is forgotten about, unlike 'Ray'. It doesn't delve deep into the material but covers things too simply. Overall, 'Walk the Line' is a good biopic for anyone interested in Cash or music but it never gets to the level of great.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Witherspoon Complements an Evocative Phoenix in Real-Life Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is most intriguing about the new Johnny Cash biopic is how Joaquin Phoenix does more of an impressionistic take on the Man in Black rather than the dead-on impersonation that Jaime Foxx did as Ray Charles, or going further back, that Gary Busey did as Buddy Holly. Although Phoenix lacks Cash's craggy features and full-throated delivery, there is enough resemblance vocally and physically for him to get away with it. Moreover, what Phoenix does very well is get under the skin of Cash's psyche through sheer intensity in director James Mangold's 2005 film. When he performs onstage, it is not so much the musicality that gets you but the often scary glare he gives as a tortured soul. Whether destroying a dressing room or feeling ill-at-ease with his stoic parents, it's a powerfully unrelenting performance that evokes Cash's spirit, albeit one that is sometimes too off-putting and humorless over the course of a 136-minute film.Recent biopics seem to be following similar dramatic patterns. Especially in the early going, the movie bears a striking resemblance to "Ray" in treatment - a rural childhood, a demanding parent, a transformative childhood trauma, adultery, drug addiction. However, to Mangold's and co-writer Gill Dennis's credit, he does not go back and forth to Cash's childhood to make us understand his pain. Instead, he deals with it succinctly upfront and uses the periodic reappearance of his parents as the emotional link. The other aspect that works in the film's favor is the love story at the core. Cash's incessant, decade-long yearning for June Carter provides the spark of the film.Reese Witherspoon takes advantage of portraying a real-life character less recognizable than Cash and inhabits June with an obviously deep empathy and an authentically Southern-fried sensibility. What remains consistent from her most recent films, for instance, her anachronistic Becky Sharp in "Vanity Fair" or her overachieving half-spirit in "Just Like Heaven", are the fierce intelligence and iron will that seem to be her growing trademarks. She also easily brings out June's natural kinship with performing (not only singing but comedy bits and playing the autoharp), and her duets with Phoenix onstage, especially "Jackson", are among the movie's best moments. Casting a fishing reel with aplomb or facing her Christian guilt over the first divorce, she brings a natural goodwill that's completely convincing. As the love story moves toward resolution with a family intervention and a romantic onstage moment, it's really Witherspoon's no-nonsense nurturing that attracts our attention more than Phoenix's doleful responses.It's always a risky decision to go with the singing voices of the real-life performers or the actors portraying them. Some voices are so recognizable as to defy impersonation (e.g., using Ray Charles' original tracks in "Ray"). Neither Phoenix nor Witherspoon sang or performed musical instruments before being cast, but they bring such a great sense of showmanship that their vocal deficiencies simply don't matter. Credit needs to go to T. Bone Burnett for training them so well for six months. There are also terrific scenes with Cash interacting other legendary figures like Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, the latter played with fiery mischief by Waylon Malloy Payne.The movie has a solid supporting cast even if some of the roles falter toward stereotype, for instance, Robert Patrick simmering near a boil as Cash's cold father, country singer Shelby Lynne looking and acting dour as his psalm-singing mother, and especially Ginnifer Goodwin, who has to play Cash's first wife Vivian as a small-minded shrew. Like all-fact-based movies, the movie can also feel episodic, and it does sag somewhat in the middle as the film belabors Cash's amphetamine addiction. Regardless, even if you are not a fan of Cash or the Carter family, this is still fine Hollywood film-making with two actors going at their roles with real brio and Witherspoon, in particular, getting to the real heart of the story with conviction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great psychologically; Great musically.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist and get annoyed when psychological and family dynamics are inaccurately portrayed; I was not annoyed. I do NOT normally like country music.Movies, with their time and development constraints, can only explicate one (maybe one and a half) characters. In this case, they did a great job on Johnny. His early closeness with his brother, the effects of his alcoholic father and his complex, changing relationship with him, his burdens and attempts to escape from those, are quite realistically portrayed in the film.What there was not time enough to portray was what motivated June Carter Cash. In a way, she seems the more remarkable person.GREAT movie!! LOVED the music!! The performance of Joachim Phoenix was absolutely at the highest while that of Reese Witherspoon was maybe slightly above that. Great chemistry between them.This HAS to be an Oscar winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last year, us moviegoers were given a biopic about one famous music legend by the name of Ray Charles. Jamie Foxx did commendable work as Mr. Charles. A year later, Hollywood did it again, this time with country legend Johnny Cash. Were they able to pull it off? Absolutely.Joaquin Phoenix is at his pivotal acting peak as Johnny Cash. People have said it too many times, but I need to remind everyone reading this that his performance deserves the Best Actor Oscar.The film takes us from Johnny's childhood, filled with horror, to some of his finest live performances, and through his difficulty abstaining from his drug addiction along the way.Along with Reese Witherspoon's stirring portrayal of a sometimes confused and outreaching June Carter, "Walk the Line" is just what movie goers are looking for. If you haven't seen it yet, see it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joaquin Phoenix plays the role of Johnny Cash excellently. Phoenix displays exact characteristics, with absolutely no flaws. Reese Witherspoon plays the role of June Carter Cash excellently, if not more excellent that Phoenix.This film has proved that Hollywood can bring stories to life without adding special effects. Although Walk the Line does not contain any special effects, it is still captivating by the story it tells.Young Cash experiences hard life when his elder brother is killed in a mill accident. He also experiences abuse...physically and mentally. His father continuously tells Cash that he is "nothing", and that as long as he considers music as his future, he will remain "nothing".June Carter Cash, played by amazing actress Reese Witherspoon, follows Cash in almost every way she can. She helps him through his deepest hear aches, and helps him fight his infamous addictions.Through bad times and good, J.R. Cash and June C. Cash stick together, and don't let go of each other until the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, nothing is perfect, but this movie comes about as close as any. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the music, especially considering I really don't like Country music. I've never been a big fan of Johnny Cash, and I honestly don't know if I'd heard of June Carter before this movie. So, with all that said, I was surprised by the amazingly good performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. I even like some of their song version better than the originals. I had admired the acting of Reese and Joaquin in other movies, and with this movie am convinced that they are both deserving of Oscar nominations in my very humble opinion. Of course much credit has to be given to T. Bone Burnet and James Mangold for bringing out a story that looks, sounds and feels real. A rare thing with today's formulaic Hollywood films. As a bonus, it was clean enough that I felt fine taking my 12 year old son, who is now a JR Cash fan... Go see it, and hopefully this film will be rewarded in March, if we ever hope to see more fine films like this made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably not the movie for anyone born after 1975, but for those who remember the Johnny Cash era - it was brilliantly acted and directed. Got to be the best movie I have seen in the last 10 years. They got just about everything right,the feel of the period, the wardrobe, the music and the wonderful casting. Sorry to see they missed out 'Boy named Sue' in the prison concert but then again perhaps they didn't and it ended up on the cutting room floor. The performances by Reece Witherspoon and Phoenix were as powerful as any I have seen in recent years and the decision for them to actually take on the singing roles proved to be masterful. Was pleased to see that Phoenix captured the 'moody' side of Johnny Cash and even his body lean when on stage. This movie has Academy Awards written all over it.</fullReview>

The most telling thing about this movie for me was that I was fortunate enough to see Johnny Cssh and June at the Merrit Mountain Music Festival some years ago. I remember thinking I really wasn't that big a fan and did I really want to see him? Boy, was I glad I went! When he came out said that famous intro, "hello. I'm Johnny Cash", well, the crowd went nuts and I got chills up my spine. When Phoenix said the line, I got the same chills. Talk about a "bang on" performance.And Reece, well, one rarely falls in love with a character on screen, but she had me from the start. She had it all - the looks, the humor, the feisty girl, and the singing - wow! They brought a fresh new joy to all of the music and I was left wanting more. As a former musician, for me the director caught the excitement of "making it" to a tee. When the movie ended, somewhat abruptly, I was left wishing there was another hour of seeing these two great, truly talented performers, keep singing and wowing me. I can't wait to buy it and play it over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walk the Line was a great bio pic that let's us all see into the life of the mysterious man in black. Joaquin Phoenix gave a great performance, but I'm not convinced it's worthy of an Oscar nomination. I felt, at times that he was trying to hard to act 'mysterious'. Joaquin was never 'lost' in the role, I saw mannerisms and facial expressions that I've seen in his other movies. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing, but Jamie Foxx played a far more convincing Ray Charles than Joaquin did of Johnny Cash. Reese Witherspoon, on the other hand, stole the show and deserves a nomination for her role as June Carter. She was very convincing as the quick witted country singer. Reese has played many good roles in the past, but none more believable than this.Definitely see the movie if you are even the slightest bit into Johnny Cash. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the last two years Hollywood has given us many good movies like Good night and good luck, Brokeback mountain, Syriana, King Kong , The constant gardener, Crash, Star wars, Capote etc. but no one of these movies beats Walk the line.Walk the line tells the true story about country-rock singer Johnny Cash life with such style and elegance that it make it one of my favourite movies.The movie follows Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) from he is a little boy, his first wife, his first record, his drug addiction, up to his marriage with singer and comedian June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).The movie features INCREDIBLE performances by Joaquin and Reese. They also sing the songs too. Joaquin does a really good job of portraiting Johnny Cash. But it is Reese that steals the show in this movie. She's not just beautiful, she really outdo herself in this movie. Ginnifer Goodwin, Robert Patrick, Dallas Roberts, Dan John Miller, Larry Bagby and Shelby Lynne also does good acting.The movie is directed by James Mangold, the man behind Girl, interrupted and Identity. James does a really good job of putting Johnny's life to the big screen.The script is also good. With good dialog and good story.I recommend this movie for everyone that likes good movies.</fullReview>

The songs brought back my childhood memories when we had a 8 track Learjet in the 1963 Caddy. (which Johnny owned in the movie) T-Bone did a great job on the songs and I would see it again just to hear the music, as I don't watch a movie more than once in most cases.I don't cry often watching movies but this one was a tear jerker for me. The last time a movie made me weep was when I watched The Notebook...(another story) Joaquin Phoenix also was very convincing as Johnny Cash, and also was a good pick to play the part! I was glad to see he made peace with his dad at the end....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nicely romance-coated biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be fair, I never looked forward to seeing this and even less so when I heard that Joaquin Phoenix would substitute ALL of Johnny Cash's singing with his own. And Reese "cookie cluster" Witherspoon would star in it. It all just sounded like the brutal butchery of a rockin' legend to me. But when I saw it a while ago, it blew me and all my negative hype away.The reason Walk the Line works so much better than most biopics is because its focus is a love story and not the birth of a music legend. Attempts to only portray the latter rarely result in good films for some reason (Ray), but here we have a very sweet and compelling romance at the heart of this film.While Walk the Line has a chronological approach to the story it tells, the first scene in the film features a Johnny Cash at the height of his career, just about to go on stage. It then zooms in on Cash's childhood as he remembers it and details the events that shaped him into a rock/country legend. The film supposedly stays fairly accurate to the events in the life of the late Johnny Cash but expect one or two scenes with the typical creamy Hollywood coating.What is amazing is that Reese Witherspoon has shed her cheesecake image and gives a truly Oscar-worthy performance as Cash's love interest June Carter. There are times when Joaquin Phoenix as Cash feels too wooden and stale, but he generally acts with conviction and Johnny Cash was a man of few words so perhaps the man himself also came across as wooden at times. The singing is fantastic and Phoenix brings his own Cash-like voice to the songs.This is a great film, although not very memorable. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the good movies are playing in Orlando, and I really don't like driving in there due to the traffic and the time, so I generally wait until I can get them on Video.Last night I watched "Walk the Line" with Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. Reese won so many awards for her performance that it probably got embarrassing accepting them. She probably had to build a new wing on her house to store them. Joaquin did win a Golden Globe, but that was it. I liked him better as the evil Commodus in "Gladiator." Reese was absolutely outstanding, as I knew she would be. I really haven't liked the films she has done before this, but I always liked her acting. It really made the film worth watching.Having said that, I must say that you have seen it all before - music star gets hooked on drugs and alcohol and is saved by an angel. Well, not entirely. I had no idea that Johnny Cash sang alongside Elvis, the Killer, and Carl Perkins. They all toured together in the 50's. This film is about Cash's early years - up to the time he married June Carter - and he was definitely rockabilly - no country at all. In that respect, it was very interesting, and I will watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk the Thin Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched and enjoyed this movie at home, from DVD. But, while watching, I was glad I had not seen it in the theater. Frankly, it was simply not captivating enough to hold my attention. This is odd, because in the true and larger sense of the word, I am a lifelong Johnny Cash fan, a FANATIC! The thin-voiced spastically moving performer depicted here would not have made a fanatic of me or anyone. Since Phoenix can't get believability when the character is on stage performing, he is bound to make Cash an uninteresting clod off stage. Nothing of the very special nature of Cash's talent comes through.The audition scene was embarrassing. No record producer would indulge this garage band singer another note after hearing him hack up the gospel songs he'd sung all his life. How do you make a mega-star like Johnny Cash seem to be a trivial jerk? Apparently, you hire Joachin Phoenix to play him. How do you make a lifetime of music seem a silly mistake? You get Phoenix to sing it.All this disappointment with Cash helps to point out the extremely high quality performance of Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. Her accents, manner, presence, and yes, her singing all add up to a boffo tour de force that even further diminishes Phoenix's futile attempt ape the icon.Dabbling with Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, and mentioning Bob Dylan all fail to validate this actor's attempt at showing Cash in his natural origins. We never get to know the real man. And Phoenix sees to it that we don't even want to. I just hope those who are not familiar with the real Johnny go out and listen to the real stuff. 'Cause if they don't, and this is all they see and hear, they'll wonder what all the fuss was about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We went to see the film "Walk The Line" to hear the music, but were smitten by the acting of Joaquin and Reece - they WERE Johnny Cash and June Carter. We never realised the love story between the two and it was amazing. It really captured the era, and brought the 1950s and 60s to life. What amazing people they were, and their love for one another was the overriding message in the film - no one anywhere could come between them - they were one! We had to go back and see the film again, and since then have bought the CD of the film and three other Johnny Cash/June Carter CDs. We are eagerly awaiting the release of the DVD in May 2006.

I did listen to Johnny Cash before I saw Walk The Line, and I knew generally about his life - but not in that much detail. When I watched the film though, it almost swallowed me up. It completely hypnostised me. It takes you into a world of music and drama that you will find difficult to tear yourself away from. When the credits started rolling I really did want to sit there again and watch it for a second time. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely amazing as Johnny Cash and I can't find a single floor in his performance. Then there is Reese Witherspoon, who again plays an unbelievably convincing role as June Carter. Both actors have a chemistry which makes the film that bit more wonderful. I very rarely watch a film and say "My gosh, that was so good" at the end of it; but at the end of that I could only say praise about this truly excellent film. It's a shame that Johnny and June couldn't be around to see this amazing film of their lives - because they would be so proud of it. If you want to see a film that will touch your heart, and make you truly believe that Johnny Cash's music is the best of its type - just watch this film and you will fall him love with it. Brilliant movie, amazing actors - definitely a must see.</fullReview>

I loved the movie and feel I got to know Johnny Cash through Joaquin's performance without knowing too much about Johnny Cash before. I've always loved Joaquin before but after this movie you know you will see an awesome movie if he is in it. He really puts his heart into his work. Congrats to Reese who I also love but the movie would not have been what it is without Joaquin. Reese also did an awesome job and you will love her in it as you always love her in her movies. Walk the Line will have you crying, laughing and whether you want to or not you have to dance and just completely enjoy yourself. Get ready for a movie to add to your personal favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow.I have just seen this film, and I was completely blown away. Walk the Line is an electrifying love story that draws you in all the way; and by the end leaves you wanting more.Joaquin Phoenix gives a quite outstanding performance, which was perhaps underrated in terms of awards due to other strong male performances. He inhabits the part of Johnny Cash fully, and gives more than just an impression of the man in black. He has an incredibly powerful screen presence, and handles Cash's addiction problems well, creating a convincing portrayal of a man trying to find his place in the world, and trying to convince the love o his life to marry him.For me, Reese Witherspoon was the revelation of the film. I've always admired her expressiveness as an actress, but this film was the first time where that has really translated into creating a realistic screen character. The part of the feisty June Carter suits her perfectly, and she sparkles every moment on screen. Her Oscar was thoroughly deserved.I think that James Mangold made absolutely the right decision in allowing the actors to so their own singing. Reese has a gorgeous, rich voice; and together with Joaquin the singing helps to lift the film off the screen, and the moments that make this film truly special are when the two leads share the stage together. The performance scenes are pure magic, and they help to lift the film from good to great.Phoenix and Witherpoon have incredible chemistry together, and when on screen and especially on stage they sizzle together. The chemistry of the two leads really allows the audience to invest in the characters, and see their love story as something more than just another formulaic story for the screen. We can really believe the fact that it was a true story.Even if you're not the greatest fan of musical films (my mother is notorious for hating them, but she loved this) then this film is sill well worth seeing. You don't even have to know much about Carter and Cash to enjoy the film - although by the end you'll definitely feel compelled to go and find out more about them.Walk the Line is a wonderful, absorbing film that hooks you right in from the moment Phoenix and Witherspoon hit the screen together right until the end of the film. Go and see it for two extraordinary performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is time I ever enjoyed a film so much I felt the need to comment somewhere publicly.The film was subtly observed, extremely moving and, above all, inspiring. The portrayal of a man's near destruction by the demons of guilt and addiction, and his eventual rescue by the power of love and determination gives us all hope.Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix were phenomenal - giving masterful, heartfelt and totally authentic performances. They completely re-created the essence of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash without ever making you feel that you were witnessing imitation. I felt that they were wholly the characters and wholly themselves - the highest compliment you can give an actor.I haven't seen Capote yet, but, in any other year, Phoenix would have grabbed the trophy.Big kudos to Mangold too, for the sensitivity in which he told the story and his ability to pull these performances from the whole cast. It was beautifully framed and never at any moment one bit sappy.Finally, T Bone Burnett deserves massive praise for his uncanny ability to re-create one of the most exciting times in music ever. Right down the list, every note rang true, with Cash &amp; Carter, Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and the rest brought to life for us. I feel like I was there to see and hear it all for the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece that should never be forgotten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a big Johnny Cash fan, in fact I never listened to his music until now (not of choice, just never was interested). So understand I watched this movie with an unknowing eye.My good friend is a big Cash fan and said the movie is amazing. Truth is I only rented it because of the nominations and wins it received. Joaquin Phoenix is excellent, his best performance yet. The same for Reese Witherspoon. The work and talent put into this film is incredible (especially since they really do sing the songs and play the instruments). I don't know much about Mr. Cash but I'm pretty sure Mr. Phoenix did a damn good job letting me know about him.The movie is very subtle, no action, for those who don't care much about acting or story, then this can be very boring. It's a little over 2 hours long and it kept me glued to my seat the whole time. Some of the songs are excellent (I downloaded most of them), the voices they used to sing are very good too. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman won the award for Best Actor this year, I think Mr. Phoenix should have gotten to split it with him. Problem is that they're two very different performances.The story caught me very well, from beginning to finish. An excellent travel through the life of someone starting out fresh and getting to their prime. Phoenix did an perfect portrayal of someone addicted to drugs. There's nothing else to say really, except this movie wowed me. I'm definitely buying it. Should be in the Top 250 here on IMDb.So if you're thinking about it, you should Walk The Line (bad pun, I know) to the video store and at least rent it.</fullReview>

This film doesn't glorify Cash Its not a depiction of a glamorous life style, it shows all the hard times he had,without the poor me feeling you get in some life stories Jaoquin Pheonix, in my opinion has never done a bad film, he is known for his roles in Buffalo Soldiers and Quills but who knew that he could transform into this character of Johnny Cash and "bring it home" Pheonix is quoted saying The reason I keep making movies is I hate the last thing I did. I'm trying to rectify my wrongs." Well Mr Pheonix,relax you've done the best! All in all this is a great film and i cant fault it I've seen it over 20 times ( i work in a cinema)and am still loving every second</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joaquin is Johnny Cash "The Man In Black"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, I got to tell you how much I loved watching this movie. I enjoyed every minute of it, from the very beginning until the very end, I actually enjoyed it so much that I didn't want this movie to end. Joaquin Phoenix portrays Johnny Cash a country music singer/songwriter who is a legend, he was known as "The Man In Black" because that's all he wore, was black clothing. Reese Witherspoon portrays Johnny's wife, June Carter-Cash. I got to tell you I loved Reese in this movie, and was very, very proud to see her get the Oscar. This movie was very well acted, and the singing sensational. I've seen a couple of movies where the film is based on a singer/band, but this one tops the charts in my book. I love Joaquin and he's a really really good actor, and he's also a very good singer. However, I was a little upset that my favourite song by Johnny Cash wasn't featured in the movie, "A Boy Named Sue", but I guess he wrote so many damn good songs, they can't fit them all. I gave this movie a 10, the only thing that I found wrong was that I never got to see Mr. Cash live. That would've been a great show, but heres hoping Joaquin and Reese do a tribute, because if they did, I would pay any price to go see them sing. Watch "Walk The Line" it's a great movie, filled with great songs and lot's of sensational acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To anyone who has not seen this movie....GO GO GO!! One of the best performances I have seen. Joaquin Phoenix, gave an amazing performance as Johnny Cash. I am amazed at how great his voice was and impressed at all the effort that went into this movie. I have not followed his career, but I can say for sure he gave a stellar performance. An actor with such brilliance should be mentioned more than once. I look forward to seeing him in other roles. Reese Witherspoon as well made this movie great. As I am sure you all know by now. She won best actress. This should further her career in more dramatic roles. Direction should also be complimented in this movie. I am so glad that the actors learned how to sing, it made the movie that more real. As well as the other musicians featured in the movie, I am speechless! This will be one of the movies that will go down as being remarkable.</fullReview>

We have watched it about 6 times already. I think that Reese and Joaquin did an excellent job in singing the songs on the movie. I find them getting stuck in my head. I have some CDs with Johnny Cash songs and also duets with June. I find myself listening to them. I also am looking up information on Johnny and June on the internet. My whole family enjoyed this movie. Like I said I was never a Johnny Cash fan, but I think I am now. I purchased the movie with a music CD that had five songs from the movie on it. I am going to now go purchase the soundtrack from the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Walk The Line" is a fine biopic, detailing the rise, rough times and redemption of American music icon, Johnny Cash, and his pursuit and eventual winning of June Carter. Both leads are phenomenal in their roles. Joaquin Phoenix portrays Johnny as he grows from wide eyed country music novice through the early days of recording and touring to his melt down on stage in Las Vegas to his arrest on drug related charges to his his marriage to June, without missing a beat (to use a musical cliché). Reese Witherspoon is a revelation to those of us who've only seen her in bubbly comedy roles, doing an incredible job as June. Also featured in the film are some of the greats of the 50's rock and roll revolution, Elvis, Roy Orbison and Jerry Lee Lewis, who toured with June and Johnny. The concert scenes make you feel like a witness to the performances. This movie is a must see for Johnny Cash/early rock and roll fans. It's a faithful retelling of June and Johnny's courtship. 9 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are superb as Johnny and June.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Walk the Line" is really the Johnny and June story, told with events of their real lives as the backdrop. Although they grew up in different parts, as a young boy of about 10 little JR would listen to little June sing on the radio with the Carter Family, to the objections of JR's father who valued music and singing as zero. So you can say that for Johnny it was love at first listen. Later when he finally met her, they were both married with families, so all they could do was sing together, and they made quite a good team. But Johnny seemed to live his life to be with June, if he couldn't then nothing else seemed to matter.I am old enough to remember Johnny Cash, and remember his popularity and seeing him on TV. I never was much of a fan of his music, or his singing style, but I respected what he did. This movie to me is a great, almost overwhelming, achievement. He may not win the Oscar, but Phoenix delivered an Oscar-caliber performance as Johnny Cash from the time he went off to Germany in the Air Force in 1952, to his getting sober and off drugs in the late 1960s. That he also did all his own singing is even more amazing. While no one can sound just like Cash's unique singing style, Phoenix captured it so well it was almost like seeing Johnny Cash again, not only the voice, but the facial and body mannerisms while singing. I own the DVD, I will watch it multiple times. Joaquin Phoenix was John R. Cash, Reese Witherspoon was June Carter, Ginnifer Goodwin (of recent 'ED' fame) was Johnny's wife Vivian, Robert Patrick (of Terminator 1 and 2 fame) was Johnny's father Ray Cash, the fine country singer Shelby Lynne was Johnny's mother Carrie Cash, and various actors played Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Waylon Jennings, and Roy Orbison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Does Cash...Right and Wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walking the Fine Line between Clever and Stupid By Jayson HarsinFrom "the Man in Black," 1971: Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down, Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town, I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime, But is there because he's a victim of the times.I wear the black for those who never read, Or listened to the words that Jesus said, About the road to happiness through love and charity, Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose, In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes, But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back, Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.Thumbs up and down. I was thoroughly entertained by Walk the Line, James Mangold's attempt to be the first cinematic commentary on the recently deceased Johnny Cash. The acting and singing were superb. T. Bone Burnett's musical production is often mesmerizing. But the narrative arc attracts criticism, particularly the reduction of Cash's life to a quest for June Carter and a kind of Oedipal Complex with his father.Multiple melodramatic devices humanize the legend by making him insecure as a boy and a man. But these devices are captive to a kind of Hollywood love story. The choice to focus on Cash's early life is highly reductive and typical of Hollywood screen formulas. In this story, two major forces seem to propel Cash's early life: a love quest for June Carter, the starlet of royal country ilk, and an Oedipal drive to conquer his father. Both drives are located in his early life. In a sense, this narrative choice makes the film a narrow psychological study.Cash is marked by his humble cotton-picking origins, a harsh father, a close and protective older brother, and his love of early country on the radio, where his love for June Carter begins. The early loss of his brother leaves Cash forever struggling with the trauma of losing his best friend and paternal love. The hardworking but emotionally icy father is resentful that God took his eldest and "best son." "You took the wrong son," he cries in a poignant scene that forever marks young Johnny's future. A refrain that runs through the film is "You look like you're going' to a funeral [,John]." And Cash's response, "Maybe I am" is traced to this original event: his brother's death/funeral. Cash is forever going to his brother's funeral.The other major force propelling Cash's life is his love for June Carter. As children, he and his brother hear the girl's beautiful voice as she sings on the radio with her famous family. There the seed of love is planted. Much of the rest of the film suggests Cash's aimless mistakes in career and marriage are a hapless wandering until he finds his fated soul mate and true love, June Carter. It bears some fairytale trappings, since when Cash gets the girl his problems appear to disappear, few as they are in the film--namely, drugs, insecurity, and oedipal hate towards his father. In Hollywood, apparently, all you need is love.Different viewers will have other things to object to in this portrayal. Historical material of a docu-drama always invites comparisons to "the real thing" and accusations of infidelity to the real. While Cash is hardly portrayed as an angel, his first wife is portrayed as a 1950s uni-dimensional housewife, desiring all the dreamy accoutrements of upward mobility, ever wistfully searching for that irrecoverable Tupperware party. After weakly opposing Cash's dream to live by the sweat of his guitar, she figures out that what she really wants is a family man and the attention that any kind of spouse deserves. The story may not encourage complete sympathy with Cash in his family relations, but as hero of the film, Cash's familial misdemeanors are easily overlooked and his wife is potentially transformed into a shrewish, jealous bore. June Carter, on the other hand, is portrayed as a strong woman, caring yet determined, and able to reconcile her own choices with the judgments of others.Reducing Cash's life to these two major forces, father and love, can be seen as the cost of generic constraints on mass-circulated films with big stars and budgets. Here one should return to Cash's "Man in Black" lyrics, written in 1971. Cash was not a Lee Greenwood; his was a different kind of country music, not easily appropriated by the Republican noise machine. Though he had only had brief stints in jail, he had drug and other problems and identified with those who had transgressed and been punished or who had the misfortune of growing up in cotton fields and without resources many take for granted. The film ends in 1968, and we get an on-screen script that reduces the final 35 years of Cash's life to a footnote: "June and Johnny lived happily ever after." Ah, the pleasure of fairy tale closure. Is that all there was to the Man in Black? No, but that's all this narrative has time for. What would Johnny say?Jayson Harsin February 21, 2006 (slightly longer version at www.pearlsbee4swine.blogspot.com</fullReview>

He brings to the screen the true story of a legend. Not just the good but the bad too. Phoenix and Foxx both became their character. They convince you that your watching the subjects life and not a movie. You feel like your standing at a window watching as this story all unfolds in front of you. The movie moves along very well and dosen't seem to spend to much time on any one aspect but still manages to go in to great detail of his life. If Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best male performance then there is no justice in Hollywood.</fullReview>

The drive a musician has, the pain the loss of a beloved causes, the thrill the love of your life gives you, the difficulties between parents and children. It is all shown in a great performance by great actors. Without being pathetic or cheap melodramatic. I liked the growing of Johnny Cash as a performer. From a young boy who likes to listen to music to someone who tries to write his own songs, starts to play them for himself alone, with others, for small audiences and for enormous crowds. I enjoyed the music and have respect for the performances given in this movie. Not only by Phoenix and Witherspoon but also by other actors.

		<shortDescription>It lingers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that gets you deep inside and lingers in your system for a few days. It reminds us that life is never as you want it to be. We strive for what we think will make us happy but either we don't get it or, if we do, we're miserable anyhow. That's the human condition for you - I suppose you have to expect that from a true life story.There is an excruciatingly strong sense of longing throughout the film, residing mainly within Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Johnny Cash. It begins with Johnny's longing for his (somewhat unbelievable perfect) dead brother, an event which flavours Phoenix's performance throughout the film ? he never loses the vulnerability of the little boy who lost his soul mate brother. Some events live in us forever.The sense of longing continues with Johnny's illicit love for June Carter, played by Reese Witherspoon, which, it seems, may be destined to never reach its conclusion. It's hard to take your eyes off Witherspoon. She's like a delicate china doll magically brought to life for the purpose of bringing joy to all mankind. She plays her role with fluidity and an incredible naturalness. The chemistry between Johnny and June is palpable from their first awkward encounter to the end of the movie.Oh, and the singing's amazing ? I'm thinking of buying a Cash / Carter CD but am wondering if I'll be disappointed with the real thing?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing short on this movie is it could have gone further into their life together. It was tender, painful, loving, real life emotion through addition and the love that is strong enough to break it. It had points to make, viewpoints from all sides of the people involved.It was said when the movie was coming out that Miss Vivian was discredited in this movie. I didn't see it that way at all. I saw her portrayed as a woman who was fighting to save her marriage who was a wonderful mother and wife while her husband was hellbent on finding his dream. Many women have walked in those shoes and I think she was portrayed with utmost respect and at that time of his life, she was probably better without him.But the love story of Johnny and June showed a fire that wouldn't go out and that is what the story was intended to prove -- a lifetime love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Review I wrote for Journalism Class</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon Directed by: James Mangold There are a few great movies that have come out this year, but none compare to Walk the Line, the bio-pic about the legendary country singer Johnny Cash played by Joaquin Phoenix. The film begins with Cash in Folsom Prison getting ready to record his first live record. It then flashes back to 1943 when Cash was eleven listening to the Grand Ole Opry on the radio. He really enjoyed listening to the radio while his elder brother Jack studied the bible and Hymn songs. Cash's father, Ray Cash played by Robert Patrick, wasn't so fond of him listening to the radio. When Jack dies in a tragic accident Johnny is incredibly crushed. When Johnny enters the air force they make him change his name from JR Cash to John Ray. Johnny returns to USA from Germany and marries Vivian Liberto. They had four daughters between the years of 1954 and 1961. In 1966 they divorced and Johnny fell under the spell of drugs and alcohol. It took over his life. In 1968 he marries June Carter played by Reese Witherspoon. This movie had everything that makes a good movie, believable and unforgettable performances, period realistic costumes, Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon and everyone else did their own singing, the sets were stunning the acting was outstanding. The make-up and music were beautifully done. This movie will make you cry, laugh, and will make you sing. It will also leave you talking about it for weeks. Those very things make a movie great. This movie was incredible and people have been talking Oscar about it since it came out, and it was just nominated for three Oscars for Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress. It just won a Golden Globe for best picture, best actor, and best actress in a musical/comedy. No one has ever walked the line like Johnny Cash but the actors in this movie had a lot of talent and chemistry to pull off the love affair between June and Johnny. This movie is by far the greatest and magnificent movie of the year 2005! ~Kenzi Taylor</fullReview>

Reese will never watch Legally Blonde 1 - 2 and say that was a great job. This is because they made a true story an instant classic. Everyone likes watching films about singers, because its cool seeing a film about someone else's life because you don't have to look at your own. This film was really good. I enjoyed it from beginning to finish and all i really have to say is,"But i shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die!"Whoever decides to watch this just think.......It's country and western all the way with good story and brilliant acting.

		<shortDescription>A Powerful, Emotionally Uplifting Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a number of other biopics, "Walk the Line" follows a familiar narrative pattern, the story of a man's fight against his inner demons. Recent examples include "A Beautiful Mind" and, to some extent, "The Aviator" (although Scorsese's film is a complex one and deals with much more than its subject's psychological problems). In this film, Johnny Cash's demons take the form of drug and alcohol abuse, although it is clear that the root of his problems is a lack of love. In the early scenes, we see Cash's childhood as the son of an impoverished Arkansas cotton-farmer, the death of his beloved older brother Jack in a childhood accident, his military service in Germany, his marriage to his sweetheart Viv, and his attempts to earn a living after leaving the forces, before he finally finds success as a musician in the mid fifties. Success, however, came more easily to him than did happiness. Cash's parents, as depicted here, are cold and unloving. In particular his father Ray is portrayed as a sour, morose man, permanently embittered by the loss of his elder son and with an ill-defined grudge against his younger one, for whom he never has a good word to say, even after Johnny has achieved success. Indeed, his son's success seems to make Ray even more bitter. As for his first wife Viv, she comes across in Ginnifer Goodwin's portrayal as not so much an unsympathetic character as a deeply conventional one, the sort of woman who would have been much happier as the wife of an unsuccessful salesman (which Cash briefly was during the early days of their marriage) than of a successful rock star. The turning-point comes when Cash meets the woman who will become the great love of his life, the country singer June Carter, with whom he forms a highly successful double-act. At first, however, this relationship remains purely platonic. June is a divorcée, emotionally scarred by the failure of her marriage, and she has moral scruples about getting romantically involved with a married man. They part, and June marries another man. Even when June re-enters his life several years later, after the breakdown of her second marriage and when Cash's marriage to Viv is over in all but name, they only have a brief sexual relationship because she is too worried by his drug habit to be able to commit herself emotionally to him. With the help of June and her parents, however, Cash is able to overcome his addictions, and they finally marry after he proposes to her on stage in the middle of a concert. (This was, apparently, a true incident). Just as a lack of love caused Cash's emotional problems in the first place, he is able to overcome them with the aid of the love of a good woman. (The love of God may also have had something to do with it; the film emphasises the part played in Cash's rehabilitation by the rediscovery of his Christian faith). I am not particularly knowledgeable about Cash's music, but from what I have heard it seems clear that its main characteristics were his deep, growling voice and a powerful, heartfelt emotional sincerity. (This is brought out in the audition scene where, after Cash and his band have signally failed to impress record company executive Sam Phillips with some tired, second-hand Gospel music, he gets a second chance to show what he can do and produces a powerful rendition of "Folsom Prison Blues"). These are not characteristics that would be easy to counterfeit, so I was both surprised and impressed to learn that Joaquin Phoenix did all his own singing for the film. (My wife, who is a much greater Johnny Cash expert than I am, was even more impressed). Phoenix's acting in this film was just as powerful as his singing; particularly fine was the way he brought out the disastrous effect that Cash's addiction had on his talent. In one scene we see Cash trashing his room and tearing a washbasin off the wall; in another, we see his disastrous attempt at performing while under the influence of drugs.I was equally impressed by Reese Witherspoon's performance as June, especially as I had always tended to dismiss her as a lightweight actress, a perky little blonde girl with a boy's name and a big chin. Now legally brunette, Reese shows here that there is a lot more to her than her "Legally Blonde" airhead persona. June Carter, as portrayed here, comes across as a woman who, despite putting on a similarly dizzy persona as part of her stage act, was actually sensible, practical and caring. (Reese also did all her own singing). The Oscar nominations for the two leading performers are both well-deserved. Of the other performances, those that stood out were Robert Patrick as the bitter, censorious Ray and Dallas Roberts as Phillips. There is plenty of sentiment in "Walk the Line", but it does not drift into sentimentality in the way that some recent films have done. I found it a powerful, emotionally uplifting experience. As I said, I do not know much about Cash's music, but you do not need to in order to appreciate this film, any more than you need to understand John Forbes Nash's mathematical theories in order to enjoy "A Beautiful Mind". 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well dammit - I am not a country music fan and went to see this film kicking and screaming along with my wife - and loved it. The best adjective I can use when describing this film is Power. A powerful storyline with a huge performance by Joaquin Phoenix. To me,a Great Film starts strong from the very beginning...no need for a long build up to the point of entertaining the audience - just get us there quickly and keep us there without any lags or dead spots. This film delivers that with a superb screenplay that starts with his sharecropper childhood but doesn't dwell too long on it to the point of overdoing it. We get a good taste of his hardscrabble early life and the get to see the beginning of his lifelong relationship with his father - which is well continued throughout the film.And yes as other critics have written, this music biopic goes into the usual portrayal of what musicians lives inevitably are like - touring, substance abuse, problems in personal relationships and - hopefully for them - a later life of good personal habits and steady relationships. The fact that so many musicians lives have followed this path, is not the fault of the screenwriter - this too - like Ray Charles - was the life of Johnny Cash as it has been with Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan and ad infinitum numbers of individuals who make their living as recording and performing artists. Phoenix's performance is spot on - both in terms of portraying Cash's on stage persona as well as his personal life and battles with drug addiction. Dammit he becomes Johnny Cash...What more can you say about an actor portraying the life of a performer?Reese Witherspoon is superb in her role as June Carter Cash. Right out of the Legally Blonde mode and into a believable and realistic portrayal of the classic southern country girl who spends a lifetime on the stage... And the hell of it is - apparently both their voices are so good, they could be recording artists in their spare time...Starts strong and never, ever lets up. Go see this sure to be Academy Award winner...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An achievement on and off the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I'd never listened to more than a couple of Johnny Cash songs before seeing this movie - and even then only with half an ear. A lovingly-crafted film, Walk the Line not only got me listening to his music and seeing qualities in it not at first obvious, but impressed me with the way it carries off a difficult undertaking and delivers remarkable performances (especially that of Reese Witherspoon).The image of Johnny Cash seen in the first two thirds of Walk the Line is that of an unredeemed and not awfully likable man, ignoring his wife and child, recording songs with questionable lyrics, and getting involved in drink and drugs with all the attendant ills. He meets fellow singer June Carter (who is also married) and is instantly attracted. Cash's behaviour continues to worsen and he narrowly avoids jail or worse.Many of Cash's songs are written from the depths of despair, by a man with no self-esteem. He dresses in black and seems to succeed against all best advice. Sometimes he is too drunk or drugged to perform. But at one point he recovers enough to read fan mail - much of it from prison inmates. His songs, it seems, have given them hope, a sense that someone understands them. For Cash, there are people who appreciate and love him when it seems no-one else does. He dedicates his efforts.Walk the Line is a film of bad examples and prejudice, but also the possibility that there is a light at the end of the darkest tunnel. Cash's strict father blames him for the death of the other sibling and nothing Cash does can win a single word of praise from his father. Society condemns June Carter for being a divorcée. The whole film is redolent of the evils of straight-laced righteousness and arrogance (ironically, the Christianity that has spawned such attitudes is later embraced). But each individual has their own path to find. Cash's descent into hell was (without his intention) his means of reaching out to others. The legacy is one of which the music scene is appropriately proud.All the songs in the movie are sung live, which might not suit die-hard fans (Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant and convincing though - I had to compare his renderings with the originals afterwards to see the leap in voice quality). But the real discovery is Reese Witherspoon (June Carter) who has found the most charismatic role of her career. When she enters, the screen lights up, and the expressiveness of her face, her perfect characterisation, and the sheer devotion and joy that she brings to the role kept me glued to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic "Channeling" of Cash!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic in this film--it was as if he had "channeled" the incredible Johnny Cash, not acted as him. There was true pain in his eyes when there needed to be, which I guess isn't surprising given some of the things Joaquin has lived through in his own life (the death of his brother, for example).The chemistry between Joaquin and Reese was amazing as well. On stage as well as off, there was intense passion between them--sometimes positive and sometimes negative.Hard to believe, as well, that Joaquin and Reese sang all the songs in the film!To tell the truth, I didn't expect to love "Walk the Line," even though I have immense respect for the "Man in Black." Nor did I expect my very British husband (who isn't a music fan) to enjoy it. However, we both left the cinema raving about it.Worth every penny...I will definitely see it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hate country music . . .but WOW!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film last week with my Dad because we were bored basically, not much else. When I suggested we see Walk the line, he was a bit sceptical mainly because of the Country singing in it.Whilst wating for the film to start the over 60's parade started piling in, and we felt a bit silly sitting there. However once the film got started, I soon forgot about what was happening around me.It is a typical James Mangold film, showing not holding back on any of the characters intensity or passion for what they feel is right. It reminds me of Girl Interrupted (one of his previous films), in which he created such strong characters. He sets the picture of Johnny's life perfectly, and not knowing about Johnny Cash previously it was such a memorable experience. We are let in to Cash's heartbreak as his older brother and idol are taken from his life, and the rejection that he faces from his father. Phoenix is absolutely brilliant at the emotional scenes that would have sunk most other actors. He delivers an understated performance that is just so beautiful and pleasurable to watch.Enter Reese Witherspoon as June Carter: What an incredible performance, and as Oscar worthy a performance, which I have ever seen. Whilst Phoenix's portrayal invites you in to share his life, Resse contrasts this beautifully, leaving Carters feelings relitavely private. The bonding of these two perceived opposites is incredible to watch, how people with different ideals and takes on life, can share such a mutual bond.To top off an already incredible film, the live music scenes are quite simply astounding! The energy and Camera work used, really captivates you. Joaquin and Reeses voices are amazing, and it is hard to think that Reese once considered herself a bad singer.Miss this film at your peril . . .It is absolutely fantastic . . one of the best that I have seen for a long time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare cinematic achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not watch many films. Music moves me in a way that film very rarely, if ever, does. Which is why I took a chance on "Walk the Line;" it is about a musician. I could not have made a better choice. I have never seen a film quite as moving, or absorbing. From the opening scene, to the end of the film, "Walk the Line" gets in your blood, and stays there. Nothing is wasted. Every scene, every word, and every gesture, has meaning and contributes not only to the story, but the tension, and drama as well. As Joaquin Phoenix says at the end of the movie, " ? you gotta pull the string tight," and the film does exactly that. The acting, directing, sound, screenplay, and costume all mesh together to create a whole that far outweighs the sum of the parts. If this film does not make artistic history, it will certainly make cinematic history. There are two reasons why this may very well be the case. One reason is the exceptional construction of the film. One could begin with the sound work, as for example the eerie background music, usually a guitar, that accompanies many scenes. Such background music not only enlarges the particular scene, but lends a surreal resonance that elevates the scene not only visually, but mentally, and emotionally as well. Or, the thick popping of old style camera flashbulbs also enhances the drama of several scenes. And the film editing results in a movie that tends to flow like a river. One scene often begins as the prior scene ends. When John asks June to come back on the tour, " I miss the music," the playing of an auto-harp is heard in the background, and grows louder, as the film transitions to a long shot of her in an out door amphitheater, in front of hundreds, singing her rendition of "Wildwood Flower." The scene, and the song is one of the most captivating in the film. This technique is used throughout. Most importantly however is the exceptional, and innovative cinematography. Normally when actors are filmed on-stage the point of view (POV) is from that of the audience, which is bland not only visually, but emotionally as well. Within "Walk the Line" the POV is largely from that of the actors on-stage while they are singing. Just like the actors on-stage, one is gripped in the spotlights. And the second reason is the acting. Both actors complement each other in a manner that I have rarely if ever seen. Like night, and day neither could exist without the other. How they managed to bring to life Johnny Cash, and June Carter in such an absorbing and convincing manner is beyond me. The plot revolves essentially around his obsession with, or desire for her, and is the string that ties the film together and keeps everything tight. She is without a doubt his salvation. He meets her for the first time back in 1956 in Nashville while performing at the Opry. However, they do not finally marry until 1968. The events of these years, most importantly her attraction to him, and at the same time repulsion (because of his addiction to amphetamines, which he eventually overcomes), make up the bulk of the film, ending with his famous Folsom prison concert. But it is the singing, the sounds these two actors make on-stage that is, I believe, in some ways almost historic. In some cases the renditions these actors produce, either alone, or usually together rivals the original, as for example "Get a Rhythm" by Phoenix, or as already mentioned the very moving "Wildwood Flower" by Witherspoon. Together their best effort in the film may be "Times A Wastin." Lastly, this film cannot be seen just once. The psychology of the two main characters is complex, and there are nuances that inhabit nearly every scene. This film is a rare artistic achievement. And yet for some disturbing reason the film has been overlooked by that astute institution known as the "Academy." Witherspoon, and Phoenix were nominated for Best Actress, and Actor, and the film has also received nominations for Costume, and Editing, but was left out of the Best Film, Best Director, and Best Screenplay categories, and most importantly the Best Cinematography category. The ones that really count. It has been argued that Academy voters opted for films that made some contribution to, or discussion of controversial social subjects as for example, "Brokeback Mountain," (homosexuality), or "Transamerica," (about a pre-op transsexual). I am not sure just how important these subjects really are. Having ones genitals surgically removed, or altered is extreme behavior, and I think most of us are familiar with the subject of homosexuality. Just because a film deals with a controversial sexual subject ("Brokeback Mountain,"), or extreme sexual behavior ("Transamerica,"), why does this fact justify a nomination in any category? And why this infatuation with sexuality on the part of Academy voters? Should a film not have to rise to some level of artistic achievement? If one considers the fact that superb acting cannot be separated from superb directing, and the screenplay, then the voting on the part of Academy members becomes a little absurd. Phoenix himself said to director James Mangold during his acceptance speech at the Golden Globe Awards that half of this (his award), should go to you (Mangold). And if the acting is so good, then why was the film left out of the Best Film category, and again Best Director? Lastly, and considering the innovative cinematography how could Academy voters overlook "Walk the Line" for Best Cenemetogrphy? Leaving this film out of some the more important categories has already generated some criticism, and I hope there is a lot more. The Academy deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who is Johnny Cash?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always thought that Johnny Cash was just a person that was made up and didn't really exist. You can believe my surprise when I was told this movie was about his life.I went to this movie without knowing anything about this man and so I had no expectations. I expected the movie to be a B-movie and just be some boring life story. I was proved wrong.This movie caught my interest from the start and a part from some parts of the movie where the moments passed slowly, it kept my interest till the end. I remember Joaquin Phoenix (like a lot here) from his play as Commodus in the Gladiator. In that movie he already showed that he could act, but in this movie he clearly shows that he is a great actor. I believed him the way he played Johnny Cash.After I walked out of the cinema I knew not only who Johnny Cash was, but the movie made me more curious about the man. This movie showed me the troubled and yet beautiful life this man has lived. This movie made Johnny Cash a legend for me! 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>light on story but the music is excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film follows in the footsteps of other biopics such as 'Ray' in presenting the story of country music's Man in Black, the late, great Johnny Cash, and his on-off friendship/relationship with the wayward daughter of the Carter family, June.As Cash, Joaquin Phoenix is perfect, with facial expressions and vocal technique on target throughout. His performances of iconic songs such as Walk the Line, Ring of Fire, and Jackson, are exciting and perceptive. Reece Witherspoon is much less irritating than usual as the jokey June Carter, and her vocals are excellent as well.The story starts with Cash preparing for his gig at Folsom Prison, where he recorded his best-selling live LP, and takes the form of a flashback to his early life with dad, mum and elder brother in the 1940s. We get some sense of where his roots were and where he wanted to go.With first wife and baby settled in Memphis, Cash heads off to Sun Records where he secures a record deal with the legendary Sam Phillips alongside Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis (both depicted in this film; Tyler Hilton is an OK Elvis, while Waylon Payne is excellent as Jerry Lee). From then on we watch his ascent into stardom and his descent into the grip of drug addiction; all the time shadowed by his faithful friend and singing partner June.The plot wears a little thin but is more than fleshed out by the fabulous musical numbers (filmed with real energy and mostly provided in full), and the central performance of Phoenix.Other notable performances in the cast include Ginnifer Goodwin as Cash's frustrated first wife, Vivian; Shooter Jennings playing his father, Waylon; and Robert Patrick as Ray, the father who can never forgive his younger son for growing up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thoroughly enjoyed this movie! I'm not a Johnny Cash fan, although I've always admired his music. I actually went to see another movie, but chose Walk The Line because it was about to begin, and am I glad I did! Joaquin Phoenix gives a first rate performance that fully deserves the Oscar. He gets into the role so well, you feel you're seeing the movie from Cash's point of view. Added to that is Reese Witherspoons equally splendid performance - both actors manage to give a fully believable performance, which is difficult when portraying well-known characters.The scenes where Cash's older brother dies are chilling - Lucas Till makes Jack such a solid, likable character that his death is really tragic and sad.He and Ridge Canipe build up an excellent relationship early, and each actor must have a promising career ahead. They convey the hardships of that time so well without relying on overkill.Set in the context of changing times, social attitudes, and the pressures of Cash's fame, his family dynamics and his guilt over what happens to his brother, and surrounded by first rate music, this is a movie that deserved recommendation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the movie, and thought Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon perfect actors for this movie. They both played their parts so well, not to mention the songs they sung themselves. As soon as I got out of the theater from seeing the movie, I went and bought the soundtrack. I loved it, but was disappointed to find that the one song I really liked the most "Time's A Wastin", was not on the CD. That song will be a huge hit if Phoenix and Witherspoon decide to record it in its entirety. I really think they should, I know it would top the charts. Anyone that loves country music will truly enjoy this movie. Johnny Cash is a country legend. I never knew his brother's death haunted him most of his life. In fact, I never knew he had an older brother until I seen this movie. Also, never knew his addiction was that bad or that long. I also want to add, the movie really portrayed the deep love Johnny Cash had for June Carter. Never have I seen such a powerful, long-term devotion, and passion for another human being. I think when June finally said "yes" to Johnny's proposal, made him the happiest man alive! He finally got what he wanted and waited for..........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joaquin Phoenix has outdone himself in this performance as Johnny Cash. I was awestruck. True - Phoenix is too good looking to be Cash. But put that aside. His performance was off the charts. I've never seen ANYONE who could actually become the person he was portraying as Phoenix has done in this movie. It's beyond description. I had heard he had done his own singing in the movie, and as I watched I thought to myself, "I must have heard wrong." He doesn't have an "awesome" voice, but then neither did Cash. But take it from me, he can sing! My husband - sitting next to me - whispered, "He must be lip sync-ing." (He was unaware of the fact that Phoenix was supposed to have done his own singing.) The scene where he's at Folsum Prison is absolutely priceless. (Short, but priceless.) Reese Whitherspoon is perfect as the perky June Carter. And her voice is amazing. The evolving of their love affair was played out with such tenderness. I especially appreciated how each detail was created to build upon the next in order to show how Johnny and June were meant for each other. I'm not sure which kept happening more during the movie- my heart swelling with emotions like anger, compassion, and love, or my jaw dropping because of the unbelievable acting If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar for this performance there's something seriously wrong with the Academy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a very pleasant surprise. Although it got good reviews, it was only the lack of something better when my wife and I decided to catch a matinée before going for dinner that got me into the theater to see it.I was never much of a fan of Johnny Cash, who I often described as having a range of half an octave in an unpleasant key. Furthermore, I just did not believe Joaquin Phoenix was the right man for the role. I believe you had to see Cash to appreciate his unique style. "The man in black" looked big and powerful on stage as he held his guitar to his shoulder like a rifle, and when lyrics like, "I killed a man just to watch him die" passed his curled lip while his eyes seemed to dart about the room he could appear somewhat menacing. I didn't think Phoenix could convey that image.I was wrong. In the Folsom Prison scene, when Phoenix yanked the guitar to his shoulder and curled his lip as he poured forth the lyrics, the darting eyes had a look of madness in them. I felt a chill run down my spine ? it was as if Cash himself had taken over the actor's body. I actually felt as if I were watching the real Johnny Cash. I have never seen an actor actually become the real-life character he was playing the way Phoenix did. It was an Academy Award performance.Reese Witherspoon handled the June Carter role quite well. She conveyed the spirit quite well, although I don't think anyone ever had the energy and warmth in her comedy that Ms. Carter did. Think Minnie Pearl on speed.Cash is not portrayed as a sympathetic character. He was a self-centered man who could be downright mean. Of course, those characteristics are not exactly rare among big-time entertainers. What makes the story interesting is June Carter's unwillingness to marry him, in spite of her obvious love for him. She made him wait until he knew she could live without him if could not return that love and be faithful to her. Possibly, for the first time in his life he came to value someone else as much as he valued himself. It seemed to work and Cash, along with June Carter Cash, went on to a great career, and reportedly, a good life with the woman he loved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie this afternoon, hoping but only partially expecting to really enjoy it. I had heard that it was good from a friend, which was the only reason I bothered to go and see it. And... my friend was completely right!This movie depicts the life (and love) of Johnny Cash. His start, his music, his tours, his dependency on pills, and his long time friendship with and love of June Carter. The parts were played played and sung by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. Did someone, or everyone, else know that Reese had such a good voice?? I admit to being rather impressed by her vocal performance in the role. Her acting matched. Witty, intelligent, and real.Joaquin... was pretty fabulous. He has a great voice, and his acting was superb. I can't imagine that was an easy part to play. He did it sometimes disturbingly well, with respect to the drugs.The story is good. It's filmed pretty well. The beginning was a little boring, I thought, but not bad. The end felt very slightly disappointing to me. Wanting *more* is usually a good thing, but this time I think there could have been a little more. I don't know, that's really open to interpretation.I can't say I have ANY idea if the contents of the movie are what *really* happened. I knew next to nothing about Johnny Cash going in. I'd never listened to his music; I wouldn't have thought it was my *thing*. After watching this movie, I am definitely going to have to get some of his albums.I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but was totally worth watching and I'd recommend it. I may even see it again in the theatre.</fullReview>

Ladies and Gentleman, we have a new star and his name is Joaquin Phoenix. His portrayal of Johnny Cash was not acting. This performance was far above acting. The proof is found midway through the film where Johnny Cash sits at the dinner table staring at his father. Without saying a word you can feel exactly what he wants to say just by his look. That is how you do it. Reese Witherspoon gave a wonderful performance and seemed to be on the same level as Joaquin. The next five years are going to be very interesting to see where these two young stars go in their careers. I'm putting my money on Joaquin. Great job guys.</fullReview>

His singing gave me chills - you really can't believe it's him and not a dub of Johnny Cash. His range is astounding, being able to go from high to the really low notes Cash is so famous for - without breaking or sounding sour. You walk out of the movie knowing that he's the Oscar winner this year - there can be no question. And Reese... that girl just continues to build herself in my eyes as one of the great actresses of our time. For those who think all she's good for is eye candy or a romantic comedy, you are dead wrong. And in my opinion, her singing was even better than the woman she portrayed. This was an explosive relationship, and the two of them pulled it off perfectly.</fullReview>

I had seen the movie previews on TV and was prepared to hate it because anyone could see that Joaquin Phoenix was no Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon did not remind one of June Carter.I was very pleasantly surprised. Joaquin did his homework. While he doesn't look like Johnny or sing exactly the same or move the same way, he somehow captured the essence. Reese did a very good job of capturing June's behaviors. At times during the movies I felt I was watching Johnny and June instead of two actors. I know it sounds silly, but when John proposed to June and she was taking her time answering, I found myself totally caught up in the moment, urging her to say "yes".

		<shortDescription>Johnny Cash is Worth Your Time &amp; Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Walk the Line" Opened this Weekend with TOO Much Hype to be a Good Movie, Right?Fellow Film Buffs (FBs), Nothing tires me more than going to a much anticipated box office opener only to be fooled by the "Hype", leaving the theatre disappointed because I wasted $12 and 2 hours of my limited free time. I'm going to share with you the "Three Realities of Movie Hype", and whether "Walk the Line" is worth your time and money (without revealing too much)."The Three Realities of Movie Hype"1) The BUZZ: Come on, of course this movie is going to be hyped; it's a movie about the legendary Johnny Cash! I mean, even after he died he won the "2002 Grammy for Best Country Album". Honestly, I am not a fan of Johnny Cash, I never liked his music, nor do I like Country Music, but the guy is legendary, so I was curious. As a result of the Johnny Cash "Hype", I saw Joaquin Phoenix every where, on countless magazine covers, billboards &amp; ads, and TV shows including Oprah. I heard three things about "Walk the Line": i) Was Joaquin Phoenix 'too wimpy' to play the gritty Johnny Cash? ii) Forget learning how to play the "Ghee-Tar" Joaquin Phoenix took 6 weeks 'just' to learn how to hold the guitar properly - ya right, "Ree-Tar-Did". iii) Joaquin (pronounced "WAA-keen") is quitting acting for life after this film because he wants a real life. Maybe because it's of his highest paycheck yet (a salary of 3.5 million dollars). Sadly, nobody wants to see this fine actor go.2) The TRAILER: After watching the trailer, I could just hear the evil Producers voice say "That's right, and even if this movie sucks, we're still going to get millions of Johnny Cash fans to the movie and buying the soundtrack?

Come on, Reese "Legally Blonde 2", why? Joaquin on the other hand is "the man", his "real" performances leave you wanting more: "Signs", "The Village", and "Gladiator" are all sensationally acted.WINNER or BLUFF*?"Walk the Line" is a Winner! Go see this movie because Joaquin delivers, this is Reese's best movie ever, and perhaps, like me (a hater of country music), you too will find yourself thumping your feet to the music.*Unfortunately, all adequately 'Hyped' movies win their money back and more? we're the only ones who lose our precious time and money.Film Buffing by JP Richards"Taking the risk out of going to hyped movies."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THAT was Reese Witherspoon? WOW!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a longtime Witherspoon fan since "Legally Blonde" but in this movie I forgot that was her as June Carter. I had heard that Joaquin Phoenix did his own singing as Johnny Cash--which was very good, I'm a longtime Cash fan--but I hadn't known that Witherspoon would do her own singing as Catter which was equally good, and I was watching the credits at the end thinking, "Who WAS that?" Story did drag a little at times but was true to that part of their lives as I am familiar with it--and yes, Cash was indeed that self-destructive, and Carter was that much a part of his survival. As much as a story of rags to riches, this is a story of love and redemption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's life and Energy Transcends Forumlaic Structure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's strange that someone as unique and original as Johnny Cash would have a movie made about his life that is so formulaic-it was almost scene for scene the same outline as Ray. However, Mangold does something here that most Bio-pic's don't. He narrows the subject matter down to two plot lines, often ignoring other things that would have been interesting, or cool to put in. At its heart this is a love story-a film about the redemptive power of love, true love, problems and all. At the same time its also a film about redemption in general. This is due in part because of a great script, and incredible performances. Phoenix is amazing as Cash. He is not just impersonating him, but adds a level of depth. Robert Patrick was also surprisingly great as Cash's father. But its Reese Witherspoon who steals the show, mostly because I forgot she could act. While the composition of the film is nothing new, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the editing is great. In fact everything about the film is great technically. However, what makes this such a great film is its energy. There is a life to this film that transcends its formulaic nature, and adds a level of emotion that is more than just from the memory of the man in Black. Mangold, Phoenix, and Witherspoon create complex and beautiful characters that we care about, and love despite their faults. And that is the beauty of Cash's life and the message of this film-that Love, from God, from each other, can save even the worst of us, despite of ourselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mother is a huge country music fan. So, naturally, she wanted to see this movie. Personally, I'm not much of a country music fan ... I liked Alabama ... a little Shaina Twain ... and a little of Toby Keith. I wasn't exactly a "willing" movie goer, but ... I got the shock of my life! "Walk The Line" was an EXCELLENT movie! Let me say that, again. "Walk The Line" was an EXCELLENT movie! I was amazed at how Joaquin mastered Johnny Cash's movements. Reese Witherspoon was equally amazing, especially when they did the duet on "Jackson". Although, I don't remember June ever being THAT CUTE! It must have been before my time.Bottom line: THIS WAS A QUALITY FILM, WITH GREAT TALENT! It was in-depth. Honest. It didn't sugar-coat reality. It handed it to you, and said, "Here! This is how it really was!" Joaquin &amp; Reese sound AWESOME! Few actors &amp; actresses actually have good pipes! These two do! They both deserve, at the least, an Oscar nomination! If you haven't seen it, TREAT YOURSELF! I'm going to spend Thanksgiving hearing my mother say, "I told you so!" But, hey, sometimes mom does know best. THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE TIMES!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not an expert on Johnny Cash, I liked him, but he was before my time. I have been reading about the Carter family for the last couple of years and so was familiar with the story of June and John. Joaquin blew me away and Reese proved that she can act and deserves to be taken seriously. I loved this movie, I would love to hear the two of them comment on this film. They can't have been huge fans either, but for some reason their chemistry makes this work. I recommend it highly. I have heard some of the criticisms, Joaquin is too short, Reese too pretty but I had no trouble believing them as John and June. I wanted to be entertained, not pick something or someone apart and I was entertained, transported even, to their lives. What more should a movie do?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances...okay movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by stating that I am a HUGE Johnny Cash fan and was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I read Johnny's autobiography, so I had a lot of outside knowledge about him and his relationship with June Carter, which is one reason why this movie just didn't do it for me as much as I'd hoped it would. Like all Hollywood biopics, WALK THE LINE glosses over a lot of facts, plays around with chronology, and just leaves out a lot of details that fans like me would have enjoyed seeing. That's not to say that the movie is not any good...the performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon are superb, the set design and costumes were very impressive, and the music, of course, was wonderful...the true flaws lie with the screenplay and the editing. Maybe it's because I'm familiar with the story, but the film seemed a little too hurried to get through all the details of Cash's life in two hours...more time should have been devoted to Cash's outsider status in the country music world and his "man in black" persona, which in this movie seems to take a backseat to his drug addiction and recovery with the help of his true love, June. All in all, the film is played as more of a love story and less of a portrait of a legendary artist, which is what I hoping it would be. Perhaps if the film were longer and had a better director, it could have balanced the many aspects of Cash's fascinating life a little better. All in all, the film was very enjoyable, but I'd be more interested in an extended version with more music.P.S.: I still don't understand why this movie wasn't called "Ring of Fire"...maybe the producers didn't want it to be confused with that dragon movie that came out a few years ago.</fullReview>

Reese is great cast against Joaquin because she is so slight. He is 5'8" and certainly not the height which helped Johnny Cash command his audience. What is Joaquin Phoenix? He is magnificent, gorgeous, and hot, hot, hot. OMG, he manages to look at June/Reese with the adoration that Ewan McGregor gave Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge, except it isn't innocent. It smolders with passion and yearning. Where did he come from? This isn't the little creep from To Die For. This isn't the smarmy creep from Gladiator. This is a complex, brooding, fascinating man that would be worth the trouble to get next to, and trouble he is, in spades. Oh, and the singing? It's fabulous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw both movies opening weekend. I totally was digging Walk the Line. The next day I went to see Harry Potter and I don't read the books but I was expecting things to be explained to me like in the first three. Well I just stared at the screen for two hours. I had no idea what was going on. Two people who read the books talked my ear off about it and it's just not interesting. Plus, I had a terrible time being cramped up by tons of nerds and the nerds got mad when I cut the huge line going in. Old people and adults drop your kids off to see Harry Potter and you can go see Walk the Line. You'll have a much easier time getting in to Walk the Line and not have to stand in a line for two hours and sit for two boobless hours feeling as though you took LSD. The guy who played Johnny was awesome, he is very convincing and plays all the good songs by Johnny. I know for a fact he is going to get best actor of the year because he deserves it. All the actors were good and real. I had a great time and you will too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into the movie theater, I had never even listened to a full song by Johnny Cash. I was interested in the movie because I could tell from the commercials alone that it was Oscar worthy. Not only did I leave with a greater appreciation for the actors, but a new love for Johnny Cash. The man in black lived a rough life behind the scenes, and Joaquin did an excellent job of portraying him. Witherspoon also managed to play a believable June Carter, she brought new life to the role and her voice wasn't half bad either. Overall, this movie was utterly amazing.

		<shortDescription>A Walk in the Thin Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that there always is a previous praise to those films that are biographical, and the main actor/actress should get lofty credits. Well, "Walk the Line" disappointed me. Passing through its slow, boring development, Joaquin Phoenix didn't surprise me. His work was mainly done on rough imitations, but not fonding with the spirit of the character. There is no connection between viewer and spectator, mainly if you are not related nor fan of Johnny Cash. To those like us, the story by Mangold will not deepen us emotionally into his life. Reese Witherspon, on the other side, shines and flows on a river of expos? charm and blossoming emotions. She is an angel. The other part of the cast fails to guide the public through their emotions, and we are puzzled on the real conflict and the real rooted problems. Life is hard, yes. But Cash's Life is not honored in this film, it's copied. Besides the Love Story rendering between Cash and Carter, and the moment where Johnny sings his "Folsom Prison" tune to the agent, there is nothing remarkable within the film."Walk the Line" failed to satisfy me. It lacks a lot of strength, basically. It is stuck into a limbo of entertainment, with a disappointing Phoenix that fails to feel but only impersonates, with the shining of Whiterspoon and a mix of nice, bewitching soundtrack, that are curiously performed by the main couple, Joaquin and Reese. I can give it the current rating comparing it to "Ray", both movies where I didn't know the singers portrayed. One sucked me in and the other left me indifferent. See "Ray" instead, if you're not a die hard of Johnny Cash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and shallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walk the Line is one of those movies that almost everyone likes. So I get labeled as "harsh" and difficult to please. Well, maybe I am but the thing is I do understand why this film was successful and why people enjoyed it. Technically, there's nothing to criticize. Witherspoon as June Carter is riveting, giving the southern twang an endearing quality. The music is definitely entertaining. I have to admit that scene with Cash and Carter singing a duet of "Time's a-Wasting" is quite memorable. But for me, that's just not enough.This is a movie about the life of a legendary musician, Johnny Cash, played not-so-brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix. Cash's brother dies in an accident at the beginning, and Mr. Cash senior, who favoured the brother, seemed to blame Johnny for his death. A music lover since childhood, Cash struggles to make a career for himself as a songwriter and performer. He's controversial, messed up and in love with Carter. This is enough to describe the remainder of the movie.Now I don't know much about Johnny Cash and his music, but I can't claim I learned any more after watching Walk the Line. Call me difficult but when I see a biographical film, I expect the makers to put in some effort in trying to understand and portray the different dimensions of the personality in question. All I got was that his brother died, his daddy didn't love him and Carter was the only thing keeping him going. I'm just not convinced that this formed the essence of Johnny Cash and his music.And by the way, I don't know why this is a taboo in Hollywood, but I am brave enough to say it: Joaquin Phoenix is not a good actor. Let's face it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Ray!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ray was a very good movie and on my top ten of 2004, but only at number ten. It had a powerful performance by Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles. He had it all down. The walk, the talk, the piano playing. The only things that hurt him was near mediocre direction and the fact they wouldn't let him actually do the singing. Walk the Line is on the other hand a wonderful movie. It is one of the best movies I have seen in years. Not the best of the year because 2005 was extremely strong but surly number two to only Brokeback Mountain. Walk the Line has two great performances to Rays one, both of which are much better than Foxx's as well. Joaquin Pheonix, an actor we have all known has great talent after his turns in such films as Gladiator and Signs has finally gotten a great roll. He gives what is easily his best performance as Johnny Cash. He knows the character better than probably anybody but June ever did. He gets the voice right, and all the mannerisms. It is not just an impersonation. Anyone can do some sort of a Johnny Cash impersonation while Pheonix creates a full and amazing character. Reese Witherspoon is a less proved actor in my opinion with a wonderful turn in the underrated Pleasantville to help her. I have now finally decided that she can actually really act and that it was no fluke. Her performance as June Carter is on the same shelf as Joaquin Pheonix's. She gets the tone and who knew she could sing? The supporting performances are also very good but are unfortunately overshadowed by the two leads. Dallas Roberts is though particularly good as the man who gets Cash started. The direction is a little by the book but since when has that really hurt? Doing something risky is the way to making a masterpiece but who says that by the book hurts a movie? The movie made me listen to Cashs songs and I really loved them. It made me feel great. It is some of the most fun I have had at the movies in years. It also just grows on you each time you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phoenix is Mr. Oscar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walk the Line Let's all sit here for one second and discuss the formula in making a biopic about a legend. First of all, why would anyone want to make a film about someone? Well the obvious reasons would include popularity. For example Ray Charles had a huge fan base that included people from the older generation and even a select few from the newer. Johnny Cash's popularity didn't string some much up to urban areas or any coast cities but pretty much there are a good number of people that heard of the name Johnny Cash. The next part of the formula has to be the actual story of the person; the struggle to the top, the origins of the person, an overcoming such as drug addiction or an abusive relationship, (i.e. "What's Love Got to Do With It?") and a settling ending to their story even if they are still living. The film which follows Cash's early childhood up to his engagement to June Carter gives all these elements of a biopic and that's exactly where this film fell short.Director James Mangold whom many people have never heard prior to Walk the Line had a true opportunity to shine and show us all something that had never been seen before. The film starts and ends very strongly but there is a true sense of hollowness in the center of the film. Not too sure yet of what it is, could be the screenplay or even just the story of Cash himself but I was really eager to get the ball rolling again about an hour in. Twenty minutes pass and ball really rolled. It's a bit of a random upset and not too sure if I was just getting distracted but it is what it is.Now!...............the performances! Oh my god, can we give Mr. Joaquin Phoenix an Oscar! This man truly is talented. After being a true supporting player for the past couple of years he has made a great transition into a leading man. This movie is all about Phoenix and how he embodies this man. I have to do it; the comparison of this performance to Jamie Foxx's performance in last year's Oscar winning role in "Ray." The difference is that Phoenix really elevated the material and I get he got that from somewhere not on the set or watching a video or any meeting with Cash if there was one. Phoenix takes the performance to a brand new level and at any point do I ever feel like it's a mimic which is what I felt Foxx did. Phoenix gave so much emotion from his speeches to his singing to his rapid eye movements. Phoenix is the true frontrunner at the Oscars as of now.Reese Witherspoon has finally lived up to expectations. For the past four or five years I've heard a lot of comparisons to Julia Roberts. I never believed it because Julia is one of a kind but Witherspoon truly is talented. Her singing is beautiful and gives a jaw-dropping performance as June Carter. As of the rumor going around saying that she will win Oscar, it can happen but due to the lack of contention in the category. But if Joan Allen is nominated which I feel she will be, she will most likely win Oscar. Five nominations and no win along with losing to newbie Witherspoon won't really sit well with voters and fellow Oscar lovers. But she is a lock for nomination. (I hate saying lock because academy does stupid stuff all the time.) The supporting cast is perfect as well ranging from Dallas Roberts to overbearing father Ray Cash played exquisitely by Robert Patrick to the suffering first wife of Cash, Vivian, played by Ginnifer Goodwin who can give you pains in your stomach because she makes you hate her so much. A great ensemble I must say.Walk the Line is a great experience and can get the best picture nomination that people are predicting but it WILL NOT win the top prize. Nothing too spectacular about it and there's so much left to be seen. I'm walking the line in including this in my top five of the year so far. We'll see? Grade: ***/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What amazing performances! Pheonix and Witherspoon are definitely Oscar worthy for their roles as Cash and Carter. It was a long movie-around 2 1/2 hours but worth every minute. I wish it could have actually been longer. There seems to have been more story to tell. I especially loved the telling of the beginning of Cash's career when he walks into Sun Records for the first time. The determination he had was amazing. The performances were all believable - almost like a time warp - watching the likes of Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, June Carter and J.R. Cash. Thank God Pheonix and Witherspoon did the singing themselves. This made the movie so much better to watch - no lip-syncing!! They were great!! What a beautiful story they were telling. It was a treat watching them. Their on-screen chemistry was beautiful. Quite a bit of unexpected humor, too. What a huge disappointment it would be if they weren't nominated for Oscars...and WON. This movie deserves a best picture nod, too. I am sure the soundtrack will be sought after and Cash's music revived for a whole new generation. What a beautiful love story it was! Johnny Cash was - and still is - a force to be reckoned with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash is a triumphant performance from a very talented actor who captures the essence of the famed performer on the screen; while Reese Witherspoon as June Cash just knocks the ball out of the park in her role and with every scene she becomes more magical and visually on the screen, so important to Johnny's development as both a singer/performer, and more importantly, for his future happiness as a father, husband and a singer.I loved this film from the first frame to the last, as the chemistry and the talents of Joaquin and Reese make this film come alive with energy, passion and solid writing to make WALK THE LINE one of the best films of 2005. Golden Globe and Oscar are written all over this film.WALK THE LINE is an honest film, as it shows all the flaws and past sins of its characters, as well as triumphantly ends with the love and marriage which Johnny and June Cash shared together to the end of their lives.Watching the last frame as Joaquin finally enjoys the richness of family and love with Reese as June Cash is one that I shall always remember and cherish. WALK THE LINE deserves to be nominated as BEST PICTURE for 2005. The film warmed my heart, as it will yours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartfelt film is impassioned without being energetic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strangely low-keyed musical-bio on country great Johnny Cash, his humble beginnings in a dysfunctional household to his first, unsuccessful marriage and quick rise to stardom often alongside future wife June Carter, with whom he had a rocky courtship. Based on two separate books by Cash, the film has very fine musical sequences and keen eyes and ears for the nuances of troubled families, but after the first 90 minutes the film seems to get stuck in a rut. Director James Mangold, a careful and talented filmmaker, doesn't utilize the slower-paced scenes to underscore anything meaningful--instead it just feels like sluggish narcissism. Cash's drug dependency and eventual withdrawal is well-wrought without a lot of hysterics, but Mangold's staging of these moments is clichéd (he's seen too many movies himself). The budding, on-again/off-again romance with June is surprisingly complicated (she wasn't one to give in easily), but it probably wasn't wise to shape the final chapters of the movie on whether or not Carter would say yes or no to Johnny's numerous proposals (and Reese Witherspoon's pouty fierceness tends to make Carter look hard-headed in place of willful). The picture is surely a handsome one, with lots of fine tunes and terrific period atmosphere, but Joaquin Phoenix peaks early in his lead portrayal (at the Sun Records audition) and the other performances are peculiarly uneven. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS THROUGH:Yes!! My first "10" for a 2005 release I saw in the theater. Walk The Line was a wonderful Movie! It was touching, poignant, and also very entertaining. It contained sweeping cinematography, and was wonderfully directed with many a closeup shot, which worked very powerfully here. The performances were tops. Joaquin Phoenix gave a powerful and intense performance. Reese Witherspoon is a breath of fresh air. She was charming, spirited, engaging and completely Oscar worthy. Both have an excellent chance at best Actor/Actress Oscars. The chemistry between these two is as electric as the feel of the whole Movie, and the fact that these two people do their own singing is incredible. Joaquin was great and Reese Witherspoon should record an album, preferably immediately.To me a movie gets a 10, when there just isn't anything lacking. Walk The Line is a great movie and one does not have to be Johnny Cash fan to love this movie. Of coarse you may just become one after seeing it, but I think a biography that is just really well done can appeal to people who may not even know a lot or much, about the person before seeing it.There is a lot to love about this movie and it crosses so many genres. It is a serious drama in many ways. It is also an entertaining and exhilarating musical that will have your foot tapping in much the same way Chicago did. It is a story of success and triumph. And it is also a love story, and in a way, much more interesting then many others on film, because this one is real. Walk The Line is my favorite film of the year so far and though I know it may not stay that way (there are at least two other movies coming out this year I suspect maybe up there) I still believe it's a perfect 10. What Walk The line also does so beautifully is connect with the Audience. Watching this movie makes one wish they had known Johnny Cash and June Carter cash. It gets you involved very deeply, but more then involved, more like utterly immersed. This movie is destined to become a classic. It really is, as mentioned above, a breath of fresh air, because of how truly well done on all levels it is (and that's a rarity.) There is a radiance to Walk The line one does not see often and I could see this becoming one of my favorite films ever. My vote is 10 of 10 and I hope this movie continues to generate a lot of buzz and people continue to support it and the talent involved. I had a great time seeing this and hope many others feel the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Musical Biography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Walk the Line" is a great musical biography of Johnny Cash. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I've read criticism of it saying that it is the standard rock star film of battling drugs, etc, but Johnny Cash is anything but your normal star. He commands a respect to this day that very few (maybe Bob Dylan)do. The acting is outstanding on all counts, as Juaquin Phoenix does an amazing job portraying Johnny Cash. Even better is Reese Witherspoon as June Carter; what a terrific, inspiring performance. And of course, the advantage that a musical biography has over other biographical films is the great music, and there is a lot of it: "I Walk the Line", "Ring of Fire" and several other of Cash's legendary repertoire. The only reason it didn't get a 10 rating is because they downplayed the religious aspect of Johnny Cash's life, and the importance that his Christian faith had in what happened to him. I get tired of movie producers being almost embarrassed to delve into the subject of faith; his faith was a huge part of his life and it shouldn't be brushed aside like this. Otherwise, this film is terrific and I highly recommend it, especially to those who love great music. If you were not a Johnny Cash fan before watching this, chances are you will be afterward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got back from seeing WTL (by myself), and I tell you if that movie doesn't get Oscars then the academy must be blind,deaf,and stupid. IT's better than Ray. It's better than anything else I've ever seen. In fact, I might see it again while its in theaters, something i've never done before. You can actually see when Joaquin Phoenix stops playing Johnny and becomes him, and it's within the first 20 minutes, when he's singing the "one song that sums up what he's done in life, one song to define him." IT happens ,so fluidly, but you actually see a physical change from J.P. to J.C, and for the rest of the movie, he is Johnny. Some scenes were so intense I had to cover my mouth, and yes, I did cry. More than once.And Reese. Reese was June Carter beyond what any actress could ever dream to come close to being. Even her southern drawl didn't seem too over exaggerated. This is a movie that I couldn't leave my seat during or after. I saw all the credits! And I wasn't the only one. Most of the theater was elderly (not a kid in sight) and no one moved an inch or even breathed loudly the entire time. It's just that stunning, that amazing. At times it literally took my breath away. I left the theater feeling a deep hollowness in my chest because of the intensity lost that was once there. I will definitely buy it the day it comes out. I mean, I felt this movie. The cast became the people they were portraying, and it seemed like I was right there. that's what a movie should do, and WTL brought me into Cash's world. Even the death cards at the end were amazing and fitting. Even in death their love couldn't be stopped. This is billed as a love story, but its more. It's a story about music,life,love, and most importantly,PASSION. This movie works so well because Phoenix and Witherspoon understood that as much as the Cashes did. I think they would be proud that their story was told so well, and it's yet another testament to their genius that they handpicked the actors who portrayed them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie!! Would Definitely pay to see again!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As just an average, everyday "joe" taking the wife to see a movie, I'd like to think I could give the average movie-goer a fair review. First off, I'm not a real big fan of country music, though I have been listening to some classic country lately. This movie definitely lives up to all the good things reviewers have wrote. I'll admit I didn't quite know what to expect with Phoenix and Witherspoon as the main characters but, WOW!!!, they were superb in their portrayal of Cash and Carter and the fact they did all of the singing without any overdubs only confirms this.Once again, as an ordinary, man-on-the-street movie-goer I want to recommend this movie highly. My wife and I paid the better part of $50 to see this movie, what with popcorn and sodas, and I would definitely pay the money to see Walk The Line again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A load of crap on par with The Doors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets take the myth and create a story so shallow and trite that you can't help but think 'Why was this movie made?" Mr. Phoenix is a mediocre actor and unsuited for such a complex character as Johnny Cash-- First and foremost:I don't care that he didn't sound like Cash-he never got the vocal inflection. He sang as if he never listened to more than a song or two... Johnny Cash was as much about phrasing as the depth of his baritone(neither which Phoenix had). Remember when Kurt Russell played Elvis-his acting skills made you forget that he didn't resemble the king-Mr. Phoenix has just the opposite problem. Just because the physical resemblance is there, doesn't mean you make a convincing Johnny Cash. On the plus side-Reese Witherspoon did a fine, believable job as June Carter-except that towards the end she didn't look old enough (June had three years on Johnny).This movie is on par with Oliver Stones The Doors: All myth and little substance. As a side note I immediately noticed Johnny taking the cigarette out of Luthers mouth (and the irony of his future death)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before "Walk the Line" came out, some people thought that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon would be miscast as Johnny Cash and June Carter. They were not miscast at all. Not only do they both do a great job playing the roles, they do their own singing. This movie does as great a job with its subject as "Ray" did. It makes perfect sense that Phoenix and Witherspoon have received Academy Award nominations; I'd say that they deserve to win. This movie is a masterpiece in every way. Up in that great music house in the sky, Johnny and June must be proud to know that this movie did such a great job portraying their lives. Perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a boring deja-vue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't want to hurt no one. It seems, I'm the only one who didn't enjoy this movie at all. I did enjoy many musician bio-pics, but this one was boring in every aspect: The story is a deja-vue (Bird, Ray ...), the old country music and the movie was just not directed intensely, emotional or interesting. The pace was slooow, the story was sloow, the music was slower and I didn't see any romance (just a guy insisting and a woman giving in after all). This was a major disappointment. Maybe it's not the movie, maybe it's Johnny Cash himself that was so boring? And no, I don't think it's the cultural difference, since I enjoyed so many other similar American movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sadly unfurfilling tale about a great artist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First: I saw the extended cut of the movie, and when I refer to Cash and June, it is the movie characters I refer to, not the people they are based on.I have a problem with this movie, and it is the way Cash is portrayed. How close to reality it is I can not say, but from what it shows in the movie, he seems to have been given everything without having to work for it. The only thing he has going for him is his talent as a writer and musician.Now, the movie goes through some lengths to show why he became the man he did. A difficult child hood, and being thrown into fame before shaking off his child like stubbornness and selfishness. And then, the addiction and relationship problems, which I am sure made him a much worse person that what he had potential to be.But when the movie only shows this side of him, and not show any change. The moment in the last concert is very selfish of him. Very. And that's what you get before the movie is over (other than the couple of scenes after that).Because of this, I am not too happy with the movie, and that is despite everything it has going for it. The amazing acting and singing done by both the leads, the music, the setting and interaction between them and other stars of the era. All of that is amazing! But when the character whose life you are following is unsympathetic till the end, the movie just leaves me hanging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard going to keep watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm currently deployed overseas and have a fair bit of down time at night - if I was in any way busy this evening there's no way I would have stuck around to watch the film through to the end.The film portrays Johnny Cash as a weak and pathetic individual, bereft of any redeeming features. From what I've read of him, the film portrays the character accurately - the type of character I genuinely dislike, hence I suppose why I didn't enjoy the film. I could see nothing uplifting in the story - at all. He seemed to be a poison to all he had close contact with and his lack of strength led him to succumb to all temptations. If not for his musical talent and consequent wealth, he would have been an even more lonely man.I love his music, but not the man that sings it - nor the film about the man.Joaquin Phoenix is very strong in the role and his depiction of Cash's voice is excellent - in fact, his voice is 'too excellent', and considerably better than the true Johnny Cash. You see, I think a real charm of Johnny Cash was that his success belied his singing talent. His acting skills were great and his living of the ballads were most convincing - the anger borne from frustration and desertion of the boy named Sue, and only the Lord knows why that boy took his guns to town.But don't get me wrong, I still love The Man in Black's music and have many of his albums. But just because a person can sing and entertain does not mean he is a good man, nor does it mean we should just blindly accept all his weaknesses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily 1 of the GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is great on two fronts: 1.) Cinematically, story-wise, it's just about as perfect a movie as you can get. Honestly, it's easily one of my favorite films ever, and for a reason.2.) I can't stress this enough man, PHOENIX AND WITHERSPOON sang the lyrics themselves. Every song you hear in the movie is their voices.Ebert said himself he was gobsmacked when he realized that fact afterwards. Even Jamie Foxx didn't sing any lyrics for his supposed Oscar-worthy performance.That Joaquin didn't EASILY win the Oscar for his performance is one of the greatest crimes of all time. The guy was STRAIGHT UP AMAZING in a once-in-a-lifetime role.Personally I thought the ending was succinct and very well done, too many movies try to draw something out and perhaps the way they ended the movie keeps you wanting more than drawing it out too long.However, I think tiny additions like a quick nod from and to his father at the end would've shown some smidgen of respect finally between the two, as Cash becomes the real family man that his dad never could be...And of course perhaps an even longer stare between he and his wife June could've solidified this movie, as perhaps, THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. No I'm not crazy and I kid you not.As is, for me, objectively speaking, when you consider the performances and the storyline itself, it's a top 10 movie of all time EASILY, and the fact that it has such a low score on here is ridiculous...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About as Good of a Cash Biopic as We Can Hope For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I initially had some concerns about this film. First and foremost, I didn't really understand the casting of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. Not that they did bad jobs, but just that I think they weren't the most obvious casting choices. However, when I found out Cash had chosen Phoenix personally to portray him, well, I can't really argue with that.I also think they played down the negatives a bit. The domestic abuse is pretty much nonexistent and the drug abuse shows up, but makes Cash seem more like a lovable loser than an outright problem. I understand that Cash's son was a producer on this film, but the true story would be a bit more rough. (That, and the story cuts off with almost forty years of Cash's life left. One thinks there could have been more to say...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great movie. I really biographic movies like this movie and A Beautiful Mind and La vie en rose. I've never really known who Joaquin Phoenix was because when I saw Gladiator I didn't know what he looked like. I knew that he was nominated for an Oscar for this movie and that Reese Witherspoon won one for this movie so I decided to see it. Reese Witherspoon was amazing and she sang really well with this amazing voice. Joaquin Phoenix surely deserved to have won the Oscar. He completely immersed into the character and his singing was just as good.Normally, I don't like country music but the soundtrack of this movie is great, probably only because when I listen to a certain song I think back to the movie. The way the movie was filmed and the story was just great. It made me want to learn more about Johnny Cash who I've never really care about before but after this movie I can't believe that he never got a number one billboard hit.Great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised by this movie because I am not a fan of Cash and know nothing about his life - well I do now and that is because I watched 'Walk The Line' which is an immensely watchable movie with riveting performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon; in fact their acting is so good in this film that the movie is mesmerising from beginning to end. The fact that they did their own vocals is astounding. The life of Johhny Cash is very interesting and his struggle with addictions; a big surprise about the movie is the beautiful love story between Cash and June; it is very beautifully portrayed and the on screen chemistry is just right. My only problem with the movie is how Cash's on screen parents are never aged as the movie progresses - this was a major fault of the director but I still give the movie 10 for its overall deliverance. While Johnny goes through all kind of facial changes in his drug addictions, his father remains permanently with the same face he had from 1946 to 1968, very silly mistake. Mamma Cash is very miscast too, she is only looking 10 years younger than Phoenix and she remains young for the entire film except for a large pair of 1960's glasses towards the end. This is very bad miscalculation on the part of the director and puts a slight amateurism slant on the production. However, as far as interest goes, this film is interesting from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk the Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the true story of the great county and western singer/legend Johnny Cash (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Joaquin Phoenix), from director James Mangold (Cop Land; Girl, Interrupted). Growing up in the Depression era and after joining the air force, he bought his first guitar and wrote his own music, and proposed to Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin). Soon enough he auditions to a record guy with his boys/band, and after singing one of his original songs, gets a record deal and tour to promote his songs. While touring, promoting his song, along with such artists as Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton) and Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne), he falls for already famous singer June Carter (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Reese Witherspoon). After a long tour though, June leaves because of Johnny's behaviour as a drug addict, and his marriage falls apart. He does convince June to tour again, promising to support her, and it has a happy ending when (after many proposals) she finally accepts marriage. Also starring Terminator 2's Robert Patrick as Ray Cash, Dallas Roberts as Sam Phillips, Dan John Miller as Luther Perkins, Larry Bagby as Marshall Grant, Shelby Lynne as Carrie Cash, Shooter Jennings as Waylon Jennings and Johnathan Rice as Roy Orbison. Witherspooon certainly deserved her Oscar win, I reminded of the huge chin spoof in Bo! in the USA sometimes (lol), and Phoenix is very convincing (voice in particular). It is a great story with a great singer impression, the songs, including the brief Ring of Fire, and of course the title song are the highlights. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Costume Design, Best Editing and Best Sound Mixing, it won the BAFTA for Best Sound, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for T-Bone Burnett, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful. Plus you get charmed by Reese Witherspoon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say "Walk the Line" is an excellent biography type film about country-rock legend Johnny Cash. From start to finish you are not only entertained but informed also, and the acting and music during the film is just magnificent you often sense you are watching the real Johnny Cash and reliving his life over before your eyes. Also Joaquin Phoenix does a fine job portraying Cash, his actions and looks and singing manners are realistic. Most of all this film educates you as many like myself learned plenty about Johnny it begins with his humble upbringing in rural Arkansas on a farm with tragedy striking that causes Johnny to leave for the service and to later settle in Memphis. From then the film does a good job to show how Cash got started in the business by making records locally in Memphis, TN and just little by little he starts to tour around only to meet the young innocent and popular June Carter(Reese Witherspoon). Going along as this film shows the touring and many like the actual singing which was good and you feel as if though both the voices of Reese and Joaquin are really John's and June's, to me I find the transformation of these two central characters relationship the most pleasing. Little by little John who stays on tour all the time, and drags away from his wife and kids becomes more attached and falls for the charm of June. Also the up and downs are portrayed nice showing that John went thru the tough period of drugs and alcohol, before finally coming to terms and getting his main love in life June Carter. This man in black has to travel the rocky road sometimes, but his faith and good nature pulls him back in the end. I must say this was a very charming performance from Reese Witherspoon, she was just so nice and fit the part of June Carter so great her skills and talent showed off with a great singing voice! Reese was well deserving of her Oscar win, she's now America's true sweetheart! Overall this movie was a great true story of a country-rock legend that educated and entertained while both showing highs and lows and ending with a couple that loved one another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie in Black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That Walk the Line is a showcase for raw-horsepower performances, white-hot music, and a pervading sense of gloom goes without saying. I don't think I've ever watched a music-driven biography that initially so depressed me. I popped the disk back in it's case and felt mentally and physically blue. My God, what a fascinating, talented, multi-faceted waste of an early life! And yet, to paraphrase Paul Harvey, you don't know the rest of the story.It really is the story of Walk the Line, Johnny Cash's trial by fire, his crucible that brought him health and love and admiration in his later life, that gives that later life meaning and sweetness.Now, I know he was deep and a deeply tortured soul, even after he cleaned out and sobered up, but watching the movie gave me an appreciation for the level of wellness he attained in his life after the movie.Bravo to Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon for their careful and dynamic embodiment of Cash and his long love and wife June. By their good works, after I recovered from the hangover of feeling depressed, I began to appreciate that Walk the Line is a memoir, not an autobiography.The rest of the story is not so much a happy one, but a completed one. Walk the Line is a great, great movie--the storm before the calm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I have a thing with most biopics: I cannot get myself to love them, even if they're good. Walk the Line has a lot going for it. The performances are excellent, the story is well written, the directing is Hollywood invisible, the production values are high and the drama is good. But I can't seem to love it. It's just all right by me.I suppose maybe I'm always looking for a bigger implication to the story than what's presented. What we have here is the life and times of Johnny Cash. A slice of his youth. His trouble with his father. His first marriage. And his pursuit of June Carter. All of which is presented in a mostly chronological order.How true to actuality is it? It doesn't really matter. Biopics are primarily interested in legend and myth--but honest legend and myth. Johnny Cash was a troubled man. The film's Johnny Cash (portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix who seemingly also takes care of the actual singing in the film) is likewise a troubled man. We see his filmic not-quite-tragic obsession with June Carter (portrayed by Reese Witherspoon very effectively as well).Maybe you need to be a bigger fan of the man or the actors or something to take the appreciation of this movie to another level. As far as I go, it's good. It does what it needs to and I applaud it for that. It's effect on me is less than spell-binding. It's just a nice movie and a good way to pass the time on a flight. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found Walk The Line to be a good, enjoyable movie; Witherspoon and Phoenix both are excellent, and it strikes me that any time Reese wants to switch careers to become a C&amp;W singer she's probably got a legitimate shot at being a star. When was the last time you saw a Hollywood movie with the principals doing their own singing *and* it all worked out? (Moulin Rouge me no Moulin Rouge, Obi-Wan was strictly amateur hour) That being the case, I've a few nits to pick. With a couple exceptions, the first half hour of the movie left me wondering how far I'd get before flipping the DVD off. Phoenix's voice in the early going was dull, flat, and nearly lifeless (although I wonder whether it was just that his timbre and range were far better suited to Cash's later music?), and you had no sense that this would become a legendary singer. The early exposition was terribly rushed, going from vignette to vignette in a choppy, barely-explored fashion. Beyond that and throughout, it struck me that scenes with other stars (such as the ones with Waylon Jennings and Elvis) were thrown in more for their namedropping than any dramatic purpose. It kept the movie from being truly great, IMHO.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining yet often formulaic biopic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although musicals are not my speciality, 'Walk the Line' had a certain allure to it that made me want to witness the rise of one of the worlds most all-time well known musicians through the medium of film. What was odd that it turned out the film didn't really play like a musical and managed to end up like a romance/fairytale story. But this wasn't a bad thing.I really liked the use of diegetic sound in the film. That means the sounds and, more importantly; the music, were actually in the film resulting in the fact we could hear them just as well as the characters could and this played an important part in witnessing Johnny Cash's journey. The music on the radio which plays a big part later on, (or more importantly, the person singing it), the rough sound of the bands making their own records in a store followed by the shutting of a door in Cash's face giving off a sense that he can hear his music on the record but it's just a little out of reach and hard to get to and the way he rehearses his songs whilst in the army are all good, early examples of Cash and his tendency to give music and sound a priority in life.What also adds to this is the early changes of era. We go through a couple of decades in about five year bursts and each time, the setting and the music changes somewhat. This gives a good feeling of travel and suggests Cash's character is on quite a journey.Along with the music, the other thing I mentioned was the romance element. Because this is a life story, a marriage or a relationship is bound to come along at some point and the film deals with these relationships (in fact, with most character's relationships with each other) in an entertaining way. Each relation is pushed to an absolute limit. Cash's constant lust to get married to June and the way he shows her up a few times is pretty awkward viewing and if you don't know how the story ends, it's fascinating watching them all react in the slow, awkward way in which they do. What's also good is that well into the marriage, there are certain cliff-hangers we are left on, leaving doubt as to whether each character will love one another anymore.It's also interesting how the actual musical performances advance the plot. The relationships growing on screen and Cash's problems are two of the things highlighted during these scenes and they work well.Although these good things inject the film after every twenty minutes or so, they're not enough to stop some glaring items that bring the film down. These occur every now and again but the most obvious is when our hero, Johnny, settles down with married life which is, coincidentally, when the film looses a lot of energy as it stops for a breather. There's also a bit of an obvious 'protagonist's failure' when he seems to be loosing his battle with his drink and drug problem. It seemed like a bit of an obvious 'lowest point' before he miraculously came back for his last performances, especially at the jail.Although sometimes frustrating and if you can look past the fact Reece Witherspoon's character doesn't seem to age in the film, there's a good chance you'll like this interesting and sometimes entertaining biopic.</fullReview>

Joaquin had the same movements as Johnny Cash that I have seen on television and movies that featured Johnny Cash. Even his expressions were great copies of JC. I am a long time fan of Johnny Cash and this movie was great, one of the best bios of a person that I have ever attended. I understand that most of the script was taken from JC's own autobiography so it must have followed his life pretty closely. Reese was good also in this movie but if she deserved an Oscar so did Joaquin only 20 times more so. He did (as she did) his own singing and playing of the instruments. I just loved the movie and Joaquin.</fullReview>

I think the directors handled the films in the same way, and for all the troubles Johnny Cash went through in the film it felt sanitised to me, just a bit too glossy for my liking. That said I did enjoy it, having never read a book about Cash, I learnt a few things.I liked Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of this man, I thought he brought a depth to the performance that did the man justice. Reese Witherspoon was also convincing as June Carter, though having seen the film after the Oscars I was expecting a bit more from her performance. I suppose it just proves that it was a weak year for female leads.The support cast do a great job and the music is top notch, as you would expect. If you like Cash's music then this is worth a watch, Here again Phoenix did a good job, just enough like the real voice to not niggle in your brain throughout the film. It may be glossy and a bit Hollywood but it's OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The performance that Joaquin showed in this movie is fantastic. Ya would of thought ya were really watching Johnnie Cash. He captured his moves, his voice, his stand and his love for June.I seen the movie 4 times b 4 it came out where I could buy it. I have seen it 4 times since. I never get tired of watching him. His sincerity to show the hardships of Johnnie you can pick up on in his eyes &amp; expressions on his face. He made the entire show worth seeing time and time again.Reese done a great job on June. With a great voice that poured out the sounds of her music. They were great together &amp; would love to see them do another movie together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally you would regard this movie as another shallow idol portrait, but the actor work makes it the opposite.Joaquien Phoenix are mostly making his performance through looks and body language. And he really tells a lot by that method. Reese Witherspoon forms a full character with another technique, but they are completing each other very well. And don't forget Dallas Roberts in the small part as Sam Phillips. Performance of last year.The script is rather simple, but leaves space for these actors to make something quite interesting out of it. A positive surprise about a true American hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You don't have to be a fan of country music or Johnny Cash to enjoy this movie. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give the best performances of the year in a biopic that gets behind the image of its subject to portray a tortured, and often unpleasant, man. There are obvious similarities between this movie and "Ray" the life story of Ray Charles. This is a better movie though and that is due purely to the outstanding on screen relationship of Phoenix and Witherspoon. Joaquin Phoenix just about reaches that pinnacle of becoming more like Johnny Cash than Cash himself. In much the same way as Val Kilmer occupied the character of Jim Morrison in "The Doors". Reese Witherspoon gives is a feisty June Carter who's sheer energy carries the movie at moments when it may seem to flag. The depiction of Cash's struggle to make it as a singer is very real and doesn't indulge in the overnight success story so many biopics portray. This is a thoroughly engaging movie that I will definitely be adding to my DVD collection as soon as it is released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I even noticed Joaquin was in Walk the Line, which I loved. I now own 8 Joaquin movies...absolutely loved his interview on Oprah and those darling expressions on his face!!! I agree with another comment that he was robbed of the Oscar. Much to my distress I just read that Joaquin doesn't believe in God and that really disturbs me. I hope all Christians out there will pray that Joaquin will come to know the saving grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. I also hope and pray that he will stop cussing in movies!!! A lot of his movies are full of cuss words which adds nothing to the plot and makes it very annoying to watch. I love Ladder 49, Signs, The Village, Inventing the Abbotts, It's All About Love, but I found Clay Pigeons to be very offensive. I just love Joaquin and want the best for his life....Can't wait to see his next movie but it will be awhile since he's not made a movie since Walk. Love you Joaq!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i am only nineteen years old and really had no clue who Johnny cash was. in fact when i went to see this movie i didn't have any clue what the movie was about. also i was in no means a fan of country music (espiecally from the 1950s/60s.) however i am a fan of great movies and that was exactly what this was. phoenix and Witherspoon give the top performances of the year and both deserved Oscars for their roles. the chemistry between them was unmatched. the only part of the movie that might seem a little slow is about a 15 min. period from after his childhood tragedy till the time he met june, but it is an important part in setting the stage and showing how he fond his sound. once reese comes onto the screen the movie just ignites. from the first encounter of them getting tangled to the big marriage proposal every single scene with them talking to each other brings something new. i cant remember the last time a saw a movie and was so intrigued and amazed by the dialogue of just two actors having a conversation. they just make u fall in love with them. also there are so many great intense and powerful scenes phoenix nails. from the smashing of his guitar, to him passing out on stage, to the fight with Vivian, to thanksgiving with his dad and tractor incident. i was left after each scene saying wow what a performance out loud. i thought it was very well tied together not losing the audience with a good mixture of the script intertwined with the music performances. which by the way as i said earlier not having ever heard a johnny cash song i even find myself stomping my feet to the music which is saying something. i really cant even describe how good of a job phoenix and Witherspoon do in singing the songs. a truly inspirational story. roger ebert summed this movie up perfectly by saying "the performances are great, the drama is great, the writing is great, the music is great, i loved it"... and i agree 1000%</fullReview>

Walk the Line is an excellent with extremely great performances from the cast. Joaquin Phoenix plays an amazing role and made me become more involved into Johnny Cash's music.

		<fullReview>I can't say that I'm a fan of Johnny Cash or that I know much about him - but there's something for everyone in Mangold's film, and you certainly don't need to be a fan of the country music legend to appreciate it. This is a film that is based much on the performances of its stars, and while I don't know how Johnny Cash acted; Joaquin Phoenix gives a great performance in leading this film. The fact that he sings Cash's songs himself makes it all the more impressive, and for an actor who hasn't produced much of note over the past decade or so; the performance works on a number of levels. Of course, it was Resse Witherspoon who took home most of the acting plaudits with her role as June Carter; and on the whole I'd say she deserved her 'Best Actress' Oscar award. Phoenix wouldn't have been a bad winner either; but it was near impossible for anyone to beat Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Capote portrayal. The rest of the cast is good, and Robert Patrick is the actor who stood out most for me. His role as Cash's father is a world away from his usual sort of casting, and he does really well with it.Pulling good performances from his cast isn't the only thing that writer-director James Mangold can be proud of himself for. Biopics tend to leave me cold, as they tend to want to follow the full life story of the subject, which ultimately ends in depression. Contrary to the norm, Mangold focuses on Cash's life while he popular, and although the film has its depressing moments; it ends on a real high. The climax to the movie is one of the most moving moments seen on screen over the last decade. The finale is genuinely heartfelt, and provides the perfect ending to a movie like this. The plotting is good, as it gives equal credence to both sides of Cash's persona; we've got the music side, and the human side. The film always feels very personal, and the director does a good job of offsetting Cash's personal life with his musical life; but at the end of the day, at its basis - Walk the Line is a film about the love between the country legend Johnny Cash and his sweetheart June Carter. Walk the Line is a movie that I can recommend to anybody - you don't need to be a fan of Cash or his music to enjoy this movie. And that's how a biopic should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've seen better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many people who thought this was a fabulous piece of work, but I'm not one of them. I respect other people's opinions, but I just saw it as a flat, old-fashioned biographical film. It really did not offer any real gripping stories, that I have not seen in biographical films before, there was little room I felt, to really like or dislike the lead characters. It was pretty much a standard love story with really good music, and strong acting performances. The music is enough for some recognition for this film. I can not argue with the authenticity of the music which made this film appealing throughout. Granted of course though, just get a Johnny Cash album for that. I don't drive to Vegas to see Elvis impersonators only. Recordings of the real Elvis or Johnny Cahs are hardly that heavily in demand. If you want to capture the different loks on the music being made, that is another story. Granted though, I thought that was extremely watered down. For the most part, this film is a total ripoff on the film that inspired it, "Ray." "Walk the Line" deals with the same primary issues of the lead that "Ray" deals with (i.e. the scandal, negligent family man, origin of artist finding unique sound, etc.). One scene I thought was done very poorly in this film which was inspired by a similar scene in Ray is when Cash and his two performers audition at the sound recording place and the producers finds their sound boring because it is the same old thing. And the scene gradually turns into him doing something really spectacular with his music. It was absolutely watered down with minimal energy. This level of energy remained constant throughout the film. The best part of the film was the acting. I can not deny that the acting n this film was absolutely fabulous and kept the film. Both Joachin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon absolutely became their characters. It was not an impersonation. They really were the characters. Witherspoon's Oscar was completely deserved. Since I have not Capote, I can not completely against Phoenix not receiving the Oscar, but he sure could have won and wold have deserved it. Overall, this film was at best, a little more than decent. Cash fans, enjoy. Phoenix fans, watch Gladiator. Witherspoons fans, Watch Legally Blonde or Vanity Fair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie made me realize how much Reese Witherspoon outshines Joaquin Phoenix. It's a well-made movie that shows no matter how screwed up and talentless you are, you can still make it big by hanging in there.... I'm talking' about Mr. Cash now.... I could never understand why this this guy ever got popular, so I figured I'd watch the movie..... After seeing what I presume is a fairly realistic portrayal of Johnny Cash by Mr. Phoenix and the scriptwriters, I'm left with an overwhelming impression that Johnny Cash himself was an arrogant jerk, with a childish temper and little talent. Kudos to the cast for singing the tunes instead of miming to the originals.... the early rock n' roll stuff is really good. A mistake I noted is that supposedly, back in 1952 when Johnny is buying a guitar, some of the models hanging in the store were not yet in production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lust, guilt and body language over dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Mangold is a rarity in American 'studio' cinema: he is not interested in sticking to one category or genre; the director of 'Girl, Interrupted' might not be expected to voluntarily make the biography of a pop star. The Johnny Cash story, though, is well-stocked with the stuff of Gothic legend and that ole dichotomy of lust and guilt that has informed the work of the blues and western greats from Charlie Patton through Robert Johnson and Hank Williams to?Johnny Cash. Mangold is pretty adept at exploring the dark undercurrents whatever his subject. The wide screen was made for the kind of shots cameraman Phedon Papamichael sets up here - there really is a camera language which is not quite the same as that used in medium-width frames, and he is especially fluent. The Memphis of the 'fifties, fat big automobiles and the air heavily moist with music, is lovingly recreated, and the vignettes of rock 'n' roll taking shape will make most of us who were born after 1950 feel an aching regret at not having been older, just as today's young rock bands keep trying to redo the 'sixties they never knew. Joaquin Phoenix has joined the top league on the strength of his performance, going from playful and innocent to bloody dangerous, and he has a better voice than Cash, actually - and we should not be surprised to see Reese Witherspoon's first album out soon. She can cut the mustard. One major problem with this film for non-American audiences is the dialogue. There are many long scenes consisting of nothing but talk, or even half-whispering, where we can't help wondering, 'What on Earth are they talking about?' Sometimes, only sometimes, we can guess from watching the subsequent action. There have been letters in the press from British cinema-goers, begging for subtitles in US films, but only notably since 'Walk the Line' came out, although it is by no means the first film to meet with incomprehension away from home. Bound to boost DVD sales! CLIFF HANLEY</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the movie but like so many it is more impersonating than acting. I thought the same thing of "Ray" last year, except walk the line does a better job than "Ray". The story line is good and gives you enough background in the life of Johnny Cash and the type of person he was. I was pleased to see that it didn't glorify him and showed the faults in his personality and moral character. It did not give a whole lot of info of the life of June Carter. The story doesn't really tell you anything that you didn't already know about Johnny Cash unless maybe you just weren't ever interested in his life before hand. Big Johnny Cash fans might not find it all that compelling but probably will see it, people who don't like Johnny Cash have no reason to see it. Overall I liked the movie and would recommend renting it but I wouldn't buy the DVD until it goes in the $5.00 bin!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is the movie I was waiting for...about the childhood and early rock 'n' roll years of Johnny Cash as well as the relationship with June Carter. All mixed together it results an excitable and amusing movie. The story is based on Johnnys autobiography with some slight changes, but generally captures the best and the most important moments. The Folsom prison scene at the beginning makes you really feel like entering into a live concert and is one of the few memorable scenes in this movie.Surely the acting has to be praised, Joaquin Phoenix as well as Reese Witherspoon really got into their roles and were very convincing, you actually feel the chemistry between them! Both Joaquin and Reese made a Oscar-worth performance! Although I sometimes missed Johnnys voice in the songs, Joaquin(Reese also) made a solid singing performance as well so there cant be any real objections. Throughout the movie we hear great early songs of Johnny (and June), like Cry!Cry!Cry!, I Walk the Line, Jackson, Get Rhythm, Ring of Fire, Folsom Prison Blues,..."Walk the Line" must be watched as a love story in first, and not a detailed Johnny Cash movie, and some parts of his life were just kind off simplified for the purpose of this love story(like why Johnny wears black,...). I cant loose the feeling that Johnny was even stronger and more charismatic then shown in the movie. But I guess its because we see just the young years of Cash. But this movie succeeds not only because of its great actors and classic love story. "Walk the Line" also manages to display the engaging portraits of stars like Elvis or Jerry Lee Lewis(also episode roles of Waylon Jennings or Roy Orbison), of course just as background, but after all the 50ties are just unthinkable without them. And it comes to my mind that Johnny Cash really outlived them, they lived fast but also burn out fast, except for Johnny. He went on, and on,...and the strength for this came out of June and the love that was connecting them..</fullReview>

I think it unfair to say that Witherspoon was too pretty to play June. June was actually very pretty and given the miracles of modern cosmetics would have stood toe to toe with Reese Witherspoon.The music was great. We should have had more. Phoenix is quite stunning in his voice portrayal of the singer. Arguably Cash made some of his best music in the last ten years of his life and pity the story stopped in the 1960's.

		<shortDescription>Good acting, well sung, but badly written screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have the same problem with this film as with "Ray". Some writers seem to think it's enough to tell a few episodes out of the life of a fascinating person but that's simply not true. Just like in Ray, the audience is presented with a string of seemingly "significant" episodes out of a musician's life, which are supposed to make us understand his life. And again it's an all-American story: poor boy rises high, falls deep and then returns into the light. But if I'm interested in the facts, then I prefer watching a documentary. And if I watch a film, there should be more to a story, there should be some depth. There should be some coherent idea behind the whole film. This is not the case at all here. The way this story is told is a total failure. I was appalled by some of the messages that underlie certain scenes. Just take the Folsom prison scene. First he looks at some fan mail and it is suggested that he might be a light that guides them in the right direction. Later in prison he basically tells them what great guys they are. Can something like this really be conveyed uncritically (and with a close-up on the admiring eyes of June Carter)? My impression is that the story of Cash was told by someone who has no idea what he conveys with his words. The good acting mostly carries the viewer over those gaps but frequently I felt there were emotions without any motivation in the story itself. The movie is like very thin ice over a nothingness. As I said above, the only reason why the ice never breaks is that Witherspoone and Phoenix carry the audience along so well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good, not great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first Walk the Line felt like a great film. After thinking about it a little more, I started to feel that it a very good film flirting with, but not touching greatness. The story was a little too simplified for its source, both in spirit and and formation. I thought the way Cash's demons were simplified in the film didn't do it complete justice. Also, the more I thought about the script, the more I felt that other than Cash the characters were lacking the depth required to be a great film. I really liked the directing. Mangold is an impressive director with more range than I realized. He now has at least three distinctively unique films on his resume with Ring of Fire, Kate &amp; Leopold, and Identity. I would definitely watch near anything he directed sight unseen. The acting was very impressive also. Phoenix is showing that (pardon the pun) he has the skills to spread his wings and fill a diversity of roles. Witherspoon made an underwritten role have more depth and power than it probably should have. The rest of the cast was talentedly engaging and provided the Phoenix the environment to shine. Ultimately, I thought the biggest flaw was the script. It seemed to turn the story of Johnny Cash into a little too much of an one character story. June Carter seemed like there should have been more depth to develop her, and in some ways Vivian Cash seemed to not be present enough in the whole storyline. Overall, it is an impressive film. I don't it entirely succeeded in its goals of show us who the man in black really was. 7/10</fullReview>

There was June and Johnny and both their parents, with little Roseanne trying to get grandpa Ray Cash to use a tin can and string phone &amp; talk.Symbolically it said Johnny's dad couldn't talk. We knew already that Johnny's childhood memories were his demons.Johnny told his dad to pull the line taunt, but Ray tried to get Johnny to do the talking, thinking he, himself, just couldn't find the words to say. Johnny encouraged his father that he could do it: "Tell them about the time of the flood, when you saved us with a boat made from a door."There it was, Johnny encouraging the father who would never, had never, encouraged him. The implication of the now happy family life, of the beginning of positive relationship with dad, of Johnny clutching onto good memories of the past.Yes, there it was, during the credits, when, instead of Johnny and June doing the hot "Jackson," Johnny's voice could have poured out deeply, "How high's the water, Papa?" That was what I was hearing, that song, "5 feet high and rising" so I guess they made it. dj of raleigh ------------------- "..we can made it to the road in a homemade boat, "..that's the only thing we got left that'll float</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I'd just like to say that this movie surprised me by being absolutely outstanding.Last year I took an American biography class and learned quite a bit about Mr. Cash. When "Walk the Line" first came out, however, I wasn't very interested. To be honest, I watched because of Joaquin Phoenix (Johnny Cash) but realized throughout that this movie was going to be great, and it definitely was.Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon (June Carter) both give accurate portrayals of their characters. The movie begins when Cash is only 12 years old, quickly building up his character and his love for his brother, his determination to marry his long-time sweetheart, and play music. The trouble between him and his wife Vivian and family is heartbreaking, as is his growing addictions as he also rises to fame and tours with his band and June Carter.It's really hard to describe this movie in a way that will give it all the credit it deserves. The music is excellent, and it's amazing to find out that both Phoenix and Witherspoon played and sang all of Cash and Carter's song for the movie. If you are a fan of Cash or even just want a movie to watch and enjoy, this is definitely the movie for you. Cash's journey through all the hard times in his life and back to the top is truly inspiring.I give this movie a 10/10, no hesitation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I go into this little review of Walk the Line, it should be known that I have been a serious Johnny Cash fan for 5 years now.I tried to go into this film unbiased, neutral, I was willing to see it from a film goer's point of view and not as Johnny Cash fan boy, but I couldn't, I was drawn right in and completely involved, like being at a Cash concert, and I think that is a good testament to Joaquin Phoenix, the rest of the cast and the writers and directors.JC has had a well documented life, his success came early and even so, I guess he out lasted them all, not just living longer than his peers but his relevancy too, the late 90's and early millennium saw him win over the alternative generation of today, let us note ? Dylan, Orbison, have not achieved that.The tragedy of Cash's youth is covered somewhat, although I suspect there was a heap more misfortune in his early teens and up until his first record contract (with sun records, Elvis's label), the film gets the point across well. Robert Patrick who plays Cash's father has that depression-era father off to a tee. All through the film, I was glad to see further scenes with Ray Cash (Robert Patrick). I particularly enjoyed how the writers reveal that Ray Cash did eventually overcome his own personal alcoholic demons and regret his early fatherhood.A neat and wonderful storyline, quickly brought into the picture is JC's first tour with Jerry Lee Lewis, June Carter and Elvis Presley. All actors are utterly convincing, and give intense performances in a time where amp-power and technology was not an option, and thus the performers had to give it their all, to make up for the volume and power they didn't have. Each group are thrown together on a sort of cheap and cramped tour across the southern states, the film unveils the beginning of Cash's rock stardom, worship, drugs, booze and escapism as well as the narrative ark ? what will be long time romance with June Carter.From here the story spirals into Cash's roller-coaster lifestyle, the rewards, the rejection and his strained marriage with Viv (Ginnifer Goodwin). Scene by scene, it is as if you are in a Cash concert, which is alright by me, my only hope is, the audience non familiar with Cash have got to be won over by Joaquin's and Reese's performances. I'm under the impression they used their own voices, which is a remarkable statement in itself.I would have like to have seen scenes on Cash's relationship with Dylan but that is a small price to pay, and it is quite apparent, this is essentially a love story at heart.If you are a fan of Cash, then you will love it, if you are music fan you will love it too, if you are a movie buff you would be crazy not to find this film enjoyable. It begs that age old hypothetical question of, if you were given the chance to revisit history, and given once chance to observe any moment ? what would it be? Well I know for me, I would choose, 1968 Folsom Prison, amongst the crowd of 2000 entertainment-starved prisoners watching Cash in his career defining performance, bellowing out tales of desperation, solitude and regret.~Paul Browne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cash and Carter done well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this story. The acting was very well done. Witherspoon has certainly moved to a new level. No longer is she the "blondie" or child actress in any regard. She has solidified her rising status by portraying June Carter as well as she did. As far as Phoenix was concerned, it was not so simple. I did not buy that he was Cash until a mid-film point. What turned my opinion around was how he looked at Witherspoon on stage. While performing together it was hard to ignore the long stares of admiration in addition to tortured looks of rejection he gave her. I think this was the point where his role started to be authentic and put Phoenix in the right direction. I think mechanically, Phoenix was just a bit off the mark. Not suggesting that he didn't move like Cash. But he was just so slightly shy of completely grasping Cash's moves physically. As I watched the movie "Ray", I was astonished at the gestures and physical moves Foxx had perfected to the degree that I had to remind myself that I wasn't watching Ray Charles, himself. The second half of the movie, my doubts of Phoenix's portrayal of Cash subsided. Executed superbly was the struggle, friction and tension between Cash and his father. It was tangible. I also think the audience felt the chemistry between Witherspoon and Phoenix. There was no mistaking it. Only in Hollywood could an extramarital affair be condoned with the addition of drug and alcohol abuse. But, alas! We are all human I suppose. I enjoyed this story so much. I wish there were more films done with such excellent taste and expertise. An excellent job for Phoenix. An outstanding achievement for Witherspoon. Reese, the pace car is off....You're on your way to the top.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked last year's "Ray", and I didn't mind Jamie Foxx taking home the Oscar for Best Actor, but I never thought that the film was as good as many believed; it had a good soundtrack, but, like so many biopics, it failed to really convey the sheer awe that a great artist can inspire. With "Walk the Line", however, James Mangold has struck a live wire.First, I've never been a huge fan of Johnny Cash or his wife June Carter Cash; I was aware of their music, and knew some of their songs, but I was never a devotee. My favourite Cash performance was his guest voice on "The Simpsons." I really can't judge Joaquin Phoenix's performance on its resemblance to the real Cash; all I can say that it is a great performance that works on its own terms. Reese Witherspoon is the same with June; there is an extensive supporting cast of a good actors, especially Waylon Payne as Jerry Lee Lewis (much better than Dennis Quaid).There are several terrific musical sequences in this film, none better than the Phoenix/Witherspoon duet of "It Ain't Me, Babe" that, for me, betters Dylan's own version (sorry Bob, you got a talent for penning lyrics, but not for singing them).I give "Walk the Line" a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of one man's rise, fall, redemption, and love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****CONTAINS SPOILERS****A true story of one man's rise, fall, and redemption in a story that touches the heart and moves you. This man was Johnny Cash and the one that helped redeem him was his true love June Carter. Joaquin Phoenix plays Johnny Cash, a man with dreams of writing and singing music despite his father's criticism and his wife's lack of support. Johnny's life was shattered at the age of 12 when his beloved brother, Jack, died in a table saw accident yet he continued on. He eventually started his career off nicely, touring with rising stars Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis and it's here that he meets singer June Carter played by Reese Witherspoon. Johnny is immediately attracted to her but June isn't interested in a relationship because of her bitter divorce and his marriage even though Johnny isn't in love with his wife anymore.Despite having bad setbacks Johnny and June sing together and go on tour in the 60s but Johnny's involvement with drugs causes his downfall and the end of his marriage to his wife, Vivian. June stays by his side and helps him overcome his addiction to pills and Johnny's career is back on top after he makes a live album at Folsom Prison. Johnny continually asks June to marry him but refuses him every time because of her two divorces and that he hurt her with his addictions and lies. Yet deep down she loves the man but refuses to admit it. But when he proposes for the last time on stage in a concert Johnny's words of his love, devotion, and promises to not hurt her again, June finally says yes. Walk the Line is a brilliant masterpiece that captures the late Johnny Cash's early years perfectly from his rise, fall, and redemption. But the heart of the story is the love and devotion between Johnny and June and how they come together and stay together for 35 years till June's death and later Johnny's. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant as the late country singer whose addictions led to his downfall but how June's support and caring led to his redemption and Reese Witherspoon is brilliant as the late country singer June Carter who helped Johnny in his time of need despite how he hurt her with his addiction and lies but soon came to love him. My dad says that sometimes it takes a strong person to get someone out of their destruction and that is what we see here between June and Johnny. This is a great movie and should be watched by all fans or no fans of Johnny Cash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't for one minute buy Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash. I didn't buy the guy who played Elvis, or the guy who played Jerry Lee Lewis, and as good as she was, I didn't buy Reese Witherspoon as June Carter either. I did buy the woman who played Mother Maybelle, she seemed authentically downhome, as did Robert Patrick as Johnny's dad, but the rest of the TV movie-ish cast seemed too young, too pretty, too uncountrified, and?Witherspoon excepted?too thespianically challenged. That being said, I still enjoyed the movie, the camera work and retro set design looked good and the direction was understated and the whole thing actually came alive for one moment during the Folsom Prison concert scene. But the last part of the film focuses too myopically on his drug problems back then, and whatever the essence of Johnny Cashness is?which despite the black clothes includes a knowing nod and a wink and infectious Southern high spiritedness that are fairly absent in Phoenix's somber, morose, inward performance?it's buried by the film's single-minded interest in Johnny's dysfunctional courtship of June. Which is portrayed interestingly enough, but the impact that Cash's stubborn class-conscious country songs had on popular music during the 60s gets sidelined along the way, assumed rather than shown, and the film nearly loses track of what made him a great artist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not go willingly to see this, it was a toss-up between "Syriana" and "Walk the Line" and WTL won and I'm so glad. This is mainly a feel good effort from James Mangold and many of the warts of Johnny Cash are depicted, some in great detail: nothing is spared in the depiction of his first marriage and how selfish and neglectful his behaviour was towards his wife and daughters mainly through his use and abuse of drugs and alcohol. This is all stuff that was common knowledge. However, the underlayers to this were a brother who was accidentally killed and a father who blamed Johnny for being the son who was spared when his brother was so much more superior. Johnny's father has his own demons. What truly brings magic to the screen are the performance of the two leads and their surprisingly incredible voices. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give their all and capture the spirits of Johnny and June Cash so extraordinarily well it is almost surreal. Bravo to all, well done! 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Walk the Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How uncanny. Today is the day that Walk the Line won big at the Golden Globes, winning Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy, as well as snagging the Best Actor and Actress - Musical/Comedy for both Joaquin Phoenix and Resse Whiterspoon. Today is also the day that I attended my first GV Surprise Screening, and Walk the Line was shown.You've got Elvis, and you've got Johnny Cash. Walk the Line chronicles the life of country music legend JOhn R. Cash, who performed alongside other music legends like Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis. It also tells of the struggles of one man's determination to make music his life, the reliance and subsequent battle against drugs, and looks into his various relationships. Sound familiar? Of course it does. Walk the Line is in 2005 (locally 2006) what Ray was in 2004 (locally 2005). I know it's probably unfair at making the comparison, given that both musicians' music are so different. But the way the narrative is structured for Walk the Line, resembled that of Ray's quite a bit, that you might think you know what would go next when you substitute Jamie Foxx with Joaquin Phoenix. Both had to pick up music, both won nods for their accurate portrayals, and both had to sing in their actual voice. Drawing parallels, we see how both draw inspiration from their life encounters and encompass them into musical lyrics, how stardom grew in their heads, how succumbing to drugs screwed everything up, and how they harness creativity in making comebacks.While Ray was a more personal look into Ray Charles' extraordinary career, Walk the Line seemed to have tried to cover more ground, but somewhat loses its focus occasionally. Too many subplots just got tied up at the end without much detailed exploration, like the strained relation between Johnny and his father (played so stoically by Robert Patrick), whom the former is blamed for the death of his beloved brother, or the struggles June Carter (Resse Whiterspoon) has to face being a divorcée in days were marriage is sacred. Equally glossed over too is the matrimony development and deterioration between John and his wife Vivian - we know he loves her and managed to provide her material needs, but all she longed for is his presence. Sigh, sometimes you can't have the cake and eat it too. He works hard to build up his career (therefore spending a lot of time on the road), and can't seem to juggle and find the work-life balance.Where does Resse come into all this you say? She plays his best friend and fellow performer on the road, June Carter. It's like the third (married) party coming into the life of a lonely married man giving in to temptation. She tried her darndest best to reject Johnny, but ultimately caved in to his persistence.But both of them, when paired up on screen singing their songs, have the exact same power as Ray's in having you tap/sing/groove along to the tunes. Their chemistry is a delight to watch. If you're not too acquainted with Cash's music, this is as good an opportunity to do so. Until the drugs rear their ugly head and the tunes just stopped while he undergoes some soul-searching rehabilitation. A pity that his comeback at recording live at Folsom Prison, was too short, otherwise it would have been a really good way to cap it all off.It's a good film nonetheless, though I felt that those who have watched Ray might have sensed a deja-vu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Electrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a thoroughly engrossing film, wonderful for its music, for its acting, for the direction of James Mangold, for its costumes, and for its examination of only a portion of Cash's life.The music is Cash's music but all the performances which we see Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon do belong to them. Their performances are not lip-synched performances of Cash and Carters' renditions. Phoenix captures Cash's gravelly bass fantastically. Cash's voice was so deep and is so distinctive that it is truly a credit to Phoenix that he could do a credible version of Cash. He captures the huskiness, the throatiness, and the depth of Cash's voice wonderfully. Phoenix has charisma to burn and in his embodiment of a man who gets caught up in the excesses of the "rock 'n' roll lifestyle", is haunted by the loss of his brother and whose conflicted relationship with his father maddens him, Phoenix captures a big-hearted, generous, soulful man who is vulnerable to the temptations available to him on the road.Phoenix is phenomenal throughout the movie - from his early desperation to support his wife which leads him to perform an inspired version of "Walk The Line" for Sun Records founder Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), to a scene in a diner in which he has a lengthy chat with June Carter (Witherspoon), to a scene in which a down-on-his-luck Cash stumbles on foot through the rain to Carter's house outside Memphis to beg for her affection, to a scene in which he figuratively thumbs his nose at the warden of Folsom State Prison and fires up the inmates by performing with extra vigor when the warden had asked him not to.Reese Witherspoon is not to be outdone though. June Carter was as big-hearted as her husband but stronger than him - unwilling to tolerate his carousing or pill-popping. She is obviously attracted to him but keeps her cool until he gets his act together. The whole time, she deals with being a divorced single mother in a conservative area where she is subject to the judgment of locals about some of the life decisions she has made and all the time she remains upbeat. Reese Witherspoon is as convincing in her role as Joaquin Phoenix in his. This truly is a masterclass in acting from two very talented actors in which they fully sketch out the interior lives and inhabit their complex subjects. They are not alone in fantastic acting. Ginnifer Goodwin as Johnny's long-suffering first wife shows great patience but also exasperation in dealing with his many problems. Also great is Robert Patrick as Johnny's taciturn father, Ray Cash, Shelby Lynne in a small part as Johnny's mother Carrie, Sandra Ellis Lafferty and Dan Beene as June Carter's parents, and Waylon Payne as Jerry Lee Lewis.The direction and screenplay from James Mangold are amazing. To elicit such great performances from so many, to have the film look so good, and to capture with such depth and feeling a crucial part of a great American artist's life are the highest tribute to Mangold's film.I said that it was a great film for showing only a portion of Cash's life. That it focused on his start in the business until the time he kicked drugs allowed Mangold to capture what he thought was Cash's search for redemption. I found the dramatic arc which concluded with his quitting drugs and committing to June very satisfying in a way it wouldn't have been had it ended with Cash's death or a less dramatic latter moment in his life. Truly this is an amazing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Walk the line was one word: Astounding, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon had this amazing on screen chemistry that, going by the junky movies that have been coming out lately, is a rare find. The movie was amazingly put together, and highlighted the main aspects of Johnny Cash's life, while still leaving a lot of the more immoral (I'm a VERY HUGE fan of Johnny cash and i'm not saying he lead an immoral life) Things out of it. I saw it twice, and have already reserved a copy at FYE. It wasn't boring, and though long, it wasn't drawn out, seeing what kind of hardships the man in black had to face in his life made me love his music EVEN MORE! And choosing Joaquin Phoenix to play him was a great choice, not only are his looks even hotter then ever, but his (And Reese's) Voice was awesome. I have to say, this is THE BEST movie i have ever seen, and i Definitely recommend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a "Man in Black" fan from day one (First heard I Walk the Line" in a country bar in Country Idaho in 1956). I have always thought he was the best! This movie is truly "Johnny Cash". It tells his story, from start to finish, and does very well at getting the intended information across. Some things that occurred in his life were left out in the interests of time, but that did not detract from the story line. One of the things that was left out was the information about who wrote some of the songs he sang (prisoners), and what his impact had on prisoners that he had dealings with. This movie is an excellent job. I can hardly wait for the DVD to come out!!!!</fullReview>

How he used to hunch-one shoulder higher than the other. Stone faced.About Reese Witherspoon, heavens to betsy, she was as good as last year's Best Actress, Hillary Swank. Indeed, Reese stole the picture as June Carter who became June Carter Cash. Anyone with musical history savvy knows John lived for her and proved it by dying just four months after she did. Reese's performance was something up there with the term "marvelous." WHAT A TALENT.The movie was totally enjoyable. Not a boring moment experienced. Well worth your time and money. A perfect blend of a great true love story mixed with both the expected and unexpected. A treat for the ears and eyes with a tug at the heart as well. Simply said-A DON'T MISS FLICK!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. I've seen this film twice but still want to see it 100 more times. This movie is one of the most moving, honest, and well done films I have seen in a long time. It opened my eyes to many things. First, to the Man in Black himself. Being a young adult, I knew very little about Johnny Cash other than his name. But through the movie I gained a huge amount of respect for him, and found that I enjoy his music. If it wasn't for this movie, I probably wouldn't have been exposed to the legend that is Cash. This film also showed me how amazing Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are. I thought they were good actors before now, but this film truly showcased their amazing skills. Their chemistry was unbelievable. I would say it is the best work that each of them has done in their careers. They deserve lots of awards and praise for their hard work acting and singing in this film. It's incredibly impressive what they have accomplished. At the end of this movie I still wanted more, I wasn't content with leaving the life of Johnny and June and going back to the real world. It had that strong of an impact.</fullReview>

In this day and age of sensationalism of "celebrities" and short-term memory deficit of the general public, I am amazed that James Mangold, Cathy Konrad, T-Bone Burnett, and everyone involved in the making of this film have persevered and created something so heart-breakingly beautiful.

Joaquin Phoenix is good as Johnny Cash, probably because Phoenix knows a lot about substance abuse problems (he's in alcohol rehab now.) Reese Witherspoon is good as the perky effervescent June Carter who saves Cash. The film concentrates on the years from the late 50s to the end of the 60s.The film could have been a lot more.

		<shortDescription>Excellent biopic with good music to boot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a recent boom in musician inspired bio films, Walk the Line examines the early and often tumultuous years in the life of Johnny Cash. Joaquin Phoenix is virtually guaranteed another Oscar nod for his portrayal of the Man in Black, at turns withdrawn and viciously out of control. Reese Witherspoon gives a likewise performance as the love of Cash's life, June Carter. Both stars provide the in-film vocals for their real life counterparts with remarkable results. Where Walk the Line is most successful is its accomplishment in making Cash's evolution enjoyable while not neglecting the music he made along the way. Other real life musicians of the era make "cameos", but there's never any doubt that this is the Man in Black's film. Walk the Line is a definite Oscar worthy contender that will be hard to overlook in several categories come ballot time. If you like just one song from his legendary catalog, you'll love this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joaquin and Reese did an amazing job of bringing Johnny and June to life. I had grown up on their music but after seeing their life story it put it all in a new perspective. The ups and downs in their lives kept me riveted to my seat. Even my daughters (who never listened to their music) loved the movie. Joaquin did such an amazing job at singing the songs and you could hear the little quirks in his voice that resembled Johnny. Reese's renditions of June's singing voice was great as well. Even though her voice is a bit higher than June's, she picked up all of the perkiness and giddiness that June put forth. Whoever cast them both in the movie deserves an award.What an amazing and interesting couple they were! I can't wait to purchase it on DVD and also the soundtrack. That foot stomping rhythm in the beginning keeps going through my head. Kudo's to everyone involved in the movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad as a bio-pic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a product of the 1950s, I grew up on Johnny Cash. His music was the soundtrack for my adolescence ('way back When Country Wasn't Cool) and he was among several whom I idolized...such hero-worship inspired me to seek a profession in music, myself; this led to a media career that is now thirty-plus years in existence.Fans always exist, but my affinity with Cash took on a special significance, due in part to the fact that we both came from the same sweltering little area of south Arkansas, both were raised hellfire-and-damnation Southern Baptist (and both overcame it), and we even had mutual acquaintances, although I never met the man.Having read both of his autobiographies and the 1969 bio by George Carpozi, Jr., I entered a St. Louis, Missouri theater prepared to be the worst critic ever to have two thumbs. My surprise came in several waves. There is faithful attention paid to Cash's recollections (in Man In Black and Cash: An Autobiography), especially when the viewer understands that for the most part, each scene in the movie is a compilation of numerous scenes from real life. There are nuances ? such as the scene on the tour bus, when Cash makes his way back to June to propose. Enroute, he encounters a sleeping Luther Perkins, who is holding a lit cigarette, and Cash gently crushes out the smoke for his friend. Not in the film, but Perkins was to die several months later as a result of burns from a fire caused by his sleeping with a lit cigarette.One thing that puzzles me, though, is that there is enough fact about Cash's hell-raising to make two movies and a sequel. It's hardly a topic in this film. Cash's writings about his own life took me on dark treks where he would lash the wheel of a Jeep, close his eyes and drive blindly through the desert, expecting to crash and die. He was fined nearly a million dollars for setting a forest on fire. He was known for trashing hotel rooms with chainsaws. His epiphany and road to recovery from drug abuse came after a climactic episode when he crawled into a cave that was well-known to be a hopeless series of labyrinths, in an attempt at a final escape from the world. How come no one has ever done a movie about any of this? Finally, Joachim Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, both gifted and skilled actors, don't look or sound like Johnny and June, but they have enough talent to make the play work. The choice for supporting players was a bit disappointing (with all the Elvis impersonators on the planet, one would think it wouldn't be tough to find an actor who looks like the King), but there is one breathtaking bit of casting that deserves some award or reward. Dan John Miller as Luther Perkins is the dog-goned-est reincarnation I've ever seen on a screen. Other than that, the casting is so-so.But I highly recommend this film for the story, the sound, the music and the energy. If ol' Johnny is helpin' out St. Peter right now, he's probably gotten permission to take his show into Hell, itself and entertain the damned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's tough for a movie to appeal beyond its target audience, but this one does. It all starts with Joaquin Phoenix, completely immersed in his role as Johnny Cash. So when an irresistible force (Reese Witherspoon) meets that immovable object, it must have been a lot like the chemistry really created between Johnny and June Carter. And they can sing too. But that's not where the movie's charms end, legendary performers (Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Waylon Jennings and the Carters) -- who haven't come to life in biopics about those legends -- flesh out and add to the story. Last year, I was bemoaning that despite Jamie Foxx's tremendous portrayal of Ray Charles, the film itself was lacking. Not so here. Impossibly, unbelievably, ecstatically not so here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh... my... Goodness...This movie totally blew me away! First of all, I am a huge Johnny Cash fan, so I had high expectations in the first place when I went to see it, and both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon blew me away in their performances.Reese Witherspoon reminded me a whole lot of June Carter - it was just like she was alive, God bless her soul, standing in my TV and singing and performing like only she knew how.But the award for actor of the movie definitely goes to Joaquin Phoenix in his portrayal of the Man in Black, Johnny Cash. As I watched this movie, and as I watched Joaquin perform, I was seeing and feeling Johnny Cash - no matter what his actions were.This is one of my favorite movies of the year, and it is definitely one of my favorite biopic movies. All of the other performers didn't miss one second, but it was definitely a movie that Joaquin and Reese made good.Props to all.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ray was a great movie and as many said it was like watching the great Ray Charles again.Phoenix may not have mastered Johnny's Voice to that degree, but aside from that, the acting and mannerisms were near perfection.Plus Reese had better be at least an Oscar nominee or Grrr!! I'm writing this before reading any other reviews so if I'm repeating what many have already said (and I probably am), it must be true.It may not have renewed my interest in Country Music (although Cash was a crossover singer) but it renewed my interest in Cash.A great Movie and no wonder it's getting almost 50% in 10's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the performances riveting and haunting. The characterization of Johnny and June are good enough, but even without them, this film would have been terrific. Joachin and Reese made this film what it is now and will be in the future. The original music of Johnny and June was good, but Joachin and Reese surpassed their singing in all aspects. I cannot get enough of the movie soundtrack (which I purchased immediately after I saw the film). I cannot wait to buy the DVD so I can watch Walk The Line over and over. I will now be a truly loyal fan of both of these terrific actors. What a wonderful idea it would be to have these two perform at the Oscars. They certainly should win and if they don't, I will be tremendously sad. This kind of talent is very rare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Worth Seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hats off to Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, and Waylon Payne for excellent performances. Their performances alone make this a "must see" bio pic, whether you're a Cash fan or not. The only negative to the movie was that the plot dragged at points, i.e., too much time was spent on the "down years" and not enough on the "up years." There are points in the movie ("down years") where I was thinking, "I get the picture...enough already!" Would have been a better movie if it emphasized Cash's later, successful years. For example, more time could have been spent on the Fulsom Prison scene, which was excellent. By not doing so, the director misses an opportunity to further showcase the excellent job Phoenix and Witherspoon do with the music.Even with this negative, this movie is definitely worth the time and money, and should be seen on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phoenix and Witherspoon should most definitely garner Oscar nominations for 2 of the best performances of 2005. In fact, they both deserve to win the acting awards. Please keep in mind that they both do all of their own singing in the film. They did not copy their characters - but made the characters their own. Phoenix proved that he is definitely one of the best young actors presently in movies. Witherspoon has always been a delight - but has now shown why she will have a long movie career. Bravo to the producers of one of the year's best films. Let us hope that the Academy voters reward this film with multiple nominations - Picture, Actor, Actress, Director, Screenplay and many more - all very much deserved!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was outstanding.As a big cash fan, i was ultimately impressed with how well this film captured the love of Johnny and June. The way Mangold captured every scene in this movie was just amazing.Phoenix is amazing, but Witherspoon stole the show. For someone who never got to meet June Carter her performance was incredible and if she doesn't at least get a nomination for an Oscar i'll be mad. I might have enjoyed her performance a little more, had i not seen the real Carlene Carter in a play about her mother in July 2005, though.I do think that Vivan Liberto was portrayed a little more negatively than she really was. But, i look at it as more of her being defensive rather than offensive. Ginnifer Goodwin did a great job as well as she always does in the movies i have seen her in.All i can say is, this is the kind of movie you either love or you hate. And i loved it. Even if you're not a cash fan, it's a beautiful story, and you'll even find yourself laughing quite a bit throughout the movie. And in my opinion it was better than Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see movie, if only for the wonderful singing of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie blew me away. I've been a Johnny Cash fan for many years. I never missed an episode of his weekly television series so many years ago. He was a great showman and a wonderful songwriter, but one of his trademarks was his inability most of the time to sing on key. Joaquin Phoenix, in this wonderful movie, not only sounds like Johnny cash, but actually is a much better singer. His duets with Reese Witherspoon were absolutely fabulous, and make this movie a must see for anyone who appreciates country music. In my opinion, these two fine actors, for their singing alone, would earn my vote for Oscars. The most difficult scenes to watch in this movie are the ones depicting Johnny Cash's father's cruelty, and indifference to Johnny's success, but in general, this is a great movie and in my opinion, should receive a nomination for best picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not usually entertained by biographies, and find many of them to be very slow. However, Walk the Line starts off with a bang and leaves you caring about the characters for the rest of the film. Joaquin Phoenix makes it very easy to relate with Johnny Cash, making him more than some celebrity in a movie. He becomes a very real person that you could imagine spending an evening with. Despite my usual indifference to movies of this nature, this movie was actually very interesting and entertaining. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have great chemistry and are sure to be nominated for Academy Awards. While I wasn't crazy about the guys that played Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley, the rest of the cast was quite good and made the movie very entertaining and easy to watch. Go see this film.

		<shortDescription>Walk the Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There aren't many movies that I can sit thru and still want to see more when it is over . This one is different. "Walk the Line" surprisingly is appealing to all age groups, too. I have found from talking to teens who have seen it that you don't have to know the country music era of Johnny Cash to enjoy this one. If you happen to be a "baby boomer", it just adds to the experience. Witherspoon and Phoenix perform so much like Carter and Cash, and it is evident that they really had their heart in their work. Add to that the fact that they were singing and playing "for real", and it should be enough to earn them an award for best actress/actress in such an outstanding performance. Put it on the top of your list of movies to see, and do it before it goes off the big screen. You won't be sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Cash is Humanized in WALK THE LINE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems biographies of well known figures of the twentieth century have become an ever increasing source material for high drama (Ray, Beyond the Sea). Singer and songwriter Johnny Cash and his true love June Carter are realized by some honest, heartfelt performances and vivid period settings in Walk the Line. Directed by James Mangold (Girl Interrupted) from a screenplay by himself and Gill Dennis, the film draws material from autobiographies The Man in Black and Cash: An Autobiography. An impending concert by Johnny Cash at Folsom State Prison is the point the story begins as it flashes back to 1944 in the South where the struggling Cash family works on a plantation. As a young boy, Johnny idolizes his older brother Jack and wishes for something special in life. Their mother gives Johnny the love for singing hymns while their father (Robert Patrick) is an alcoholic, stern figure. When tragedy strikes the family, an emotional, dark cloud hangs over Johnny (Joaquin Phoenix) through the years even as he serves military duty in Germany and begins to find solace in writing music. He marries his sweetheart, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), and the two have a family and struggle to stay afloat financially while Johnny tinkers with gospel music and forms a trio. When a fateful audition starts badly, he reverts to his more personal, angry music, and the rest is history. Johnny begins cutting records, dressing in his fabled black outfits, and touring with the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Cash begins an infatuation and life long obsession for June who is also married at the time. Before long, Cash develops a dependency on drugs with unfortunate results. His career at a crossroads and his home life a shambles, he descends into a self-destructive path with only June Carter as his true love and salvation. Let's face it, the reason for seeing this film is to see how good the performances are by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and they deliver the goods. There is definitely chemistry between the two especially in their duets as both of them show vocal abilities by singing their own songs (as in films like Coal Miner's Daughter and The Buddy Holly Story). It would require a strong actor to play a legend, and Phoenix proves to be adept. He gets his vocals in a deep, low range to the point you are convinced that he is young Johnny Cash! Kudos should also go to Witherspoon who also shows a gift for warbling with a country twang and acting all at once, not a feat to be taken lightly. Goodwin shines in her moments as the first Mrs. Cash, and it's a shame we don't see more of her in the film. The concert scenes are restaged with authenticity while simultaneously involving us with fluid close-ups and sharp cutting. It's nice to hear some famous songs recreated for today's audience. Even if you weren't a fan, the songs strike a memory chord regardless. Like Ray, Walk the Line shows how familial loss can have a lasting impact creatively and emotionally. The story manages to move ahead a few years at a time and important moments are rendered realistically. It is amusing in these pop music biographies to see a Who's Who of Rock n' Roll greats in their career infancies. Just seeing Cash pal around with the likes of Lewis, Presley, and others is fascinating. A lot of ground is covered in a little over two hours, but it doesn't feel too episodic. What the film captures successfully is the affect that his music had on prison inmates and how an overwhelming amount of his fan mail was attributed to prisoners who felt that he spoke to them. (Watch for a cameo by co-producer James Keach as the prison warden.) Cash was a man of the people, and the film takes great pains to show that Cash was not perfect and in fact very human. He succumbs to the temptations of female groupies, gets addicted to drugs, goes to prison, and shows peculiar behavior as he obsesses with June. Although he was smitten with her, Cash was instrumental in getting June into the spotlight to do solos and to stand equal with him. The film's momentum bogs down during Cash's downfall but redeems itself with scenes such as the Thanksgiving dinner in which Johnny confronts his father. Among the movie's few flaws is the failure to develop the strained relationship between Cash and his intimidating father (well played by Patrick), and the resolution of the film with its family reunion doesn't ring true as one would have liked. There is an amusing scene with June and her family scaring off a drug dealer who is trying to see Johnny. More scenes like that would have been welcome.There will naturally be constant comparisons with Ray, but that shortchanges a film that would shine in any year. OK, Ray might be a tad better and Coal Miner's Daughter is the gold standard, but Walk the Line does just fine and Phoenix is terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coolest Man on Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Johnny Cash chronicling his life from when he was a young boy growing up broke on a farm in 1944 to 1968 where he had just recorded his famous live album at Folsom County Jail and a live performance where he ultimately proposed to June Carter on stage. Like the film "Ray", the performances are outstanding and probably better than the movie.Jouquin Phoenix channels Johnny Cash like he's played him his entire life. He is amazing. He doesn't look like him much, but Jouquin did his own singing and sounded just like him. He also had all his nuances down including the way he swung that guitar around while playing live. Reese Witherspoon is just as good as June Carter. She also sang her own songs and look for both of them at Oscar time. She plays June like a little kitten, but also very strong as the woman June Carter was. Robert Patrick plays Ray Cash, John's father and boy, was he a piece of work. It's easy to see how Johnny Cash came to hate his father, but also respected the hard working man he was. Much of Cash's inner demons come from his relationship with his father and the blame that was put on him when his older brother Jack died in an accident when he was younger.A lot of this film showed Cash's struggles with pills and addiction and ultimately his time in prison. Some of this is tough to watch, but like "Ray" a very important part of the singer's life. The best aspects of "Walk the Line" is the music and the love story between Johnny and June. The two of them just simply belonged together.Johnny Cash was never the biggest star in the world, but he was always the coolest man in the room. Fans of his will appreciate this film for the music and capturing some of his most infamous moments during a span of his life. Other's will just enjoy a fine film and appreciate some wonderful performances. (***1/2)</fullReview>

This movie is definitely recommended. The movie I last say him in before Ladder 49 was Signs. Is it just me or has he become a better actor since then? I don't think this movie is getting the attention it deserves. I suppose that's what you get releasing around the time Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire comes out. All, well I was still very impressed. I did see him in 8mm starring Nicholas Cage. That was quite the ****ed up movie but the director was the one from Seven. Compared to being a country star he played an employee of an Adult store. I must say 8mm was quite more disturbing than Walk the Line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walks a Very Fine Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the late Johnny Cash this is for you. Unlike the trash that I've seen lately in the movie theaters, this one actually fits up there along the ranks of its caliber, such as "Ray", which was a terrific film.The film, "Walk the Line" is the story of Johnny and June Carter Cash, how they each rose to stardom, overcoming obstacles, and facing great harsh times together. The style of the movie shows flashes of greatness, while at times, makes you wonder why are you even seeing this movie? I have to hand it to Joquain Phoenix in this flick. Normally, I wouldn't even consider a Top 100 Actor, but in this movie, he looks like one. As "The Man in Black" Phoenix has every bit of him down to the look, and his vocals. He even plays the guitar in this movie! Which I was more impressed with. His chemistry with his band are absolutely tremendous, and his relationships with other people are almost superb. He, and June (portrayed by the lovely Reese Witherspoon), portray superb chemistry as the future couple of Country Music. Witherspoon gets a thumbs up performance, as she too has every bit of Carter down to the bone, down to the playing of the Auto-Harp, which is not easy to play. As assurance to the protagonist, she gets a nice jerking performance (though looking a bit like a flues in some of her costumes), but she gets my approval as the wife of Cash.As for the supporting, Robert Patrick is the one that stands out the most to me. Well renowned for his work in "Terminator 2: Judgement Day", he exemplifies himself as the father of Cash, and shows the apathetic, and harsh ways of him. His scenes make him stand out more than any other member, and gets the nod.Some lines get old ("Ex: "You look like you're going to a funeral." Cash: Maybe I am") tires out in the film, but its all worth it, as they are each said at the right times. Another brilliance by also, noteworthy director James Mangold ("Kate and Leopold"). If he can create another movie like this, he's a nominee for an Oscar.Take a fine walk, don't rush, because this curtain call is surely not going to be its last.Take a bow Mr. Mangold.9/10.</fullReview>

However, never in a million years would I have thought this would be such a fantastic combination of actors to portray Mr. Cash's life. I am a die-hard Joaquin fan, so of course I was anxiously awaiting the release of this film. I think that he is finally getting the recognition that he deserves, and hopefully in the future we will continue to see great things from him. Don't get me wrong it is not like you get lost and forget Mr. Phoenix was pretending to be Johnny, but it is the fact that he actually captures the spirit of him. I was very impressed. The movie is very short considering the long and interesting life that Mr. Cash lived. I hope that he would be proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Things Wrong With This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I had two problems with this movie. It is an EXCELLENT movie, but, when Johny Cash did his concert at Folsom Prison, it was not with a bass so loud that it shook the walls. One good thing about the music of the 60's, was, the bass was not overpowering. The other thing wrong with this movie, was that it was not long enough. But, in order to do a full story of Johny Cash, It would probably have to be a 10 hour movie. So, I guess they did as much as they could, considering the time factor they had. Joaquin Phoenix was EXCELLENT as Johnny Cash. He looked like Johnny Cash, and ALMOST sounded like him. Reese Witherspoon almost had the voice down, as June Carter, but, I don't think she looked much like her. Still, she gave a wonderful performance. All in all, I'd give the movie a 9 out of 10 I guess.</fullReview>

Then everything went down hill; his two M Nigh films did little to impress, he had a decent enough small role in "Hotel Rwanda", but faith was lost again in Ladder 49 (yes I DID watch it, and yes it DOES suck).But Sweet redemption is now found for him. He can die happy knowing he played a role perfectly. I'm a light Cash fan-but I am quite familiar with his music and had a basic knowledge of his life from things that I had read. Phoenix manages to actually SOUND like the Man In Black-and since his voice was what made him unique-this is a big plus. Throw in an equally amazing performance by Reese and you have a solid movie. It may not cover any new grounds in film making, but what it does -it does well.</fullReview>

It makes Johnny Cash's rocky career accessible to the common man, while at the same time allowing for his fans to get a few glimpses of him that are hard to see without a lot of money spent on a huge collection of DVD's and books.Reese Witherspoon does not sound as much like June as Joaquin sounds like Johnny, but performs well nonetheless. Joaquin even gets the growth of the gravel baritone by slowly building the voice from the beginning of the movie to the end. His portrayal of the first audition with the higher, less confident voice set up the rest of the movie very well.The clincher for me was Folsom Prison, when Joaquin used Johnny's rifle shot guitar playing movement. That said it all. Great movie.</fullReview>

I saw Phoenix in Gladiator and was impressed with his acting in that particular film. Phoenix not only is the subject of the story, but through his nonverbals, physical demeanor, and his acting skills he becomes an integral part of the story-telling. The bit with "Sam Phillips" telling Johnny Cash that he had to believe in himself sums up the position that Phoenix assumed when he undertook this acting role.

		<shortDescription>Johnny Cash would have been proud of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most film biographies about artists, I was skeptical about Walk The Line. I thought the film would try to make a big spectacle by glorifying Cash's life and by having to show every detail of his career so that all you get is a big convoluted opus. I was basically worried it would turn out to be something like The Doors or even Ray. Walk The Line is not one of those films. It focuses on a specific story revolving between Johnny Cash and June Carter. It has a similar structure to Alex Cox's "Sid and Nancy" where the film is about the relationship and the music follows in the background. People who know a lot about Johnny Cash might be disappointed only because they may want to see more behind the man in black. I on the other hand, am glad they did not exploit his dark side or try to unravel any big mystery behind the legend. We don't need to know the myth behind this man. Johnny Cash was a monumental figure in American music. His devotion to playing music and staying alive was depended so strongly by his relationship with June Carter and that is what makes this film interesting. The performances are superb. Joachim Pheonix delivers all the way through the end. His singing is great and at times, he really looks like Cash. I can't speak as highly about Reese Witherspoon but she carries herself as a believable strong and self protective woman. She does not mimic or try to replicate June which is actually good. I hope most people who don't know about Johnny Cash will see this film and will then be tempted to buy his music. He is without a doubt, one of the great treasures of American music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, but very similar to Ray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me state that I am NOT a fan of Johnny Cash. I am also NOT a fan of Reese Witherspoon. I do like J. Phoenix however, and that is why I went to see this film. I was especially eager to see/hear how he pulled off his role since he played guitar and did the singing.I was not disappointed! Recently I've gotten fed up with how "trendy" listening to Johnny Cash has become. I have a friend in a punk rock band, and when I visited him last, he was playing J.C. Since my friend is from Arkansas, I figured I'd let it slide. But, after hearing the J.C. versions of Depeche Mode and Nine Inch Nails songs on the radio vs. their own renditions, I had had enough. I made a conscious decision to not listen to Johnny Cash.Well, during the movie I found myself tapping my feet, and wondering if I should get a greatest hits album, or pick up a few of his better albums. I have yet to buy a Cash album, but this movie was so good, I think I may end my boycott of listening to Johnny Cash. I do hope however, that the radio station I listen to plays the DM and NIN versions of the songs, and not Cash's versions.I couldn't help but notice how similar this movie was to Ray. Not to take anything away from the casts' performances, but this is basically Ray w/a white cast. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the movie, it was just told in a very similar manner to Ray.Not being a Reese Witherspoon fan, I normally don't pay much attention to her. But she was incredible in her role as June Carter. She was cute, bubbly, funny, and so believable, I forgot it was her.Mr. Phoenix was amazing as Mr. Cash. I never forgot that it was J. P, but he was fantastic. He did an incredible job w/both the singing and the guitar playing.If Jamie Foxx deserved the Oscar for Ray, Mr. Phoenix deserves it for his role as Johnny Cash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without a doubt the best movie I have seen in a long time and the only movie I have ever paid to see twice. Joaquin Phoenix was able to capture the essence of the man in a way that gave me chills, another first. Reese Witherspoon is beautiful as June. When given the task of portraying such an iconic couple, the best that can be done is to be as true as possible to the spirit of the individual(s). I think this movie was able to capture that truth. The fact that both actors did their own vocals only added to the sincerity of the film. Nobody will ever sound like Johnny Cash and Joaquin didn't try to. He was able to find his own depth and richness much like Johnny did. An imperfect voice, an imperfect man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know this has been heard many a times, but I am sincerely one of the great and many Johnny Cash Fans! I have been to the same theater six times to see this movie, I just cant get enough of it; please please tell me this will be out on video!! The very second and sixth time I went to see this show, I took this same friend of mine with me. He, and its a crying shame I must say, has never been introduced to Johnny Cash, nor June or any fellow artists in that era. But, he went both times, and each time, he never took his eyes off the screen. He was just as fascinated as I was and has now become more familiar with the one and only, great and historical, Johnny Cash. I thank you kindly for producing this film; if I had one last request before I died, it would be to see this movie just one last time. It would be a crime, and I mean a serious crime to show this film and never put it on the shelves for the many fans to have, hold and cherish the rest of their lives, I cant stress it enough!! Thank You Kindly, Tiffany Fanning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AMAZING with a capital A</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up with Johnny Cash's music, I was apprehensive about seeing this movie. For one, I didn't know about Joquoin Pheonix, wasn't quite sure if he was "Man in Black" material. Honestly, I wasn't sure if he was going to be able to pull it off. Then there was Reese Witherspoon. While I think she is a great actress, I have yet to see her in anything but romantic comedies (I didn't see "Vanity Fair"). Again, I wasn't sure if she had the right dramatic chops to pull of a role as this. Now I will be the first one to admit that on both counts, I was dead wrong. The chemistry between Pheonix and Witherspoon was electric, not to mention the writing and direction of the film. Out of the 2 hr and 30 minutes I sat in the movie, there was honestly only one section that I though went about 5 min too long; the time literally flew by. Both of them blew me away with their singing as well...I was really impressed with Reese Witherspoon who sounded better than the actual June Carter Cash, while Pheonix sang with a DEAD ON Johnny Cash tone, including his famous wobble. Strong performances by the supporting cast members (most memorably Ginnifer Goodwin and Robert Patrick) made sure that the bottom didn't fall out. My vote for this movie, is a solid 9 out of 10, and I urge everyone to see it.</fullReview>

They were both so convinceable that you started to believe they were the really Johnny and June. I was simply in awe at how fabulous their voices were...You'd really think it was Johnny Cash singing. At one point in the movie I even closed my eyes and it sounded totally like Johnny Cash but it was Joachim doing his own singing. The movie flowed so well that near the end I wanted it to continue. Never a dull moment in the story.A totally awesome movie...A must see even if you were never a Johnny Cash fan like me. It has Oscars written all over it....from the story line to the actors. Definitely two big thumbs up and highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly the best movie of '05 that I have seen. Reese and Joaquin are Johnny and June to perfection. I (being a Johnny Cash fan) was worried that Joaquin wouldn't be able to pull off the singing, but he was superb when singing (although you can tell it is his voice and not Johnny Cash's)! I also loved the fact that the director pulled no punches, he simply showed us who Johnny Cash was, which at times, he was a bad husband and father, and a drug user. The screenplay was great, relying on dialogue rather than visuals or Johnny Cash's music. The dialogue was excellent between Johnny and June.I give this movie 4 stars, a must see.

This movie doesn't pull any punches and it tells the tale of Johnny Cash's meteoric rise and the demons he carries along the way. I got the distinct impression that if he hadn't met and married June Carter, he may have left us several years before he did!! Phoenix and Witherspoon must be commended because they did all of their own singing and even though neither quite sounded like their perspective alter egos, it worked in the performance and I felt both actors had stopped acting and started reacting very early on in the picture! The movie was a bit too long and it had a brief time when the story slowed down, but overall a must see and an obvious Oscar contender come February!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was F**kin awesome movie i loved it. i saw 'walk the line' yesterday and they captured Johnny's and June's lives to perfectly i couldn't believe it. John Carter Cash (June's and Johnny's son who produced this movie) really did make my year by making a movie with my favorite actor and actress about my favorite song artists ever! he really did make a great movie about his parents. It must have been hard after their deaths in 2003. The only thing i would have changed is the sound track. everyone was looking forward to listening to 'lets get together' by June carter and her first husband. the sound track does not have that song on the CD. that is the only disappointment. but other then that it was an awesome movie and i would recommend it even if you don't know anything about these two country superstars.~Rachel</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Done in the same vein as "Ray", this bio from the early part of Johnny Cash's life and career is simply superb. As with Jamie Foxx's uncanny portrayal of Ray Charles, it's Joachim Phoenix that makes this film. His performance is amazing, off stage and on, avoiding trivial imitation yet making you feel you are watching the Man in Black. Hard to imagine after seeing "The Village", but more like what we knew was in this guy after seeing him upstage Crowe in "Gladiator". And the movie is more than that, with Reese Witherspoon's coming of age, and the riveting music sequences from T. Bone Burnett. Credit Mangold for exposing the essence of Cash's motivation, making us understand a man that touched a nerve in everyone who cares about popular music, whether it be rock and roll or country. And isn't it great that one doesn't even think about the artificial lines defining those two genres when watching this film? I came away from the movie feeling that Cash was about people, about the choices they made, about the earth they dug, about the God they feared, and most importantly, about the music that expressed their life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar-caliber performances in this truthful telling of Johnny Cash's early life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give incredible portrayals of the early Johnny Cash and June Carter in this effort of James Mangold ("Girl, Interrupted"). The film chronicles the early career of Cash and his life, marred by thoughts of guilt over the death of his older brother (a topic expressly probed in 1980's "Ordinary People"). Phoenix truly embodies The Man In Black's persona as a young man (in an Academy Award worthy role) , and Witherspoon completely sheds her persona of being a sweet-natured good girl (a la "Legally Blonde" and "Sweet Home Alabama") with a mature, Oscar-worthy performance of June Carter, and her solo on the autoharp is worthy of a nomination itself. Phoenix captures all of Cash's early demons, from his first marriage to Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), to his historical meeting with Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), to his notoriously volatile courtship of June and their engagement in 1968, the same year of Cash's "Folsom Prison Blues" in concert. This film is definitely a must-see. Give these roles a thorough look-see and extreme consideration come Awards time. ***1/2 of ****</fullReview>

I would advise anyone with the love of music to go see this movie. I took my teenage daughter who also enjoyed this movie. So I would say that this movie is for all ages. If anyone out there doesn't know the true life of johnny cash then go see the movie. I cried, I laughed, And I even danced in my chair to the music.

Joaquin had a tougher role but he came through beautifully in expressing the angst and struggle in JC's life.The actors did a very credible job singing and the drama around their relationship was interesting and poignant.JC was a brilliant songwriter and singer who took some wrong paths on his road to fame and somehow lived to tell about it.

		<fullReview>Going to see a biography is usually nerve racking--don't waste my time with a bunch of fiction and try to sell it as someone's life story. I was relieved to see that "Walk the Line" was produced by Johnny and June's son John Carter Cash. From what I have personally read and watched on such show's as "Biography" on A&amp;E, this film stays true to Mr. Cash's experience as a share cropper's son to his struggle with drugs and alcohol. The depiction of Mr. Cash's relationship with June Carter Cash is not at all "corny", but pretty uplifting. Joaquin Pheonix IS Johnny Cash, especially on stage. I went for Reese Witherspoon's performance, but was blown away by Phoenix. 'Walk the Line' is Joaquin Phoenix's movie. Bottom line-I have re-newed faith in Hollywood, there actually is talent out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk the Line, a roller coaster of emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right up front, I'll tell you that I am not a fan of any country music. So, when I accompanied my husband to see this film, I was curious about whether it would hold my attention. This film is not about the music, not entirely. It's about the man and the woman. It was fascinating and compelling, dark and joyous, and left me with a feeling of having gotten to know two people whom I'd never met. The acting is superb. Witherspoon is fabulous. Phoenix reaches down and finds the dark places with adept skill. The actor who plays the father is extraordinary. The camera work heightens the feeling of getting inside the skin of the characters through tight close-ups that can almost make the observer uneasy over the intrusion. In the middle of the film, I caught myself thinking that I didn't like these people very much. By the end of the film, I did. In Walk the Line, I always cared even when I strenuously disapproved of them. This film wrenches emotion from the viewer. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk the Line glows like a ring of fire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Powerfully emotional and musically triumphant, "Walk the Line" lives up to its title in presenting the turbulent life of music legend Johnny Cash. Director James Mangold does not simply capture Cash's life but also expertly shows the emotional hell and physical pain he endured on the road and at home. Mangold's direction succeeds especially well in laying out the love story between Cash and his wife, June. To say the portrayals of the Cashes by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are well done would be an understatement. The actors pull off such a brilliant performance that it is a mirror image of the singing duo. Even to those who are not fan's of Cash's music, "Walk the Line" will make you a fan of his life.Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) had a troubled childhood growing up in Arkansas. His family was poor and his father (Robert Patrick) always looked down upon him. His solace lied in music taught to him by his mother. While working as a salesman, Cash comes across a record company who offers his band a tryout. Impressed with Cash's new style of music and lyrics, the producer places Cash on tour with big names such as Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis. While on tour, Cash meets singer June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) whom he relentlessly attempts to woo for many years. The riggers of the tour also take a tremendous toll on Cash as he succumbs to the rock star lifestyle and suffers the consequences of those actions. When Cash hits bottom, only he has the capability to clean himself up to get his career and his life back on track.James Mangold's direction is a wonderful tool is telling Johnny Cash's life story. His style provides a foreshadowing of future events and yet does not give away any of the story. Mangold's camera work and use of lighting are essential in capturing the mood of the setting and Cash's emotions. The devices also come into play in camouflaging Phoenix into Cash. Mangold's increase of lighting and turbulent camera movement illustrates Cash's troubled mind and anger and the emotion emits through the screen. Through these devices, the audience is able o better understand Cash's state of mind and his own rationalities for his actions.Mangold along with screenwriter Gill Dennis create a great adaptation to the life of Johnny Cash. Basing their story from two of Cash's autobiographies, they achieve an admirable feat by not simply focusing the terrible things Cash did and experienced. Throughout the film, Mangold and Dennis manage to alive keep the flirting and love that flows between Cash and Carter. No matter the depth of the trouble Cash finds himself in, Carter is always by his side and the theme is never forgotten.Portraying a musical icon with the charisma and talent of Johnny Cash cannot be a mere impression of the man. It is in this truth that the Man in Black made the perfect choice in selecting Joaquin Phoenix for the role. Phoenix excels in not only capturing the mannerisms and personality of the legend but also succeeds in playing guitar and singing as Cash did. While Phoenix does slip a few instances with his vocals, he more than makes up for it with his acting ability. This comes into play throughout the film as Phoenix has to carry on a wide range of emotions: anger with his father, love for June Carter, and the heartbreak of disappointment. Reese Witherspoon is equally amazing in challenging the persona of June Carter Cash. Witherspoon achieves her own singing and musical performances that rivals and at times surpasses her co-star. As June Carter, Witherspoon emits a different kind of pain. Whereas Johnny Cash did not care what people thought of him, Carter endured criticism for her personal life decisions. Witherspoon's portrayal makes her a very sympathetic character that the audience will rally behind and support. In a not to be forgotten supporting role is Ginnifer Goodwin as Cash's first wife, Vivian. Goodwin makes Vivian an equally sympathetic character who loves her husband and wants him to be home with the family. Goodwin depicts Vivian well as a devoted wife who stood by her husband as best she could through everything they both endured. Audiences will feel her love and devotion to stand by her man despite his rock star lifestyle and Goodwin's execution of the role keeps Vivian in the minds of audiences throughout Cash's ordeals.Mangold's direction and imagination combined with the outstanding performances of the cast bring the legend of Johnny Cash to fulfillment. Fans of Cash will be proud of the film and new comers will want to know more about the Man in Black. The film does not pull any punches in telling Cash's life story. It tells all aspects of his life and shows that even a legend can pick himself up when he is down. "Walk the Line" is what Johnny Cash lived by and encourages us to do the same.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fascinating, music-filled biography of Johnny Cash, this movie really doesn't pull any punches in graphically showing the troubled celebrity's many flaws. From Cash's rural Arkansas childhood with an abusive, alcoholic father, through his meteoric rise to fame as one of the leading lights of country music, to his hard fall due to drugs and alcohol and eventual redemption through the love of a strong-willed, grounded woman.River Phoenix gives a great performance, channeling Cash's powerful bass voice and awkward guitar style- despite his lack of any resemblance to the real Johnny Cash. But the real star of this movie is the amazing Reese Witherspoon, who perfectly captures the on-stage charm and wit of June Carter, while showing the courage and determination of a show-biz veteran. Both stars show their incredible range of talents by doing their own singing and playing, too. Great script, rising well above what lesser talents would've turned into an overly long "True Hollywood Story", and showing the real heartaches and strength of two great American talents,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WALK THE LINE : Strong Film, But It Suffers From A Flawed Beginning...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WALK THE LINEWALK THE LINE is a flawed, yet consistently engaging film. Though the movie falters at some points, there is constantly something on screen to keep the film enthralling.My main problem with WALK THE LINE came in the first 45 minutes before the entrance of June Carter. Simply, the movie feels too standard... too been there done that... and too unfocused. The first 45 minutes are spent showing us the major points in Johnny's life before June (the death of his brother, his constant love of music, his struggles in the service, etc.). Considering this is typical fair to expect from a biopic, then why was this the most disappointing part of the film? Because the quality film the director has made is not a Biopic, but a love story/2 person biopic. Johnny Cash is a fascinating man on his own, and I'm sure had a biopic been made to specifically focus solely on him there would have been a great film there. But the first 45 minutes seem to me like the director simply wants to get to the June Carter story as soon as possible.Once we get to the point of June's arrival, the movie gains a focus it hadn't had at first. It seems the director and screenwriters true passions were in telling the story of Johnny and June... and they should have realized this instead of being confused for the first 1/3 of the film about which story they are actually telling.However, this is not to say the film is faulted. The troublesome first 1/3 is indeed flawed, but still never sinks lower than a good-yet-standard biopic. And what saves the film from being severely marred by it's opening is the performance of Joaquin Pheonix.Pheonix is engaged in the role and has a focus from the get-go... even when an overall focus is missing from the film itself. Pheonix carries the first third of this film on his shoulders, and keeps it going through till the end. Ironically, the strongest part of his performance was how endearingly vulnerable he was able to make himself regardless of the terrible things he'd done.And as for Reese Witherspoon, she matches Pheonix on every level and is phenomenal as June Carter. Two reasons for the film's improvement upon her arrival are... 1.) The film finally becomes focused and all the elements come together... 2.) Her performance is just so damn magnetic.Overall, it's a great film featuring two incredible, Oscar Worthy performances. And despite the fact that it is far from perfect at first, the film sends you out of the theater on such a high that I had temporarily forgotten how disappointed I was at the start....

		<shortDescription>I shot a film in Memphis...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poor boy grows up in rural America, overcome adversity and becomes a successful musician, repeatedly overcoming the scepticism of the music industry to achieve massive hits. But he struggles with the emotional strain of retaining a wife at home and a mistress out on the road; and also with an addiction to drugs. After facing some criticism for confronting social problems, he is finally accepted as a national treasure, and the story ends with a caption telling us he continued to make music until his old age. Meanwhile, the film stars an actor with an uncanny physical resemblance to the real thing, who even contributes to his own musical turns in the movie; but there are a few slightly corny scenes where the writing of a particular song is linked just a little too directly to events in the character's life. Now, this could be a synopsis of 'Walk the Line', but it just as easily be a synopsis of 'Ray', the biopic of Ray Charles released a couple of years earlier. From which one can note how if you take an authorised biography as your source material, it follows that your going to get a certain sort of product as a result. But 'Walk the Line' suffers a bit from the comparison: although personally I prefer the music of Mr. Cash to that of Mr. Charles, the latter's story is more remarkable: black, blind, addicted to heroin, he refused to play segregated venues; whereas Cash, unloved by his father, addicted to prescription drugs, and who recorded an album in a prison, appears to be trumped on most of these points. Additionally, the story features a large role for Cash's eventual second wife, June Carter, who did write 'Ring of Fire' but who is otherwise uninteresting. If you don't like Cash's music, the film will probably leave you cold. But for anyone whose blood runs chill on hearing Cash's deep bass voice sing "I shot a man in Reno", the movie will still appeal, and with the likes of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis included in the dramatis personae, it's a history, not just of Cash, but of the birth of rock-and-roll.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The consultants for this movie were not checking their facts properly-there's a long list on here of mistakes and some even they have not mentioned. Thus when Jerry Lee Lewis is shown at the dawn of Cash's career he'd only made one single-and thats if it was supposed to be 1956! Lewis Boogie never appeared till well into the 60s! And though Johnny Cash may have written a song called Rock'n'Roll Ruby it was not a Cash single at all but by Warren Smith! Its so easy to check stuff out now-Wikipedia is the obvious place. So many key events were missed out-like the anecdote told to Carl Perkins which inspired Blue Suede Shoes.Or the famous Million Dollar Quartet. Whether the fashions of 1968/9 were accurate I was pleased to see the June Carter character wearing the same sort of dresses-I hate minis. It was only a brief tour of the life of Johnny Cash in the 60s -should have been longer.I enjoyed it and would watch it again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formulaic biopic with excellent performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most formulaic and predicable biopics that I've seen. Almost every scene looks like it was written to present a significant event in the characters lives. As such it successfully tells a story but sacrifices any real character development or depth. Each piece fits together so neatly that I was left asking "What happened to the real people?". Of course this is hard to avoid when you have to tell a person's life story in 2 hours. That's why the best biopics avoid this trap and instead focus on a particular episode or a small chunk of time (i.e. Pollock). Nevertheless, the performances by the 2 leads are outstanding. Reese Witherspoon was either born to play the role of June Carter or else she has been hiding a lot of talent under the one-dimensional roles she has mostly played in the past. Joaquin Phoenix is very good as the Man in Black- especially since Johnny Cash was such a unique presence. Overall, even with low expectations for this film, I found myself disappointed. Come on Hollywood, Johnny Cash deserves better than this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abseloutely fantastic, best film this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the past two years, the academy awards for best actor and best actress have been dominated by performers seeking to portray real life characters. From 'Ray' to 'Capote', 'the Aviator' to 'Finding Neverland' it would seem that the biopic is well and truly on the up. As such, the arrival of yet another misty-eyed trawl through the early years of a musical legend, country crooner Johnny Cash, came as little surprise.Coincidentally, surprises are few and far between in the actual film. It is predictable, formulaic, clichéd and cheesy in all senses ? blazing talent saved from drug hell by the love of good woman. Yet, despite that, it is ridiculously enjoyable (and I'm not even joaquing)! The film focuses on the earliest (and most interesting) parts of Johnny Cash's life, from the death of his brother to the infamous gig he played at Folsom prison in 1968. This allows them to really cash in on the palpable chemistry between Witherspoon and Phoenix, as they battle his drug addiction and their feelings for each other. In fact, their performances are without doubt the best part about this film. Even with his first-rate brooding bad boy of an on screen presence, Joaquin Phoenix is overshadowed by a magnificent Reese Witherspoon. Her reese-nt Oscar victory is much deserved for a truly stunning performance.What makes the performances even more commendable is that both Phoenix and Witherspoon sing their own songs, rather than relying on miming. This lends an authenticity to what is already a fantastic set of songs, giving the film a great buzz and atmosphere to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uncanny Joaquin Phoenix performance in average bio-pic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phoenix's portrayal of Johnny Cash's singing is absolutely uncanny. True, its pitchy on a couple of the low notes in Folsom Prison Blues, but he has almost all of the nuances in the tone perfect. The guitar playing is adequate, but the riffs that made Cash famous aren't quite there, but no complaints. There was only one Johnny Cash. This is truly an unbelievable performance, matched only by Kevin Spacey's singing of Bobby Darin tunes in Beyond the Sea.Reese Witherspoon is also good, singing as June Carter, who was always in Johhny's "big fat shadow" in real life. If you're a June Carter fan, you'll love the singing. If you're like me, just sort of knew she was Johnny's wife, then the singing won't do much for you, although Reese does an excellent job in her portrayal.Aside from the two outstanding performances by the stars, the move is your average predictable bio-pic. I thought it was a remake of "Ray"--tormented by losing a brother, starts out as nobody, struggles, gets good, gets into drugs and (POSSIBLE SPOILER) is finally rehabilitated and becomes immortal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Met My Expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What you see in the trailer is what you get in the movie: a story you've seen, read, or heard hundreds of times before. A celebrity overcomes adversity, can't handle success, nearly destroys his life through substance abuse, and finds redemption in the end.The hook in that tired old story that this movie offers is Johnny Cash's unique musical and vocal style. On that front, director James Mangold ("Kate and Leopold") makes a mistake by having Joaquin Phoenix do his own singing. A big part of Cash's appeal stems from his amazing deep bass voice. Not one male singer in 1,000 has the low notes Cash had, and -- surprise, surprise -- Phoenix isn't that one. It would have been so easy to find a good Cash imitator to dub the songs, but because they let Phoenix do the singing, the audience is left wondering how this guy ever sold a single record, let alone millions. The big audition scene is simply an embarrassment; there is no way any record producer in the world would have touched Cash with a ten-foot pole if he'd sung "Folsom Prison Blues" with the mediocre sound Phoenix produces.(Reese Witherspoon, on the other hand, pulls off her musical numbers with a nice voice and real country music style.)Another shortcoming of Walk the Line -- and here the movie's trailer is misleading -- is the lack of a credible love story. There's very little romantic chemistry between Phoenix's Cash and Witherspoon's June Carter, but that's the fault of the script rather than the actors. Cash is such a worthless human being through most of the movie that it's impossible for Carter to see anything in him. When she tells a drugged-out Cash that he's a good person, our reaction can only be "He is?" In the bizarre marriage proposal scene at the end, she agrees to marry him not out of love, but apparently out of embarrassment.Even with those negatives, the movie is slickly made, features some fine performances by the lead and supporting actors, and has several good concert scenes. If you're looking for something unique or thought-provoking, skip it. But if you're in the mood for a dramatized E! True Hollywood Story, this one fits the bill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Actress?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK...let me start by saying that I have almost no knowledge of Johnny Cash, and never heard of June Carter before this movie was released. I FINALLY got to see this movie on DVD, and it was very good, but I just can't believe that Reese Witherspoon won the Oscar over Felicity Huffman in TransAmerica. I think Whitherspoon did a wonderful job and definitely was deserving of the nomination, however when compared with what Huffman accomplished in her role, it wasn't even a close second. The way my nay-saying friends explain it is, "but she SANG!" Which is great, but if we are talking about giving away the award based on voice manipulation, again, I think Huffman wins. I think mainstream America got it's way on this one.As a side note, (remember I don't know much about Johnny Cash), the film didn't do anything in the end to resolve the impression that he was a socially-stunted, skirt-chasing, fall-down drug addict, who essentially embarrassed June Carter (on stage) into marrying him. Sounds like a guy any of us would tell a girlfriend or daughter to stay far away from. Because it is stated that they remained married for many years, until dying within a few months of each other, we can assume that he cleaned up his act for good...but if you look at it logically, she actually placed herself and her daughters in a very precarious situation. I know romance is romance, especially when it comes to the Hollywood ending, but if it had been my best friend, I'd have told her she was CRAZY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Walk the Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A biopic with a romantic core is James Mangold's latest offering as he narrates the high's and lows of the late Johnny Cash and the woman who stood beside him through it all (while keeping him just out of arm's reach), June Carter.Mangold's film has a great opening sequence: the Folsom Prison, site of his famed concert. Shot from the exterior it's a cold building, but the closer the shots take us, the louder the music becomes -- the rousing rockabilly before an anxious crowd awaiting to see their favorite performer, a man who had it all at one point and nearly lost it. This man is Johnny Cash, and a crucial event as a child shaped his fatalistic streak and set the stage for family dysfunction. Seen as a boy, then as a young man, Cash remains the same: a man with the boy inside trying to make things work and be someone to please his father. He has a family of his own, and works from door to door as a traveling salesman until he goes by a recording studio and gets the notion that he too could become a music performer. However, his audition bombs: Sam Phillips, musical producer, interrupts Cash's band's performance of "I Was There When it Happened" -- a song with religious overtones -- and tells Cash to perform his music like he feels it. He chooses "Folsom Prison Blues" and from a slow start, the song gains momentum until it reaches a frenzy... and a legend is born.It's the stuff of every biopic: their humble start, their incursion into music and initial rejection until they strike the note which makes them famous, chart topping hits and raving concerts, debauchery, a pivotal moment which send them spiraling down, hitting rock bottom, the slow climb back up from scratch, redemption. It's all here. If it weren't for the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon and this massive fireball of energy that virtually leaps out of the screen in its many musical moments, it would be another by-the-numbers story that wouldn't even seem out of place in a VH1 "Behind the Music" series. Both of them ignite the screen whenever they are performing, together or alone, and inhabit their roles without a seam showing through. From their "Meet Cute" moment where June shows her comedic side -- a facade hiding her own inner fears of being a failure -- to the later events in which Cash will find himself relying on her (and her family) to simply live, they are perfect in bringing this love story to light. We believe that in essence, Johnny Cash and June Carter were the couple who were meant to be, and that's what makes it worthwhile to see their lives on display in this great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reese steals the show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie twice in the theater and will buy it when it comes out on DVD. I was raised on the music of Johnny Cash, and always knew he lived a hard life, but I discovered I was pretty much ignorant in what I knew. That he survived the early years of his career is a miracle, thanks in large part to June. Both Joaquin and Reese gave amazing performances in the movie, and had John and June lived to see the final product, I think they would have been extremely pleased. Joaquin was born to play this role, and he embodies it heart and soul. The scene in Sun Studios when he sings "Folsom Prison Blues" for Sam Phillips, was for me the defining moment of the movie. He went from being a nobody to being Johnny Cash. As great as he is however, Reese steals the movie from him in practically every scene they are in. She is phenomenal in this part. From the first moment that we see her, she lights up the screen and blows everyone else out of the water, with effortless grace. As the first couple of country music, Johnny and June, and Joaquin and Reese reign supreme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting makes the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script for this movie is familiar (at least to Johnny Cash fans) and somewhat pedestrian. The acting, however, is superb. Perhaps the best decision James Mangold made is to have Phoenix &amp; Witherspoon doing their own singing. Witherspoon does a better job approximating June's high, playful twang, but Phoenix's performances make you forget that he sounds very little like Cash. Being a Johnny Cash fan for almost 30 years now, I didn't expect Phoenix to be able to convince me. I was wrong.This isn't a great movie. There are no new insights into the man (then again, Cash always was an open book). The photography is pretty, but unremarkable. Walk the Line is, however, great entertainment, primarily because of the work of Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, and Robert Patrick. Definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk the Line Barely Walked the Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walk the Line was a good movie, but if you walk in expecting to see a movie about the music of Johnny Cash, prepare to be disappointed. WTL is mainly a movie about the love story between Cash and June Carter.Walk the Line started off very well. Within 30 minutes, we see how Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) grew up, his affection with music (listening to songs in his childhood, spending time in guitar shops and writing lyrics when he was in the army), and his turbulent relationship with his father ( who was blaming Johnny for his brother's death, and telling him his brother was the better son). Then we see his first audition, followed by his first gig, where he sees June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) for the first time.Once June appears, the movie felt like a repetitive song. That song goes like this: John meets June, John and June sing a song together, John upsets June, John starts drinking and taking pills, John and June make up, and start singing another song?.. This sequence was repeated 3 times. Now I know these events happened in Cash's life, but I'm also pretty sure there are other things we should have seen. For example, what were his relationships with other musicians? and more importantly, what were his relationships with his daughters? (he barely spoke to them during the movie). Also, Cash is one of the best songwriters of all time, so how did he come up with the ideas behind his songs? The weird thing is, we have two scenes of June Carter writing Ring of Fire, and only one scene of Cash writing music in the army, and another scene showing us how he came up with the lyrics of Get Rhythm (easily one of the highlights of the movie).So, why did I give WTL a 7 despite all the problems I had with it? It's pretty simple: Because Phoenix and Witherspoon gave two of the best performances I've seen in a long time. Being a big fan of Phoenix since his "Inventing the Abbots" days, I knew he was going to pull it of. And he did indeed. I will never forget the look on his face when his first wife left him. The fact that he learnt how to play the guitar, and that he sings exactly like Cash is even more impressing. Anyway, the real revelation here is Witherspoon. 5 minutes after she appeared, I totally forgot she was an actress. I saw her on TV the other night and I thought "Why did she dye her hair blond?" and then I remembered Witherspoon is a natural blond and she became a brunette only for the movie. Her performance was sweet, funny, and unforgettable. Also, she sounded like and angel in the songs, and I wouldn't be surprised if she and Phoenix start getting deals from record companies in the near future.So, I'd recommend watching Walk the Line, but I'd really love to see another Cash biopic, one that will focus on his music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cash vs Ray, Booze vs Heroin, guts vs soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a boy I visited a friend in Germany whose father had the unsettling name of Adolf. He spoke very little English and he used to sit in his great-chair and listen to Johnny Cash, hour after hour. The music never grabbed me, but it sure grabbed him, seven thousand miles away in another land. So when the film came out I was overjoyed. Finally a chance to solve the mystery of why Cash was so appealing. I felt like I was about to be initiated into a secret society. Nobody would go with me so I went alone. I wore black.I can't help but compare this musician biopic to last year's Ray. I loved Ray so very much as a film. His music was more my speed than country but the film too was a warm and loving portrayal of a man who absolutely adored his music. Ray was a musical genius, a kind soul, someone I would be friends with if I had the chance. I wasn't half way through Walk the Line when I knew, Cash was no Ray. He was angry, depressed, violent, disrespectful, and destructive. But he didn't have a fraction of the talent that Ray had to redeem himself with: Cash was not a musical genius. He just had balls. And both Cash and Ray were haunted by their childhood, and they were both addicts. But Cash was addicted to the far less exotic booze and pills rather than Ray's pot and opium. Ray was high but Cash was always low.Walk the Line was a hard film to watch although in the end I wanted the singer to find success or at least love. This was a mean guy that I shouldn't care about or invest in, but I did, so that much of the film worked. I don't think I'll listen to his music, but I understand better whey Adolf did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joaquin Phoenix, as weird as he is, managed an outstanding portrayal of Johnny Cash in this movie. Bravo! Reese Witherspoon also deserves credit for her portrayal of June Carter. I have listened to and admired the music of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash my whole life, and found this movie to accurately reflect my impression of "their" story. I do not know if the events and timelines depicted in the movie are consistent with the actual facts in their lives, but I was singularly impressed with the performances of both of these actors. In general I do not like Joaquin Phoenix as an actor, and I have never seen a single movie of Reese Witherspoon's. I have seen other movies about singers, and often the attempt to portray their music fails miserably, and detracts from the movie itself. Walk the Line manages quite the opposite, there is plenty of music from the "Man in Black", and it is perfectly aligned to help the story. You find out why he's "...headed down to San Antone...", and just who is in "...the burning ring of fire...". If you are a Johnny Cash fan, this is a MUST SEE - at least once. If you have only recently heard some of Johnny's music, I highly recommend this movie so you can find out about this genuine American legend. If you've never heard of Johnny Cash, what planet did you come from?</fullReview>

I have not been a big Joaquin Phoenix fan, but the way he sings is phenomenal. He starts off tentatively and you can see his talent grows as he becomes more confident. Reese Witherspoon is an absolute doll in the role of June Carter. Her mixture of strength and vulnerability mimic the real June Carter so well that, while the physical resemblance is not there, the emotions certainly are. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to everyone.

Performances by the actors who played Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Roy Orbison are also to be noted. The story line follows Johnny's and June's love story tenderly and accurately. My favorite scene is Johnny's marriage proposal to June on stage. Considering both Joaquin and Reese both learned how to play musical instruments and performed their own songs, they should receive, at the very least, Oscar nominations. Both their musical performances (singing and playing) are excellent!!! Very enjoyable film in all respects.</fullReview>

And it's nice to see a regional film shot on location in the real places that does not condescend to southern accents or culture. It gets a bit repetitive, maudlin and dirge-like as Johnny's ache for June wears on, and the film's examination of Cash's drug-addled, room-wrecking cliché of a superstar life don't go beyond your average "Behind the Music" episode. It's kind of sick how we celebrate the antics of self-destructive misfits instead of trying to get them some help, but at least Cash fell in love with a woman who was not an enabler.

		<fullReview>This movie was everything that Ray could have been. It followed a distinct line of young Cash's life, yet didn't weigh you down to where it became a drudge to watch. For example, his strained relationship with his father. It showed you just enough to let you know it happened. It didn't show you every painful little detail. Also, the death of his brother was shown in tasteful memory with him touching the saw at Folsom Prison. Not the over-dramatic portrayal of Ray Charles feeling water on the floor and a hand grabbing him. Cash's memory of his brother wasn't done in such a over the top manner, making it much more realistic. Phoniex (sp) does a spectacular job, from the stage antics to sounding like Cash enough that this didn't have to be a lip-sync film with two different voices. (Those of the actors and those of the original performers.) I felt Witherspoon was a little more attractive that June Carter, but really captured her voice and mannerisms. If this movie does not win an Oscar, then the Academy really is as rigged as everyone already thinks it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Reese Witherspoon did a remarkable job in her role as June Carter. And she can SING!That was the most delightful discovery about her performance in Walk the Line. She did a credible job, even if she took few risks with her role. In fact, hers was probably one of the least demanding roles in the film. The risk-taker in this one is, hands down, Joaquin Phoenix. He said he knew nothing about picking a guitar and never sang before in his life. He was terrified, by his own account and worked really hard to develop his character.He succeeded wonderfully well! There is a temptation to compare this film to last year's RAY. Don't give in to it. RAY was a traditional biopic, this was, at it's very heart, a love story. The trauma of his brother's death left a deep scar on Cash's family and stunted his relationship with is father. Even as he achieved greater success, there was always the gnawing desire to win the approval of a hard, bitter man. His father's emotional abuse and menacing behavior informed Cash's actions, including his pursuit of June, even more than he was willing to acknowledge. She was the love of his life, from the moment he heard her perky voice on the radio as a child until the day he died, four months after her passing. The consummation of that love affair was a healing experience. It was, in truth his rescue. If you approach this film expecting something like RAY, you will be disappointed. If you approach it as the love story it truly is, you will be delighted. Joaquin deserves an Oscar nomination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, even if you're not a fan of Cash's music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'm pretty sure those weren't Johnny Cash's original recordings, so I wonder who did the vocals?" Stephanie, a bigger Cash fan than I, posed the question after the movie. She was duly impressed when I informed her that Phoenix did all of Cash's vocals with no dubbing.It serves as a testament to Joaquin's dedication to the role. In addition to performing the vocals, he also learned to play the guitar from scratch. And lest we take anything away from Ms. Witherspoon, she performed her own vocals as well and had to learn the auto harp. Maybe this won't impress some of you as much as it does me, but I thought it went a long way in adding a more personal touch that a biography such as this needs to succeed.Another thing that a biography needs to succeed is an ability to condense one man's entire life into a two hour timeframe. How do you take the life of a country music legend and effectively tell a story of family turmoil, military service, music success, drugs, infidelity, and redemption all within such a short amount of time? I don't know, but I recommend you watch Walk the Line for an example of how it can be done.I expect Joaquin to be listening for his name on Oscar night. He puts in such a believable performance that you don't have to be a fan of Cash's music to be interested in his story. We see from the beginning that the traumatic death of Cash's older brother will never cease haunting him. But it's Joaquin that really shows us how this dreadful memory won't allow him peace. His father wishes it was he that the devil took, his wife never seems to fully embrace his career or the fact that he has to live on the road so often, and the road itself contributes to his dependence on drugs.Indeed Cash becomes a man who can't resist temptation.Ironically, it's one of those temptations that eventually becomes his savior - June Carter, portrayed so smoothly by Reese Witherspoon that I won't be surprised if she too will be listening for her name on Oscar night. As the relationship between Cash and Carter develops, the movie shifts from the chronicle of one man's life into a genuine love story. It's not until he risks losing her love that he realizes life can be a failure despite whatever success might come.Consequently, Walk the Line has something to offer audiences that don't wear black dusters and kicker boots. But those who are most interested in the musical aspect of Cash's journey will go home satisfied. I particularly enjoyed watching the correlation between Cash's life experiences and how they influenced his songwriting. Keep a close eye on the scene where Cash strolls the streets of Memphis and watches as a young boy and his dad rhythmically shine shoes and then later on listen closely when Cash sings his hit Get Rhythm. Subtlety reigns supreme, but it's clear enough to give us a glimpse of the man's process.Younger audiences that don't warmly embrace biopics may not find themselves enthralled with Walk the Line, but anyone who likes a good character study or a true-to-life love story should be thoroughly entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I predict this movie will have wide appeal. I can't say that I was ever a fan of Johnny Cash; I was born in 1949 and liked the Beatles, Neil Sedaka, etc. HOWEVER, I FEEL THIS IS A FANTASTIC MOVIE! My Mom, my husband, and my brother all agreed it was excellent, absolutely excellent. The music is toe-tapping wonderful. The plot is riveting. The acting is amazing. The cinematography is compelling. I may make an exception to my rule and see it TWICE. Especially noteworthy are of course Phoenix and Witherspoon (how can they sing so well?!?), and the actress who played Johnny Cash's ex-wife. If you hesitate to see this movie because you aren't a great fan of Johnny Cash or biographical films, trust me and see the film anyway!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Slow Burning Country Man Heats Up The Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's great to see a movie where talent shines and music rocks! When I first saw that preview, it was a bit strange to see Reese as a brunette. Now I can't imagine her going back to just a blonde. She is fantastic in this film and shows how truly talented she has always been. She also does some really good singing. She is also a perfect match for a man who gives a fiery performance, as the man in black.Phoenix's intense portrayal of the man who must endure a life of pain and conflicting emotions is a refreshing country biography, after so many films that a bit self-important in their over-adoration of their biographical tributes. Here is man, whose major accomplishment is to share with us how life treats him, who is unable to conquer his demons easily, and who is lucky enough to find a match for him in his travels through life.Not a big fan of country music myself, but I couldn't help going with the beat and admiring every one of the numbers that Ms. Witherspoon and Mr. Phoenix recreate for us in the screen. Here is a film that should be honored later in the year. It certainly ranks as an honest and entertaining film, one that shows admiration for the man it portrays, doesn't sanctify, condemn, or dehumanize him in any way to suit the studios or satisfy the masses. As a matter of fact, one of the most bone-chilling moments is seeing that zealot in the middle of the film criticize June in the store. It is horrible to see our losing the ability to understand and truly see ourselves. The film is fair and gives everyone a chance to show how music can somehow at least help us go on and deal with life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Performance of Johnny Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This performance could win Mr. Phoenix an Oscar for Best Actor. He has done an outstanding job of portraying Johnny Cash. His singing and the way Cash stood on the stage when performing couldn't have been better. And Reese, what a delight she was! She was bubbly, feisty, and her singing as June Carter- well who would have thought she could do that! One thing I learned is how far back Johnny and June goes. He first heard sing on the radio in 1944.It's too bad that Elvis wasn't around people who REALLY cared about him. Johnny Cash was very lucky from that standpoint. His life could ended very early on had it not been for June Carter and her family.Anyone who's a fan of Johnny Cash or country music will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple Formula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film today and found it to be slightly disappointing. I live in London where the films are at least two to three months behind and each trip back for Thanksgiving means I get ahead of the game a little in terms of films I am excited to see. Plus the price of a movie ticket here in the USA is far more manageable (at least $14 per person).This film was on my must see list and as the opening sequence rolled on starting with the major milestone of the subject and then fading into a traumatic event that shapes the future I knew what was coming almost every step despite knowing next to nothing about 'The Man in Black'.The comparisons to 'Ray' are the most obvious. Both singers lost a brother during the early formative years and then went on to produce ground shattering new forms of popular music while suffering the pangs of a family destroying substance addiction. Unfortunately, Walk the Line does not seem to delve too deeply into the unpleasantness that a drug problem can be. Skimming scenes of a few pills and a desperation for them and then the standard children crying as the parents fight felt forced, like a paint by numbers Picasso.I felt all this detracted from wonderful, singular performances from the two leads who both have an incredible talent for mimicry. If this entire film had been nothing but a string of concert performances; I would have been thoroughly entertained. The relationships between those performers (including that of Cash with his standard issue unfeeling father) felt slathered on for the pulling of heart strings. What must have been a tortured and deeply loving relationship between June Carter and Johnny Cash felt cheapened and commercial.Since bio pics seem to be all the rage these days, there must have been a lot of crowd pleasing to do. The public who, like me, might not be too familiar with the talent of Carter and Cash. Then there are the people who knew or were related to them. I have heard grumblings that the first wife of Cash was not accurately portrayed but again cheapened to look like a harpy. What woman wouldn't be upset that her husband was a cheating drug addict? Last of all there are the fans. Rabid or devoted, they obviously feel a connection through the powerful music of a legend. Too many masters does not a personable film make.All in all this film features two truly gifted actors trying to reach the audience with hollow material. They do this best through the amazing music they perform live each take (so it is said) but when it comes to dialog, the movie feel flat. With a questionable ending leaving the viewer confused and unfulfilled, I can not honestly tell anyone this is a experience that should be had by all who enjoy good film. Nor can I tell them to avoid it. The music makes this worth a look but possibly at home with a remote with a fast forward button.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Until I saw this movie Johnny Cash never really impressed me much as a person. I liked his music enough not to turn it off when it came on the radio. Now I am forever a fan of the man. Walk the Line is a beautiful story of a love that has no limits, no end.I have a new respect and a thirst to know more, for the man in black and his lady love, June. Reese and Joaquin made me fall in love not only with them, but also their characters.This movie belongs at the top of the " great love story" list. I can't wait to own the movie and sound track.

		<shortDescription>Walk the Line..........Don't miss it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cast: Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, Ginnifer Goodwin, Robert Patrick, Shelby Lynne, Dallas Roberts "Walk the Line" is the story of music legend Johnny Cash (1932-2003) and is courtship of country singer June Carter (1929-2003). The story is one of love, hardship, and tragedy which follows Cash's story from his hard upbringing in rural Arkansas, to his rise to country music stardom. Along the way, he falls in love, witnesses his own family life disintegrate, and struggle with dug dependency. Among the Cash songs heard in this movie are "Ring of Fire", "Walk the Line", and "Folsom Prison Blues".The film opens, Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) is awaiting to take the stage for a live recording in Folsom Prison. From there, he flashes back to his younger days as a child in rural Arkansas. While he is encouraged to sing gospel by his mother Carrie (Shelby Lynne), his father Ray (Robert Patrick) is not so forth-coming. He is a tough parent whose harsh treatment gets tougher after the death of Johnny's older brother in a saw mill accident. All of this will continue to affect Johnny throughout his life.After a stint in the US Air Force, Johnny settles in Nashville, TN with his high school sweetheart Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) and plan to start a family. While he doesn't thrive as a door-to-door salesman, he does get a new found ambition to be a musician. He assembles a couple of friends together and audition at Sun Records. While their first attempt to cut a gospel record does not bode well with Sun Records founder Sam Phillips(Dallas Roberts), Cash does win him over with originals he wrote while in the Air Force. Soon, Cash is touring with the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley. At one of these shows is where he meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). The attraction between the two is evident, but there are other factors why they can't act on it. Carter comes from a devout Southern baptist family who also have prominence in country music, Cash is a married man who loves to party hard. Carter is already considered flawed in the eyes of Southern Christians because she has already been divorced and the thought of pursuing a married man conflicts her throughout the movie.It is this love story that drives much of the film. Carter and Cash often tour together, making their attraction even more intense. Both do eventually act on their attraction, though it does carry it's consequences. Johnny, now completely dependent on alcohol and prescription drugs, has his family life hit rock bottom and Vivian divorces him. June now becomes aware of Johnny's addiction and while she could've easily walked away, her love for Johnny compels her to get him straightened out. With her love and support, Johnny has a new lease on life and makes the most of it. The film ends with Johnny and June ready to exchange vows. They would never leave each other's side until June's death in May of 2003. Johnny would follow her 4 months later.The best acting in this film came from it's two headliners, Phoenix and Witherspoon. I had my doubts originally with Phoenix. He did his own singing in this film which almost gave me reason not to see this film. But as the film progresses, Phoenix falls right into the role of Johnny Cash and I will expect an Oscar nomination for both Phoenix and Witherspoon. You don't even have to be a fan of country music to love and understand this very human story. Definitely do not miss this one.(A little Johnny Cash trivia for ya- Cash is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, Songwriter's Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding acting and music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a good movie! My friend and I whispered this to each other several times during the movie. If you like mature biographies, superb acting, and terrific music, then you should like this. Never mind the critics who moan that the story follows "the standard biopic formula." I think that they've been too jaded by watching too many movies to appreciate a good, real-life story.Phoenix and Witherspoon were superb in this engrossing, true story of the love and music of two legendary star musicians. Many others have already praised them for their acting and singing, so I won't repeat that in detail here. For me, it was important to know that the real Cash and Carter gave their approval to these wonderful young actors. I was glad as I watched that I could trust that the movie was being fairly faithful, at least, to the facts.However, I couldn't rate the movie 10 out of 10 because of a few problems. The biggest is the downplay of the Christian content. A few allusions are made to Johnny's crisis of faith and his redemption, the attitude of some of June's conservative fans to her divorces, and her remarkable parents, but only a few. As a Christian, I think that I could extrapolate some of what Johnny and June must have been thinking or feeling with respect to their beliefs at crucial moments, but I couldn't be sure without a more explicit portrayal. Doubtless this is the result of a decision by the producers and director to avoid making secular audiences uncomfortable, but Jesus Christ was, in reality, very important to these peoples' lives. For example, I doubt that Johnny's recovery from drug addiction was just a matter of him learning to find and love himself, as the film seems to imply. After the events of the film, the couple spent years making gospel records and performing shows with evangelical services included. Additionally, for a Christian, adultery and divorce for the sake of love is not just a matter of considering morals and hurt feelings, but also of sin and obedience to God. A brief scene after his drug recovery showing June taking Johnny to church that stops at the church door just doesn't show enough about what must have went on inside them. This would have been a more powerful and meaningful film if it had.Another problem is that, according to one of her daughters, Vivian Cash was not quite the antagonistic shrew portrayed in the movie. She was actually proud of her husband's career until he started the drugs and "stopped coming home." This sounds plausible to me, and I suspect that there was some minor telescoping and fudging of the truth, besides.It's difficult covering 25 years in 2 hours, but there's virtually nothing about significant people like Johnny's long-term band mates or June's children.But I still loved this movie. Even if there weren't enough scenes for the story, almost all of the them were plausible.Some of my favourite scenes: Sam Phillips telling Johnny that he didn't believe him when he sang his gospel tune for his audition. That gave me food for thought for when I sing hymns in church!June modestly, politely telling a judgmental fan that she was sorry for letting her down when the fan called her unworthy of her parents and un-Christian because of her divorce. A natural reaction would have been to bite back or run away, but Witherspoon made a lovely show of restraint and humility.June's mother telling her to go back and help Johnny when I as her parent would have opted to keep such a loser away from my daughter.June's parents helping out Johnny's drug recovery by chasing away Waylon Jennings from Johnny with shotguns!P.S. I found Reese Witherspoon more beautiful and charming in this movie than in any of her previous ones I've seen.P.P.S. For those of us here in Canada who were wondering what that tiny town somewhere in "Ontario, Canada" (it must be too insignificant to be named) was where Johnny proposed to June on-stage: it was the mid-sized city of London! Did the subtitle editors omit "London" because they thought that it was going to be confused with London, England?! Or is Canada just not important enough in their minds? They wouldn't have done that if the city had been, say, the smaller Buffalo, New York, eh?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walk the Line has impressive performances,a great director, and a great story to tell,but in the end it could have been so much more. The bulk of the story is Johnny Cash's love and obsession with his future wife June Carter.The filmmakers looked at the wrong aspects of Cash's life to film thus turning it into a stereotypical biography movie.The relationship is all well and good but it gets tiresome and you want to see more about Cash's music and how he created it rather than his love life and his pills.The performances are dead on,Joaquin Phoenix's Johnny Cash is uncanny.I was all most amazed to find out he sang all of his songs because he has Cash's voice dead on.Reese Witherspoon gives the best performance of her career,she actually has a role she can chew.The always talented Robert Patrick plays Cash's father. I was disappointed by the film though.Every bio film focuses on the negative aspects and a person who didn't know a thing about Cash's life can predict the ending of his story. I think they should have and could have done some more with Johnny and June's marriage.</fullReview>

I was always a pop kind of listener and I didn't start liking country music until I started dating my husband. And that's when I first heard of Johnny Cash. I know, it's sad but I can't help it.. :) After listening to country music more and more I began to like it and now I don't listen to really anything other than country. I just went and saw the movie tonight and I give it an A++++++++++++. It is a VERY VERY good movie. I will probably go see it again if not, I will definitely buy it when it comes out on DVD. I recommend buying tickets in advance because it will sell out very fast (I learned the hard way). I hope this movie gets an Oscar, an Academy Award AND an Emmy. It deserves to get at least one of those.</fullReview>

The time sequence of their marriage is incorrect and the time sequence of the length of the brother's death is incorrect. Secondly, and I think more importantly, the impact of Johnny Cash's conversion or re-dedication to his faith is minimized to the point of being almost invisible. Is this because writers and directors are unfamiliar with the biography or they do not know enough about Christianity. Instead we get true love allows him to deal with his problems. I thought it would be better to give a more accurate picture of the man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected a lot from Walk The Line, and although after seeing the movie I wasn't thoroughly displeased, it left a sort empty feeling. Walk The Line was much too long and it just didn't deliver the drama the story deserved. You could distill drama from what happened (like Cash's overdose or his performance in a prison), but it stayed there on the screen and didn't come across to the viewer.Witherspoon and Phoenix were not altogether in their element. Witherspoon is far more convincing and quite believable, although not always in tune with the events. Phoenix is over the top, overacting his way into one of the lesser performances of his career. Although there was some chemistry, it was not nearly enough to make us believe in the passionate Carter/Cash love story.The biggest flaw of this movie I found to be the directing. The movie lacks pace, guts and, sadly, an interest in the lives of the characters it displays. This becomes all too evident in the treatment of the "prop" characters: Cash's first wife, his band members, even a few popular singers of the time like Elvis or Jerry Lee Lewis. They are cardboard characters. Ultimately this is true for the two main characters as well, who are saved only by their screen time.I'll have to wait till a biopic of the real Cash is made. Until then, I'll probably grab a written one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Listen to this, I am a 14 year old kid from the northeastern United States who loves hip hop music and EminEm, but after reading this review, you would never had guessed this about me. Having known nothing at all about Johnny Cash, I went to see this film on a Sunday afternoon with my father. I figured, "Ahh, what the hell. I'll go keep the guy company, maybe learn a little bit about something I know nothing about, eat some popcorn, and make fun of some odd moviegoers with my dad." I took my seat, relaxed, and after the first 5 minutes of the film I was already on the edge waiting desperately for whats going to happen next. Jaoquin Pheonix was Phenomenal, and throughout the film you care for this Johnny Cash guy as though he were your brother. Through his hard times you feel the pain; through his happiest moments you sense the joy; and through his music, you sense who he was. Even though I knew nothing about Mr. Cash, I had heard some of his songs, and let me tell you this, if I had sat in that theater with my eyes shut tight I would've thought that was Johnny Cash singing his own songs. Jaoquin put all his emotion into this film, and to the many critics say Witherspoon steals the show, I disagree.Now, when I say I disagree, I'm not saying that Witherspoon was bad, because take it from me, she was also phenomenal. Witherspoon, who played the role of June Carter, acted as Johnny's ambition, and without her, Johnny wouldn't have been able to survive. Witherspoon brings the joy into this movie, with all her pep and brightness. Her portrayal of June Carter is worthy of 100 Oscars, I just may give Jaoquin 101.Now, believe me, I wouldn't take the time to write this comment had I not loved the movie. I am usually more of a Dodgeball, or Anchorman kind of person, but this film may have just converted me to the Drama genre. Every scene in the movie hits you in the heart with something new, and there's no way to explain the emotion that you are forced to feel for the characters thanks to their stunning performances. Backed with a strong story line, this film is worthy of every award that is available to win. I mean, think about this, who really wants to see a couple of homosexual cowboys win awards, sure, they may give great performances, but being able to pull off the role of two of the most famous musicians in American History sounds a little bit more difficult to handle, and yet, the actors did just as good of a job. Give the Oscar to Walk the Line, it's the best movie you'll see in years. And if u disagree, well then maybe you should become a gay cowboy.</fullReview>

Naturally, his rise to the peak of his success as a recording artist is chronicled, but additionally, his relationships with his father (Robert Patrick), first wife (Ginnifer Goodwin) and fellow band member June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) play a prominent part in this tale, as well as his personal battle against the pills.A really, really good biopic could have been made out of this. And it should have been. So why hasn't it been? After all, the actors play their parts so well (more on them later) and the music in the film is so good (more on that later too). Alas, something is lacking in the script department.An uplifting tour through Johnny Cash's life will certainly satisfy most viewers. But as a Cash novice, I wanted something of more substance. Something that would help us understand Cash's character more, rather than just routinely showing us what he did. Director James Mangold not only fails to develop the characters convincingly enough (yeah, we see the two leads' families, but little else) but also struggles to retain hold of a meandering narrative that sometimes bores. Some emotional scenes don't hit the mark, and Mangold has a tendency to hammer home the few rather banal messages that his script has for us. (When watching the film, I thought "Alright James, we get it!" at least twice.) Yes, Cash fans. I do realise that you may not notice most, if not all, of the things I complained about above. But we have to take all viewers into account here.Anyway, onto the positives...Joaquin Phoenix has established himself as one of the decade's most dependable actors. Four films he has starred in (Gladiator, Quills, Buffalo Soldiers, Hotel Rwanda) have been among my favourite films of their respective year of release. It's somehow ironic that Walk The Line will not be one of those, for his portrayal of Johnny Cash is definitely one of his better portrayals. It's especially enjoyable to watch him perform Cash's material on stage (and yes, he did sing the songs himself). Unfortunately, the script doesn't allow him to inhabit Cash's character entirely, and that may well cost him the Oscar.As June Carter, Reese Witherspoon brings her usual charm back to the screen. Thankfully, there are no traces of Elle Woods in this down-to-earth portrayal. She even manages to flesh her character out a little near the end of the film. It's not quite an Oscar-worthy performance, but it is very impressive nonetheless. She and Phoenix help to keep you almost consistently interested in the proceedings, and the supporting cast capably assist them.Finally...I must mention the music. The decision to hire O Brother, Where Art Thou?'s composer, T-Bone Burnett, was inspired. Don't be surprised to find yourself humming some of the songs you hear after you have seen the film.The above elements are enough to make Walk The Line a watchable film, if not a particularly inspired one. One thing it has definitely done is make me interested in finding out more about the life, times and music of Johnny Cash. I'm sure it may do the same for others who are relatively new to Cash's material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The performances in this film are fabulous. Starting with Robert Patrick, who breathes the despair and disdain inherent with a hard drinking cotton picker of the 1930's into the character of Ray Cash. Elvis, Jerry Lee, and Waylon are afforded an interesting take by Messrs Hilton, Payne, and Jennings respectively. No one in this film is imitating, all are acting, and it really comes off clean. Reese Witherspoon is nothing short of amazing as June Carter. Her singing, insight into character, and precision of nuance is spot on. You will be enthralled by her performance every time you watch it. Joaquin Phoenix becomes Johnny Cash right before your eyes. From the slightly higher tone of his vocals at the beginning, to the rich robust baritone that a hard life injected into his voice as he matured, Mr. Phoenix is perfect in his interpretation of this music legend. Tieing these great performances all together is James Mangold, who never forgets that this is above all else a love story, and treats it with the respect that it deserves. Mr. Mangold uses the great music and strong characters to build upon the deep felt romance that lies throughout this excellent motion picture. Country music fan or not...this is one of the great bio pics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a life-long professional musician and music educator, I have always cast a suspicious eye on biopics based on the lives of famous musicians.Will an actor with no musical training be authentic? Will the story be historically and artistically correct? Will the story capitalize only on the negative drama (since sex, drugs and rock'n'roll sell, they always seem to make movies about the tragic figures), or on the musician's contributions to the art?Past attempts have either done a passable job or failed miserably at all of these - even the best of them ("Bird" being one standout) still contained errors that bother a real musician (fingers not moving correctly in sync with the overdubbed recording).The only two movies I've seen recently to do an outstanding job of all of the above are "Ray," and now "Walk The Line." The fact that these actors learned to sing/play just for the role is an amazing feat - as a musician I can't imagine learning to act convincingly in such a short time, let alone learn well enough to impersonate a famous personality so well that it's Oscar material.And the story - a well-balanced and historically accurate look at his career and that period in American music, and all that came with it.Stellar! I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

Phenoix and Reese obviously did more then justice to their characters and no doubt will be in the running come Oscar time, but unlike a lot of movies where you have a few really good actors and then the rest of the cast...this movie was carried by the whole cast, who all did an incredible job. Its funny, Its sad, It's real. See it, I guarantee you'll leave that theater running to get tickets for the next showing. :) Yay for walk the line.p.s: You don't have to be a johnny cash fan to love this movie, cause you're gonna end up being one after..cause you will love this movie lol</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get what makes this film great. I'd say it was good, but not great, if I felt that way, but I'd venture to say it's not even good. Phoenix and Witherspoon are great actors, amazing voices, chemistry... WHO CARES?I'd love to watch the two of them in concert, that'd be great. But this is a movie. And great acting does not a movie make.A movie is supposed to have a story. Man has bad childhood, Man gets Married to someone, finds a new gal, gets addicted to speed, new gal helps him, they get married. That's not a story; that's framework. Singing between plot points does not cut it. Watching Phoenix lie on the ground half- conscious, get up and fall down again for 45 minutes, is not interesting. The first 10 minutes, I'm rooting for him. But if he doesn't try new things, to help himself or have something happen until his gal locks him into a room for a month, I'm checking my watch and waiting for the cliché to be over with.Now, maybe this aspect of his life was cliché. Maybe the man was a walking cliché. But I doubt it. As the music producer said early in the film (paraphrasing), What are you going to sing the minute before you die that's going to say who you really are? In other words, who is this character, what makes him different than Jerry Lee Louis? Ray? Any of the other cliché movies where a singer has a bad childhood then success then stress then speed then sadness then salvation then story ends?I learned not much about Johnny Cash. Learning his Dad was a jerk and his gal stuck by him didn't do squat for me. I want to learn something in this movie that I can't learn by reading a 3 sentence summary of the film.Expect more, guys and dolls. Don't let hype and the fact that they spent more money promoting this film than they did shooting it fool you. Don't let them cash in on his recent passing and the Hollywood hype. Have a nice day.</fullReview>

He hit Johnny Cash dead on. WOW!!! Reese...what can I say...another WOW. I was more amazed by her. I love her to pieces and think she is wonderful, but I always see her in the cute little romantic comedies. Seeing her in something like this really shows her versatility. She was awesome. Not to mention the fact that they both(more Joaquin than Reese) had to learn how to sing and play instruments. They both did an amazing job. I was also impressed that it did so well against Harry Potter. Good Job!! I think this is going to be the movie(and actors) to beat come Oscar time.</fullReview>

The way they sang all the songs and told Johnny's life story truly did him justice. They did not make him out to be a hero like most biographies would, they just told his life the way it was. After seeing this movie you will leave the theaters moved and very emotional. If possible you also leave the theater having more appreciation for Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. I cannot describe how brilliant this movie was. Watching this movie made my boyfriend and I feel like he was so legendary that he was almost fantastic.If you haven't seen this movie yet, GO SEE IT! now, immediately!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not much of a "theater-goer", costs too much, the lines are too long, and there isn't usually a movie interesting enough that I can't wait to watch it in the comfort of my own living room! But "Walk The Line", WOW!!, this is a first movie that I've gotten a buzz to see in the theater in a long time, and man was it worth it! I was worried though, being a southerner and a long time Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash fan, I just wanted it live up to and do justice to the life of "The man in black" and his rock and soul mate. And well it did! J. Pheonix absolutely personified Johnny Cash, the first time he was on stage in Texarcana, and you hear the growl in his voice when he says, "Hello. I'm Johnny Cash.", it makes the hairs on your arms stand straight up and sends chills down your spine. But the real surprise was Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash, it's the little things that make her performance absolutely unforgettable and breathtaking! I don't know if you've ever been below the Mason Dixon Line, but we have our own way of saying just about everything. Anytime you can rhyme words like flower and hour, or power and our, well that's just pure southern drawl right there! Reese even had that little high pitched "I mean business, but can be sweet as pie all at the same time" twang in her voice throughout the entire film. I can't even describe the feeling of "coming home" that I got while sitting in that theater tapping my foot to every beat coming out of the speakers and the silent sing along I was having! I laughed, I cried, I felt, really felt something throughout the entire movie. Passion is what drove Johnny and June, you can see the passion between Jauquin and Reese, and you can feel the passion that drives this movie into being a movie that will be hard to beat for a long time to come!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heeeere's Johnny! Cash in on one of the year finest, Phoenix and Witherspoon make a dynamic duo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***1/2 Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, Robert Patrick, Dallas Roberts, Dan John Miller, Ginnifer Goodwin. Directed by James Mangold. A brilliantly made biopic of legendary country singer Johnny Cash (Phenomenal Phoenix) written and directed by the talented James Mangold off the books written by Cash himself. As did "Ray" the film is told through a flash back as Cash plays his finest gig at Folsom State Prison. Phoenix really brings his whole deck of cards to the show this time and Wonderful Witherspoon as June Carter really steals the show. Overall phenomenal acting all around and surely one of the years finest. Phoenix did a great job talking and walking the line as Johnny Cash who through out the movie deals with his career and crumbling marriage. Mangold's film is one of 05's best so far and sure fire steals the spotlight. Bravo Phoenix and Witherspoon. My final rating 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phoenix and Witherspoon are sensational</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biopic drama about the late country singer-songwriter, Johnny Cash. Structured very much like "Ray," last year's biodrama about Ray Charles, the storyline focuses on Cash's early career, up to his mid-30s, the creative period when he eventually achieved fame, culminating in 1968, after his marriage to June Carter and his musical comeback, fueled by the immense popularity of his album, "Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison." And, as in Ray, we also get footage sketching in a family-of-origin backstory. In Cash's case, it concerns the accidental childhood death of his older brother, who was favored by Cash's alcoholic father, Ray, at least as told here.Director (and co-screenwriter) James Mangold ("Heavy;" "Copland;" "Girl, Interrupted") excels in working with actors, and he succeeds here spectacularly. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, as Cash and Carter, are brilliant, authentic, captivating. To top it off, both did all their own vocals on the Cash songs in this film; Witherspoon also had to master the autoharp. (The day after seeing the film, I listened to some early recordings of Cash's hits. Phoenix's vocal timbre and timing in this movie are stunningly similar to the young Cash's.) Robert Patrick is also riveting as Cash's dour and hypercritical father.The narrative is almost a cliché of many other musicians' and artists' lives. Early promise and success. Increasing career hassles and pressures. Neglect and disruption of family life. Alcohol and drug addiction. A plunge in artistic productivity and popularity. And then, in Cash's case, redemption, another chance, abetted importantly by his co-performer and eventual second wife, June Carter Cash.Perhaps the story lacks luster precisely because the narrative arc is so familiar, one we've heard so often in varying permutations, that it no longer has legs. The New Yorker magazine critic, David Denby, has written that Cash was an intriguingly complex man, but the nuances in his character are not developed in this film. (One item left out, for example, was that Cash apparently was a community college grad before he went into the Air Force during the Korean War.) If we had been offered more particulars about Cash, the narrative might well have been the stronger for it This movie is at its best when music is being made. In the second hour, there is a long music-free period, when Cash was succumbing to the effects of amphetamines and other prescription drugs, and here the film drags. My biggest beef with many films about musicians (narrative or documentary) is the nervous tendency of the editors to cut off songs midway through a performance. I suppose I should be grateful that the editors for "Walk the Line" commit this transgression only a few times, and not as ham-handedly as in some other films. Still, with a film length of 136 minutes, there is no excuse for any song cuts at all.It doesn't help "Walk" that, following the slavish biopic convention (think of "Pollock" or "Frida"), we are offered meaningless postage stamp cameos of some of Cash's musical associates and contemporaries (Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis.) But there are also some small yet very good supporting contributions from others: Dan John Miller and Larry Bagby (as Cash's original sidemen, Luther Perkins on guitar and Marshall Grant on bass), and Shooter Jennings playing his father, the late Waylon Jennings.The parallels with Ray Charles don't end. Like Charles, Johnny Cash achieved no further artistic breakthroughs after his mid-30s. Instead, both men plateaued out and kept doing what they did best for decades to come, making lots of their familiar music and lots of money too. In the end, Charles and Cash both died too soon, in their early 70s. This film, like "Ray," doesn't achieve greatness, but Joaquin Phoenix's virtuoso performance, like Jamie Foxx's as Ray Charles, is as good as it gets. If you like Johnny Cash, don't miss this movie! My rating: 8/10 (B+). (Seen on 11/20/05). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly just don't have the words to express how I was gripped during the movie by everything in it. I hate the comparisons between "Walk the Line" and "Ray", as though the former is in some way copying the latter. Johnny Cash and Ray Charles are simply two different people, even though they happened to have similar experiences in their youths and careers. And Joaquin Phoenix was just as brilliant playing Johnny Cash as Jamie Foxx was playing Ray Charles. Let them both be praised (and every other detail of both films), instead of insisting that one was somehow derivative of the other.Anyway, all that said, I was blown away by "Walk the Line" and all of its performances and music and shots and editing and storytelling and everything and I hope everyone else appreciates it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a country fan all of my life, I grew up listening to Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, etc. All of the old greats. I was really impressed with how well Joaquin Phoenix played his role. Not only did he sound so much like Johnny, but his mannerisms were right on the money. You would almost believe it was Johnny Cash himself starring in his own movie. I remember the 60s and 70s when he looked so much like Joaquin did in the movie. I certainly hope he gets an award for the part he played. I don't believe I've ever seen anyone do a better job. Being a great Waylon Jennings fan, however, is the reason for this email. In the movie when it showed Waylon and Johnny living together, it portrayed Waylon with long hair and a beard. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty certain that at the time that scene was taking place, Waylon was still clean shaved and had wavy hair that he combed back. The movie ended in 1968 and that was when Waylon made his Hangin On album at which time he was still clean shaved and had slicked back hair. It wasn't until he was in the hospital a few years later, ready to quit, that he decided to try it one more time, "his way", that he changed his look, took control of his music and the rest is history! Was this just Hollywood or was there another reason for his appearance in that scene. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't detract from the quality of the movie at all. Most people who aren't lifelong Waylon fans, like myself, wouldn't even know what I'm talking about. Anyway, this was a great movie with a great cast and although I only saw it two days ago, I'm already looking forward to seeing it again. Keep up the good work!</fullReview>

Reese Witherspoon wasn't that bad after all who could argue with sound acting experience that is Legally blonde and legally blond 2...not to mention Overnight Delivery. But after hearing and seeing some clips and audio files i thought "maybe they'll do the man in black some justice" they did more than that...they took that entire genre and perfected a movie about it. with great renditions of jerry lee lewis and Elvis and buddy holly i was blown away. i wanted to know and see more about those characters and people in that time period as well. but phoenix takes it and makes it his own his guitar playing style and charm and shear weirdness that was and is johnny cash was excellent. Witherspoon did a great job and redeemed herself. i was proud to have seen it and will probably be a repeat viewer. loved it</fullReview>

After you have seen it, though, you will love both the man and his music. For me it was a bit of a history lesson, as well. I had no idea what the driving force was that motivated Johnny Cash to pursue music, nor did I know of his ties to other famous singers. What a full life the Man in Black has led... tragic, yet beautiful. I'm so glad that he decided to share his story with the world before he passed on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but somewhat hollow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen quite a few of these music bio-pics. In comparison, this one is better than most, but certainly not the best.There is a large 'buzz' around the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. But like the movie itself, it rings a little hollow.It is more like this movie is a good career move for each actor than great performances.Joaquin does a pretty amazing job at capturing Johnny Cash's sound and style. And I was surprised at how good Reese sounded.That might be the problem with the movie. June Carter was not a great singer. The fact that Hollywood decided to remove her very strong country twang, also removed what made her a respected country artist - her honesty.It is true that Nashville has turned it's back on this 'Mountain Folk' country sound, but that was not the case in the 60s. So this June Carter ends up sounding more like Shania than any female country artist from that era.But in the end, go see this movie. It is much better than most of the drivel that Hollywood has been putting out this last year.But if you want to see some great music bio-pics, rent 'Lady Sings The Blues' or 'The Buddy Holly Story'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Walk the Line a couple of evenings ago and thought I'd check out the IMDb response to the film and I just want to ask one thing: Has the world gone mad? 8.1/10? Did you all watch the movie and think "well I liked the singing in it, so that must mean it's one of the best films of all time"? I mean seriously, if it wasn't for great performances from the two leads, is this film really anything more than a mid-afternoon TV Movie? I thought Reese Witherspoon was fantastic and Joaquim Phoenix, despite not really sounding that much like Johnny Cash, was pretty damn good too - but that's all the film has going for it. Remove them and you've got "Daydream Believers: The Monkees Story". Nothing wrong with this film - in fact I seem to remember having quite an amusing time watching it stoned at about 3.30 in the afternoon when I was a student (just after I woke up) - but it's not in the top 100 films of all time and neither is "Walk the Line: The Johnny Cash Story" It's a "Well at least that's another two hours of my life enjoyably wasted" 6 out of 10 at best. Or perhaps everyone who reviewed this film had just smoked a fat one before viewing?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J. Phoenix was the only man that could represent the darkness of Johny Cash's character, just through his eyes. His intensity as a man in struggle is breathtaking. His chemistry with Witherspoon's character burnt the silver screen. Not only he played the man in black, I think he is one himself. Cash's passion for his woman and his music are brilliantly reflected in Joaquin's passion to caption not only Cash's restlessness, but the restlessness of love. Reese was also amazing in being the kind of woman that would inspire such pathos. She completes a beautiful love story that is really the highlight of the movie and has great music as its deserving background. With Walk the Line, Joaquin Phoenix establishes himself as one of the most talented actors in Hollywood. I can not wait to see him in roles were he can unleash layers of darkness not only of the characters he plays but of his own. I don't believe in Oscars, and although this performance should be at least worthy of it, it would barely do justice to his brilliant performance.</fullReview>

His mannerisms are almost perfect, you can truly just feel the pain from johnny cash in his eyes. Reese Witherspoon does a good job too, but she has a sort of whiny accent that June carter doesn't have. This movie is an wonderful portrayal of johnny cash's life. However, the movie is based only on childhood up until he marries June, and not up into old age. The songs turned out great, the actors/actresses remade all the songs and sung them themselves, which worked out perfect. Again, you can't tell the difference sometimes between Joaquin and johnny, but Reese didn't do as good of a job, but it is still great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk the Line is Above the Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years, I'd seen my share of somewhat good and really terrible bio-pics. This film blows everything out of the water. It's the most riveting film of this genre that I've seen since "Frances". This didn't have that rushed, glaze-quickly-over-everything quality that I've seen in others. For instance, it's based on Johnny's two autobiographies, and Johnny and June did select the two actors and, possibly, the screenwriters, which gives this film credibility. There was also the good (practical, really) idea to cover his childhood through the Folsom Prison appearance. It's only right - the film is 2.5 hours and Folsom Prison was a phenomenal comeback for him.Now, I've adored Cash since I was 6, and my family wasn't really into country, but we had the Boy Named Sue and Folsom Prison singles, so I got a good sample of the Man in Black. Having been a fan for over 30 years, I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I figured that if anything, I'll be spending 2 hours "checking out Cash", as it were.The opening credits gave me goosebumps. The first shot is that of a really cold, horrible, cloudy day with a prison off in the distance. The camera veers to the left and we see the "Folsom Prison" sign. Then we hear the fading in sounds of applause, crowd noise, pounding tables, stomping feet, the rhythm section of the Tennessee Two, and from there, it was cinematic magic. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are shown as you've never seen them before. The wet-behind-the-ears Irish fireman of Ladder 49 meets the dog-toting ditz from "Legally Blonde". Great chemistry between the two. I really rooted for the two to get together (even though, of course, I knew they would, but it was fun to see how they got together). Also, Ginnifer Goodwin bears the thankless task (hope she gets "supporting actress") of his vicious, selfish, shrew of a first wife. Robert Patrick, as daddy Ray (ironic, isn't it) serves as the villain of the childhood scenes, and Goodwin is the villain of his early career, both of whom try to break his spirit and destroy his confidence in himself. "God took the wrong boy" - "that's no band, those are just two mechanics who can barely play". Frankly, if anyone can rise up like a phoenix from those two piles of ashes, anyone can do anything. Very inspiring. I walked out of the theater feeling really hopeful about life, and you will, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Bio films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't call myself a Johnny Cash fan, my Dad always was so I knew his music and a little about him but the trailers looked good so off I went and I was blown away!! I can't say I was a big fan of Joaquin Phoenix either although I must admit he's been in some of my favorite films and did well (Gladiator, Signs.) His performance as the late Man In Black Johnny Cash was incredible. The film chronicles everything from Cash's childhood upbringing, the loss of his big brother and his relationship with his father throughout his starting years as a superstar. Drug addiction, his first marriage, his handling of fame, and best and most of all...his music. I would almost classify this film as a musical it's so full of Cash's music. It's beautiful and brilliant. Even if you're not a big fan you'll recognize some of his bigger hits and they don't overplay the songs they are just such a huge component of the film!! The script is riveting and nothing is overdone, the pace of the film is downright brilliant and every minute is worthwhile and intriguing. Next to the music the next best thing is the incredible romance in this story. This film will appeal to the absolute best of romantic fans out there. Cash's relationship, friendship and love with his future wife (of more than 35 years) June Carter is beautiful and handled with such grace and intensity and done with the perfect amount of pace. You feel everything about them. June Carter is played with equal fervor by Reese Witherspoon, probably one of the biggest stars in the film. Although I can't say the role is a big stretch for her, being she is from the south and grew up with the same influences she does an amazing job as the fire cracker June Carter. It chronicles her first two marriages, her children, her caring for everyone around her and her desire to save her best friends life (Cash.) So much is covered in the film but it never feels forced together and rushed. This is without a doubt James Mangold's best work as director and writer. He must be an enormous Cash fan because this film was made with such passion and heart. Other notable appearances are Robert Patrick as Cash's overbearing, rather harsh father, and Ginnifer Goodwin as Cash's first wife Vivian. Some of Cash's children are speaking out against this film supposedly because of the portrayal of their mother Vivian saying it shows her to be jealous of Cash's career but I didn't get that at all!! If it painted anyone in a bad light, in those early days, it was Cash himself. He was a poor husband, drug addicted and nearly abusive. I did think at times that the character of Vivian was portrayed a little shallow and without any real substance but Goodwin did a good job.I honestly would have still been blown away by this film has Phoenix and Witherspoon lip synced every line but they DIDN'T!! Both of them spent months in vocal training and instrument training and nailed these performances. Together their chemistry was unstoppable, possibly one of the best on screen duos to date which truly captured Cash and Carter and their relationship. Their performances and singing were absolutely astounding!! This film rivals and overtakes last years brilliant bio "RAY" starring the incredible Jamie Foxx so if you liked Ray you absolutely must see Walk The Line. This film is an instant classic and I would love to see an Academy Award sweep because it's well deserved. The best film I have seen in ages and one of my favorites from now on!! A huge 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best movie of 2005</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend of mine saw this at a film festival and told me I HAD to see it when it comes out. I was counting the days especially after seeing the interview on PBS Charlie Rose. I have always like j. phoenix and absolutely love Reese W. (specifically after Legally Blonde) as in that movie she took the part of June Carter to an absolute level of believability, it is her strength as an actor. I thought it was interesting that Joaquin and Reese never upstaged each other, not in the story line or in their acting, it was true chemistry as there must have been between Carter and Cash in life. I walked out of the theater thinking it would be great if every movie you walk out of you feel as good as I did, it's been a long time since I felt that about a movie. As dismal as the "movie" landscape was this year, I know that if there WERE many other fabulous ones, they will still win Oscars for their great performances, hands down they must win. In the interviews before the movie came out, Joaquin and Reese even then conveyed a certain chemistry between them as actors, not to mention that they have tremendous respect for each other as actors, it was just bound to be good. I enjoyed Joaquin in Gladiator so much, and he was so believable, as in this movie. I think Johnny Cash would be proud of this movie, Joaquin's performance was so good he could have been his son in looks and even his singing. It is hard to believe these two never sang before, not to mention having to do IT on screen. THIS REALLY IS THE BEST MOVIE OF 2005 AND MANY OTHER YEARS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been a fan of Johnny Cash (Joaquinm Phoenix), therefore I have not followed his career; but the story of his life is really an excellent theme for a movie. There are drama, rejection, music, drugs, romance and love. The screenplay begins when he was a boy, being raised very close to his brother Jack in a cotton farm in Arkansas; the tragic death of Jack in an accident with a saw, generating a process of rejection of his father; the period in the air force in Germany; his wedding with his sweetheart and the financial difficulties of the beginning of his marriage; his success with music, touring with Jerry Lee Lewis, June Carter, Elvis Presley, and Carl Perkins, and becoming addicted in pills; his fall in the world of drugs, causing the end of his marriage; his passion for June Carter (Reese Witherspoon); his raise, with the support of June, with a concert for the inmates at Folsom Prison in California; and his proposal of marriage to June on stage in Ontario. In addition to the wonderful screenplay, the stunning performance of this great actress Reese Witherspoon deserved the Oscar of Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role. Last but not the least, the wonderful songs are fantastic. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Johnny &amp; June"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long legged guitar pickin' man...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... is how the real June Carter refers to her husband, Johnny Cash, in a song covering the film's closing credits. He counters by calling her a "Big Mouthed Woman" in a famous duet of theirs. That was a very satisfying end to a wonderful film. It seems to have begun some time ago, before the deaths of Johnny Cash and June Carter-Cash, who each personally picked both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon to play them in the film before they died only four months apart in 2003.I went to see this film with high expectations fueled by all the pre-release hype and trailers I'd seen for a long while. For a change I was not disappointed. This is truly a wonderful film. Although it definitely deals with unpleasant subjects such as the psychological and emotional abuse Johnny Cash suffered as a child from his abusive, alcoholic father (played with real talent by the versatile Robert Patrick) and his later fall into pills and alcohol as a result, much like his old friend Elvis Presley; who the film illustrates as having started Cash down the same road abusing prescription drugs that led to his own, later death.This was also a bit of a personal memory trip for me, both from a similarity to some of our life's more ugly experiences and for the backdrop his music and the others of that Sun Record's miracle group in the 50's played to my own life. Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison and Elvis Pressley were all musicians I listened to primarily from about 1957 onward for years, in no small part because their music spoke to me in a very personal way (Johnny, Elvis Presley and Hank Williams are the only performers to have been inducted into both the Country Music and Rock And Roll Halls of Fame). So to see this period of their lives depicted on screen was a personal experience that I am sure has to have colored my opinions of this to at least a small degree. However, I don't think even my beginning prejudice would cause me to like the film were it not extremely good - as a bad film of something so personal would have caused me to dislike it far more. Having said that...I was transfixed by the personal presence of the wonderfully talented and beautiful Reese Witherspoon, who plays June Carter-Cash in the movie, much to Mrs. Cash's credit. Her performance has to be ranked with some of the finest I've ever seen in a long lifetime of movie going. She was completely convincing in her role and played every emotion to a well rounded "T". Even more impressive, she did a stellar, professional job of covering all of June Carter's songs (she also had to learn to play the auto-harp), including her very surprising on screen chemistry with Joaquin Phoenix, who played the film's main character, Johnny Cash. Even with the danger of it sounding like a tired cliché in today's Hollywood, if she doesn't win, let alone be nominated for an Oscar, there are no gods...For his part, Joaquin Phoenix was tremendous in the primary role. Even knowing Phoenix was the one actually singing the songs in the film going in, it was very hard to not believe it was Cash himself singing as I watched him on screen, he was just that good. He performed all of the songs himself without being dubbed and learned to play guitar from scratch just for this role. In fact, I think the real danger here for Joaquin Phoenix is that his portrayal was so very exactingly just like the real Cash that people won't notice where reality stops and the magic he creates on screen begins. He was truly mesmerizing in this role, so good it's hard to find the right superlatives to heap the praise high enough.Not to be outdone by any means, a huge amount of credit has to go to the screen writing, by Gill Dennis and James Mangold, who also directed. The script was wonderfully done, inviting the audience into the life of Cash in a way that made me, at least, feel more like I was an eyewitness to the real events rather than just watching a film.James Mangold's directing was wonderful, perhaps even brilliant. His concept of having both Phoenix and Witherspoon record Cash and Carter's music was a masterstroke of genius, assisted in no small part by the surprising talent of both stars, who may now have a second career to fall back on. Their music made the film in a way that nothing else could have. That both Cash and Carter lived their lives to bring music to the world could not have been so respectfully portrayed without such convincing delivery of the very object of their life's work. Both stars should be applauded for even having given the effort to trying, let alone succeeding in such a great way.The other actors did a great job of their performances as well. Both Tyler Hilton as Elvis and Waylon Payne (Wallon Jennings' godson) who played Jerry Lee Lewis were standouts. Waylon Jennings son, Shooter Jennings, also made an appearance playing his father.Last but not least, the costumes, set and art direction gave a rich canvas to the talented cinematography of Phedon Papamichael. Sound, sound editing, music in all respects and the perfect, wonderfully understated makeup for Ms. Witherspoon should all get mentions at Oscar time.Sony, Universal, Focus Features, Columbia Pictures, Paramount, and Warner Bros. who are all said to have passed on the project, should be kicking themselves now.</fullReview>

As the movie picked up I actually thought Johnny Cash was still alive and on the screen. I was especially impressed with some of Phoenix's body movement. He seemed to really learned the way Johnny Cash walked, played guitar and sang slightly from the side of his mouth. The "addiction" part of the movie seemed to drag a bit, but the supporting characters were so developed that it carried. Obviously the music was fantastic. Oscars for everyone in "Walk the Line."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When movies today are as bad as they are today, you get people going crazy over mediocre movies like this one! Jouquin Phoenix looks nothing like Cash, he can't sing, and Reese Witherspoon looks like a yuppie from Los Angeles more than she looks like June Carter. I can't believe this movie has received so much adulation. Was I watching a different movie? I thought that Johnny Cash and June Carter were southerners who had hard lives? The actors playing them seemed to have an air of wealth to them. This movie just didn't seem realistic in any sense whatsoever. I thought June Carter in real life was a hard woman. Reese Witherspoon seemed like a graduate student more than a low-class southerner! Anyway, don't feel like you have to follow the crowd and like things just because other people do. I thought this biographical epic was as boring as "The Greatest Story Ever Told", and it seemed like even a longer movie!!! I thought the movie about Jerry Lee Lewis was much better, and it didn't receive any Oscar consideration whatsoever. I dare anybody to watch "Great Balls of Fire" and compare it to "Walk the Line", and tell me that "Walk the Line" is better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't like it, and for good reasons, so don't read this if you don't want the film spoiled for you."Oh, did he write the songs, too?"That is the probable reaction of many to "Walk the Line", an appropriate title for a pedestrian "love story" and cursory biopic. Much like the kids on 90210 that never do any homework, Johnny Cash's and June Carter's songcraft is abridged to watching them play through the finished versions of their songs haltingly in two scenes. No rough drafts, no place of inspiration, no real influences, they just sprung fully grown from the head of country music. And wasn't "Walk the Line" written for his first wife, not June? That would have complicated things.What the film does have a lot of time for, however, is a lot of after-school special daddy problems and a "my wife is an emasculating unsupportive shrew" domestic drama. I read somewhere that Roseanne Cash walked out of the family screening of the movie because her mother was portrayed as such a pill; but didn't she take it too hard? I mean it's just her mother up there on the screen for millions of people to boo and hiss at, right? The movie needed more oomph at that point and to show a man leaving a wife that isn't the daddy's girl of Satan might either make viewers scratch their heads or?undermine their moral fiber! You'll have people everywhere getting divorced! Even more than the 50% that are right now! That is the evil that could result from showing something complex you elitist anti-flyover moonbat!We have the unexplained inspiration scenes, the death in the child scenes, the breakdown scenes, the "baby I just need mah medicine" scene (though it does vary from Bill Clinton's medicine), the "daddy you never loved me" scene. Get it? And throughout it all Joaquin Phoenix obviously gives one of the year's top performances, for your consideration, despite that he doesn't look much like Cash, behave like you can imagine Cash behaving (all petulance and no pride), or sound much like him. Oscar tallybots are standing by. In fact he only sounds like him in the later scenes where the tracks have been heavily produced and his tone lowered, the early unfiltered singing scenes show that he really can't sing and doesn't have the low notes. Note to future disciples of T-Bone Burnett: okay songwriter, good player, great producer, not a vocal coach.As for the script: having a family squabble in front of the Carter family would be like a young politician having a squabble in front of the Kennedy family. The Carters are shown as homey yokels, while superior in sense and sensibility to the weirdo Cash family; in reality they were and are legendary superstars and country royalty. How about a movie about them? From his IMDb profile it is apparent that the most important thing co-writer Gill Dennis has ever done is to be "Man with Cigar" in David Lynch's "Eraserhead." This actually tops about everyone else involved in the movie.Reese sings nice and looks nice and isn't given much to do.Other than Shooter Jennings playing his own father, none of the people look or sound like the superstars they are playing or show any of their charisma, especially the Roy Orbison, and I didn't know that Jerry Lee Lewis grew up in Chelsea. Phoenix just isn't very good, and the problem is compounded by a sense of cockiness in how good he seems to think his performance is; he was undermined by the script from the beginning, but he could have put a little real thought into the freaking thing. He really seems to think (from his performance and his interviews) that he is a master thespian. Would that River were here to show how it's done.Best example of how it falls short: the moment we are all waiting for, when the two of them finally get together, is just tossed off, the movie has no shape. But then, none of James Mangold's movies have been very good and they have all opted for shallow psychobabble over real psychology (ummm?girl, interrupted and Identity come to mind). "Ray" was a pretty bad movie, directed by another pretty underwhelming director, but I'd still watch it again over this. I guess it made John Carter Cash happy to see this boring generic love story up on screen, even if it isn't the real story.The best thing about this movie is the poster.By the way, I wonder how many stealth marketers plant fake independent praise on this site.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone wants to know if Joaquin "It's Not a Harelip" Phoenix can pull off Johnny Cash. Physically, the resemblance is striking enough. Likewise, Phoenix's mannerisms are more than convincing. But when Phoenix opens his mouth, things get dicey. It's not that his accent is bad, and he's a credible drunk. What nags are the times his interpretation comes off as... well, sorta developmentally disabled. The apex of this disturbance comes during a pillow-talk scene between Cash and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), in which he teases her with peanuts (yep), cackling like a half wit as Witherspoon drawls, "You're a mean man, Johnny Cash! A mean man!" That's not okay.Otherwise, the film wisely chooses its range of focus to be the period leading up to his performance at Folsom Prison. Nonetheless, the first half of the film drags, during which his brother dies, his father is established as an a-hole, Johnny joins the army, gets married, has kids, and sucks at being a door-to-door salesman.Things pick up when he begins his stage career, and June Carter is finally introduced. It's then that the film finds its identity as a love story. It's not the most scintillating love story, however, and famous protagonists notwithstanding, it lacks drama, most of the slack for which is picked up by Cash's downward spiral.The most rousing scenes take place on stage, particularly when the couple does "Jackson." Boldly, the actors are really singing, and though they'll get inevitable flack for simply not actually being the artists they imitate, they're surprisingly proficient. But ultimately, the film never resonates?maybe due to the film's insistence on passing over glamorization and scintillation in favor of loyalty to biographical facts (it's totally annoying to be reminded that Cash wrote a song about going to prison, never having been). Hey, honesty's okay?it's just not as fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Mangold, the director who brought us such flawed but interesting films as Copland and Girl, Interrupted, has done it again. He has crafted another flawed but interesting film, Walk The Line, named after one of Cash's biggest musical hits; this one on the life of Johnny Cash. Actress Reese Witherspoon won an Oscar for Best Actress for her portrayal of Cash's wife June Carter Cash, of the famed Carter Family singers, and while she's solid, competent, the award she won is merely another way for Hollywood to elevate the bankability of sexy young starlets- think Marissa Tomei, Mira Sorvino, Gwyneth Paltrow, Julia Roberts, Angelina Jolie, Hilary Swank, Renee Zellwegger, Charlize Theron, and now Witherspoon. Financially, for the long term of the industry, this makes sense, so that, even decades from now, films they appear in can bear the Oscar imprint.Joaquin Phoenix, who portrays Cash, however, is completely out of his league as the infamous Man In Black....Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael adds little to the film. His framing and vistas do little to enhance texture of the scenes, nor do they add an unconscious poetic element. Despite globetrotting, Cash's life is portrayed as static and dull, and the love story is nothing great. What Mangold does not grasp is that the real reason cash is worthy of a film is because of his singing and songwriting. When will biopics about artists actually focus on the art, and not the soap operatic stuff? But, if they are going to focus on the peripherals, one would think they'd play up the fascinating stuff, the legendary stuff, not the usual crap all people go through, for that merely shows that the subject is like the viewer, when the fascination stems from what the subject has that is NOT like the average person. In other words, as the saying goes, always print the legend over the truth. Walk The Line never trots down that alley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just So We're Reminded Of The Ones Who Are Held Back, Up Front There Oughta Be A Man In Black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1955, Johnny Cash is an aspiring country singer from Arkansas who is young, talented and going places. However, his marriage is failing, he's in love with another singer, he's haunted by a childhood tragedy and is addicted to pills. Can he pull himself together ?This is an enjoyable, classy, perceptive biopic of a guy who for my money is the most interesting and evocative country singer-songwriter of all time. What I like about Cash is that he was an unpretentious man; he had many faults and lived a fairly reckless life, but not without penance and reckoning, and that's what the movie captures so well. At the heart of it is the conflict in him between his responsibility to his wife and family and his love for June Carter, which tore him apart. It's not doomy and gloomy though; the period designs are vibrant and dynamic, and the great man's pumping freight-train rhythm music fills the film with humour and gusto. Phoenix and Witherspoon are both terrific and both did all their own singing and playing; he doesn't look or sound like Cash (who does ?) but he nails his mannerisms exactly (especially the gunslinger guitar style) and she belts out her vocals and southern drawl with uncanny precision. Phoenix is great in many films but if you've only seen Witherspoon in dumb valley-girl movies, then be prepared to be amazed by her performance here, which won an Oscar. The support cast is excellent and country fans should also note the presence of stars Payne and Jennings (the latter playing his own father, Waylon). Like the best biopics, this movie is dramatic, informative (for example, Ring Of Fire was written by Carter, not Cash), touching, and about someone who really mattered. There is fantastic music throughout, supervised by T-Bone Burnett and featuring many great players. My only gripe is that it doesn't included my favourite Cash song, Man In Black, but that was written in 1971, three years after the movie ends. A beautifully made and thought-provoking drama about a great musician, and a well deserved success both critically and commercially. Written by Mangold and Gill Dennis, based on Cash's two autobiographies, and produced by James Keach, who has a small role as the Folsom State Prison warden.</fullReview>

However, for someone who knew very little about Johnny Cash and his music it does not have much of an impact.Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Pheonix produce good performances and their ability to perform the songs themselves is testament to their talents and acting abilities. However, Walk the Line does not really ever progress, by that I mean Johny Cash obsesses over June Carter, they fall-out, he copes by taking some illegal substance and they make-up, and in-between they sing-songs.Walk the Line to its detriment neglects his wife and kids too much, as though this would have a negative effect on who we perceive Johnny Cash to be. Although I found the music not to my liking it was the scenes where music took a back-seat, and we had a chance to try and understand Johnny Cash that were inadequate. I did not feel come the end that I had any understanding of who he was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biography is well worth watching. Johnny Cash, himself, is a country legend and one of my favorites. In fact, his legend has crossed over into new territory with younger audiences, and this film may help further the legend. Reese Witherspoon does June Carter to a "T" ~ she turned in an excellent, energetic performance, capturing the voice and the spirit of the singer. I wouldn't change a thing about her. Unfortunately, I thought that Joaquin Phoenix missed the boat on his portrayal of Johnny Cash (and that's where strength of performance is needed). He captured Johnny's persona and strength of character, but he failed miserably on the music, I thought. Granted, Johnny's voice and style would be hard to emulate. To me, Phoenix's voice just sounded weak and off-key. This is one instance where dubbing would have been a good thing. This is not a bad movie, though. The story is wonderfully real and contains great material even for someone who doesn't know much about Cash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walk the Line (2005) **** (out of 4)Wonderful, if still flawed, story of Johnny Cash and June Carter is brilliantly brought to life by the two lead performers giving terrific performances. Phoenix was certainly born to play the role and delivers perfectly capturing the Man in Black, his drug addiction and his drawn out love to Carter. Witherspoon, in my opinion, is the best actress out there and I've been saying this the past twelve years or so and she really shines here. The two have wonderful chemistry together and the live numbers are filmed perfectly and the two have rather nice voices, although I don't think they sounded too much like the real couple. I said the film was flawed and it is in a certain way but I think this happens with a lot of films based on real people. I think the film is somewhat hampered by the PG-13 rating but in the end this is a love story and an actors showcase and both aspects come off perfectly. The history of Cash's rise to fame along side Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis was a nice added touch. As everyone here already knows I'm a die-hard fan of Dylan and in the film Phoenix and Witherspoon do a duet on "It Ain't Me Babe", which was so damn good that I'd call it better than any Dylan version I've heard and better than the real Cash/Carter duet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Run-of-the-Mill Good Biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biopics about musical talents are usually a double-edged sword in terms of enjoyment; on the positive side, if that musical talents happens to have incredible music (and Johnny Cash falls into this category) then the least you will get is a decent two-hour soundtrack; however, does good music equate to an interesting life? Johnny Cash was widely known as grizzly bear of a man, rough-edged and with a deep and unknowable chasm of a past. His stint at Folsom Prison forever shaped his image, and the few scenes that deal with the event are among the most powerful in James Mangold's Walk the Line. Unfortunately, coming off the heels of 2004's Ray, this biopic treads a path that was too recently trekked; a path too familiar in the biopic genre of film: singer struggles to find talent, upon finding said talent become a star, falls in love, has children who remain out of focus, trudges through years of some form of drug, and comes out a champion. Luckily, Joaquin Phoenix is good enough to fill in the large footsteps created by Jamie Foxx, though the commonalities of the biopic genre are not challenged.June Carter, played by Reese Witherspoon (Legally Blonde), was a vital force in Johnny Cash's life. Like a sweeter Jekyll and Hyde, Reese expertly portrays an innocent and na?ve Southern dame while on stage, whilst showing off her fiery and relentless devotion in her private life with Johnny. The acting throughout is top notch, with a notable performance by Waylon Payne ? Jerry Lee Lewis came alive once more on screen rivaling Dennis Quaid's 1989 rendition of the partygoer. Like Ray, however, brilliant acting is the saving grace for an otherwise run-of-the-mill movie about a 50s-60s performer.Walk the Line is worth a watch for Cash's witty and swinging music and the good performances, but I can't help but wonder how this movie could have been done differently had director James Mangold taken a few more risks to avoid the biopic outline. While the love interest and drug addiction and their interrelation are an integral part of Cash's early life, the real reason fans are interested in the man behind the music is the highway man, the wanderer, the man in black, the man who's been everywhere. Walk the Line provides a textbook portrait of Johnny Cash's early life without revealing the mysteries of his heart, his soul, his thoughts. Cash's interest and sympathy for inmates is revealed but in his performance at Folsom, but never finds an equal footing with the addiction and love story. We get the clear idea that June Carter is to be thanked for removing him from a spiraling ring of fire, but we never get a clear indication of what form by which that ring of fire manifested itself besides what can be seen on the outside. Thus, Walk the Line succeeds in its purpose: making a good biopic, but fails to take enough risks to propel itself ahead of such films such as Ray or Great Balls of Fire!, instead feeling more comfortable lying beside them as an equal.

		<shortDescription>A good film for older age groups</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Plot A chronicle of the life of famous singer Johnny Cash and his struggle with his family, his career, drugs and the love of his life.The Pros This film will appeal to mostly older people. Younger people might not enjoy it, especially teenagers and kids. It is very similar to the film Ray, which is strange seeing as it's basically saying that Ray Charles and Johnny Cash had very similar happenings in their lives. The music and singing is very good for actors who don't usually sing. The cast and the acting are fantastic. Overall, it isn't a bad film at all.The Cons It tends to get boring. Younger people might not appreciate it because they aren't familiar with Johnny Cash's music. Worth Hiring/Buying? If you are a Johnny Cash fan or a collector of Oscar winning films, this might be a good addition to add to your collection but it isn't anything spectacular in my opinion. But since more adults like it than teenagers than perhaps you can try it out.The Final Word I'm giving this film 6/10, which isn't a bad rating, so check out this film if you want to see how hard it really is to be a successful celebrity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dragged on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walk the Line was a good movie, no doubt about it. Joaquin Phoenix practically became Johnny Cash, and Reese Witherspoon was perfect for the role of June Carter. It was interesting to learn about how Johnny Cash got started, how his brother died, how he was married when he met June, as was she, and how he was in the Air Force before he became a star, which was what technically got him started, anyway. Tyler Hilton played a good Elvis and Waylon Payne played a good Jerry Lee Curtis.Now this is why I didn't like it: it dragged on forever! Johnny Cash was kind of messed up and took drugs a lot, but that was what the entire movie circulated around. The entire move, Johnny is walking around high or drunk. It's depressing! See it, but kids probably won't enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that is very good at fooling people into thinking it's brilliant. Yes, it has its moments, like when the on-stage chemistry of Phoenix and Witherspoon is at its most evident, but on the whole, there's just not much to it. It follows the rise-fall-rise format of just about every other biopic out there. (Johnny makes it big and is surprised and happy. Johnny gets too big for his britches and develops a drug problem. Johnny meets the girl who can bring him down to earth and give his life meaning again.) I was certain this movie had nothing new to offer when Cash went through the addiction withdrawal scene (shaking and grimacing in bed) that has become almost obligatory in this kind of movie. And the pacing! Oh, the pacing! This movie drags itself along like a two-legged dog. This is one of those films where the editor could have had a field day, and should have, but for whatever reason, didn't.That said, what the movie lacks in direction and writing is almost made up by the outstanding performances. Phoenix and Witherspoon are obviously perfect for their roles and they do spectacular things with the material given them. In parts, Phoenix's singing voice is almost indistinguishable from Cash's. Witherspoon's is noticeably different than June Carter's, (lacking a bit of the country twang) but is still just a beautiful voice to listen to. And I was really blown away by the strength and vulnerable elegance she put into her performance.The magnificent performances and the wonderful music save the movie, but the script is so predictable (even for a biopic) and the direction so lackluster (although there are a few very pretty shots) that you may get the feeling you're wasting your time. Or, as in my case, that you've seen this all before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor man's "Ray"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wasn't desperate to see this, but wanted to learn a little bit more about the man Johnny Cash.What I learnt was that he hard a tough upbringing, got into drugs, had woman problems and built a massively successful music career. Hardly a new story. I'm not saying his story isn't worth telling, but it's hardly a new music story is it? How many of the music legends of the past 50 years didn't have all the same issues, most notably Ray Charles, who's story was brought to the big screen just the year before? Seems like another case of movie execs saying "that Ray movie did really well, let's do one like that! Are there any other famous musos who had drug problems?".Like "Ray", the highlight of the movie is the rehab stuff, but the rest really wasn't that ground breaking. Phoenix and Witherspoon do good jobs with what they're given, but the story didn't have you on the edge of your seat, plus there wee no great musical moments.Unless the next big music movie is going to be about the Foo Fighters, Billy Ocean or Dexy's Midnight Runners, lets put this genre back in the guitar case for a few years hey!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best portrayals ever of alcoholism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The darkness was responsible for his work, but also for dragging him down." So said co-writer and Director James Mangold in his commentary on the film biography of country singer legend Johnny Cash. "Walk the Line" is an excellent portrayal of alcoholism and the grand dichotomy largely responsible for the conflicts in the work and lives of Cash, Edgar Allan Poe, Richard Burton, Jim Morrison and countless other remarkable achievers. The portrayal of Cash's father's alcoholism and abusive behaviors is superb as well in this on-screen acknowledgment of the genetic roots of a disease to which he succumbs.Since the cinema and addicts (the screenplay is based on Cash's autobiography) can't be trusted to accurately report real-life events, there's no way to know whether there was heavy drinking before Cash's popping of amphetamines and barbiturates began. But as soon as it starts, his demeanor dramatically changes, which we see in Cash's facial expressions as portrayed by actor Joaquin Phoenix. He instantly begins illicit one-night stands with fans when on the road, while his wife Vivian stays home with their children. The drunken show of anger when he rips apart his dressing room after a scene with the woman he truly loves, fellow country star June Carter, is a classic by-product of his addiction which, as is true for addicts everywhere, serves as an excuse to pop more pills.Carter, in an Oscar-winning performance by Reese Witherspoon, is the one person who is willing to draw the line, at least some of the time. In a vow to stop enabling after she sees Johnny and the boys in his band stinking drunk just hours before a performance, Carter says she will no longer be the Dutch boy with the finger in the dam. While she enables by beginning an affair with Cash after her divorce, she finally realizes what must be done and flushes his pharmacy down the toilet. Panicking, he cries that he needs the pills?they were prescribed. It's a scathing indictment of doctors, who all-too-frequently play pusher.The view of alcoholism as a "family disease," the mal-effects on spouse and children, becomes apparent as his wife Vivian finally leaves him for good, children in tow. Self-inflicted financial abuse, as he tries to cash a $24,000 check in the 1960s, becomes apparent. Unfortunately, the film leaves to the viewer's imagination any financial victimization of others. (Financial abuse of both self and others by alcoholics is my specialty: I wrote a book on the subject, "Drunks, Drugs &amp; Debits: How to Recognize Addicts and Avoid Financial Abuse.") The informal intervention that apparently inspired in Cash a need to seek sobriety started at Thanksgiving in his new home. Reacting to Cash's indifferent attitude and reckless behaviors, his father Ray (portrayed by Robert Patrick) implied that drug use was at the root of Cash's problems when he commented, "I quit drinkin' a long time ago." Indeed, Ray's attitude had improved, although probably not by as much as if his son wasn't an addict. The look in actor Joaquin Phoenix's eyes was as close to one of, "Maybe I'll try sobriety," as any ever expressed. Do watch how Carter's family protects Cash from his pusher after he has suffered through the pain of withdrawal. (Finally, the one thing they should protect him against!) With the drugs mostly out of his system, he begins to ask questions every addict in early recovery must deal with, including, "What have I done?" When he admits to having "hurt everybody I know?I'm nothing," Carter points out that God "is giving you a chance to make everything right." As is typical of addicts in recovery, he thinks he is fundamentally flawed. Cash's favorite film was "Frankenstein," because it was a story of someone made up of bad parts who tried to do good. "Frankenstein" was written by Mary Shelley, who may also have had the disease of alcoholism. Perpetuating this myth of addiction (myth # 60 in my book, "Alcoholism Myths and Realities: Removing the Stigma of Society's Most Destructive Disease") is the only serious flaw in an otherwise excellent movie. In case you're new to these concepts, the truth is that addicts are almost always fundamentally good people who act badly as a result of a particular biochemical reaction to the drug. My goal (I've authored four books on the subject) is to show how to identify addicts and assist them into recovery, before tragedy happens. June Carter just made it, even if Vivian and others did not.</fullReview>

The movie even shows a fat southern drug craving punk-face, named " Elvis". And a dork named Jerry Lee? Uggh? I need more lines.

		<fullReview>While being an excellent capture of the place and time of Cash and his early career, this unsympathetic look at the one-note character of Cash and his obsession with his wife to be makes for little character interest or development, and has little story beyond "this happened, then this happened, then this happened". While the Folsom performance shows Phoenix NAILING the live Cash and letting rip some of the passion, the other music performances are weak in comparison. Not much happens in this film, and it takes a while to happen, too.Not a film that will be remembered by many other than Cash fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hope that title makes sense. This movie is long, but the movie also seems to jump too quickly from year-to-year. This movie is decent. Not great, not bad, decent. I felt the movie understated Johnny Cash's stardom and made it feel more like a guy who was constantly struggling to break out. I also felt as if Johnny Cash was some little boy chasing an OLD woman the whole time and that was kind of distracting. The actors were good. Phoenix is probably a little overrated as Johnny Cash, Reese Witherspoon is great as June Carter Cash, and whoever played Jerry Lee Lewis was really good. He's not a main part of the movie, but the acting of the man who played Lewis really stuck out to me.Overall rating: 6.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thumbs Down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hallmark of a great biopic of a singer is the music. As a kid I loved "The Jolson Story". While Larry Parks played Jolson; all the songs were sung by the real Jolson. Likewise in "Ray", Jamie Foxx was great as Ray; but all the songs were sung by Ray Charles. The makers of "Walk the Line" forgot this formula. While Phoenix did avery good job portraying Johnny Cash; he has no voice. Hence, I give the movie a thumbs down because in the end Johnny was all about his wonderful voice. When I saw him and June in the late 80's, June lovingly referred to him on stage as "Ol Golden Throat". And that he was. Phoenix was "Ol Lead Throat". Also, the plot development was poor. The conflict with his Dad should have been fleshed out. The movie failed to capture how Johnny eventually "bottomed out". Also, in the 70's Johnny made his "altar walk", became a Christian and truly turned it all around. The movie never even mentioned it. I guess the secular humanist that run Hollywood simply don't embrace that message. Reese Witherspoon was great. And lets face it most Americans are not familiar with her voice so who cares if she sang.</fullReview>

The ground is shaking, the audience is quaking, the cinema's sub-woofer is close to breaking. Then comes the money shot; all slimy, reptilian skin and dilating pupils. Yup, ole Joaquin/Johnny needs to drink more mineral water and lay off the diet pills. As for ole Joaquin, that boy sure can act! Just watch him. He's acting up a storm. He's acting his gosh darned butt off. There lies one of the two (possibly three) problems of Walk the Line. At no point do you forget that you are watching a person pretending to be another person. The second problem is this - it makes Johnny's life look uneventful, and consequently, makes Johnny look dull. And the third problem? You know the bit in the Blues Brothers where they do a gig at a red neck bar and the lady behind the bar says, "We play BOTH types of music, country AND western!"? Reece Witherspoon's entire performance is based on this woman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully acted, intelligently directed biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reese Witherspoon almost steals the show as June Carter, the woman who set fire to the heart of John R. Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), but that makes perfect sense because she did play a substantial, life-changing role in the man's life. Reese sings, too, and very well! Phoenix is great, though, and paints a sympathetic, fascinating portrait of a good man who fought a good fight with his personal demons. The structure is episodic and predictable, but director James Mangold keeps the energy level high and allows us to plunge into the mud with Cash and ride his bumpy road to success also. Mangold sustains a solid emotional journey for the character while never ignoring the pure joy of Cash's music. The standard biopic structure is applied where we work our way back to a pivotal moment in the subject's life that is seen in the film's prologue. The moment employed here has strong resonance. "Walk The Line" is not a masterpiece, but it is intelligent, rousing, emotionally uplifting and beautifully acted. And it showcases Reese's best role since "Freeway".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful performances, writing and stylish filming make an excellent movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into Walk the Line it's fair to say I knew nothing about Johnny Cash other than the Ring of Fire song and one of my more eccentric school friends who was into his music while most other kids were reading Smash Hits and watching Top of the Pops! So I wasn't sure what to expect and how the movie would affect me, and like most of the prospective audience I was attracted by awards hype, reviews and the always strong Joaquin Phoenix.I was also lucky enough to see the screening in the Gold Class of the cinema when no other Press has turned up until fifteen minutes into the movie. So the extended introduction of Walk the Line reverberating through the underseat base and the wonderfully filmed opening sequence projected onto the huge screen really hit me with force. The opening is both visually and audibly superb. Building tension, setting the tone perfectly for the movie, and defining the circular nature of the storyline.That's one of the excellent things about this movie, the story. It's superbly written and brought to the screen. A cliffhanging moment of tension created from the outset using visuals of Fulsom Prison, the Walk the Line introduction and no real words. I have to say this is one of the best movie opening sequences I've seen in a long time. Powerful and attention grabbing from the first second.The entire movie is beautifully filmed and visualised, recreating the era with ease and taking you to those moments even if you haven't lived through them or were even born. It's full of well framed shots often with a slow moving tracking move, giving it a very natural and authentic feel. None of the filming or set-ups are anything more than is required and never pulls you out of the movie.Then there's the music, music I was just not aware of, which makes its affect on me even more astounding. I'm now singing Cash songs in my head, the day after the movie and I'm awaiting arrival of some of his records. I now may well be a Cash fan, and that's through both the music of Cash and the performance and singing of Pheonix.It's something that should never be a great consideration for acting talent though. If he or Reese Witherspoon had mimed their way through this movie would their acting performances be any less? I doubt so. However they do sing all the songs and authentic or not they are excellent and convincing performances. Hence the soundtrack release with their own recordings.Singing aside their performances as actors are amazing and the chemistry between them is as real as anything I've seen or experienced.Pheonix gives a stunning performance of intensity and burning passion. He's a totally tormented character and to be quite frank, thoroughly unlikable in the movie, yet you are drawn to his performance and find a connection through his suffering, redemption and through the relationship with June Carter played by Witherspoon.She also gives an emotionally charged performance, one which is worthy of her accolades and awards. Yet I can't understand why Pheonix has not been as recognised. In my eyes his performance is the winner in this film, but she successfully casts off any of her previous light roles and proves she is a real actress of weight and stature.Robert Patrick is also well cast and gives a powerful performance as the father of Cash. He starts as a drunk but then gives through to a hard and unyielding man. It's a similar performance to his Terminator role, although much more human! Seriously though, he does pull off the role well and set against Pheonix you feel the tension hurtling off screen.There are some very notable scenes between the three of them. When Pheonix as Cash discusses his dead brother with Carter it's a strong and emotionally poignant moment. A scene in direct contrast to this is the Thanksgiving stand off against his Father which explains so much about the character of Cash and indeed of his abuse of himself. In fact this movie does help to show you how someone can come to abuse themselves through such things as drugs and alcohol. His journey through this common and often misunderstood path is clearly shown and explained through clever and intelligent writing, direction and performances.Overall it's a strong and emotional movie filled with excellent characterisations and performances. The story is very well written and transferred of screen. However it's not entirely without issue.The sequences of touring felt slightly longer than necessary and although the on stage performances were great with some excellent songs, I did feel that similar ground was being covered in the later stages.Still, through these scenes the relationship between him, his family, wife and Witherspoon continue to be built upon and it does leave with a good understanding of them all.The ending does seem to fill you with some level of twee-ness but there is absolutely no arguing with it - it's factually based and I've heard that this couples love for each other was that strong a bond.Without a doubt I'd recommend this movie even if you aren't a Cash fan or have no idea what his music is like. For the first time in a long time I actually want to go and see a movie a second time. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Opening at the Folsom prison, before Johnny Cash takes stage, we're shot back to his child hood. Living on a poor farm, with a cold hearted father, Jonh's brother Jake is killed in a freak accident. Stone hopping through the years, we go through Cash in the army, where he started writing songs and the beginnings of his marriage to Vivian Cash. Stuck in a door salesman job, Cash soon cuts a record, based on the songs he wrote in the army. From the popularity of the record, he sets on tour with Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins. On the tour he meets singer June Carter; in a recent messy divorce.With a turbulent life, Cash spirals, with alcohol abuse, drug addiction and his adultery love for June. From the beginning of his marriage to Vivian, the marriage was rocky, only getting worse over the years. Still carrying the guilt of his brothers death, Cash is always in a constant state of making his father proud and accept him.While not a fan of John Cash's music; and while this doesn't change my stance, Walk the Line is one of the most powerful film biography's, on one of country musics greatest musicians. Walk the Line blends perfectly a balance between the music and Cash's life, keeping the target audience wide for the non Cash fan. The drama between Cash's wife, father and June are so intense, and the raw emotion of the drama is vividly brought to the screen.Giving powerhouse, mind blowing performances, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are electrifying as Cash and Carter. Phoenix and Witherspoon are at the top of their game, delivering such powerful dramatic performances. Topping this is the singing, with both Phoenix and Witherspoon singing all the songs. While the supporting cast give great roles; Robert Patrick is wonderfully as Cash's father, they are over shadowed by Phoenix and Witherspoon.Whether your a fan of Johnny Cash or not, Walk the Line is a excellent biography film on a singing legend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last year, Ray brought to life the genius of Ray Charles. A biopic of the legendary, mainstream rhythm &amp; blues musician, proved to be one of a kind- not only in its portrayal of the late legend, but also on the heightened production and acting. Ray earned Jamie Foxx an Oscar, one he truly and fully deserved, clearly not the case with many recent Oscar winners.This year, Walk the Line, a cinematographic derivation of Ray, continues in the same fashion by exposing the genius and the faults of Johnny Cash, the deceased country singer with a voice "like a sharp razor" and an attitude like none other. The story and life of the self-proclaimed "Man in Black" simply cannot be condensed into a 136-minute-biographical-semi-documentary movie. Director James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted) tries his best however, to adapt Johnny Cash's made-for-movie life and abridge it into an ordinary Hollywood storyline. To put it shortly- J.R Cash was born Feb.16, 1932 in Kingsland, Arkansas. When he was 3 years old, his father moved his family to northeast Arkansas to farm 20 acres of cotton and other seasonal crops. Cash was enlisted in the U.S Air Force after he finished high school. After serving for four years, Cash returned home and married Vivian, an ex-girlfriend. At 22, Cash auditioned as a solo artist for Sam Phillips' Sun Records. After he was rejected, he tried a second time with his band The Tennessee Three. This time he was accepted into the recording company and released his first single "Hey Porter".During the next few years, Johnny Cash would go on to release many hit singles such as "I Walk the Line" and "A Boy Named Sue". Meanwhile he had divorced his first wife and remarried to country singer June Carter. June and her family helped Cash overcome his addiction with narcotics. After years of bliss and excellent music, June died in May of 2003 and Cash died four months later from diabetes complications. The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix as the eternal Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as the tender June Cash. Both actors do justice to the late performers. The over-achieving Phoenix is almost entirely guaranteed an Oscar nomination this year. Phoenix basically evolved into the "Man in Black". Witherspoon also did a tremendous job at showcasing her own acting abilities with June's Southern charm. The most amazing component is the music however- all songs were performed by Phoenix himself. The direction of the movie must also be noted for it truly captured the moments most relevant in Cash's early and later years. Mangold proves his capabilities in full context in Walk the Line. The scenes, both lavishing and heart-breaking at the same time, paint a picture of Johnny Cash's life, laden with the brutality of life and the heartwarming effects of love.Although Walk the Line is excellent in its point-of-view direction, and in the portrayals of both Johnny and June Cash, it fails to distract the viewer from finding similarities with the superb Ray. The resemblances are far too many to fully evaluate but the main ones remain on the plot. The death of a sibling, poverty, drug usage, and the multiple relationships are some of the main characteristics both movies share. Nevertheless, Walk the Line is still fully entertaining, even at its lowest points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walk the Line is a competent, but not transcendent film that follows the Bio-film format to the letter. The strong points of the film come from the excellent original music sung by Pheonix and Witherspoon, the on-screen chemistry and the impassioned performances by the whole cast. The weakest point of the film is the lack of detail and story content. Cash's struggles were not adequately represented and the film failed to address anything that a fan of his music would find new and interesting. This is a shame, because Cash led one hell of an interesting life. Five out of five for execution, but two out of five for content.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not an homage piece, a la 'Ray.' There are too many praise-worthy aspects of the biography left out of this for that to be the intent. This one is about performance, and its relationship to real life. About walking the line, the fine line between the two.The gist is that June and Johnny live their "real" lives, then allow that experience to overtly reflect in their performances on stage. And sometimes the performance drives the real life, culminating in a marriage proposal (and acceptance, finally) in the middle of a performance. All aspects of their public images are deeply rooted in experience, exaggerated and replayed on stage.But between "performance" and "reality," which is which and is there even a line between the two? How much does performance play a role in our marriage proposals, our troubles, our joy? Our "real lives?"--An aside. Reese is not a good actress. She's all head and hands. All exaggeration. The style of a stage performer transplanted into films. But here she plays a stage performer, which fits nicely.</fullReview>

Almost none of the characters were developed in the story except Johnny Cash and June Carter. At the end of the movie I didn't even remember most of the characters names. The man lived an incredibly interesting life and they decided to touch a little of every aspect, but in the end didn't really go into detail of any of it. The movie also seemed to drag a lot, which you would think would allow them to go into detail, but alas, no. The movie was by no means bad, and I'm glad that I saw it, but I don't think it is the masterpiece everyone is making it out to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phoenix &amp; Witherspoon: "Hotter than a Pepper Sprout"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Johnny Cash in "Walk the Line," Joachin Phoenix has achieved a tour de force with his powerful portrayal of the singer's early years in the music business. Phoenix's singing has been widely and deservedly praised, but Reese Witherspoon (June Carter) also holds up her half of the duets just as credibly, and her buoyant performance helps save the film from wallowing in the lead role's personal troubles.But also credit James Mangold's adept direction of his and Gill Dennis's screenplay for the ultimate advance of the narrative with a savvy use of songs that reinforce the tale. You will cry and smile, alternately, during this emotionally charged and highly enjoyable film version of an authorized biography. Mangold shows us the boy called J.R., suffering a drought of paternal affection in the shade-deprived cotton fields, but who learns from his mother how to tap into a spiritual strength by singing. We are brought into the boy's dark night, where we sense his self-doubt which, fed by guilt, will later sap the spirit of the young singer, and lead to the addiction that threatens to destroy him even as he strives for success.When Phoenix finally appears on stage as the veritable embodiment of the successful Man in Black, and leans into the microphone to give us that "Hello, I'm Johnny Cash" in perfect Deep South baritone, we have no doubt, so true has been the cinematic exposition and Phoenix's craft. With superb attention to detail, the film captures a lost era in the life of our nation, just as it repeatedly shows Johnny Cash attempting to regain an idealized childhood. The cinematography of Phedon Papamichael II frames forlorn scenery with the reverence a true believer has for all God's creation.When the relentless touring takes its toll on Cash's first marriage, the couple argues in a room filled with fan mail. Cash prefers to rest alone among piles of unopened letters than be with his wife and children. Even when the singer brings his family to a concert to watch his performance, we see that they clearly belong with the audience, and not among Cash's true inner circle. Who could better share his love than June Carter, his tour mate, the disembodied voice he idealized when still a boy and the one woman who remains his true friend.Cash spirals into the depths of drug addiction, and inevitably is arrested, but the scene of the singer alone in a jail cell is cut short so that it doesn't function as a moment of truth. Cash avoids confronting his personal demons, and heads home instead to hang his head in self-pity at poolside. Throughout the film, Cash's struggles and triumphs are consistently shown as they affect the intimate side of the man; the great financial success and the many number one songs are referred to mostly obliquely in montage.Finally, June Carter literally saves the drowning singer. She dries him off and then dries him out.The happy ending works in this film, since Cash's reconciliation with his father has been prepared. After a lifetime of miscommunication, misdirected anger and guilt between father and son, it is the brutal honesty of the senior Cash that forces the crisis that brings about the singer's redemption. Johnny Cash goes from being a talent mired in addiction to the man who recaptures his artistic potential, symbolized by the live concert at Folsom Prison. Whereas the song, "Folsom Prison Blues," was an early product of Cash's chafing against authority, the actual live concert is a way to show the world that the Man in Black is truly a star, who belongs on stage, not in prison. Even if those cons know every word of his lyrics, they are just another part of the world Johnny Cash celebrates in song, and in so doing, redeems himself.The concert is Cash's final attempt to recapture an elusive dream from his past. The Man in Black succeeds and we leave him enjoying extended family bliss, united with June Carter. He even recalls his father's triumphs with equanimity.The credits roll to the voices of the real Johnny Cash and June Carter singing one of their signature duets. Here we realize with awe that these great singers are inimitable, yet we are equally amazed at how consummately these two American icons have been acted and sung back to life by Phoenix and Witherspoon. I say, give them both Oscars, and by all means ask them to sing "Jackson" on Academy Awards night. Four stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WALK THE LINE Written by Gill Denis &amp; James Mangold Directed by James MangoldI fin d it quite peculiar that biopics about musicians all seem to contain variations on the same plot points. Musicians have troubled childhoods, often including traumatic experiences and/or stern upbringings that will likely cross the line into abusive. Musicians get married and then inevitably neglect their spouses and cheat on them with groupies post getting discovered and making something of a name for themselves, And it wouldn't be a movie about a successful musician if said musician didn't get into a full-on battle with drugs and alcohol. I can accept that these issues might be typical of a musician's influential background and the industry that exploits their talents by running them around the world, away from their family. What gets me is that these stories aren't stories at all but real lives. There are probably more people out there going through exactly what you are and you don't even know it. The similarities may be seemingly unavoidable but the film must differentiate itself to make it's own name. The emphasis must then be placed on two things ? the performances of the lead actors and of course, the music. In the case of Johnny Cash biopic, "Walk the Line," director James Mangold takes it one step further and crafts a destiny driven love story, set against the backdrop of the familiar rise and fall of a rock star.The larger force at work gets started early for Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) as Johnny becomes enamored with June upon hearing her sing on the radio when he is just a boy. His discovery is innocent but the influence will be lasting as the sound of her voice inspires desire inside of him to have the same opportunities and the calm that her voice brings to his impoverished and troubled childhood will be something he searches for for decades to come. When the two finally do meet, the calm returns to him immediately and their chemistry is unmistakably natural. As they sneak glances when the other isn't looking, they look affected without understanding why. The insight comes the first time the two take the stage together. They speak a language that no one else can discern only the language isn't spoken, it's sung.Watching two people fall in love on stage and through song while one or the other alternates fighting against it energizes the performances. Their infatuation and excitement invigorates their voices and faces, inspiring anticipation in both the on screen audiences and those is the multiplexes as we anxiously watch to see where this will lead. Having Phoenix and Witherspoon sing their own parts only deepens the performances' authenticity. It removes the detachment from the character one would ordinarily experience while watching with the constant awareness of that voice not being from that body. It doesn't hurt that they both sound fantastic too.As June, Witherspoon's exuberance is infectious. She demonstrates a strength in vulnerable times that is usually masked by a giant smile. Phoenix plays Johnny as a na?ve genius, unaware of how his decisions affect those around him. He very rarely looks determined or calculated; instead he is impulsive and organic. And certainly he can brood with the best. Together, their connection is palpable. Amidst drug detox, ballooning egos and the collapse of marriages, the pull between them remains intact and retains its hold on their hearts. The happiness they could have and both deserve is always just out of reach and you will want so much for them to have it that you will not want the credits to roll. And though you may wish they could keep on singing for you, it is still a relief that they can finally drop the act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never really knew the story of Johnny Cash, but I always enjoyed his music and I love Reese and Joaquin so I couldn't wait to see 'Walk the Line'. Plus my husband's an aspiring singer. I loved this movie, I'm waiting anxiously for the day it comes out on DVD so I can buy it immediately. They said Joaquin wasn't Johnny Cash and never would be but you'll never find anyone better for that part, and Reese as June was an amazing performance and will make her an academy award winner for sure. The love story between Johnny and June will make every girl fall in love with this movie, and the rock-n-roll legend will satisfy every guy to make it a great movie for all. I hope you enjoy as much as we did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who is not very familiar with the legendary music of Johnny Cash, and not a huge fan of Joaquin Phoenix(largely due to how well he portrayed his character in Gladiator: he was so good, I hated his character, though I didn't really feel him in Signs], I was immensely impressed with the film, it's contents and the exquisite performances given by Witherspoon and Pheonix. If you are by any means a fan of Johnny cash you owe it to yourself to stop what you are doing, and go get tickets for this film right now! I am not a country music fan, but I was grooving' with the music in the film, and enjoyed it thoroughly. I felt the movie didn't drag, but nicely and aptly explained the torment Cash experienced in the beginning of his career. I really cannot say enough about how good this movie is, and how much I urge you to see this brilliant piece of cinema. The only 1 thing I can say bad about this film, is that I wanted it to be longer! I highly recommend this, (can't you tell?) to anyone who likes great films. Even if you know nothing about Johnny Cash, but you appreciate excellent movies, you seriously need to see this Oscar worthy picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one's got it all!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this film I could not help but think of what I call the three most compelling themes in telling a story. First, there's the story of a person realizing their dream (the humbler their beginnings and the stronger the odds against them, the more powerful the effect), second, the story of redemption (the farther they fall and the farther they make it back, the more compelling their return) and lastly the story of a love that finally succeeds (particularly one where the odds seem stacked against them). Most good movies are lucky if they successfully cover just one of these themes and even fewer manage two, so when I tell you this movie has all three, well you may disagree, but that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it! I have read many reviews comparing this film to Ray, but the one which I thought of after seeing it is Hustle and Flow, which I believe also contains these three themes, although to a greater or lesser degree in certain areas.I think Mangold brilliantly uses the close-up to incredible effect in telling this story, particularly the 2-shots during Cash and Carter's duets. They lent a real intimacy to these scenes and made me truly feel not only the love between these two people, but also a genuine caring and friendship.I am amazed to find that although I was never a real Johnny Cash fan, I have become a huge Joaquin Phoenix/Johnny Cash fan. While Phoenix has received praise for his performance from every corner, I feel Ms. Witherspoon deserves every bit as much, if not more, recognition for her wonderful turn as June Carter Cash. To be able to act like that, to look like that and on top of it all, sing like that, is truly an embarrassment of riches. If she is overlooked at Oscar time, I will be sorely disappointed.I've seen it twice now. Please make sure you see it at least once. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Go see this movie.Even if you don't know anything at all about The Man In Black or June Carter Cash.I was born in 1970, and by that time, Cash was already a legend. Being born in '70, Cash wasn't exactly my cup of tea. It's only since I've gotten older that I've expanded my musical tastes to include many things I used to scoff at.Phoenix is unbelievable as Cash. He's got his mannerisms down cold. As I watched him play the guitar, held up high with his strumming hand way back on the strings, it brought back memories of seeing the real Cash on TV when I was a young boy.Whitherspoon was also amazing. I'm sure her Nashville bloodline helped out, but, she perfects her performance every bit as well as Phoenix's Cash.I did think that Witherspoon sounded just a tad bit like Sandy The Squirrel on the Spongebob Squarepants cartoon. But, then again, so did June Carter Cash. Southern through and through.Like "Ray", being a period piece, Walk The Line really is convincing in portraying the 50's and 60's.I loved the scenes where the Sun Recording artists are all riding around in cars to their next show. Can you imagine todays over-bloated egomaniacal musicians traveling to their next gig together in a sedan?Another performance I really enjoyed was Shooter Jennings portrayal of his father. I thought the Jerry Lee Lewis character was funny as well. The whole bit about "God said 'don't touch!'" was great.This movie is worthy of its praises. I can't imagine it getting beat out at Oscar time.I also liked that it was a fairly clean movie. My 13 year old son went to see it; actually ASKED to go see it, and I wasn't embarrassed to sit there with him and watch.The movie touched on some pretty serious issues; drug abuse, infidelity, etc., and did so more or less cleanly. That is a welcome change in todays films. The movie is plenty strong enough on its own, so it didn't need any 'shock value' or explosions, blood and guts, etc.The only thing I would like to have seen was more of an expanded role by the other Sun artists on tour. But, the movie was long already, I suppose.I was already a fan of Phoenix, from his roles in movies like "Signs" and others. I like Witherspoon as well, but this performance really shows that she can truly act, and is simply not just a 'star'. She's quite the actress.Go see this movie. It's one of the best films I've seen in a long, long time. It's right up there with Ray in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny and June were portrayed beyond perfection. I fell in love with them both, with their music, with their struggles, and with their lives. One of the best films to come out in the last 10 years. I would hope these two fine actors (Joaquin and Reece)make more films together as their on-screen chemistry, at least in this film, bests even Tracy and Hepburn. Then, of course, there's the soundtrack. I've been a fan of Johnny Cash for three decades and I think the singing style of the man in black was exceptional. Then Reece stepped up to the microphone and I was overwhelmed. If these two actors do not receive the Acadamy Award for their portrayals of both the Cash couple AND for their ability to sing I will be sorely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>yes, you should see this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew very little about Johnny Cash and pretty much nothing about June Carter Cash before seeing "Walk The Line." I was aware June had died recently, and that Johnny died soon after of a broken heart (but not before releasing an excruciatingly beautiful version of NIN's "Hurt," along with an equally waterworks-inducing music video). As a music and movie addict and a sucker for a great love story, these tiny nuggets of information provided enough incentive for me to shell out the $9 ticket fee.With that said, this movie gave me goosebumps like very few movies ever have. From the pounding bass line permeating Folsom Prison at the beginning of the film to the closing shot acknowledging Johnny and June's recent deaths, director James Mangold takes the audience on an emotional roller coaster, albeit one you never want to end. Aside from two or three slow points, the movie flows well and remains engaging throughout its entirety.Let's move on to the acting, shall we? I'm not exaggerating when I say that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon both light the screen on fire. Phoenix almost always gives great performances, but Witherspoon's transformation from cute girl-next-door to Jaw-Droppingly Talented Dramatic Actress is a revelation on the level of Elisabeth Shue in "Leaving Las Vegas" (minus the whole hooker thing). And despite (probably false) reports that the two actors supposedly didn't have the friendliest off-camera relationship, you would never know it from watching them on screen together. Their chemistry is off the charts. Watching Phoenix and Witherspoon sing to each other in front of thousands of people, it's crystal clear how Johnny and June's love story inspired someone to make a movie about it.The music is pretty amazing as well. Phoenix doesn't sound exactly like Johnny by any means, but he sounds similar enough to believably and respectfully inhabit Cash. Witherspoon herself is great, with a sweet voice just this side of twangy, which manages not to turn off audience members like myself who generally don't listen to country.I really can't say enough positive things about this film. You should be standing in line right now waiting to buy tickets. Or call Fandango, whatever. Just go. Now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so interesting and poignant that the two plus hours flew by. The movie could have easily gone on another hour or two while still keeping our rapt attention. Performances were intense and heartfelt, and we could feel the chemistry between the leads. Although I admit I never knew much about Johnny Cash or his wife or their music, I am now interested in learning even more about them and buying their CDs. The only real problem I had was with trying to figure out who the other singers were supposed to be. For example, the actor who played Elvis Presley didn't look much like him. But I'm sure this has more to do with my own ignorance of 50's and 60's era singers. But that is a very minor issue. The movie is terrific and I urge everyone to enjoy this piece of artwork.</fullReview>

Phoenix does an excellent performance and Whitherspoon is just as good. The must see movie of the year!!! I also like the determination that Pheonix had buy going to a vocal coach for a year just to get Johnny Cashes voice perfect. I was personally worried that because Pheonix doesn't actually look like Cash in real life would take away from the believability, but the more you hear him sing the more he becomes Cash. Well in my eyes at least. So definitely see this movie if you are a Cash fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you think of when you hear the name Johnny Cash? Well, I think I speak for just about everyone when I say, Isn't he the Man in Black?? Doesn't he sing: I Walk the Line, Ring of Fire, and the Nine Inch Nails cover; Hurt? Ya, before this movie, I did not know too much about this rebellious country singer. I knew he had a certain dark style of his own, and over the years I have learned to appreciate his music more and more. This particular day I wanted to hear some of those old rockin country songs and hear more of the story behind Mr. Johnny Cash. I was not prepared for what I was about to see... Although I knew Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were great actors, I did not know the depth and the range they were capable of. I was blown away by their ability to empty their hearts and souls in front of the camera. Not only did they help to tell the story for us, their work went above and beyond what is normally considered the responsibility of an actor or actress. They transcended any work I have seen on the big screen in a very long time. I can say this because most movies are just not moving anymore, it is pretty rare. But seriously, I was so moved physically and emotionally while watching this movie, I found myself crying, getting chills, and my soul being tugged from deep within. I was enwrapped with these characters from the beginning of this flick all the way to the end. Even the young Johnny Cash and his brother were impressive- to say the least. I was not aware until the end credits that Reese Witherspoon and Phoenix did all the vocals for the songs in this movie. I thought Cash's voice was in there somewhere... nope! We are also given a super performance by Ginnifer Goodwin who plays Vivian Cash (Johnny's first wife). The tension is felt as both women become entangled in Cash's drugged and drunken episodes. You can see the twisting and turning inside of Joaquin Phoenix, and as you look at his eyes and how the color of his skin changes you are convinced that he truly DID live the agony of Johnny Cash. The director James Mangold does a stellar job bringing together all the pieces necessary for an award winning movie, and this one WILL go down as one of the great ones. I think people will try to figure out exactly just how this display of raw emotion was translated into the frames of this film. This one will win awards and praises (and they will deserve each and every one of them)...You'll see. Definitely a MUST SEE Film!!~ Sir Ryan</fullReview>

Some of the songs were off a little but better than lip-syncing. Reese also studied June's voice styles and movements really well. She was great.

		<shortDescription>Reese Witherspoon is a revelation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot has been written about Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Johnny Cash but it is Reese Witherspoon as June Carter who gives this movie its heart and soul. Phoenix is wonderful showing Cash as he grows on stage and finds a comfort with his voice; however it is only in his duets with Witherspoon that the sparks really fly. Witherspoon lit up the screen in Legally Blonde but after such dogs as Legally Blonde 2 and Sweet Home Alabama I was unprepared for the way she could carry the emotional weight here. While Phoenix's voice was always on the edge of musicality, Witherspoon's always hit the right notes and tone. She deserves an Oscar nomination for her portrayal! Overall, Walk the Line is well crafted with a particularly pleasing inclusions of subtle scenes that make their way back into songs or later plot lines. Phoenix captures Cash's intensity on stage and his misery when apart from Carter very well though he is somewhat less effective in capturing other aspects of Cash's motivations. The core story of Cash's relationship with Carter is extremely well done. Although the film-making avoids some of the clichéd Hollywood touches that showed up in Ray, the story line is lacking in the complexity of Ray and thus yields a somewhat weaker film overall. Abstractly, I would say that the film could have benefited from some tighter editing to cut about 15 minutes from its running time, but I wouldn't want to cut one minute of Reese Witherspoon's screen time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash." - Johnny Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit I really have a lot of respect for the passed Johnny Cash. He was such an incredibly talented song writer and he was such a great performer. I also had a lot of respect for his wife, June Carter, who being raised around music her whole life actually taught Cash a couple things (which they don't go into during the film to show Cash as being more dependent). I wanted this film to do the man "justice" like Ray did for the immensely talented late Ray Charles. 'Walk the Line' does do Cash justice, but it just doesn't have the style and raw emotion 'Ray' had. 'Walk the Line' is a great film, it's just disappointing because it's not nearly as excellent as I thought it would be.'Walk the Line' follows the story of Johnny Cash (played by Joaquin Phoenix). It starts from his early childhood where he was emotionally abused by his condescending father (played by Robert Patrick - the bad guy from Terminator 2: Judgement Day) who was a farmer. The story shows young Johnny, or J.R. (as he was called back then), growing up and going into the Air Force during the Korean conflict. Cash is stationed in Germany and there he develops a love for country/rock/rock-a-billy type music and starts working on writing songs. He comes back from Germany, marries his sweetheart (not June Carter) and has children. Cash later falls on hard times and is having trouble paying the bills. He and his band try out for a local record label owner, blow him away, and cut a deal. That's when it all starts. Cash goes on tour with such musicians as Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley and June Carter (played by Reese Witherspoon) who he eventually marries after his current wife leaves him. Cash develops a drug/alcohol problem stemming from guilt from his father and all goes to hell, and his friends and wife try to help him.'Walk the Line' does a smooth and informative job of chronicling Cash's life from early childhood to on the edge of middle-aged, but unlike 'Ray' it doesn't seem to have too much style or creativity. The film is very conventional with both the writing and directing. That's a good thing because it's easy to follow that way, but it also is a bad thing because it doesn't bring anything exciting into the mix. It seems as though 'Walk the Line' has no artistic integrity and some huge fan read the Cash autobiography and made a film about it. It's like watching a documentary almost. This can hurt the film come Oscar season for the races outside the acting, because no matter how conventional the technical aspects are the acting never ceases to be outstanding. Joaquin Phoenix gives a powerful, dead-on, tour-de-force performance as Cash, but he doesn't steal the show. Although it's the Johnny Cash movie, the actress who plays June Carter, Reese Witherspoon, steals the picture. Witherspoon, in her best performance yet, gets a chance to prove how much of an incredible performer she truly is. This performance gave her the chance to prove she's well on her way to becoming the next Meryl Steep or Sissy Spacek. It's truly amazing to watch her on screen and her passion and flair for the role is almost sure to snag her a Best Actress Academy Award Nomination come Feburary.I highly recommend 'Walk the Line' to anyone looking for a film showcasing stellar acting and the story of one of the giants of American music, Johnny Cash. 'Walk the Line' runs 135 minutes, but it goes by as if it were only an hour and a half. It's a truly entertaining and engrossing picture, but the only complaint I had was it was just too prosaic. Grade: B+ (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 11/25/05)my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces).</fullReview>

The movie shows Johnny and June in Las Vegas clearly identified as 1965 singing Jackson, yet according to my memory (and more important, the liner notes on the Johnny Cash Legend CD), they did the song in 1967. And shortly thereafter, the movie shows June trying to write Ring of Fire. Well it is true that she did write it for him, but he recorded it in 1963. I also need to do my research because I have no idea if the proposal scene (no spoiler here...it's common knowledge he marries her), occurs as it did in the movie or if that was literary license.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous vocals, excellent story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very well written, and I was highly impressed at the vocals. Phoenix and Witherspoon did excellent jobs at portraying Johnny Cash and June Carter. At first, I almost had a hard time realizing that the vocals were all original. Once I realized it, I was awestruck. Whoever knew that these talented actors could sing classic country like that? I give this movie a 10 out of 10, and highly recommend it to all Johnny Cash fans. It is really something! I also enjoyed the story--of his life...which I honestly never knew all that much about. It gives me an even greater appreciation of Cash's legacy than I already had. Everyone in the film did a fabulous job, and it was very well directed. Kudos to everyone all around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of the year (so far)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As biographical films go, this is one of the best ones I've ever seen. Being very familiar with both Johnny and June, I was amazed at the transfiguration of two actors into country legends. You forget Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are not actually singers. Not only that, the unknown actors playing peripheral legends are outstanding. The actor playing Jerry Lee Lewis is great as is the actor playing Elvis. Having Shooter Jennings play his dad was a nice touch as well.Of course, you have to compress a lot of stuff into a 2 hour+ movie. I would've liked to see the scene where Johnny leaves Sam Phillips due to the fact he wanted to make a gospel album. (Hinted at from the beginning, but according to "Cash" the reason he left Sun Records.) Also the folk festival Johnny played where he actually met Bob Dylan (seen in archival footage of the recent PBS documentary on Dylan.) They probably could've got Jakob to play his dad-- but I guess I'm directing another movie.One sore spot: "Ring of Fire" was released in 1963. I know this. I was three years old and I cajoled my father into buying the 45 for me. (Maybe it was the mariachi horns.) The movie makes you think it was written three years later-- and that June wrote the entire song by herself. Actually, she had to have some help because it was such a hard song for her to write. And now a word about two criticisms I've read and I couldn't believe the shoddy knowledge of the facts...Why didn't they have "A Boy Named Sue"? Because the movie stops at 1968. This song was recorded live at San Quentin in 1969. (Seen on the documentary currently running on CMT ad infinitum.)Why wasn't Kris Kristofferson included? Because the movie stops at 1968. "Sunday Morning Coming Down" wasn't released until Johnny had his variety show on ABC. (1969-1971). I guess they could've shown him as a custodian at Columbia, but that would be a bit of a stretch... All in all, an entertaining and well-acted movie. Johnny said he wanted the filmmakers to show the truth warts and all-- and I think they succeeded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely phenomenal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been fanatical about Johnny Cash but have enjoyed much of his music over the years so I wanted to see what the "man in black" was all about. I couldn't believe my ears when I heard Joaquin Phoenix sing. He certainly deserves an Oscar for this one. He has everything a great actor SHOULD have. By the end of the movie, I was believing he WAS Johnny Cash. Reese Witherspoon also did an excellent job of singing. Some parts of the movie seemed a little slow but one should expect this with an autobiography. The parts were necessary to the telling of the story. I learned things about which I had been under the wrong impression previously. I had always felt that Johnny and June were truly in love and this movie showed how they were able to stay together for the rest of their lives. They had been through a lot together. Not many movies move me this way. My fiancé and I both decided we need to go buy the boxed set of Johnny Cash's music now. I can't say enough good things about this movie. Joaquin Phoenix has become one of my top favorite actors. Bravo to ALL involved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unflattering portrayal of a music legend. Then again, any movie that features a pretty lady who plays the autoharp can't be bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie that features a pretty lady (Ms. Reese Witherspoon) who sings dances and plays an autoharp can't be bad. I'm changing my rating of this movie to 9.Once again, Hollywood offers another slanted and distorted movie bio of a public figure, this time Johnny Cash, focusing on his personal problems for the sake of grabbing the audience's attention. Yes, Johnny Cash had a lot of personal problems - early in his life. Okay ... so what? Why focus on that? Why not focus instead on the fact that he was a U.S. Air Force veteran? Or that he was one of the most brilliant pop song writers in American music history? Or that for much of his professional life he was a social activist? Or that he got his substance abuse problem under control? The story of Johnny Cash is more than he had a substance abuse problem. The story of Johnny Cash is what he accomplished despite the substance abuse problem.This movie offers an unflattering yet interesting portrayal of one of the most gifted popular musical artists in American history, Johnny Cash. The portrayal is unflattering because it shows Mr. Cash as being a self-centered, pill-popping, emotionally fragile philanderer who neglects his family and almost wrecks his career. But the movie also provides an interesting and engaging portrayal of a gifted musical artist who became an musical icon in his own time. The movie's suggestion that Mr. Cash had to overcome adversity to achieve success is unconvincing. Although he came from poverty, Mr. Cash's background was not one of deprivation. According to the movie, Mr. Cash's father was judgmental and overbearing, but so what? What the storyline lacks, however, is more than made up for by the music, and this involves an outstanding performance by Jaoquin Phoenix who in this movie IS Johnny Cash. Indeed, Mr. Phoenix's uncanny portrayal of the musical legend is akin to that of Fay Dunaway's amazing portrayal of Joan Crawford in "Mommy Dearest." Also, Reese Witherspoon offers a strong performance as June Carter. What makes their performances even more remarkable is that neither one are known for being musical artists. Yet they sing, play musical instruments and are quite good. How many movies portray anyone playing an auto-harp? This movie is proof that when actors are given the opportunity, they can reveal a wide range of artistic talents that they otherwise would not be called upon to perform. His personal life notwithstanding, Johnny Cash was a great performer and for that reason alone this movie is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fabulous movie with Reese and Joaquin playing exceptional parts. Amazing how both manage to do such a great job singing even tho neither were singers before this movie.Some say Reese outshines Joaquin, but remember in real life, June Carter was a larger than life person and Johnny Cash was a quiet, shy, man. They both did a fantastic job of making this an honest portrayal of their characters. Joaquin does an amazing job of expressing Johnny's spirit and raw talent and does not try to imitate but gives his own interpretation. His characterization is so believably real! I saw Johnny in Texas in 1956 along with Elvis and Jerry Lee. This was just on the verge of them becoming successful and known. It was a short time later that Elvis first appeared on Ed Sullivan. This was an amazing concert and one that will remain in my mind forever.I bought the sound track to this movie and appreciate it more and more with each listening. I will definitely buy the DVD when it is released. This is a movie that is worth watching many times more.Joaquin and Reese are definitely Oscar contenders!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure and simple fantastic storytelling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a long, long wait for this film's theatrical release, I must say, I was NOT disappointed! It was great to see a biopic that isn't just about physical imitation (as Witherspoon &amp; Phoenix don't look like the folks they're playing to start with) that relies more on the actor's innate, intense, and instinctive portrayal of their character's emotional and psychological truths, and in this pic, there were many truths to relay. Our two leads, Joaquin Phoenix &amp; Reese Witherspoon, both deliver incredible performances reflecting Cash and Carter's intensities as well as their subtleties.(As a side note - I felt the same about Philip Seymour Hoffman's work in "Capote") Writer/director James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted, Copland) accomplished what he stated he was setting out to do - to create a film that celebrates both the icon and the fallible man that was Johnny Cash.I must admit that Mangold does juggle the story with what may be seen as too heavy a hand at times, playing up Cash's drug addiction, destructiveness, and self-centeredness more so that on the portions of life that offered him joy, which is where the concert and musical performance scenes come in and offer the film's viewer's a bit of a break from these torments.The story is told very simply, thank goodness, as it is a film that could have fallen into a stylized trap. It's almost as if Mangold told the story of Cash's life the way Cash himself would write a song - here's the story, raw and hard, with a beginning a middle and an end - all in all the best way to convey any message. Cash didn't trouble himself with metaphors; nor does Mangold.Reese Witherspoon, an actress whom I've always admired, is amazing as the confident &amp; amusing woman behind the mic when speaking, den-mother to the touring gaggle of unruly young men (Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, &amp; Roy Orbison), June Carter. It was nice to see her in a flick that ain't a comedy for a change! She gets to spread her dramatic wings some.Hey - Whether she's playing a flakey blonde (Legally Blonde) or the not-so-girl-next-door-like 90's gal unwillingly dropped into a 50's TV scenario (Pleasantville), she moves through her characters naturally, with a crackling energy, and with more depth than scripts often offer her.Phoenix again shows his diversity as an actor deeply dedicated to his craft. I think many may simply perceive him as the "rebel without a cause" sorta actor, and if you find yourself guilty of that inaccurate view of him, catch "WALK THE LINE", as well as his role as Commodus, the spoiled, pretentious, heartless, almost fey emperor in "Gladiator", not to mention his portrayal of the intensely religious, yet contradictory character of the Abbe du Coulmier (next to the brilliant Geoffrey Rush) in "Quills." All in all, the casting was incredible all across the board, from Robert Patrick as Cash's cold father, Shooter Jennings (yes ? Waylon's son) as Waylon Jennings, Johnny Holiday as Carl Perkins, to Tyler Hilton as a hopped up young Elvis.This is the perfect Cash lover's, rockabilly, &amp; country music lover's movie! * For those into vintage 50's clothing - You'll be dyin' for the clothing in this movie, not to mention the cars! ~T.Paul www.t-paul.com</fullReview>

What I mean is that it takes extraordinary ability to rise above the normative bio pics and make a piece which is masterful and genius in its own right, not just interesting to those who are interested in the subject matter.Pheonix plays Cash flawlessly. His deliberate, easygoing manner, his crooked half smile, and his twangy but honest voice. I give this film a nine out of ten not because I think it is better than ninety percent of the films ever made, but because it did an absolutely terrific job with the potential that it had. It is a very invovling, very real, very honest treatment of the life of Johnny Cash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overpraised Acting Performance by Joaquin Phoenix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joaquin Phoenix got much praise for his role as Johnny Cash in Walk The Line - a chick flick masquerading as a biopic of Johnny and June Carter Cash. His performance - one of the rare instances of a well-deserved Oscar snub - is certainly one of the most overrated in film history. In addition to looking absolutely nothing like Johnny Cash, he fails to sound or act like him as well.His attempts to impersonate Cash's baritone singing style were noble, but Cash was one of the most gut-wrenching of singers in popular music. He conveyed his feelings and emotions through his voice both live and in the recording studio, and was a tremendous storyteller in addition to being a singer and musician. Phoenix, unfortunately, was completely unable to tap into this aspect of the man and his music. Also, as captured in the recordings "Live At Folsom Prison" and "At San Quentin", Cash was a rather mellow individual when interacting with his appreciative audience of inmates. When the landmark Folsom gig is reenacted at the film's conclusion, Cash is depicted as wild and unhinged - almost as if his motivation for performing at the prison was to start a riot. Cash most certainly was a rebellious individual, but to depict him in a manner such as this is dishonest and irresponsible on behalf of the actor portraying him and the filmmaker, to say the least.The movie's sole redeeming quality is the fine performance by Reese Witherspoon as the love of John's life, June Carter. Unlike Phoenix, she succeeds in capturing the charm as well as capably mimicking the singing style of the late performer.Walk The Line is a slick Hollywood production which will surely satisfy the Lifetime movie-of-the-week crowd. But true fans of Johnny Cash and his music will be disappointed as it does not give the legend and his legacy the proper respect that is deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHY doesn't Joaquin Phoenix have an Academy Award by now???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EVERY film he has been in deserves an award, yet he is passed by.....The way he captured Johnny Cash in Walk The Line is enough of a reason to give this man an award for his awesome talent. Not to mention "To Die For" and every other film he has been in. He has a way of becoming any character that suits and does it in a brilliant way. Why Tom Hanks, whom is a good actor in his own right, gets two awards in a row and Joaquin is totally ignored is beyond me.Of all actors in this day and age, the greatest is Joaquin. And he is Vegan. Loves animals and wont eat or exploit them. You cant find anything better in a human being. Vegan, by the way, is a person that wont eat, use or wear anything that comes from animals. We Vegans are rare, but a growing awakening to animal rights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected a lot more from this film. I have nothing against the great Mr. Cash (may he rest in piece), or the actors, but the director/screenwriter James Mangold should be whipped because of this. I mean, the movie was *empty*. All it was, was the same old love-story we've seen over and over and over again. The movie had next to nothing to do with Johnny Cash's music. Only part when it even talked about his music was when he was in the studio, recording for the first time. After that, nothing. It was all downhill from there. I continued to watch the movie to the finish, out of respect for the real person behind the story and the great actors, but it was definitely boring. There was *nothing* in the script we haven't seen a million times before. I'm sure Mr. Cash's real life was a lot more interesting, and their love story was a lot more fascinating and unique than this piece of crap screenplay was.Shame on you, Mr Mangold. Cashing in on a dead guy like that. Johnny would deserve better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've waited a long time for "Walk the Line." A fan of Johnny Cash all my life, I was anxious to see a movie about his life. No movie can do justice to a man like Johnny Cash in the time permitted. But the part of his life this movie deals with, is does well as far as the story and gives a strong performance of what it chooses to show about the singer. My opinion is that it leaves out some very important things about Johnny Cash. I never got to see in this film the creative intelligence of the Man In Black when it came to his ability to write songs and music. I see it in the way he deals with situations in his life but not otherwise. It was something that made him good all his career that was missing. About the two main roles. Reese Witherspoon absolutely convinced me I was watching June Carter (with the exception of the first scene she was in). Sorry, but I am not one who is crazy about Juaquin Phoenix's performance. As good as it was, he only had me convinced during the scenes he was singing. That part of his performance was powerful but that is where I think he concentrated his study and efforts. In the non singing scenes I had flashbacks to other Juaquin roles - especially in Gladiator. There are other actors that could have matched Reese's performance level - whether they were considered or offered, I do not know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joaquin The Line: Don't Believe the Hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't believe the hype about Joaquin Phoenix and "Walk The Line." Although his performance is very good in the film about Johnny Cash he is very much overshadowed by Reese Witherspoon taking on the role of June Carter Cash. The film is good enough but not Oscar caliber and this is mainly due to the fact we are sure there was more planned and that more got left on the floor.First, the flaws with the film. The actor who played Elvis was about as far away from the King in looks and style as he could be. Maybe this was intentional. Elvis is such a dominating figure he might have taken away from the main story and character of Johnny Cash. The film did dwell way too much with Cash in a stupor and while this was evidently very true better use of the script might have been to eliminate some of the passing out, drugged out scenes and lengthen the picture to more of Cash's later life. As it is the film stops at his proposal to June on stage. If you were looking for "A Boy Named Sue," "Ragged Old Flag" and some of his other, later hits, you will be disappointed. The movie deals mainly about his life starting from a young farm boy to his father's utter disappointment and his pursuit of June Carter. Oh, and there is that drug thing.Now Cash did screw up his life big time with pills and booze. But I'm 52 years old and I remember more good about Johnny Cash's life than the bad. There was so much more to tell which the writer and director failed to capture. A good 30 minutes might have been cut from this film and added on about his salvation and the good part of his life. The fact so much time was spent on these scenes we saw over and over, it gave Joaquin Phoenix little time to show he can really act. The man is an excellent actor but this film, despite the Oscar hype, did nothing to show what he can do, due to the restrictions of the script itself. I particularly hated the way the film did not flow. You were to assume way too much and I believe this is because of the time constraints of the original script. There is nothing mentioned about Cash divorcing his first wife. They just end up packing up the car and leaving, never to be heard from again. There should have been something.Where was the story of the Man in Black? Cash himself told the story in his music about why he always wore black. Stating "maybe I am" when he is told he looks like he's going to a funeral, just doesn't cut it.His getting back to God was left to him standing in front of a Baptist Chapel with June waiting to go in. Nothing, not a bit of explanation. The film was filled with this type of cutting, leaving way too much on the editing floor. Maybe they should have left out a few drug scenes and left in some of the other cuts.Now, to the good side of this film. Phoenix did very well with what he was given. The film explored the almost hateful relationship Cash's father showed for his son which came out strong. The character selected to play Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne, son of country singer Sammi Smith) was as disgusting as Lewis was in real life. I also liked the casting of Shooter Jennings as Waylon Jennings in the film. I applauded seeing the son of "the Voice" portraying his father, a legend in the business. Ginnifer Goodwin was outstanding as Cash's first wife. Look for a best supporting nod for her.The scene at Sun Records is phenomenal and the story of the Folsom Prison Blues "live" album is very well done. The concert scenes of early Rock N' Roll are also strong.The best part about this film however, is Witherspoon. She nails June Carter to a tee. You can't help believe when it comes to Oscar time she will be nominated. She may not win, but I wouldn't bet against her. She was absolutely perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny's the MAN (in black) and June's great, too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Cash released his first song the year I was born, my Dad always loved his music, so I grew up listening to him. I'm not a country western music fan for the most part, but Johnny was one of those performers who could not be so singularly classified.This movie captured the man I knew all my life to be the young Johnny Cash. I have always been a Joaquin Phoenix fan, but he stepped it up a notch here with an Oscar-worthy performance. Reese Witherspoon, as well, captured the character of June Carter, which I did not believe possible when I first heard she had the role. She was wonderful.The scene right at the beginning of the movie where Johnny is looking at that power saw in Folsom Prison prior to his concert is one I will never forget. The foreboding of what is to come is ominous and powerfully presented.The scene where Johnny (as a 12 year old) is told by his father that the "wrong son died!" will help all of us understand the demons he ended up having to exorcise in his rocky road to fame and spiritual freedom.If the only Johnny Cash you remember is the one who sang on stage with evangelist Billy Graham or who appeared on various gospel specials or shows, sang songs by Nine Inch Nails, or if you are too young to remember who Johnny Cash even was, then this is your opportunity to see where the journey of a great man of God, the man in black, began.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Although I am not sure Johnny Cash gets due credit for his impact in the music world, I was very pleased when I heard that this film was going to be made. Supposedly Cash and his wife, the talented June Carter, hand picked Joaquin Phoenix and Reece Witherspoon to star. Whether true or a bit of legend, the two leads are nothing short of fantastic. Phoenix reminds of Gary Busey's turn as Buddy Holly more than 25 years ago.Writer/Director James Mangold ("Identity" "Girl Interrupted") does a really nice job balancing the personal and musical development of Cash the man, with a love story for the ages between John and June. Many films struggle to have one decent story line and this one manages to do justice to two. Phoenix and Witherspoon do all their own singing and it seems as if Phoenix is gaining most of the publicity for his vocals and acting, while Witherspoon seems to be getting lost in the shuffle. This is a shame because her energy onstage and strength during other scenes are really at the heart of the movie, much as I suspect June's strength was at the heart of the real life marriage. Nevertheless, both are outstanding performances and a joy to behold. The scenes of the Folsom Prison concert are raw and heartfelt.Make no mistake, the film does show warts and all. June's (2) marriage failures, and John's marital problems and addiction to pills that nearly ruined his life and career. Watching Cash's struggle to please his father (played chillingly by "T-2"'s Robert Patrick) will make you uncomfortable, as will his scenes with first wife Vivian (played well by Ginnifer Goodwin).My only criticisms of the film stems from the fact that it really glosses over all the issues with the children and that the Sun Record tour members are generally miscast ... the exception being Waylon Payne as Jerry Lee Lewis.The supporting cast was solid overall. Country Singer Shelby Lynne has little to do as Cash's mother; in a nice touch Waylon Jennings' real life son Scooter plays him; James Keach produces and plays the Folsum warden; and Sandra Ellis Lafferty is spot on as Mother Maybelle Carter.The amazingly talented T Bone Burnett handles the music in the film and does a nice job with the selections as well as the pace. The film probably will appeal to those over 40, but younger viewers should go to get a better understanding of the roots of country, folk and rock music. At the same time, they will be treated to a very real and touching love story.</fullReview>

Reese Witherspoon does an excellent job as June Carter and good lord, is June's behavior an example to us all. I dream of being able to be that polite, but I just can't do it.

		<shortDescription>Johnny Cash deserves a better film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The moment I looked at an exterior street setup with beautiful 1950s picture cars, each looking brand new without a speck of dust on it, I knew I was in for a poorly thought-out run of the mill biopic. From scenes of his all-string trio with a phantom drummer on the soundtrack to the dubious audience interaction at Folsom prison, the filmmakers aim low and mostly achieve their aim. The script takes needless liberties with the facts, presumably to "dummy down" a complex and interesting life story. For instance, Johnny Cash was a successful amateur musician long before he met Sam Phillips, not the unskilled beginner the film depicts. This is an insult to the audience. The second half devolves into an addiction story but deprives us of the "come to Jesus" moment that may have led to his recovery. And whatever became of his first wife and daughters? And so on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blues for The Man In Black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was introduced to Johnny Cash by my older cousin, via "A Boy Named Sue" and Cash's take on being led to the gallows, "25 Minutes To Go". This was before I discovered a boy named Alice (Cooper) and Led Zeppelin's "Gallows Pole", subsequently leading to deserting the previous generation's outlaws (like Cash and The Beatles) and going all long-haired, ripped-jeaned and anti-socialite. (To scallywags under 30: yes, respected and seemingly harmless icons were once regarded as threatening and subversive.)"Walk The Line", though lauded as a Johnny Cash biography ? is not. As a movie, formulaic; as a biography, a sordid "Behind The Music" episode at best. Focusing on only a short period of Cash's life (from boyhood until 1968), and then only on Cash's infatuation with vocalist June Carter, "Walk The Line" paints the prolific and determined young man as a neurotic stalker ? of a woman who is seemingly as mixed up as he is (if June's two failed marriages and intermittent dalliances with Cash are any indication). Who would've guessed this Grand Olde Pioneer's goals and destructive actions all revolved around The Getting Of Panty from June Carter? Noticeably missing was the scene where he holds up a boombox playing "In Your Eyes" outside June's bedroom window.Joaquin Phoenix is J.R. Cash (as Johnny liked to be called) and, though not a physical chameleon akin to the Day-Lewises or Oldmans, is a chameleon in *essence*, metamorphosing into every character he bequeaths his movie-going audience. An acting marvel, who should have been accruing awards since being "terribly vexed" by Russell Crowe, this role, whilst not his best, is at least on par with the Academy's provincial (and hypocritical) leanings towards "serious" thespianism. In singing all Cash's songs himself on the soundtrack, though he lacks the trademark weather-worn baritone, Phoenix nonetheless causes us to double-take on a few magic moments, superimposing the soul of Cash over his onstage persona. His vocal sync is near perfect (nailing that Cash sideways-mouthing), and with most of the songs adhering to simple I-IV-V progressions, the git-tar wrangling should not have caused many brain tumors with the actors-playing-musicians (though Phoenix likes holding that C chord a lot?)."Folsom Prison Blues" is played upon considerably, especially that infamous line, "I shot a man in Reno / Just to watch him die." Powerful words indeed, for a 23-year-old kid from Arkansas in 1955, cultivating the outlaw image which would render the eventual Man In Black? I once kicked a man in the Chattahoochee, but I don't think that counts. Jutting-jawed Reese Witherspoon, suitably perky and delicious enough to moon over, is June Carter, Cash's regular touring buddy and *raison d'?tre*, who pulls him from the depths of drug addiction and marries him after a final onstage plea from Cash - in a climax that debases everything Cash created. In making this love affair the movie's engine, it implies Cash would have been relegated to "Would you like fries with that?" without June, but he was already a success on his own terms before she was his "inspiration". We see that, after all the "biographical" misdirection, this is nothing more than a chick movie clothed in black and blues. Thankfully, the film neglects to show us that June turned Cash to Christianity ? being born once is enough to make some people annoying, but being born *twice* makes them unquestionably intolerable. Robert Patrick is Cash's unsympathetic father, Ray, who unrelentingly badgers Cash even into adulthood ? for the first time in cinema history, a lifelike rendition of parenthood! In their eyes, you never do Grow Up. Ray's hurtful digs play a large part in Cash's drive and despondency in this movie, yet a passive (and unrealistic) reconciliation at movie's end demeans this subtext, with Ray begrudgingly giving Cash his due, "You're the one with all the stories." Almost a backhanded compliment, the only reason this silly smoothing of hostilities was placed at movie's end was to wrap it neatly ? like a movie ? once again departing from any semblance of "biographical" intent. Cash's use of amphetamines propped him up during grueling tour schedules, yet we never hear exactly how scheduled he is. At times, Cash's real life itinerary grew to 200 cities in as many days ? quite an astonishing tidbit - yet the movie is content to have him away from home just long enough to rouse the ire of his Bitching Movie Wife.There's an easier way to watch a man die than shooting him in Reno ? marry him off to a small town girl. If there is one inherent message ? one thread in all these musician biographies - it is that the first girl you marry is going to be the Whining Byatch of the bunch.The death of Jack Cash, Johnny's older brother, was so telegraphed, you could see his table-saw mishap coming while watching the movie "Ray". Speaking of Taylor Hackford's and Jamie Foxx's "Ray", comparisons are inevitable ? seeing as "Walk The Line" is the same story rewritten with a white guy. Already the trend solidifies in delivering pop star biopics: as long as there are enough drugs and groupies and deaths in the family, it will assure an economically viable film ? all things being equal, "Ray" is a more fully-developed character study, thin as it is. "Walk The Line" is anorexic. Fans will love the full versions of Cash songs (performed by Phoenix), but are gonna Cry, Cry, Cry at how the film's creators did *not* Walk The Line with the finer details and, like the Boy Named Sue, may want to search the honky-tonks and bars for the men responsible and give them 25 Minutes To Go?(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enthralling On Stage and Off Stage Romantic and Musical Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Walk the Line" is enthralling from the opening scene as it makes clear this is a bio pic equally of sound and sight. We are aware of a strong rhythm as we're told a signature date and and place in musical history -- Folsom Prison 1968 -- and only leisurely is the source of that gradually increasing rumbling beat identified. Just as we are anticipating a standard performance recreation, the gray of prison shifts suddenly to a flashback of the wide open spaces of childhood memories that are not as sunny as the sky.Director James Mangold in obviously close partnership with musical supervisor T. Bone Burnett ties the intertwined, riveting stories of Johnny Cash and June Carter very much to their roots in Americana music at mid-20th century, capturing the interplay of music, period life on the road and feelings. The tense dramatic scenes are silent on the soundtrack, completely enthralling the audience, so that the music emphasis is on music-related scenes.The detail on music authenticity is marvelous, both in the background selections, like Wanda Jackson, and the foreground re-enactments, as Burnett has done so well from "O Brother Where Art Thou?" to "Cold Mountain," but the film doesn't patronize to explain the historical significance to un-musically knowledgeable audience members as it's more personal here. So it's just background mise en scene that we see Johnny the child drawn to listen to the Carter family on the Grand Ole Opry radio show, as we hear June the child introduced, when his family finds even those icons of traditionalism too far astray from gospel music. Later we see him take in the black and white sounds and rhythms of post-war Memphis, drawing him to legendary Sun Studios. Though Dallas Roberts' portrayal of Sam Phillips seems a bit too bland, at least compared to how charismatic the legendary producer seemed in later interviews (let alone Rip Torn doing a similar character in "40 Shades of Blue"), we are gradually brought into the ferment of the rockabilly nexus that revolutionized popular music -- Jerry Lee Lewis (engagingly captured by Waylon Payne, from that signature tinkling of the 88s to the "killer" personality); young Elvis (Tyler Hilton doing one of the mildest of the interpretations on film); and Roy Orbison (Johnathan Rice capturing his look but not quite his sound, as unfortunately Chris Isaak is probably too old now to portray the young Roy).June is a critical musical link for them all from country to rock 'n' roll and the burgeoning folk scene. Her important linkage from the traditional Carter family to rock to Dylan is beautifully, albeit quite briefly, encapsulated through a wonderful segue of Reese Witherspoon herself with an auto-harp singing "Wildwood Flower" as "My mama's favorite song" into a duet with Joaquin Phoenix singing as Cash on Dylan's "It Ain't Me Babe," with its lyrics particularly ironic for the duo. These connections become even more personally significant as Mother Maybelle is shown as a key forgiving and steadfast rock in both their lives. Details such as Cash's move from Sun to Columbia are just indicated visually in passing, while fans will finally now get straight how their children Carlene Carter and Roseanne Cash are step-sisters, as the guilt over their family responsibilities are a major plot point.The love story on stage is as dramatic as its off stage progression, even though we know how it'll eventually end, especially when June tries to limit their interactions to when they click musically. Witherspoon is breathtaking at capturing the complexity of June's life-- the comedy, that we of course know the actress is a smooth pro at, as June explains how she developed the comic persona in the family business to insecurely stand out compared to the musical talent she was surrounded by, as well as the tightly wound, uber polite professionalism of someone who's been on the road since childhood such that she can more than hold her own on tour with these raunchy, macho guys like traveling salesmen. But the depths of June's hurts from fans and family pressures that Witherspoon portrays, the sensuality of the romance and close friendship, and especially the magic she creates on stage with Joaquin Phoenix in the many combustible on-stage performances are new revelations to us of her talent.All this would be of illustrative interest to music fans if it weren't for Phoenix's intense performance. We see the influences come together that make up his guilt and rebellion that he incorporated into his songs. But the camera seems to restlessly move when it's not focused on him, as he powerfully draws the audience in from the first shot of him back stage at the prison. He is not just physically being another person -- not just living in Cash's skin in a dead-on capturing of body language and even an extremely close approximation of that voice-- but this is as much a psychological portrait as well. It's spooky this year with Philip Seymour Hoffman channeling "Capote" and David Straithairn doing Edward Murrow in "Good Night, and Good Luck," but Phoenix goes beyond those recreations to an intensity of capturing the subject's inner life. He'll surely earn the Best Actor for the Golden Globes comedy/musical category.The camera work and cinematography are beautiful. While the many southern locations are used very atmospherically, each scene has a different cast of sharpness and color, from period brown to the grays of prison to the green of peace.Shooter Jennings too briefly captures his dad Waylon completely. Shelby Lynne is marvelous as momma Cash singing gospel in the cotton fields. Robert Patrick is a bit stiffly one-note as Cash's father.The packed opening weekend matinée audience with a multi-ethnic and multi-racial audience of all ages of adults as the kids and teens were at the new Harry Potter, was intently involved and cheered at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved it!!!!! Joaquin Phoenix is excellent, definitely deserves an Oscar!!! His portrayal of the late great Johnny Cash was astounding to say the least. The love affair between Johnny &amp; June was portrayed with lots of class &amp; dignity. Brought me to tears at the end. I didn't want it to end. Phoenix even does his own singing &amp; if you close your eyes you think it was Johnny Cash. Or maybe not since Phoenix looked just like Cash in the movie. Excellent just excellent, I can't express enough or there are not the words to tell how great this movie is. I want to see it over &amp; over. Shooter Jennings as Waylon was just a moment that brought tears again. He did a great job &amp; looks just like his daddy. Just loved it. Everyone go see it, you won't be disappointed. Phoenix was picked by Cash &amp; what an excellent choice. Phoenix even learned guitar for this movie. Just brilliant. Great movie. Loved it &amp; will love it forever. Johnny &amp; June are in Heaven smiling &amp; are just so proud &amp; so is Waylon. RIP. Love forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "Walk the Line" is superb. The storyline is great. The leading Actor did an Oscar Winning performance. It was also sad in a lot of area, especially in the scene where Johnny Cash's first wife is on the floor. Even though according to the film June Carter helped Johnny Cash get off drugs, his first wife would have been supportive if given the chance. I did not know that June Carter wrote the song "Ring of Fire," so I learned something by watching the film. I liked the scene where it started out with Johnny Cash as a child. I love films that display the childhood of famous people, because it helps to understand why they became the legend that they were destined to become.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk the Line is Right on Target</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) grew up during the Depression and through the second World War as the son of a poor sharecropper (Ray Cash, played by Robert Patrick) on an Arkansas cotton farm. His father's distance and clear favoritism for his older son shaped the young J.R as much as did his mother's love for singing hymns. A childhood tragedy also contributed greatly to the make up of the man J.R. later became.As a young man, J.R. joins the Air Force. He's stationed at a base in Germany where he fills his spare time learning to play the guitar. He's also obsessed with his girlfriend back home, the pretty Vivian Liberto (Ginnifer Goodwin). John eventually wins her hand and settles into a small apartment with his wife and new baby. Trying his hand at door to door sales in Memphis with little success, he yearns for his music even as his young wife tries to get him to settle down and be more responsible.John is finishing up another long day when he happens by a small recording studio where, for a few dollars, fledgling musicians can record their own songs. He begs owner Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts) for an audition. John and a couple of his buddies have been playing casually in their spare time for months. Unfortunately, the gospel music they play doesn't impress Phillips, and he bluntly tells them so. Out of sheer desperation, John plays a song he wrote about a man doing hard time in Folsom Prison. Phillips is no idiot; he agrees to work with the earnest singer/songwriter, and Johnny Cash is born.In those days, incessant touring was the only way that singers could both make a living and get the exposure they needed to ensure radio airplay and record sales. It's on one such tour that Johnny meets pretty June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Eventually, traveling around the country, the entire troupe become friends. Waylon Jennings (who is played by his son, Shooter Jennings), a young Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne), Roy Orbison (Johnathan Rice), and more of the soon-to-be greats are among them.Although Johnny is successful with his music, his wife is running out of patience. Her husband isn't often home and when he is, he's exhausted. She also worries about the growing friendship between Johnny and June. Eventually, Vivian can no longer hide her disdain. Johnny's disappointment in himself only grows when he's still unable to please his hard-hearted father. He escapes his unhappy home life by touring some more, and then by sliding into drinking and worse. Cash's career ? and his life ? might have ended shortly after that if not for his adoration of June. Though both are married, Johnny's not inclined to give up though he runs into more than a few stumbling blocks along the way.Joaquin Phoenix has already been singled out for high praise and for rumors of Oscar? as a result of his performance. It's true that Phoenix is astounding in the role. Making his performance even more amazing is that he learned to play guitar just for this part, and that he does all of his own singing (both of which he does credibly). What you may not have heard is just what a stunning performance Reese Witherspoon gives. She more than holds her own as an actress in the face of Phoenix's formidable talent, and then goes beyond that with some terrific tunes of her own. When the two perform duets, not only is the music enjoyable but the on screen chemistry is such that you've no doubt in your mind whatsoever that Johnny and June were destined to be together.Ginnifer Goodwin and Robert Patrick are both good, especially the latter. In fact, I loathed Patrick's character which is a good indicator that the actor did a fine job in the creation of a man who apparently knew little about love and even less about raising children, but who did his best despite it all. The supporting cast is also excellent.James Mangold, the director of such films as the wonderful Girl, Interrupted and the woefully underrated Identity, did a fine job directing; as the co-writer of the screenplay, his vested interest in the movie was clear and likely enhanced his direction. There are some edits that seem abrupt and effectively interrupt the flow of the story; there are a few matters that are mysteriously skipped or glossed over (perhaps these are scenes that will be returned to the film in the eventual DVD version). But as a whole, the film is well crafted, and the music, by the way, is terrific.The performances alone are worth the price of a ticket, but the story, too, is something well worth telling. Johnny Cash really was one of the greats despite his personal flaws; that he overcame many of those shortcomings only makes him an even better man. And the love story between him and June Carter Cash is at once poignant and passionate, and will likely prove inspirational as well. Walk the Line isn't perfect, but it's awfully, awfully close...FAMILY SUITABILITY: Walk the Line is rated PG-13 for "some language, thematic material, and depiction of drug dependency." Small children aren't going to enjoy this movie anyway, and even older kids may not enjoy it much thanks to the fact it takes place in a past they've never known and features people they've likely heard of only in passing. But for adults, Walk the Line has much to recommend it. I said I wasn't a Johnny Cash fan, and I wasn't. But Walk the Line was a film I thoroughly enjoyed, and as a result, even gained some appreciation for Cash's musical legacy. I recommend Walk the Line to movie and music fans alike. It truly doesn't get much better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I am not being out of line when I state that "Walk The Line" will be one of the most celebrated films of 2005. This Johnny Cash bio should cash in a few Oscar nominations for its lead actors, writers, and director. The film does primarily focus on Johnny Cash's relentless romantic pursuit of June Carter. It is not created as a love story but more as a man's willingness to romance a woman he has enduring love for. I will "Cry, Cry, Cry" if Joaquin Phoenix &amp; Reese Witherspoon are not nominated for Oscar acting nominations. The Phoenix does rise up here from his acting ashes with a vociferous &amp; breathtaking performance as Cash. Joaquin even perfects the Cash sound by doing his own singing; sound like money in the Cash vocal bank to me. Hey June, could anybody could have perfected your part better than the flawless Reese Witherspoon? Witherspoon also masters the June Carter persona and voice "withhertune" too. Director James Mangold might see another "mangold" in a Best Director Oscar statuette in the near future. His arty direction of "Walk the Line" puts him in line in as one of the deserving candidates for a Best Director nomination. The musical sequences of the film deserve a high note as one of the optimum ever captured in film. The buzz has already started on how hot this film is , or in other words the "ring of fire" has already been chained for "Walk The Line". So line up at your local movie theatre for this linear narrative that is "Walk the Line". It will be cash well spent! ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting this movie to be very good, but it by far exceeded my expectations. The acting was sensational, and the music was incredible. It was even better considering that both Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash's music was actually performed by their prospective actors. Truly breath taking, even if you are not a big Johnny Cash fan. This movie diverges into the personal turmoils of Cash and Carter, and draws the audience into the ups and down, which, helps draw them together. It binds heartache, divorce, guilt, family issues, love, and music together into a beautiful collage of genuine, heartfelt energy. It was remarkable, and worth every bit of hype it received.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am dumbfounded as to how this movie got so many rave reviews from people on this board; I can only suppose it has been swamped by studio supporters, since I see only toward the last pages are the real opinions coming out.This is about the worst biopic I've ever seen. Phoenix wasn't that bad, but he reminded me of Johnny Cash not at all. Not his looks, not his voice, not his mannerisms, just nothing. I can't say too much about Witherspoon, as I never saw June to make a comparison.So, the live performances, to which we were treated aplenty, were largely meaningless and, I'm sorry to say, there wasn't much in between them to take our minds off this fact. The story, such as it was, was full of threads that never went anywhere and it otherwise left us alternately either hanging or belaboured by the obvious. The editor must have been on the same pills Johnny was taking, because it made me feel nervous and irritable.This gives me cause to question the value of IMDb reviews as a whole, since I couldn't have previously imagined so many people being so totally wrong. I have many times relied on IMDb to get some idea about a film before I went to the trouble to actually see it. I prefer to believe my theory of the board being flooded by friends of the studio. In this case, I saw the movie first, before the reviews, else I would be in a proper state right now, out for blood.If I have to have an opinion, I would say this film is an insult to Johnny Cash and all his fans. That's all there is to it. If you haven't seen it yet, then take my advice and don't bother. 2 out of 10.freddyzdead at gmail dot com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hello I'm Johnny Cash". I Am Still In Awe, Over This Movie, If Joaquin, Reese Don't Win Oscars, And It Doesn't Win Best Picture I Will Be Seriously Irate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am still in awe over this movie, if Joaquin, Reese don't win Oscars, and it does not win best picture I will be seriously irate. All the characters are fabulous, and the story is just amazing, plus Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon are simply incredible in this! and give two of the best performances I have ever seen!. I am also stunned by Joaquin and Reese's singing, I had absolutely no clue that they could sing that incredibly well!, plus Joaquin had all the mannerisms of Johnny Cash down perfectly, just the way he walks, the way he does things with his guitar, his voice, it was just jaw dropping!.Hell Reese was so good that she is actually way better then most of the singers out now a days in my opinion, and the music was just a blast to listen too, plus Reese and Joaquin had some of the most amazing chemistry I have ever seen!. But it's not all about music, it has an extremely gripping story, as we look into Johnny's major drug addiction, which was fascinating but also disturbing at the same time, and the opening is very memorable, plus Robert Patrick is amazing as the cold somewhat heartless father of Johnny. All the characters are extremely likable, and The ending was simply awesome, as it left me with a smile on my face!, plus it's brilliantly written and made as well. This is unquestionably one of the best movies i have ever seen, and while I didn't care for Ginnifer Goodwin's character(Vivian Cash), she played her role very well, plus I found myself having the urge to clap after it was over. The scene where Johnny is confused, and is trying to get the stuck tractor out of the mud, is actually quite powerful, and the film also has some great humorous moments such as Johnny's band and the other singers getting drunk, with Reese chucking bottles at them all. To be quite honest, the reasons I went to see this film was to see what all the fuss was about, and i'm a huge fan of Reese Witherspoon, and also to see How Joaquin played Cash,and I must say I agree with everyone who raves about this film!, plus James Mangold deserves an Oscar for best Director!, in my opinion. There are plenty of shocking and surprising moments, and even though it's over 2 hours, you won't be bored as the film is extremely gripping and engrossing!, plus it was funny seeing a very young Elvis Presley. I loved it when Joaquin and Reese sung duets!, and I also loved the part near the end when Johnny sings at Folsom Prison, plus Jonny and June are so likable you will find yourself rooting for them!. My review for this may not be too popular with most reviewers however, I just loved it that much, as it's now one of my favorite movies!, plus I really do hope this film cleans up the Oscars!. I really can't see why anyone would hate this film, it's got everything you want, perfect story, incredible Oscar worthy performances, fabulous music, and lots more!, plus while I am happy that well over 2000 people have voted this a 10 I am absolutely shocked and appalled that 114 people have voted this a 1. I am still in awe over this movie if Joaquin, Reese don't win Oscars, and it doesn't win best picture, I will be seriously irate!, and if you haven't seen this, please go to the theater and check it out immediately you won't regret it it's now one of my absolute my favorite films.The Direction is masterful!. James Mangold does a masterful job here, while nothing really Fancy, it was still masterful, as he kept the film at an extremely engrossing pace. The Acting is no doubt Oscar worthy, with two of the best performances ever!. Joaquin Phoenix Is just incredible here, and unquestionably gives one of the best performances in the history of the Cinema, his chemistry with Reese is seriously amazing, and just the way he had all the mannerisms down on Johnny Cash perfectly, he is also an incredibly good singer, and sounded a lot like Cash in my opinion, i will never forget his chilling performance, if he does not win an Oscar, then i will be seriously irate because he deserves it!(Joaquin Rules!!!!!!!). .Reese Witherspoon is amazing as always, and is just incredible here, she is incredibly gorgeous, had amazing chemistry with Joaquin, is also an incredibly good singer, and for the people that thought she was miscast you were dead wrong, she was just as good as Joaquin, and gives one of the best performances ever!,as she is my favorite actress, give her an Oscar already!, she was just spellbinding on screen, i couldn't take my eyes off her! (Reese Rules!!!!!!!!!). Ginnifer Goodwin is really excellent as Vivian Cash, however her character really got on my nerves as i thought she was spoiled and real selfish, however she still played the role with perfection!, and had good chemistry with Joaquin. Robert Patrick is amazing as Johnny's Dad, he was cold and heartless at times, and had a lot of trouble forgiving Johnny with what happened to Jack he was really intense he deserves a lot of recognition for his performance here.Shelby Lynne(Carrie Cash),Tyler Hilton(Elvis Presley),Waylon Payne(Jerry Lee Lewis),Dan Beene(Erza Carter),Ridge Canipe(Young J.R.),Lucas Till(Young Jack Cash), all do wonderful with what they have to do.Overall It's one of the best films i have ever seen, and is now one of my absolute favorites SEE IT!. ***** out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Walk the Line" is a warmed over version of "Ray," trotted out just in time for Oscar consideration, shrewd timing since the Academy never saw a biopic it didn't like.The problem is that "Walk the Line" is inferior to "Ray" in just about every way, and I wasn't even a huge fan of the latter picture. If you don't know anything about Johnny Cash, or what it was about his music that makes him such a legendary figure, you won't learn it here. As played by Joaquin Phoenix in a horribly mannered performance, Cash started out his career barely able to function from one day to the next, and never really improved until the love of a good woman (enter June Carter) turned him around. Phoenix's performance is one-note, all mumbled lines and eye-rolling freak out scenes. There's absolutely nothing interesting about Cash in this version of events, and there's no explanation of what it was about him that June Carter was so drawn to. Reese Witherspoon gives the better performance, but the material she's given limits the impact she can make. Johnny and June's relationship is muddled and ambiguous. I could never tell whether they were involved or not until his final freak out scene when he clumsily gets her to agree to marry him (don't even ask me why she'd want to).The biggest tragedy of this movie is that it doesn't provide any insight into what made Cash a genius, or how the demons he was working through influenced the kind of music he wanted to make. Tepid as I thought "Ray" was, it at least accomplished that much.I've heard some people say that the performances in "Walk the Line" are better than the movie itself. Revise that to read Reese Witherspoon's performance is better than the movie, and I'll agree.Grade: C+</fullReview>

A moving story, not your standard bio pic, and clears up all the Johnny Cash myths out there. Technically, quite an achievement for a new director (or is he?) and there is not a false note in this film. A must see, and you don't have to be a country music fan to appreciate the genius of Johnny Cash, and the appeal of June Carter.Too bad Johnny and June cannot see it, they would be so pleased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Walked The Line... Straight To The Doors.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I'd heard about Walk the Line were seemingly wonderful things, like "the acting is wonderful" and "The music is superb and great to listen to", so I went to the cinema expecting a fantastic movie.I should've gone to see King Kong again.Now I'm not a fan of Johnny Cash (I do love 3 or 4 songs though), but my god, what a dull, dull movie about a dull, drunk man. Joaquin couldn't draw any pity from me even when his character was at the bottom of the barrel. Even Reese's spark seemed to be out as she just went through the motions of the movie. And the overly dramatic cinematography was the final nail in the coffin.If you want a movie to depress you, Walk the Line is great. Otherwise, go see a movie where the actors/actresses aren't made of cardboard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE!! Walk the Line started out great, with Cash getting ready to perform in Folsom Prison and a palpable sense of growing excitement. Unfortunately, this was the climax of the movie.Reese Witherspoon shines every time she's on screen. She oozes charisma. Some have complained about her singing, but I thought she was fine. Then again, I'm not a June Carter fan. Unfortunately, while Joaquin Phoenix did a great cardboard cutout of Cash, aping the looks and the moves, he has none of the charisma. He has no spark. The actor who played Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne) blew Phoenix off the stage and the screen.Overlooked in all the undeserved hype about Joaquin Phoenix were excellent jobs by Shelby Lynne as Cash's mom and Robert Patrick as his Dad. Especially impressive was Lynne. She did more simply with a look than all of Phoenix's hysterics combined.Ginnifer Goodwin also turned in a great performance as Vivian Cash, Johnny's first wife.Walk the Line was not a bad movie. It's just easily forgettable, boring, and joyless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Other than an electrifying performance by its star, what we have here is another typical show biz biopic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WALK THE LINE is the 2005 biopic tracing the roots of country music legend Johnny Cash, as well as his relationship with second wife, June Carter. As someone who has, if nothing else, a vague recollection of Cash, I found him to be a refreshing topic for a film biography. Since his son's name is one of the names credited to the screenplay, I would think that it is probably pretty accurate as far as the facts are concerned, but that doesn't make it necessarily a great film. Joaquim Phoenix is electrifying as Johnny Cash and totally nails the darkness and intensity of the character in a performance that I now think should have won him the Oscar. Phoenix completely loses himself in this character and turns in one of the greatest screen creations of a real life person ever. Reese Witherspoon won an Oscar for her work as June Carter, but I was not nearly as impressed with her work as I was with Phoenix. It's a solid performance but Oscar-worthy? I don't know. Other than an amazing performance by Phoenix, what we get here is just another show biz biography with all the same tired scenes we've seen in every show biz biography, from the "My daddy was mean to me when I was a kid" scene to the "I don't really have a drug problem, I'm just misunderstood" scene. Ginnifer Goodwin plays Johnny's first wife, who is drawn as such a total b*tch here you have to wonder why Johnny stayed with her. What makes this film worth seeing and what earned it this reviewer's rating is the breathtaking performance by Joaquim Phoenix as Johnny Cash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witherspoon very good but an Oscar? C'mon!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught the film on DVD recently and thought it was very, very good. Better than Ray (storywise)and the equal of Coal Miner's Daughter. Joaquin Phoenix gets better with each role. I thought he was stellar and should have gotten an Oscar for Gladiator and the same goes for this one although between him and Phillip Hoffman and Heath Ledger's knockout original performance in "Brokeback" there could have been the first 3-way tie. In any event, I like Reese Witherspoon, that's for sure, but I saw her role as more a supporting one than a starring one and she was more or less "Reese Witherspoon" if you know what I mean. Not too much different than her "Legally Blonde" persona albeit in a different setting. I'm not suggesting someone else should have played the part but if Phoenix didn't win best actor then I certainly don't think she should have one either. Still, Phoenix is A-1 as Cash. In the scene in the diner when he tells June that he no longer talks about his brother because other people tired of it, I'll bet he channeled memories of his own brother, River. I also appreciated the way Cash's contemporary stars (Jerry Lee, Elvis, etc.) were used. Good enough to own at home.</fullReview>

This is very easily Reese Witherspoon's best performance ever! She was fabulous playing June Carter Cash. Joaquin Phoenix was awesome as Johnny Cash also! I loved this movie so much that we had to run to WalMart afterwards to get the soundtrack and a couple of Johnny's cd's. I also have to say I think Joaquin and Reese sing way better than Johnny and June. Wow, they could have potential singing careers if they wanted to. Bravo!

Johnny and June were really legends in country music, and Reese and Joaquin did a great job in portraying the person inside of these legendary country music icons.

		<shortDescription>Half-truth, good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is an incomplete truth still true? After seeing Walk the Line, the tale of the rise, fall and resurrection of Johnny Cash from 20th Century Fox, two glaring omissions from his story jump out immediately: 1.) Cash's commitment to Christ in the latter half of his life and 2.) the latter half of his life.The film, under the direction of James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted), follows the well known pattern of music biopics. We start with Cash as a child to get the back-story on what made him who he became, fast-forward through other formative experiences, see his fame increase, see him come crashing down through the emptiness of life on the road and see him redeemed by the love of a woman.In this respect, Walk the Line is a gem, much like last year's Ray. The viewer is confronted in expertly shot scenes with the harsh realities of fallen humanity and the truth that fame has a unique power to corrupt. The magic of Cash's story, however, is that the height of his fame was later, after his turnaround. Perhaps Hollywood's eternal bias against all things Christian (unless you're a Catholic) kept Mangold and the producers (who included Cash and Carter's son ? one would think he'd focus on the father he knew) from pursuing that aspect of his life.Don't get me wrong, this is a well made movie. The acting is particularly stunning. Casting Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter (Cash) was a stroke of genius. In fact, IMDb.com reports that Cash and his wife hand picked their on-screen portrayers when plans for the movie were made before they passed away in 2003. The duo even spent months learning to sing and play the guitar and auto harp to seal the authenticity of the film. Phoenix's stage presence is eerily Cash-like; I often found myself wondering whether I was watching an actor or a recording of the man himself.Additionally, though the film (by necessity) was without a defining secondary character, the various supporting parts were brilliantly cast. Robert Patrick's coolly hostile Ray Cash provides the backdrop to his son Johnny's drive for success and meaning. Tyler Hilton as Elvis Presley, Waylon Payne as Jerry Lee Lewis and Dallas Roberts as Sun Records founder Sam Phillips gave the film a genuine insight into the birth of popular culture as we know it.Walk the Line is, as Cash's music, "steady like a train and sharp like a razor." It never soars quite like it could, though. Cash and Carter's failed marriages are never truly resolved to the point where the viewer feels right in rooting for their love (the real Cash and Carter shared one of the longest, most exemplary marriages in the history of pop-culture icons ? it is widely claimed that Cash died of a broken heart shortly after June passed). Cash's inner struggles with the God he was raised to love and his ultimate redemption through Christ that were barely hinted at in the film might have made a better story in their own right.At one point in the film, Cash and his "band" perform a gospel tune that he wrote in audition for Phillips, and the famed producer stops them halfway through to say that their music was no good because he couldn't believe in them. Cash angrily asks Phillips if he's saying he doesn't believe in God. Phillips responds that Gospel is unmarketable and Cash needs to believe in himself to succeed."If you were hit by a truck, and you were out there lyin' in the gutter and you could sing one song, one song to let God know how you felt about your time on earth, one song to sum you up; that's the kind of song that truly saves people," Phillips says, at which point Cash busts out a little tune he wrote once, "Folsom Prison Blues." Though this incident may have started the hero on the road to success, the rest of the movie implies that belief in God was what held Cash back. What ultimately saved him from the gutter, however, was the Gospel he first sang about, and its impact on him reflected in "Hurt," "The Man Comes Around" and other songs from his later career is what burned him into the memory of fans for generations to come.Unlike many such music films, Walk the Line is probably least enjoyable to fans of Cash's music. The righteous crusader and country music legend that most people under the age of 50 think of when they think of Johnny Cash is all but absent from the movie, leaving many of us wondering what the point of the film was. The middle of a story seldom stands alone, and the tale of the Man in Black is no exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The music is the highpoint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best part, IMHO, was the music. I particularly enjoyed the way that Joaquin Phoenix's vocals matured over the course of the film - he did a good job evoking Johnny Cash's distinctive style without resorting to cheap imitation. And Reese Witherspoon was delightful, particularly singing "Jackson".The performances, particularly Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, were compelling and believable. Reese captured June's liveliness and humor beautifully as well as her vulnerability - the warmth with which she responded to any approach by a fan really struck me.While I enjoyed the movie a great deal, it didn't break any ground in the biopic genre, Daddy issues, survivor guilt, repeating the bad parenting cycle, fame leading to bad behavior, redemption - sure, it's all true, but it would have been nice to see it play out a little less predictably. I also would have been interested in seeing more of the importance that religion played in Johnny Cash's life, as well as the role of Mother Maybelle in his recovery - Cash often credited her with his salvation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great portrayal of a one of a kind artist and personality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joaquin Phoenix bears an uncanny resemblance to a young Johnny Cash and in my opinion does a spot on interpretation of him. Reese Witherspoon has all the humor that June Carter used to have and they have a wonderful on screen chemistry. John Carter Cash and some of Johnny's other close friends had a direct input into the movie and from all accounts everything is based on facts with a little added Hollywood flair of course. They also have great acting by Tyler Hilton as a young Elvis and Shooter Jennings as his father Waylon in their short scenes. Jerry Lee Lewis also is portrayed in this film.I gave it a 10 because Johnny Cash is one of my all time favorite American artists and personalities and I came away from the movie completely satisfied. In my opinion, Joaquin Phoenix was able to capture at least a little bit of the magical personality that Johnny Cash possessed. He also did a very good job matching his singing voice, though of course Johnny Cash's voice is one of a kind. It is just a great movie and a way of remembering a great musician and singer as well as a great American personality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed repeat of "Ray"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie about 20 other times with the slight difference that it was about another famous person. "Ray" is the most recent example. Parallels were rampant. Let us compare "Ray" and "Walk the Line." Ray Charles experienced a rather monotonous life sprinkled with a drug addiction and affairs. Johnny Cash did, too. Ray Charles had a brother that died, and he was partially responsible. Johnny Cash did, too. Ray Charles was a famous musician from the mid-20th century. Johnny Cash was, too. Another complaint has not to deal necessarily with the movie, but its matter. Why is it that the rich and famous tend to mess up otherwise ideal lives? The song "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" quite accurately depicts my feelings about this subject. That wasn't necessarily the fault of those involved in making the film, but it's still something that irritates me about the "Walk the Line" and all of its copies. On the positive side, I must truly congratulate Reese Witherspoone on her terrific performance; I felt she did the best job. Phoenix followed behind for a close 2nd place. If you like biopics and/or are a Johnny Cash fan, you'd probably enjoy it. I'm not really either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining example of conventional genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When discussing movies that celebrate or elaborate on the lives of celebrities, I like to keep in mind that they are still only celebrities, no matter how entertaining they were or still are, nor how finely crafted the film is. After all, they're contribution to society, while widespread, hardly determines anything of value in a historical context. At best, they can move people, at least momentarily, and while that is something of note, I would argue that their impact is superficial, and minimal, when compared to that of true heroes. I'm referring to the everyday and the famous alike; those who stand for something important and even change society. From civil rights leaders to school teachers to volunteers, these are the people who should have stories told about them and their struggle. True artists, those who create and innovate and change their landscape in some way are important. I am referring more to famous entertainers, those who are elevated to the status of celebrity and are given endless fame and fortune for their (arguably) overvalued contribution and 'talent'. They are heralded as heroes and icons and are given social status that they most likely don't deserve. Their work may be needed in some way, but to celebrate them in the same way we celebrate those true heroes can seem ridiculous and distasteful. That being said, when they're story is told, it can be riveting drama, at the very least a welcomed escape. Last weekend the wife and I saw Walk the Line, the new film about Johnny Cash. the celebrated singer/songwriter who transcended genres and routinely created sounds that were unique and all his own. He was walking pop culture museum, really, going back to his days on the road with Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis when they were just starting out, and intersecting with artists like Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson, among others. If any performer was worthy of a cinematic tribute it might be Cash. That brings up another point, however. Walk the Line is more a tribute to the singer than a intellectual essay on any themes that he, his career or his music may have represented. When one makes such a conventional biopic one treads dangerously close to the territory normally inhabited by TV movies and various celebrity worship. Its hard to make something artistically memorable in this way. Yet, Cash's life was fascinating, and because he touched millions of people with his sound, it's intrigue is all the more palpable. Walk the Line attempts to capture that fascination and explain a little about what drove Cash to play. In this it succeeds, at least minimally. The portrayal of "rise to fame, a mighty fall and subsequent rise back", is formulaic, at least plot-wise, and doesn't offer any new insight into the phenomenon which his is so common in pop culture today. However, it's basically true, which earns it a stay of execution, as it were, in this review. Where is succeeds is not it is plot, however, but in its presentation of the played-out story. True, it follows the basic outline for biopics, but the characters on screen seem real and the entertainment value of the actor's performances is worth the price of admission. Joaquin Phoenix plays Cash in a way that memorializes him and captures his reality at the same time. Its not an imitation but a interpretation, and belongs on a shelf with other notable screen portrayals of famous personalities, the most recent of which was Jamie Fox in 2004's Ray. Both Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who plays his second wife June Carter, sing and play their own music, and the effect its invaluable. Witherspoon finally breaks away from her light, Hollywood resume to do something of note and it doesn't go unnoticed. The casting here was brilliant; she fits the character like a glove. Its more than just the actors in the spotlight, however. The film is well crafted, if conventional. Part of that is the film's visuals. Hollywood routinely makes period pieces that to often look like big Hollywood productions and not the reality they are portraying. That's not the case here, where the photography, set and costume design work well and lend the film some authenticity.That feeling of authenticity also lies in the story's execution. What to include in the finished story, how to end it and its overall pacing is also handled expertly by director James Mangold and Gil Dennis, who both collaborated on the screenplay. One won't notice the 136 minute running time, in fact they may leave wanting more. It doesn't aspire too high, as Hollywood tends to do, and therefore what it isn't is not a huge disappointment. What it isn't is the end all discussion of Cash's career and musical creativity. Nor is it a critique of fame and its mostly dilapidating effects. For that, one would need to listen to his music, view some of his live performances, read his autobiographies, watch an interview or two and maybe check out some of the music that he was inspired by. That's not the point of this film and shouldn't be. Walk the Line, in the end, is an entertaining look into a fascinating life and a celebration of Cash's musical legacy, at least that of his career's first act. There's certainly nothing wrong with that, especially being that is so darn entertaining (and I'm not even a big Cash fan.) However, I would like to recommend something of a little more substance when award season comes along (Good Night, and Good Luck, for instance.) After all, there are more important things in this world than the lives of famous musicians, even the really good ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The acting is stunning but the story is biopic formula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enough can't be said about Reese Witherspoon's performance as June Carter. She nails the duality of a character who lives on and off the stage while maintaining a purity and charm that certainly has pushed her into the A-list.Joaquin Phoenix as the man in black is superb as well. He takes the role into some pretty dark territory and sells it without question. Cash is haunted throughout, by the death of his brother, the mental abuse of his father, and a marriage/life that was rushed into. A complicated character made far more difficult to play by the fact that Cash is a man of few words - leaving Phoenix to mostly express himself with physicality and song.This movie will not make Johnny Cash any new fans. His music isn't exactly as accessible in snippets as the grooves of Ray Charles (the comparisons between Walk the Line and Ray are inevitable as they have many scenes and a general form in common.) With Cash you have to get a sense of the persona he created in his songs...and film isn't the best medium in which to present lyrics.A couple of scenes are absolutely stand-out. One being a diner scene early in the film after we have met June on stage. We get to see her and Cash plant the seeds of the relationship that the film follows. They have a huge amount of chemistry and it is vital that they do as their love story drives the movie.Another standout scene is when Cash auditions for Sam Phillips at Sun Records and Johnny essentially becomes the Man in Black. After performing a limp version of a gospel number Phillips goads him into singing something that he believes. Cash whips out Folsom Prison Blues and by the time the Reno line comes around, Phoenix has transformed the character from doddling, loveless salesman into massive superstar.The acting is worth the ticket, the story is standard. Its too bad that this movie had to come out so soon after Ray. They are so very similar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Because you're not quite mine, I walk (and walk and walk and walk) the line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no question that Phoenix does a superb job inhabiting the skin and soul of Cash, he's brilliant in every possible way (particularly in how he literally turns his eyes into Cash's eyes), and Reese Witherspoon is a more-than-decent June Carter as well. These two performances, unfortunately, are the only really good things about the film, which plays out more like a (two-part!) TV biopic rather than a motion picture.It starts out promising, with Cash being relentlessly drawn to music, but once he gets his foot in the proverbial door and meets June Carter, the movie deteriorates into yer basic lovesick puppy scenario, with Cash continually debasing himself because his fierce and undying love for June is unrequited.More specifically, he wants her to marry him, see, and by the end of the movie, after she finally agrees, onstage (in a sinfully heavy-handed scene that the two actors barely manage to pull off), it's clear that the film has nowhere else to go, and so it ends, somewhat unsatisfactorily. I would have preferred just a tad more depth here, I think both Carter and Cash (who remained together for THIRTY FIVE years after the conclusion of the movie!!) deserved it. I think it's a shame when two actors who were obviously so up to the challenge weren't given anything truly outstanding to work with, but they still deserve acknowledgment come Oscar-nomination time, regardless.</fullReview>

Phoenix is truly a great actor and i couldn't have picked a better person to portray this great name in music history. the part of Elvis, on the other hand, he could have used some work and i have seen better. this is just a side note and no one has to care about it, but i think they should have just brought in Jonathan Rhys Meyers who played Elvis in the mini movie 'Elvis'. thats just my point of view and like i said, no one has to care about it. but overall the movie was excellent and the end was great when everyone became reunited and loving each other again like before and it was just a great and awesome movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where is Merle Kilgore?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen movie yet but am disappointed that Merle is not listed anywhere in film credits. For those of you who are Johnny Come Lately's to the career of Johnny Cash, Merle was Johnny's best man at his wedding and co-wrote "Ring of Fire" with June Carter. He was far more instrumental in the life and career of Johnny Cash than was Waylon Jennings.Mr. Kilgore began his career carrying guitars for Hank Williams. He was roommates with Elvis in the 50's and was a key player in the rise of popular country music. In addition to "Ring of Fire" he penned a number of hits including "Wolverton Mountain".Merle passed away this past March and was a legend in the industry! Hats off to Merle!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phoenix Ain't No Johnny Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He never once really captured Johnny Cash's essence. He seems like a lightweight where Johnny Cash was a heavyweight. His voice sounded phony, not nearly as deep, ragged, or stark as the real Johnny Cash. Phoenix's voice sounds like a whispery frat boy at times when he sings....a sound the real Johnny Cash was incapable of making. And he doesn't seem remotely country enough. He doesn't sound or act like a real hardscrabble country man. Very disappointing. It's interesting to me how easily fooled some folks are by the most half-baked attempt at a Southern or country accent. This is the kind of film that makes you realize how truly great COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER and RAY are. Those were films where--even if you had spent countless hours watching the original performer---the actor and performer merged in your mind on screen in the movie biography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Cash Too Many: The June Carter Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too early in "Walk The Line" a Cash-to-be, June Carter, is introduced into the story thereby subverting what should and could have been a more focused, intriguing and intimate story of "The Man in Black," Johnny Cash, into a sappy, too-oft-told, linear, Hollywood-esquire, predictable story of star-crossed lovers. I would have no complaints about THAT story if the title to the film were, say, "The June &amp; Johnny Cash Story," or, better still, "The Real Story Behind the Lyrics to "I Walk The Line."" But, that is not the case, and but so this well-intentioned and well-acted film suffers immensely from the unwelcome, shoe-horned introduction of Ms. Carter into this biopic of the film's central character, Johnny Cash.The introduction took place within the first 5 - 10 minutes of the film as young Johnny (12 yrs. old) listened to the Carter Family sing on an ole timey radio show. Even if one did not know that June and Johnny were to eventually get married many years later, one would have to be lacking concentration to overlook this early scene as an all too obvious set up for the story-line to the remainder of the film. The scene renders the youngster as smitten, portending his inexorable pursuit of June Carter. A pursuit the story-line doggedly follows instead of concentrating on other more interesting facets of Johnny Cash's life.Playing the older Johnny Cash, Joaquin Phoenix decides against impersonation, opting for a brilliant interpretation. Word has it that he learned some of Cash's songbook prior to shooting and his education into that songbook parallels his subject's education into the music business and the cult of celebrity. If the chronology of Cash's rise to fame was rendered accurately, Phoenix vividly, and subtly, portrayed Cash's meteoric rags to riches ride, presenting Cash as a contemplative young man still feeling the wounds from his father's stern and sometimes unforgiving presence, and the deeper pains suffered from having lost his best buddy, his older brother Jack, when Johnny was 12 yrs. of age. Both of these males shaped Johnny, Jack via Johnny's assessment of him as his wiser more righteous, if not "right," sibling; his Dad via his take-no-nonsense, my-way-or-the-highway method of fathering. The resultant Johnny being a soft-spoken but headstrong kind of fella not all too sure of anything but his love of Carter Family music and a sense that he too could play his songs on the radio. Phoenix "aged" Johnny well, metering his subject's maturity deftly throughout the film.As June Carter, Reese Witherspoon played her character as caricature, employing a squeaky southern drawl and moving around, when on stage, like a teen-aged version of country comedienne, Minnie Pearl. This caricature was accurate because June (not unlike Michael Jackson, as an example) was a star since childhood, having the good (bad?) fortune to be one of the famous "Carter Family," a seminal country/blue grass ensemble responsible, to this day (see Gillian Welch, et al.), for inspiring countless country and blue grass performers to try their hand at making a record.Subsequent to meeting Johnny, June's character changes slightly, more as an effect, I think, of aging and maturation, than any direct effect from Johnny Cash, country music star. I say this because June was Johnny's senior, by far, in the music business, having ascended to stardom while Johnny was listening to her on the radio--long prior to even recording his first hit. There was little that Johnny Cash, the star, was going to teach June about "the business." As such, as shown in the film, June always called Johnny out for his drug abuse and drinking, refusing to settle for the "rock star" version her friend, Johnny Cash.I feel that "WTL" suffers, as most biopics do, from broad-stroking exposition that mistakenly attempts--ever in vain--to tell a whole story instead of sacrificing trivial details for to paint a more solid portrait its subject. For instance, though Johnny's first marriage to Vivian is given a key role in the film, one is left to wonder why he and Vivian ever got married in the first place. We are hop-scotched along in that relationship. Initially we see Johnny, at that time serving our country in Germany, making a long-distance phone call to Vivian. Even then she is reluctant to believe in him, recounting her Dad's belief that his daughter's suitor ought to be career-minded instead of a dreamer. Then, once together, we see the two do nothing but square off in every subsequent scene, from the moment Johnny brings his work buddies home to rehearse some songs to the time after Johnny returns home from his first tour only to be further harangued by distrusting, over-burdened Vivian. Their in-fighting never ceases and one is left to wonder about the specifics of their hatred for each other.Ginnifer Goodwin, the actress portraying Vivian, was hung out to dry by the screenwriter, left without option to play the first Mrs. Cash as anything but a hen-pecking harridan whose suspect devotion to Johnny Cash never came without a price. Phoenix and Witherspoon, thanks be to their starring roles, had more to work with.Overly, "Walk the Line" suffered from the same kind of lack of alternatives provided to Ms. Goodwin. What should have been a far more intriguing examination of Johnny Cash, the person, the songwriter, the entertainer, was little more than a trite love story featuring Johnny Cash and June Carter as this movie's version of Romeo &amp; Juliet or Oscar &amp; Lucinda or Dick &amp; Jane--take your pick. There should have been more examination of the man than of the particulars of pursuit of June.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun but overlong and simplistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the lousy films out there this year, this picture is far better than most. It does not, however, stand up to last year's "Ray", which is strongly resembles. Nor does the film touch on the particularly interesting thing about Johnny Cash, the spiritual duality of his nature. Cash was was strongly Christian but was open about the fact that he had committed all of the seven deadly sins. His humanity came from his humility about his own shortcomings. His core Christianity is barely touched upon here. Actual incidents from Cash's life are totally fictionalized. A strong story point is made of the fact that Cash's father blamed him for the death of his brother. A reading of Cash's most recent autobiography indicates this was never the case. Cash seems to appreciate and revere the hardships experienced by his poor, hard working father. Yet the film continues to portray Cash's hard scrabble parents, the source of his authentic "country" background, as simple- minded, cruel and cold. It is no wonder that June Carter's daughter walked out of a recent screening of the film in anger. The final resolution of the story is weak. The film takes the position that Cash beat his addiction quickly once he won the heart of June. In "Walk the Line", she saves him as she triumphantly chases his dealer from the property. The family of any addict can attest that a cure is never that easy. And in reality, Cash continued to struggle with drugs for much of his life. Joaquin Phoenix's performance, which is excellent, gives the film a gravitas it would otherwise lack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I took my Father to see this movie. I have always been a J Cash fan, but my Dad grew up with him. For him to say how amazed he was how well the portrayal way is a big 'thumbs up'. Dad said it best. "Phoenix captured the real essence of the stage" It was like watching it all over again as a young man. My Father recently saw George JOnes live in concert; a thrill for him. He said watching this move gave his a similar nostalgic feeling. Most Bio-Pics are give and take. This will be picked apart just the same. It is a good story and worth the trip.I sometimes think the bio pic world will soon be flooded with imitations of "RAY" and now "Walk the Line". If this does happen, we will have to adjust and look back at some of the best that started the trend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haven't we seen all this before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the second time in as many years, an autobiography of a music legend is rushed to the silver screen after the untimely death of their star character. Where Jamie Foxx channeled the late Ray Charles to awards glory in 2004, Joaquin Phoenix tries to emulate country music legend Johnny Cash in the new James Mangold film, Walk the Line.The comparison between Ray and Walk the Line are unescapable. Both films followed the music icons from their childhood through to the height of their stardom. Both films dealt with the drug abuse that almost ruined both of their careers. And both films spend a good deal of screen time on the various women in their lives.In Walk the Line, the woman who most influences Johnny Cash is June Carter (Resse Witherspoon, Legally Blonde). After we watch as Johnny survives the death of his older brother and his struggle to cut his first record and go on tour, Mr. Cash meets June Carter at a small auditorium gig that includes Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley on the same card. Although already married, Cash is immediately smitten by June's beauty and ability to communicate to an audience. You don't need to have seen the True E! Hollywood Story to know where this will lead.In truth, knowing where things will lead is exactly the problem with Walk the Line. It has been done before. Many times. A musical artist that becomes a sensation in a short period of time, gets hooked on drugs and then becomes clean towards the end of the film. Ho-hum. How many times have we seen that in the past ten years. Two films, Ray and Some Kind of Monster took similar paths just months before and Walk the Line gives us nothing new or interesting to marvel at as we take the already beaten path.What does save Walk the Line from the mediocre are the stellar performances by the two leads (Phoenix and Witherspoon). Joaquin learned to play the guitar from scratch for the role and even does all his own singing (take that Jamie Foxx!). His walk with the favoring limp and the way Cash talked out of the side of his mouth are mimicked to perfection by Phoenix who is sure to get his second Academy Award nomination when the are announced in just a few months.But performances can only take a film so far, and Walk the Line falls short of providing us any new insight into the world of a rock star that most of us growing up wishing to one day be a part of. In fact, the film spends too much time just mulling around that when we finally get to what should be the hi-light of the film ie. the concert at Folsom Prison that became one of the best live albums of all-time, we are not jumping out of our seats, clapping to the music having enjoyed the journey to this particular historic event.Instead, we meander with a man who never gained his fathers full respect, never was a good husband to his first wife and never lived a life that was so extraordinary that people would shell out hard earned dollars just to see how a legend walked the line.www.robertsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good. Reese steals the show.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But you will appreciate what Joaquin Phoenix does here too. The only thing I didn't like about his portrayel, someone else here mentioned--they sucked the joy right outta Johnny Cash's being. This guy came alive on stage, he loved what he did, and I just somehow reject the constand Brooding persona that we see played out before us.Phoenix could have added more on that side I think. But beyond it--I have no real problems. The staging is good, the concerts Highly believable--here you get Both actors--non-singers at that, to Sing the stuff and sound at least Reasonably like Carter and Cash. That was a shock. I would have liked more of the Folsom Prison concert, and maybe a Billy Graham(played by Franklin?) cameo, but okay--that's more Johnny from the '70s anyhows I suppose.Best of the movie--Reese. She is great. She was believable as a singer, she was a 3-D person, firey, spunky, smart, living in a tough shell. You did want to shake'em both about not getting together sooner, but nevermind. Oscar time for her if not Phoenix, I think he will get a nod too.Enjoyed the bits of Elvis, Orbison, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee, Waylon(played by his son!), etc. Those were fun and added some local color to the preceedings.They left out Johnny's night in the Cave when things were at rock bottom, and the business about setting a park on fire from a leaky truck, but never mind, they got the high points pretty much. I did think that it dragged some in last half-hour and that we could have used less of the druggy scene and more on his actual music and recording. The man was an artist after all, of some Very strong merit.Kudos to Robert Patrick and Shelby Lynne as his folks too! *** outta ****. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I've loved Johnny &amp; June for as long as I can remember, so I am biased in favor of this movie. Joaquin Phoenix has got Johnnies moves and facial expressions down to a "T"! He somewhat resembles Johnny anyway, and in some scenes, you can almost believe that you are seeing the actual Johnny Cash. Reese Witherspoon makes an excellent June Carter and sings a little like June. This movie is a real life love story with a happy ending and that made it my kind of movie. One part of this movie in particular I really liked was when the Carter's were keeping everyone away from Johnny in order to dry him out. His pill peddler shows up and Ezra and Mother Maybelle chase him off with shotguns. Seeing Mother Maybelle with a shotgun is hilarious!! All the actors were excellent, the directing superb, the script riveting. It was everything I hoped for and more!! I believe Johnny and June would be happy with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Was Johnny Cash?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a moment in the new Johnny Cash Biopic WALK THE LINE that is so true and honest it stuck with me throughout the whole film. It's a moment that most people will forget, others will scoff and probably say "look at that close-minded Bible-Thumper." But I'll carry that moment with me for a long time. Judith Carter (Reese Witherspoon) is walking around a small five and dime. A former Southern Gospel Child star she has just gone through a horrible divorce. An old sweet women walks up to her and compliments her parents as being great Christians. After Carter thanks her for the sentiment. The old women spews the line "Divorce is an abomination" thus killing Judith with her down-home Christian Charm and in the process putting good ole James 3:9 into practical application "With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness.(James 3:9 NIV) Working in Christian Radio I have come into contact with people like this. Hey I was once even accosted by a man in a collar because he didn't like the direction the station was going (and I didn't even make the decisions about that anyway.) But I also remember how easy it is to judge someone for their mistakes. It also allows me to have great admiration for June Carter and her family cause frankly this film allows them to show so much Christian love I'm embarrassed. .....But before this review turns into a sermon allow me to tell you just what I think I of James Mangold's WALK THE LINE.There are some people that are so complex, so multi-dimensional, that to try to sum their lives up in a few hours would be impossible. Johnny Cash is that kind of person. He was a man of faith, a man of sorrow, a man fighting his demons, and a man who had a gentle simplicity. When you saw him you thought he was easily figured out. WALK THE LINE tries and sometimes succeeds. Joaquin Phoenix stars as the Man In Black, and does a good job of becoming Cash. I didn't find myself looking at him and saying here's a guy trying to be someone he's not (earlier this week I sat through CAPOTE, and thought "wow that's a great Phillip Seymour Hoffman playing Truman Capote, {in all honesty I was so bored by Capote I fell asleep in the middle of it so that's why there is no review}). It's a good performance because Pheonix tries his hardest to keep Cash grounded. Reese Witherspoon also controls June Carter-Cash with a live vivaciousness. She fills those shoes so well she almost steals the movie away from Pheonix and that's quite okay with me.What doesn't work is a screenplay by Gill Dennis and Director James Mangold that is so difficult to nail down. It jumps from scene to scene because that's what it feels it needs to do. So while the performances are great, the film is too busy trying to play out events, instead of getting to the heart of the matter: WHO WAS JOHNNY CASH?. It gives us scenes with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and The Man in Black's troubles with drugs, but sometimes forgets that this is a film about a man. It's too pre-occupied with being a bio-pic and not about getting to the heart of the matter: WHO IS JOHNNY CASH? Why must bio-pics be so conservative? Why must we sit through another film about another celebrity that is too busy telling a story to care about the lead characters? (This was the problem with RAY last year. Again a film with great performances, but too preoccupied with getting the viewer from one momentous career moment to the other and not nailing done who RAY CHARLES, really was.) Johnny and June Cater Cash are people with lives far more interesting than this movie.But then there is the music. T Bone Burnett has done it again. He captured the sound of the times. He nails down Cash's music quite nicely. If there is man out there batting a thousand producing soundtracks it's Burnett. From his work on the groundbreaking "O Brother Where Art Thou" to "Cold Mountian" he makes the music a character in the film. Trying to nail down Cash's music is a monumental challenge because of its rich diversity, but Burnett seems up to the task. I just wonder why he chose to use Phoenix and Witherspoon's voice and not the CASH recordings themselves.I also liked director Mangold's attention to detail. He has captured a changing America not with the turbulent events but with background details. This is a film about Cash, and I'm glad that he captured it that way. Many films take try to hard to pull us into the time period by saying "alright here's the sixties cut to a group of hippies protesting Vietnam." WALK THE LINE grounds itself by not making statements about society but by showing us Cash. Then the film eventually ends with a pointless happily ever after moment that steals something from the films final analysis. It feels forced, and leaves us at a place that is too nice and peaceful. It felt like I was watching the end of Leave it to Beaver. Sheer badly paced schmaltz. I wished with film could have ended somewhere else. WALK THE LINE is a fine bio-pic, it has some brilliant acting. But it could have been so much better, CASH was larger than life and WALK THE LINE is too busy immortalizing Cash to let us know him. It's funny that, the small moment with June Cater and the old women struck me so much. It was the moment that felt honest? Who was Johnny Cash? WALK THE LINE doesn't really tell us.</fullReview>

It wasn't.Yes, this movie is not worth seeing. Acting, directing, writing--did they even put any effort into this? Joaquin Phoenix did learn to sing and play guitar-kudos to him. Reese Witherspoon learned how to sing-kudos to her. That is the only good thing about the movie. The actors actually learned to sing and play instruments.Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor. However, his performance here is worthy of a Razzie. However, Reese Witherspoon needs hers first. Both do terrible acting jobs that something that you rarely see from people with this much talent.The only acting that is worth noting is when Johnny Cash is going thru withdraws due to his drug addiction. Other than that, it is abysmal.Many people hyped this up and said it was the best picture of the year, but it just simply isn't. It is too long, too boring, badly acted, badly written, and badly directed. The Razzies had four easy wins just from this movie.All in all, this movie is not worth seeing. While it has a lot of fans, it is anything but worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie disrespects Johnny Cash in several ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Cash's life was forever changed when he became a Christian. However, this film glosses over that fact and shows him as a weak, troubled and tormented man who was unhappy in all aspects of his life. The movie was very slow and by the time it got somewhere it was over. What an insult to Johnny to have portrayed him in such a poor and tragic light and to gloss over the very event that changed his life and who he was - A Christian. They show June and JOhnny walking towards a church hand in hand, however, do not show what happened in that church and what decision he made in his life that day. That was a DEFINING moment in his life, which this Hollywood story glosses over and misses the mark.I was also disappointed that the songs we heard in the film were not Johnny or June's voices, but rather the actor's voices - Joaquin's and Reese's. They did a good job, but give Johnny some respect and play HIS songs, HIS voice. Otherwise, why even bother? Selena, who was not near as famous, legendary or big as Johnny got the respect and honor of having her songs in the movie Selena. Why not Johnny? Future generations who did not know of Johnny Cash will only see him in a bad light in this movie and not who he really was. Jesus changed his life for the better, not June.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, perhaps this has been said before, but here goes anyway. I thought it bore a striking resemblance to the movie "Ray," which I thought was better. The brother that dies in childhood, the addiction, the cheating (although he went the other direction on that one). The music was okay, but not that great. Bravo to them for learning it and managing to sound decent. Reese Witherspoon did do a pretty good job, however Joaquin Phoenix was the one singing the most recognizable ditties, and his voice fell disappointingly short of the throaty low bass of johnny cash. I thought they would have given him a lot more charisma. But one must also take into account that my vote comes quite a bit from watching a sweaty Joaquin Phoenix creep me out to the point of distaste. The pallor he can assume is startling, whatever movie it might take place in, and the shaking is perfect for any sort of addiction, depression, or mania. It wasn't completely horrible, but there really weren't any beautiful points, whether they be in cinematography, acting, or dialogue - nothing funny, nothing lovable, nothing heart-wrenching; just mildly entertaining. since i have a firm respect and liking for johnny cash and his music, i can say that being a fan of the real person doesn't mean one has to buy the movie. the only really good part of the film was the shadow of the late and great.</fullReview>

Like most biographic screenplays (created whilst the two central characters were still alive) it presented a sugary picture of their lives. True it showed the 'warts' but these were depicted in a biblical way as a rite of passage to salvation and the obligatory Hollywood happy ending. Phoenix and Witherspoon were brilliant - but some of the other characters were so underdeveloped that it was painful to watch . A central theme of the whole story was the tension between Cash and his father . Most people at some points in their lives can relate to this emotion but in the film it just never really convinced because of wooden acting by Cash's screen father. Also, the film was overly long and could have done with some sharper editing. What kept my interest was Witherspoon. Every time she appeared on the screen the story started to move forward - she had fantastic presence and deserves an Oscar for this performance</fullReview>

Sam would never have signed someone who sounded like Phoenix- good song or not. So he's no Jamie Foxx "inhabiting " Ray Charles; or even Val Kilmer being Jim Morrison. He's not the worst actor to play a rock star- that dubious award has to go the Garey Busy for his impersonation of Buddy Holly playing Gary Busey. A second problem; by and large we know the stories of these celebrities already, so dramatic structure takes a beating. Did any one not know that Johnny was saved by his amphetamine addiction by June Carter and that they lived happily ever after. A bit more of Mother Maybelle's character would have been welcome as well.</fullReview>

Instead we got an overlong film about an alcohol and drug dependent Cash deserting his wife and family to chase after another man's wife. Well, I guess that is the stuff country music is filled with - his dog didn't die, but his tractor got stuck in the mud, and he was broke and drunk half the time. So the stars did all their own singing - a pity - neither of them can stay in tune. It just made me want to play a recording of the real Johnny Cash to drown them out.</fullReview>

His was a twisted sad existence and if the movie is accurate, it's only the bubbly Reese/Carter who gave him respite.Phoenix and Witherspoon supposedly sing and play all their songs but in at least one case this is improbable.

		<shortDescription>A dreary, disappointing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read the reviews, from friends as well as the papers and the Oscar hype and was looking forward to seeing this. Good performances go a very long way to determining my enjoyment of a movie and Joaquin Phoenix and especially Reese Witherspoon did good jobs. But the movie failed to engage me, or the 3 others I went with. Perhaps you need to be a Johnny Cash fan, the tedious songs that we had to endure throughout didn't help. He came across as a miserable character whose life wasn't really all that interesting in the end, or at least the script didn't make it so. Annoying inconsistencies were the casting of young Johnny with a perfectly normal face but Joaquin Phoenix of course has a cleft palate scar. His parents didn't seem to age at all over the 20 or so years the movie spanned. All in all I thought it highly overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unimportant, rather dull movie, despite Witherspoon's usual excellence, and Phoenix not Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not sure why it has become so trendy to say this is a great movie--it is not. First, Johnny Cash was a big man--that was a major part of his identity--while Phoenix is very short. The idea that "Phoenix was Johnny Cash" is absurd. Second, the movie leaves out many of the songs that people really identify with Cash, "A Boy Named Sue" just one of the numerous obvious examples. Third, the movie lacks the type of passion that makes films memorable years hence. This one, like Capote, which also features one great acting performance and little else, will be largely forgotten. Fourth, it is worth asking why we need biographies of Johhny Cash or Truman Capote, anyway. If we are going to do biographies, let's at least start with the truly historic figures. Witherspoon has great screen presence, which means she is always interesting, and she does a fine job here, but it isn't enough to make this movie worth seeing again. Not my cup of tea, and frankly, it's high ratings here are a little disconcerting. Do we embrace mediocrity so lovingly now?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if there was something wrong with the DVD that I rented or if the sound for this film is just awful to begin with. I have heard much superior sound on old Three Stooges and Laurel and Hardy shorts. I couldn't understand half of his mumbling dialog - but that may have been for the best! To be accurate, though, the horrible sound in this movie about music was the least of the problems with it.The only bright spot for me was Reese Witherspoon's performance and that was illuminated only by the incredibly awful rest-of-the-movie! One thing this film did do for me was to verify what I had suspected all along - that Johnny Cash was no more than a self-serving, irresponsible, marginally talented, drug-addicted hack. I suppose that's to be expected in most high-end entertainers, but he displayed it in spades!! The character inspired no sympathetic feelings in me whatsoever. His many problems and trials were brought on by his own stupid, self destructive actions.Anyway, I returned the DVD &amp; received credit for the rental price. To me, it was a total piece of junk!

		<fullReview>OK, on the bright side, Phoenix and Witherspoon shine, glimmer, sparkle and glow radiantly.It's just a shame about the script.The very last credit has the words "...certain events have been fictionalised for dramatic reasons..." Why? Cash's life contained more drama than most screen-writers can ever dream about. I found myself comparing it with "La Bamba", about Richie Valens' tragically short career -- in my book a much better film, and one that Mangold and Dennis should have watched.This film needed 3 hours rather than only two, and should have covered ALL of Cash's life rather than ending abruptly with his marriage to June Carter. It would have been vastly improved if more attention had been given to Cash's demons instead of his addictions: his jaw injury (take your pick -- cyst removal in the Air Force or broken and incompetently reset after a car crash) and a more sensitive treatment of Jack's death. I looked in vain for his social conscience: where was the Ballad of Ira Hayes?I left the cinema feeling like I'd ordered ice cream but received cream with ice blocks in it. This film is like the tourist attractions we all fall for: you have to go see them 'cos they're so iconic, but you wonder what the fuss is about. Unfortunately, you gotta go see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Walk the Line" offers a good look into the lives of Johnny Cash and June Carter. My first expectations upon seeing this movie today were not very high. And there were some slow parts that were long and drawn out. But I have to admit that it wasn't awful. I believe this can be accredited to Reese Witherspoon. She really stole the movie and was a fabulous June Carter. Phoenix expressed VERY impressive talent, don't get me wrong. And he did an excellent job of depicting Cash's destructive and morose behavior. However, Witherspoon truly brought it home. I would give this movie a 6/10, on the sole purpose of it being kind of boring. The acting was fabulous though, and it's worth a rental I'd say. Those fans of Johnny Cash will not be disappointed, but it lacks something for later generations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The script sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The look is good, The actors try to give a hard effort, the idea is fine but the script kills this movie from being any good. I saw this movie not knowing who the director is, after finding out I'm not surprised. The guy has made other good looking yet completely lame movies, perhaps a better director would have called for a script re-write.The movie is boring, which is due to the script. You are quickly pushed through cash's first 25 years by seeing things like him going off to the air force and then being home from the air force. This helps to underdevelope Cash from the start. The few scenes you see that are supposed to develop the love story are too short and too stiff to produce a sense that these people were in love.The movie starts with the t-1000 being cash's generic, mean spirited,"I wish you had died instead of him" father. Then we jump to Cash being older. Then we jump through key things lightning fast. Then we see Cash get a real record out without any struggle or ANYTHING that might make us care or feel bad for him. Then he falls in love and has some struggle with his current wife and it all turns out fine and it sucks.During a lot of the movie I thought "I never noticed Cash had a hair-lip, but that's a great make up job" well I was wrong. It's not makeup. Joaquin has one, even though cash didn't. WHY DID NO ONE THINK COVERING THAT UP WAS IMPORTANT. playing a singer we constantly see Joaquin's mouth.Why end the movie in the middle of cash's life. Old Johnny Cash isn't worth writing about? nothing about diabetes struggle or the sadness over the death of June? Don't you think that his last single released being 'hurt' would tie in well with the 'what would be the last song you'de want to hear before you die' theme? I'm not all that surprised, They managed to suck the fun out of John's energetic years, a movie about the rest of John's life, written by these writers would probably be unwatchable.The script sucks. boring as hell. It reminded me of how in the movie 'the final cut' they would show someone's whole life only showing the main points but failing to show who they were and there personality. I kept thinking about how if my life were a movie, I would much rather an entertaining film based on any three drama filled hours or crazy times of my life, than a film about all the basic this happened, then this happened stuff.If they wanted to make it about his love for June than why not spend more time on that? If it was supposed to be about everything in the first half of his life why drain him of scenes that show him in a positive light? The movie is a mess. It's not completely awful but It could be such a better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the performances and music, and a fairly credible story, that's all you need...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes I take an actor like Joaquin Phoenix for granted, or maybe just not take too much into consideration his talents and strengths. Maybe in films like Gladiator or Signs, he had good roles but amid all the spectacle and big themes and action/suspense, some of his work was lost in it. Or sometimes he just doesn't find the potential in a character. Here though he finds himself in one of his best, if not his most ambitious, role yet as Johnny Cash, a man who rose up from nothing to become one of the legends of 20th century country. His drama and tragedies and successes are nothing new to this sort of sub-genre of the musician's bio-pic (in fact last year's Ray, which can likely draw up many comparisons with subject matter, was in some ways pretty similar). But its the convincing in the performances by Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon that help elevate what could've been more likely standard material.At times there are some fantastical moments (not that it's unbelievable, but like some of the stuff with Elvis early in Cash's career for example), and yet it's not to totally 'wow' the audience. This really comes in the form of the love story between Johnny Cash and June Carter (Witherspoon) who have an on-and-off kind of relationship that borders on being a couple, to being bitter at each other, to being tender on one end and near helpless on another, and then leading to a really moving finale. It's their connection on screen, and the surprisingly fresh dialog, that helps make situations that in Ray weren't as fleshed out make this world not too far from some truth. There are also little supporting performances that help, most notably Robert Patrick as the tough, practically unforgiving for a certain tragedy father of Johnny Cash.So there's the acting, and the story that sticks well with the themes of addiction (this time to pills and alcohol) and to being burned by insecurities and the demons of the past (and present). But there is also the music. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of Cash's music, at least I wasn't really before I saw the film (I like some songs, notably from the period covered in the film). If anything co-writer/director James Mangold uses the songs and live performances, and cool gifts of the musical Phoenix and Witherspoon, to his advantage. The songs are sometimes more of a pure rock and roll sound rather than country, and the film does shine some light on how Cash did have a unique sound to him. And the circumstances shown around him playing at Folsom prison is one of my very favorite parts of the film. I'm not saying this is one of the all-time great musician bio-pics. However, if you're looking for something toe-tapping, and something too as a solid, emotionally rewarding 'date' movie, this is the one of the month.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By-the-Numbers Biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very run of the mill biopic that doesn't provide any significant insight into Cash's character or his music. I was never an admirer of Cash's sound, so this depiction of a tortured drug addict merely came off to me as an annoying and self-centered man instead of a compelling one. The film's great saving grace is the performances of Juaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who provide highly watchable impersonations of their country-western counterparts (although their relationship frequently borders on being more obsessive than romantic, especially as Cash's descent into drug addiction worsens).But the story itself offers no surprises as a formulaic presentation of a troubled artist saved by the love of a good woman. When Cash first attempts to start his career by going into a small-time recording studio and singing a sappy Gospel tune, he is chided by the producer that "that's something we heard a hundred times before." The makers of "Walk the Line" might have listened to that advice themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phoenix, Witherspoon nail Cash biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like last year's Academy Award-winning "Ray," the newest biopic of the Holiday season, "Walk The Line," follows the same formula in dealing with the highlights of the career of Johnny Cash, whose deep aching dulcatones and gritty songwriting helped open whole new inroads in country/gospel music.And much like Ray Charles, Cash crossed all genres from blues, soul, western, pop, alternative and Christian. Knowing all of that, it was time to reward the Man In Black with his own major motion picture. Getting the plumb role of the title character (which was, supposedly okayed by the Man himself before his passing last year), was an actor who grew up on screen ? Joaquin Phoenix. Few may remember he played the rejected little kid (Gary) in "Parenthood," earned an Oscar nomination (Best Supporting Actor) in "Gladiator," and outshone John Travolta in 2004's "Ladder 49." Not only does he resemble Cash, in often eerie ways, but he also does his own singing (unlike Jamie Foxx's Ray Charles), which, many times is pretty much dead-on accurate.And like that Taylor Hackford film, this vehicle (directed by James Mangold ("Identity," "Girl ? Interrupted"), follows the same paths to tell the rags-to-riches-to-rags-back-to-riches tale of a late 20th century pop icon. It worked well for these two films, but - hopefully - it will not become a modern biopic mainstay.The movie's beginning, however, is a masterpiece.We are introduced to the outside of a gray, depressing prison ? the camera giving us quick takes of the walls, the barbed wire, the stoic guards ? all to the background of a pounding beat and stomping feet. As we move closer to the ruckus, we see scurrying screws running towards the disturbance and the din grows louder and louder.Soon we see what all of the commotion is about. Hundreds of blue jumper-clad inmates are pounding their feet and clapping to the rhythm of a three-piece band plunking a funky country riff ? over and over again ? waiting for the lead singer to appear.Meanwhile, backstage, a tentative Cash waits nervously. He then flashes back to a backwoods Arkansas cotton farm in 1944, where he and his brother, Jack, lie awake at night talking about the Bible and songs from their mother's hymn book - Johnny, also known as JR - is the artistic one. Tragedy follows, and soon Cash is a young man, heading for Air Force service in Germany. There, he writes his first song, "Folsom Prison Blues."Now living in Memphis and married to perky Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin, "Mona Lisa Smile"), he tries door-to-door selling, but the music runs hot in his veins, so he and a makeshift band - Dan John Miller and Larry Bagby - approaches Sun Records producer Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), asking for an audition. After failing to impress with a slow Gospel number, Cash perks the jaded Phillips' ear with "Folsom."They begin to cut records, tour with the likes of Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis and begin climbing the charts with such classics as "Cry, Cry, Cry," "I Walk The Line," "Don't Take Your Guns To Town," and "Tennessee Flat-Top Box," among others. These were tunes - in their day - that knocked conventional pop and country music on its ear, especially "I Walk The Line," which Bob Dylan described as "profound, deep, rich, awesome and mysterious."Cash becomes hugely successful, but, in doing so (as any biography of a popular musician will entail) he suffers some severe personal setbacks. Introduced to drugs in the 1950's, it was a habit he would spend the next decade trying to conquer. Stronger still, though, was his obsession with country queen June Carter (wonderfully played by Reese Witherspoon), whom he pursued endlessly during that same dark period.Later, after a down period - personally and artistically - Cash comes back with the famous live concert LP at Folsom Prison, as well as numerous other albums and creative endeavors. He has recorded with a variety of well-known current performers, and his translation of the Nine Inch Nails' "Hurt" is a masterstroke. Noticeably missing, though, is the singer's biggest hit, the Shel Silverstein novelty smash, "A Boy Named Sue," which Cash came to dislike with a passion.A bit slow in some spots (though the film barely shows its 137 minute running time), the picture is nonetheless a triumph of modern biographical film-making, showing the glamor, but exposing the warts, as well (the drug/rehab scenes are much better here than in "Ray"). For his part, Phoenix nails the character in the same way Foxx did, or Phillip Seymour Hoffman does in "Capote." At times, you almost believe he IS Johnny Cash, and, unless I'm off my mark, he should get a Best Actor nod for his marvelous performance. Much lower key, but no less effective is Witherspoon. Known for playing gorgeous goof balls ("Legally Blonde," among others), she shines as the proud, virtuous, stubborn, yet gently funny Carter, holding the irresistible Cash at bay for 10 years, but standing up to drug pushers and basically saving his life.Their's was a match - if not made in heaven - then certainly tempered by the fires of Hell and sustained through a mutual love of God and music. In a rather weak year for women in leading roles, I would not be surprised to see her get a nomination, as well.</fullReview>

They REALLY made Vivian Cash out to be a nagging whiner while June was made out to be an angel/saint. Even while sleeping with another woman's husband! To some, love is an excuse to have no morals, but what June Carter-Cash did to this family is inexcusable. How could he focus on his family when he was chasing this tart around. She did not, would not remove herself from his life. And he was no better. His drug addiction played a big part in his divorce, and I am glad June was there to pick up the pieces with him, but she was wrong. Period. That's my opinion. How is his wife supposed to compete with a playtoy? She was stuck at home living REALITY, while June (while leaving her own children as well) were in a playland. Of course the realities of life seem boring when you have a plaything, drugs, limelight... How could Vivian and her children compete with that? Anyway, I'll probably get blasted from all the June Lover/Excusers here, but that's my opinion of the movie, and I guess of June and Johnny as well.</fullReview>

Does it sound familiar? Yes, there are 300 movies about this subject? and they are all pretty much the same? and this is just another one. It doesn't even matter if it's about Cash, Janis Joplin, Ray Charles or, let's say, Barry Manilow. So we are talking about an extremely conventional type of movie. Then let's talk about the movie itself... first of all is waaaaay too long (at least 40 minutes longer than it should be) and that's a big problem. Then the acting? Joaquin: kinda good acting (well I'm not sure) and good singing... but too much singing!!! I would've loved two hours (and more) of real Cash but not that much singing from an impersonator. Reese, she does a really good and authentic... Reese. I mean, I really like her (I actually love her in "Election"), but in WTL there's no real acting or challenge at all? actually, her acting was exactly the same when she got the Oscar. So, 4/10 just because I could stand the 136 minutes (men!) without falling asleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In recent years, it's been the epics like Gladiator or The Lord of the Rings series and the biographies like Ray, Ali, and A Beautiful Mind who have been winning all the awards (except maybe Chicago). The last thing we need is a Ray clone winning all the Oscars this year. You can't change how both Charles' and Cash's brothers die when they were kids. But they didn't have to show how it haunts them the same way with a table saw or the water. In both movies they emphasized on both musicians having drug problems, angry wives, affairs on the road, controversial music, and their own ways of dealing with religion in music. Why do we need this twice in 2 years? In no way was this a story worth telling if they can cut out the years 1958-1964 when Cash was making his music and popping pills at the highest rate. If 6 years can be skipped in the middle of it all then what's the point? If you've seen Ray, stick with that. This movie was the same thing without the blindness, racism, or character development. June Carter's parents as well as June for the most part stand up for Johnny and stick with him throughout. We never see why. The first 2 times we see Cash and the Carter parents meet, he's either drunk or high. We never really see the good side of Cash that for some reason the Carter saints believe there is.As for the acting, it most likely is tough for people such as Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon to sing in southern accents. Phoenix was too soft and quiet for the first hour basically for us to think that half the movie had good acting in it. I didn't see much for talent until the thanksgiving table 3/4 the way through. Witherspoon was lovable, sure, but also seemed to act as different characters throughout. At first she was assertive and proper. Then we see her fishing and giving into Cash, and then we see her ditching him, then stick by his side, then ditch him, then marry him. If that's historically true than I don't love June Carter and would rather not have her in the movie to begin with.If you need a 2+ hour drag festival then see this movie. If not, see Ray again, you'd be better off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, pick your own worst fault and have someone make a biographical movie centered on it. This is essentially what this movie did for Johnny Cash. His drug and alcohol dependencies, such as they might have been, were not central to his image, to his stature in country music, or to the humanity he represented. This movie marginalized Johnnny Cash.I was happy to see from movie-review websites such as yours, that the under-30 age group raved about his music, belatedly realizing that rhythm is not the exclusive property of rock musicians. A further evolution will occur when they get to appreciate Johnnny's slower, more melancholy country rhythms which were absent in this movie, no doubt in an attempt to appeal to a wider audience.Take it from a life-long fan, apart from his "songwriting" in that German hangar and his audition for a recording, folks, it was Johnny himself actually singing, not J.

		<fullReview>I know this won't be popular, but "Walk the Line" has to be compared to "Ray". And, sorry to say, it finishes a distant second. There are so many similarities to "Ray", that there's not enough room here to list them all. From the accidental death of his brother, to his Southern/religious/country roots, to his drug addiction, and then to his marital betrayals, Johnny Cash's life absolutely paralleled Ray Charles'. But Ray had something Johnny didn't. Ray rose to the top of the music industry after overcoming physical disabilities and racial discrimination. What was Johnny's big problem? Many people mistakenly sympathized with Johnny for returning to prison to perform and entertain the inmates. The only problem is, Johnny wasn't returning. He was never a convict. He got away with using drugs, while Ray was arrested and embarrassed by the negative publicity. We can sympathize with Ray's problems and misbehavior a lot more than Johnny Cash's. And Jamie Foxx was much more convincing in his portrayal than Joaquin Phoenix. Reese Witherspoon did do an outstanding job as June Carter and saved the movie with her lively personality and excellent singing voice.</fullReview>

I just could not understand the motivations of either Cash or his long pursued love interest, Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, specifically, as to why they made the choices they did. Cash comes across as an arrogant pill popping bully, and Carter as a very confused woman. I realize that biopics are hard to make. The old ones made in Hollywood in the 1930s were almost entirely fictional. This one I believe tried to be true to life. However, Cash's life was in truth and fact dramatic enough that a better story could have been told.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pretty straightforward biopic with a strong though not extraordinary lead from Phoenix. It's a strange exercise in rose-tinted bias. Cash is portrayed as a good, if slightly intimidated young man who makes good following his dream. The bulk of the film follows his morally tortured love affair with his touring partner, June Carter (a similarly reliable Reese Witherspoon).I dare say that Cash was such a conflagration of burgeoning talent and God-fearing mother's boy... but the antipathetic characters are shown as unsympathetic and burdensome. Prinicipally here is the Viv (Cash's first wife) of Ginnifer Goodwin, an unforgiving role if there ever was one. Only Robert Patrick is granted a reprieve in a slightly clunky coda (his thoughtful characterisation also marks him out).As a result I left the theatre not really knowing whether I'd been given a good look at The Man In Black. I longed for more of the sort of wider interaction in a scene we're given at the Folsom prison gig to hold up against the more extensive, private relations within his family. We don't really even see his relationship with his own band.Interesting anecdotes such as learning to play guitar/auto-harp from scratch and singing on the soundtrack are as admirable as the leads' critique-proof performances. But they don't really entertain (let alone inform) me beyond the songs themselves. 5/10</fullReview>

I hope that if anything, this movie will make wonder of the man and seek his voice and songs and the roots of June's Carter family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He is the Man in Black....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a new hero in town, and his name is Johnny Cash! Joaquin Phoenix was hand picked by the man in black to PLAY HIM. Joaquin Phoenix did more than deliver the goods, he delivered them SPECIAL DELIVERY! Yes, this movie, thanks to Joaquin Phoenix, is going alongside some of the greats such as Ray, Roadhouse and Schindler's List...as one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Do not expect Joaquin Phoenix to be the same as he was in Signs or Gladiator. Joaquin Phoenix IS Johnny Cash. The Man in Black wore black to absorb all the sorrow in the world and then express it in his songs, much like 50 Cent does. I was astonished at how much Joaquin Phoenix sounded like John and how the incredible Reese Whitherfork sounded like JUNE CARTER CASH. I wonder if Willy Nelson saw this yet? You can forget the likes of that Austrailian dude, it's Joaquin Phoenix, as Johnny Cash, who STOLE THE SHOW. Can you say Oscar ANYBODY? And I am not talking about my Shihtzu. I am predicting that Joaquin Phoenix will SWEEP the academy, and not with a broom either. I remember me and my Dad singing "A Boy Named Sue" many a time while driving on the lonely roads of New Mexico in the early 80s. Thank you Joaquin Phoenix, for making a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid movie but should have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Johnny Cash, the singer. Like the movie 'Ray', I was expecting a solid tribute to the great singer. In 'Ray', the audience was able to buy into the singer's life because of the strong tie ins of Ray Charles' personal life and his music. We were able to see the influences that quite often gave him his biggest hits. Unfortunately, the movie, in and of itself, followed a rather drab storyline that involved a child growing up, getting into a bad conflict or problem (drugs), recovering from it, and then exiting out of the movie in a great flourish. Sadly, we see the same gambit in 'Walk The Line.' Unlike 'Ray', however, the movie fails to make the storyline as a bit player in the movie's composition. Instead, the storyline itself is the salient aspect of this movie. We do not see genuine attempts to explain Johnny Cash's influences in his music. Rather, we are left with the all too common banality of some tragic experience that affects the main character deeply. With hits like 'Rain of Fire' or my particular favorite 'Don't Take Your Guns to Town', it would have been nice to watch a movie that tried to present a fresh thesis on Johnny Cash's life and his musical influences. The movie's pace is often drab and not worthy of much praise. Much more critical thought could have been put into the script, especially for someone like Johnny Cash. Nonetheless, the movie is quite often saved by the repeated injections of musical performances-all of which were Cash hits. These performances, all performed by the actor portraying Cash, are enough to delude the moviegoer into thinking that he is watching a great biopic. Having said that, the performances by the actor and actress portraying Cash and June Carter, respectively, are outstanding. Joaquin Phoenix is great as Cash; I personally think his singing voice gets better and better as the film progresses. The actress playing June Carter maintains an air of fluffy and bouncy Southern girl charm, which complements Cash's dour demeanor. This movie is a '10' for people who have listened to Cash off and on but are not serious fans. For the rest of us, this movie could have been way better. Cash deserved a solid and awesome screenplay that involved serious thought and exploration into his life, not this.</fullReview>

Johnny's life changed for the better when he met and married June Carter, together with the Carter family, what was a shattered existence, for both June and Johnny, became a rebirth in the music industry and in family life. June took Johnny under her wing, with the aid of old fashioned, prayer meetings, mingling with simple folk, who's goal in life seemed to spread the good news thru their musical talents.

		<shortDescription>a pathetic movie about an ignominious country and western singer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is synonymous of the type of modern film making that seems to eulogise facts and circumstances which are not only trivial but of no substance.We have the usual rags to riches type story peppered with some personality defects and from this we have to identify a character who appears to be a world wide representative of the good ol'country boy doin' good after a period in the wilderness. Maybe our American cousins have a greater affinity to this sort of thing but as a movie it was quite pathetic. The acting was reasonable but where a characterisation of a once living person is depicted an actor of merit should accomplish this without too much effort. Our friends in the movie business seemed to rate this movie quite highly this is not surprising in a mutual admiration set -up. I am beginning to question my own values where we are continually directed in way of MASTERPIECES which turn out to be so much turgid , uninspiring normality</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is boring. I suspect the reason all the folks lavishing praise on this movie is because they are drug addicted amorals themselves, like how JC is portrayed in the movie, and they will laud anything that glorifies that sort of thing.Not even any original soundtracks, the lead uses his own voice does a mediocre job. He had a lip curl that looked more Elvis-ish. I didn't understand that at all until I learned the lead actor has a hair-lip. For cryin' out loud, what where they thinking? The only thing that stood out was that JC was a self-absorbed, emotionally immature drug addict still dwelling on child-hood traumas. He dumped his family for a little cutie (June Carter) he met on tour. I did not get a sense of romance out of it at all. I did not feel any empathy for JC as he was portrayed. To the contrary, I thought he was a creep. Nothing of the later part of his life that would possibly show some redemption of some kind (didn't he find religion later?) I liked JC as a musician, but came away from the movie having lost all respect for him as a man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confused as to why these filmmakers were allowed to make this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I must begin by stating that I've never really been that big of a Johnny Cash fan. But, maybe that's why my opinion of this film holds some modicum of credence: a lack of bias. Before seeing the film, I didn't know too much about his life except that one of my all-time heroes Shel Silverstein wrote many of his songs, and a bit about what he did before he died (working with the likes of Rick Rubin and Trent Reznor, his wife dying right before he did, etc.) So, I went into WALK THE LINE with a true tabula rasa, not knowing what to expect out of his life. My only really bias for the film at all was that James Mangold was tapped as the director even though his GIRL,INTERRUPTED was mediocre at best, IDENTITY was absolutely horrendous (and forgettable), and KATE&amp;LEOPOLD was certainly nothing to think about. Gill Dennis, the writer, had done nothing at all beforehand except for a few random movies no one has heard of before (LINCOLN ON THE NOSE?!?)And these are the people who are to make a biopic about Johnny Cash?!? Yes, I never really liked his music too much, but this doesn't mean I don't respect him as a man and for what his music did for the rock-a-billy and folk music world (music of which I enjoy quite well).It wasn't too bad for me that the character of Johnny was a whining milquetoast throughout the entire film who spent his time either crying, falling down, doing copious amounts of an unknown drug every five minutes, or begging June Carter to marry him (and then having constant childish temper tantrums whenever she would say no), but that nothing in the movie ever changed.There was never a sense of growth or movement in the film. There was never a real sense of conflict less his problems with June Carter, which I would imagine must have been a LITTLE more three-dimensional than the representation in this banal film.The steady ebb and flow of the film grew further and further monastic, as any time there was any real potential for something new, time was compacted and we were left experiencing nothing. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** (a sequence toward the end of the film in which Johnny is at his nadir, living in an apartment with Waylon Jennings, and then all of a sudden it's years later and he's wandering through a beautiful forest to discover a magnificent treehouse that he can now suddenly afford... what happened in the middle there, James and Gill?!? Why not let us in a little bit?!?)***DEFINITE SPOILER**** The hackneyed "love" (really no semblance of love here, Cash just basically beats Carter down as much as he can until she's so embarrassed and mentally abused that she gives in... I doubt this is the way it happened, and if it did, that's a real shame) story completely takes over every other aspect of the film or the story of Johnny Cash the musician. The three or four other plotpoints slowly dissipate such as exhibited with his sense of immense loss over his brother or his problems with his father. In fact, the end of the film abruptly and without any hint just brings us to some random moment in Cash's life when: BAM! Dad loves him again for no reason we, the audience, can ascertain. But, I guess when the movie ends, you have to tie up those loose strings even if they're not ready to be tied.The movie was certainly watchable, but in the end wholly prototypical and bland. I'm just as confused why this movie is garnering the praise its gained (less the usual Hollywood politics nonsense) as why it was made by its filmmakers. But, I guess that's how it goes.

Reese Witherspoon is no June Carter who was a splendid singer in her own right. Phoenix does a reasonable imitation of Cash but in no way does he capture either the personality or the unique voice of Cash. It is like watching the musicians on the Lawrence Welk show imitate Cash or any other great musician. No true fan of Johnny Cash would enjoy this movie.It's what might be called a "poor man's Grand Ol' Opry." There are much better ways to spend one's money than watching this flick.

He is dense and cant get anything through his head in the movie....I think Phoenix needs a new job because he acts as the same little PUSSY cat in all his films. He made Johnny Cash out to be someone I believe he was not. J.Phoenix ruined the entire film for me so thats why I rate this film a 1 on a 10 scale. Find a new Job! The ending was a bit abrupt and sudden, Like the maker had too much information and just lopped off the entire back half of Johnny Cash Life. In my opinion the casting was just off other than Reese. It's too bad that a great film movie had to end like this. I think it should be made over but there is no chance that will happen. There was never anything said about own Johnny Cash in his later years! His career did not end in the 60's! To top things off, No one aged in the film from the 40's to the 60's, what happened there? Overall.................Not good and very disappointing because I really enjoy Johnny's Music.</fullReview>

I don't think you can make a movie about Johnny Cash.There are lots of clichés in this film, like the obligatory line that leads audiences to mutter "Oh, that's where he/she got the idea for that song."

		<fullReview>This is a genuinely dreadful film, overwrought, turgid and shot entirely in close-up, like some tarted-up TV Lifetime biopic. The performances range from the bizarre (Johnny's dad) to the overly moist (the leads). Except for the Folsom scenes that bookend the film, and the scene that has Sam Phillips explaining to Johnny what makes a hit record, the movie rings false. Worse, it makes being Johnny Cash look like, well, no fun at all. It staggers from tragedy to tragedy, pausing on occasion to wipe its nose or trot out another cardboard Legends of Rock cutout (Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis). Why has this mostly played out, waxworks genre suddenly become so fashionable? Am I the only one who experiences a genuine sense of disconnect seeing someone play Katherine Hepburn play Alice Adams? Performances become impersonations, at a time when the David Steinbergs and the Frank Gorshins (RIP) have long since vanished from the scene. Playing a Truman Capote, a Ray Charles or a Johnny Cash, at a time when most of us have a fairly recent, living memory of these celebrities requires a suspension of disbelief that I, frankly, don't find, for the most part, to be worth the candle. We await reassessments of THE GREAT CARUSO or NIGHT AND DAY (sorry- forgot the recent DE-LOVELY). Better still, a reworking, so we can see Sylvester Stallone playing Mario Lanza playing Caruso playing Rigoletto!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to win a pair of tickets for the premiere of Walk The Line in New York. I wanted to see the movie so badly because after all it's starring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon - for me, reason enough! Before I watched the movie, I didn't know anything about Johnny Cash, June Carter or their lives. In fact, I am not even particularly interested in Country music, to say it mildly. I am however always interested in movies that are depicting somebody's real live and especially in movies with music, any kind of music. And music you get in Walk The Line - a lot! The movie's plot is kept simple and James Mangold focuses on the early years of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). The movie ends - and that's hopefully no spoiler - with an upbeat! After 135 minutes of fine entertainment you'll be leaving the theater in a good mood because the tone of the movie - despite all the conflicts and problems - is set quite romantic. The chemistry between the two main characters is totally believable. The couple shows you the meaning of the word "soul mate"! And then there's the singing! Mr.Phoenix learned to play guitar and got into Johnny Cash's style. He even gets his voice sounding like the legend's voice. And Ms. Witherspoon? She is no less stellar as June Carter. Both do a very fine job and all the talk about Oscar noms is more than justified. I really enjoyed the movie and will watch it again once it opens on Friday. - And on a private note: the cast of the movie I met at the black carpet premiere was all very charming. Thank you guys! 9 out of 10 points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here Comes the Man in Black.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The life of Johnny Cash (dynamite performance from Joaquin Phoenix) is told from humble beginnings in the Arkansas cotton fields to musical success and a terrible addiction to liquor and prescription medication. Tragedy strikes early on as a young Cash (Ridge Canipe) must deal with the death of his older brother (Lucas Till) and a standoffish relationship with a stern father (Robert Patrick in an appropriately rough part). Adulthood brings military service, marriage (to sweetheart Ginnifer Goodwin) and finally a chance at the brass ring (not to mention a relationship with fellow singer June Carter played to the hilt by Reese Witherspoon). "Walk the Line" is no doubt inspired by the amazing success that "Ray" produced last year. Phoenix and Witherspoon get in a fevered rhythm of performing excellence as co-writer/director James Mangold keeps the drum beating with his quick pace and lightning fast flash-points. Although a bit long and sometimes too loud, "Walk the Line" still proves that a cinematic biography done correctly can lead to beautiful music for all to see and hear. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk the Line Walks the Line Between Good and Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walk the Line is a biography/drama about the life of the late country musician Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix). While there are some negative aspects of the film?some violence, offensive language, and drug and alcohol use?there were positive aspects as well, including dedicated friendship, and care for those in prison. Therefore, I recommend this film on a conditional basis. Given the harsh language, violence, and other negative points earning the film a PG-13 rating, I do not believe this is an appropriate film for younger viewers. The parts of the life story of Johnny Cash that were shown in this film may be interesting and possibly educational to viewers, showing that the lives of famous people are not all they may appear on the surface. Walk the Line was directed by James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted; Kate &amp; Leopold; Identity), was written by Gill Dennis and James Mangold, and is based on the books Man In Black, and Cash: An Autobiography by Johnny Cash. The plot covers Johnny's boyhood and early affection for music, the tragic death of his beloved older brother, his hasty marriage to Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), his start in the music industry, his struggles with drugs and alcohol, his failing marriage, and his friendship with country/gospel singer June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). The theme of the film has to do with the pain of harmful addictions and the healing power of a good friend. Given the actual events of Johnny's life, it is expected that the film would show his problems with drinking, drugs, and marital unfaithfulness. Though some things Johnny and others did were not portrayed as wrong, as they should have been, Walk the Line did a reasonably good job of portraying most of Johnny's life problems as painful, and something from which he needed to escape. His alcoholism and drug addiction was a very noticeable disease in his life. June was a steady friend to Johnny, and helped and supported him in recovering from his addictions. The film is well-made and easy to follow for the most part. The actors are convincing. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, did their own singing in the many concert scenes, and both did and excellent job. Several friends of Johnny's are popular singers of the time, including Jerry Lee Lewis, and Elvis Presley. So there are both negative and positive elements in this film. Some wrong actions are glossed over or glamorized, but other wrong actions are shown as wrong, and we can see the destructive consequences. The value of friendship is high, and June's love and loyalty to Johnny in his distress is commendable. One note on the real Johnny Cash, I have read, is that he became a Christian later in his life. As I understand it, his faith had a big impact on his life, but the film downplayed the influence of Christianity, and emphasized worldly success. Walk the Line walks a line between the good and bad. I encourage those who read it to do some research into the real Johnny Cash's life, and most importantly, look to the Bible to learn the way to true salvation and healing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Walk the Line' is a story about Johnny Cash and his transformation into stardom. It tells how through the hardships of his childhood through young adult life he was able to channel those experiences into his music. Music that people came to love and understand.This movie is a lot like 'Ray' in many respects, and to a degree, even better. Both Joaquin Phoenix (Johnny Cash) and Reese Witherspoon (June Carter) are truly incredible in their performances. When Joaquin is on the screen, you do not see or hear him; you see and hear Johnny Cash. Everyone in this film sang and performed the music themselves. Both Joaquin and Reese had to learn to play their instruments from scratch. They were both chosen specifically for these roles buy the late Johnny Cash and June Carter. If these two do not get nominated for Oscars this year it would be a crime.I really liked 'Ray' and though Johnny Cash's life was not as turbulent, I thought 'Walk the Line' was better. Go see it and you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

If they wanted to depict Cash as being poor as a youngster, they would not put in the following: painted sharecropper house- no one in that situation lived in a freshly painted house. They lived in tar paper shacks. Cash's house looked even better than the house Richard Nixon drew up in in Whittier. Poor boys then did NOT have fresh barbershop haircuts. Their mothers cut their hair. Also, the clothes the boy's wore looked totally fake- no mends, tears, or dirt. The other thing that got me was that some of the characters- June and those who played John's parents never aged in the movie. Except for his mother's hair style, they looked the same from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was called Ray. Walk the line is your standard biopic about a deceased rock star, complete with all of the expected story lines. In case you haven't seen Ray, here you go: small child loses brother in tragic accident. Boy grows up, gets discovered, has a problem with drugs and alcohol, cheats on his wife, gets arrested for drug possession, gets his life straightened out. The end.There really isn't anything new to add in Walk the Line, which is truly unfortunate. The performances by Witherspoon and Phoenix are top notch and they both sing their parts extremely well (side note - don't hold it against Jaime Foxx for not singing in Ray because no one sounds like Ray Charles except Ray Charles. Any bass can sing Johnny Cash - his voice isn't that distinctive.) The characters, unfortunately, really don't have that much to say. In the end, Cash appears to be a really moronic spoiled brat - not exactly a glowing tribute to a music star. The movie seemed more like a vehicle to sell Johnny Cash albums to a new generation without having to pay royalties since both he and his wife are now deceased.I don't know why these same formulaic biopics are still being made. I wouldn't keep watching them if my wife didn't like them. No one's life is so boring that you can fit its entire essence into two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, this is coming from a true Johnny Cash fan, not someone who went to see it just because of the hype. I've read both Walk the Line, and his autobiography, so I feel I have a good knowledge of how his life was.In my opinion it almost glorified the troubled times of his life. It made it look like his addictions only lasted a few months, but in reality it lasted for years. The movie also COMPLETELY skipped over his involvement with The Highwaymen (Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, George Jones, Kris Kristopherson, etc), which, was a major part of his life. I think it could have went into a little more depth with his and first wife's troubles, it just kind of glided over his problems. Though much of the movie was based about his drug habit, it made it look less than it was.I also think, they could have picked a different actor to play Johnny Cash. Pheonix was good, but he just didn't quite put out that Johnny Cash vibe that you get from watching old recordings of him.All that aside, the movie WAS entertaining, and it was well worth the 8 bucks to see it. But if you are a true fan of Johnny Cash, you may see some flaws and gaps in it.I recommend this movie for everyone, unless you are a die-hard fan, you may be let down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Report on the First Forty Minutes of "Walk the Line" by Jimmy HumphreyJohnny Cash had a mean dad and a good brother that he loved. His brother was going to be someone special, but died cutting some wood that Johnny was supposed to help with. Johnny's dad was so mean that he made them pick cotton in 100 degree heat. He also yelled and said that the Lord had taken the wrong son. Johnny's mom was nice and smart and he learned to sing from her. Then, Johnny went into the Air Force and had a mean Sergeant. He took his guitar, though, and wrote some songs. People think Johnny is weird but he married a girl he liked and moved to Memphis to sit on the porch and play music with two guys he knows. His wife thought he wasn't very good and wanted him to stop trying to sell samples door-to-door, stop playing on the porch and move to San Antonio to work for her dad. So, Johnny went to this record making store he saw on the street and told the wise, 30-year-old guy running it that he shouldn't have to pay $4 to make a record. The record guy listened to Johnny and his two friends and said he can't sell gospel but that he can sell music made by someone who was hit by a car and wrote a song telling God what he thought which is music that saves people. Then, Johnny sang a song that he wrote in the Air Force about being in Folsom prison and shooting a guy just to watch him die. He didn't sound very good to me, but he came home and said that they made a record. Johnny always started playing by saying "Hello, I'm Johnny Cash" and then people would clap. Johnny was making enough money to buy his wife her dream house and a car. His wife was mean, though, and wanted Johnny to be at home and out making money at the same time which is impossible, so Johnny ended up liking this very pretty girl who was funny and who got caught on his strap earlier.In the end I think Johnny married the second pretty girl and was famous for singing good songs and singing a song in prison.The End.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is the most boring film i have ever seen in my 15 years of existence, I only watched because me and my English class were forced to by deaf dumb blind guy called Mr Shay had never even heard of Johny cash before this film but it still was just about a boring signing , why couldn't they make the film about jerry lewis or Elvis, the only good bit was wen they were on screen that was the only excitement in the whole of the film because Johny's songs were really slow and boring the high moments were when he was signing with June carter and when he pulled the sink off the wall, but the worst thing was that the other English set got to review King Kong because their DVD didn't work</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a known fact that director James Mangold makes great movies. With "Cop Land" he set a new standard for cop films and with "Identity" he blew us away. Now he takes on the life of one of musics most influential icons, Johhny Cash.First off Mangold cast moody actor Joaquin Phoenix as Cash. Phoenix's performance as Cash is so convincing, you think you're watching the real Johnny Cash. As for Reese Witherspoon, she took on the role of June Carter the longtime love interest of Johnny Cash. Reese is so incredible in this movie, especially as she trades one liners back and forth with Joaquin.The only flaw in the movie is the plot, that's been done so many times in movies. Instead of showing a unique look into the wild life of the famed singer, director James Mangold instead has made a movie about fame and drug addiction. By ignoring actual events that happened in Cash's life, this movie just comes out looking like another watered down studio flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He sounds like Johhny Cash...so what.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK let me start this review off saying that the performances by the two leads were excellent, and they got the sound of the music down, which was wasn't easy to do considering they did all of their own singing. However, once I got over that fact (and it didn't take me that long since there is lots of singing in the movie) I wasn't too impressed. The plot in my opinion is pretty boring, especially considering the run time of nearly 2 and a half hours. It basically follows the standard rock star story of break out success followed by dysfunction at home, womanizing, and of course booze and drugs. How will this one end? Will Cash sober up and get the girl just in time for the happy Hollywood ending? I'm not gonna say, you'll just have to see it for yourself. *wink* Whether this movie portrays the life and times of Johnny Cash accurately I can't say, since I'm not really a fan of his. And in fact I will probably never be able to say, because "Walk the Line" doesn't make me interested enough to find out. I'd recommend this movie for fans of Johhny Cash (obviously) and for people interested in that genre of music in general. "Walk the Line" is full of singing and I imagine if this style of music was my cup of tea I'd be giving this movie a better rating but as stands a 5-6 is the best I can do. What more can I say, I realize the actors are delivering on their end, but the story and really the title character himself give me little reason to care. All and all another critically overrated movie with a recycled plot and a tedious run time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie touched my heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew some things of Johnny Cash but this movie really makes you see things from his perspective. I caught a pre-screening of this movie and absolutely loved it. People in the theatre were singing and laughing and feeling his pain. Surely their was more that could have been included, like his faith or some of his more famous songs, but it told his life story. How can you sum up a man's life in a couple of hours any way? I am glad that others will have a chance to see him and know him, even if they didn't know who he was until now. This movie was worth buying! Also Reece and Joaquin does an absolutely great job at singing his songs and really getting into character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slightly disappointed that i was slightly disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, finally saw this movie that I was so looking forward to seeing for a long time, and I can't really point out one specific problem, except maybe I thought they should've included where Johnny wanders into Nickajack Cave when he's finally at the end of his rope with his addiction. I guess after reading the biography, I pretty much knew what to expect and there were no real revelations...that said, I thought Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job portraying the Man In Black, and Reese Witherspoon played June Carter really well. I just found the whole presentation kind of boring unfortunately. So my point is if you've already read the definitive biography, then there is really no need to watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another film to jump on the bandwagon...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, I was busy the night of the Academy Award's, but when I was told of the Oscars that "Walk the Line" had won, I was appalled. My initial reaction was "How is that possible! It was just 'Ray' with white people!". Surprisingly, it had been referred to as such at the awards ceremony. This movie really does follow the basic pattern that Ray did. If this movie came out before Ray or maybe 10 or so years after, it may have been appreciated, but this movie gives off a flair of being produced for the sole reason of imitating a successful, previous, better movie, Ray. Not to be offensive towards Reese Withersppon, I admit she is a wonderful actress, but she cannot be taken seriously in this role. I would get emotionally involved with Pheonix's character, and then I would be interrupted by our favorite ditz from Legally Blonde. Terribly sorry for all those who do not appreciate this review or feel otherwise about the movie. This comment is not intended to offend any of you, it is merely intended to say some bad choices were made in the execution of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phoenix and Witherspoon deliver career best performances as Johnny Cash and June Carter in this well-acted biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WALK THE LINE (2005) *** Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, Ginnifer Goodwin, Robert Patrick, Shelby Lynne, Dallas Roberts, Dan John Miller, Larry Bagby, Tyler Hilton, Waylon Payne, Shooter Jennings. Phoenix and Witherspoon deliver career best performances as Johnny Cash and June Carter in this well-acted biopic from filmmaker James Mangold (who co-scripted with Gill Dennis, the screenplay adaptation based on Cash's two autobiographies) focusing on the iconic singer/songwriter struggling to find a voice, battling pill popping addictions and the stormy courtship of Carter. The excellent leads do their own singing (both never have doing so professionally before!) with inspired results in spite of the film's meandering along thru Cash's 1968 penultimate comeback performance at Folsom Prison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable for the music and performances, but not for originality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reese Witherspoon should win an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of June Carter, the wife of country/pop legend Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) in Walk the Line, the biography of Cash until the two married. Director James Mangold takes no chances with this biopic: Cash is as we knew him: hard driving, substance abusive, womanizing, and one of the most talented musicians of the 20th century. Because the same could be said of Ray Charles in last year's Ray, both the lives of some great entertainers and the films that depict them could be considered formulas no one dares to tamper with. It's tough to earn an A in this genre for originality.Phoenix does a credible job imitating Cash although the screenplay offers little insight into how he developed his style or why he was abusive to himself and Carter; however it does play ad nauseam the conflict between Cash and his tight-fisted father, Ray (Robert Patrick). Phoenix has down Cash's signature roll with his guitar and more famously the basso greeting to each audience, "Hello, I'm Johnny Cash."Would that Mangold had spent more time with Cash and Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), the Sun Records mogul, who weaned Cash from gospel into music from his heart. As it is, we have one tryout session, enough to make me want much more of that creative molding. The Folsom Prison sequence captures the gritty and humane side of Cash, who not only thought this was the best audience on the tour but also empathized with their bad boy backgrounds. Too much time is spent watching Cash fall and then rise again?enough already, I get the idea within 5 minutes. And would that we could have more of Witherspoon and Phoenix singing together; they may not be as good as Cash and Carter, but they surely are electric enough to hold my delighted attention. In whole, Walk the Line is enjoyable for the music and performances, but not for originality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The actors do not look like...or sound like...the people that they are portraying. I was bored from the the start until I stopped watching it after, on or about, 45 minutes. This movie is a testimony to the masses' craving for mediocrity. I am a fan of the Johnny and June Carter Cash. The film, Angels with Angles, has a tremondous performance by Frank Gorshin. He portrays George Burns flawlessly. It is too bad that Gorshin was not part of a well publicized film like Walk the Line, or that Burns-mania is not currently a trend. Angels with Angles is not very good...but Gorshin is. If they are going to hand out award nominations to actors portraying iconic dead people..then Gorshin should have been nominated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great Hollywood love story with the South glossed over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a chance to see a pre-screening of Walk the Line a few days ago. Ultimately, it was a solid Hollywood film with great performances by Reece Witherspoon &amp; Joaquin Phoenix. Yet, being a die-hard Johnny Cash fan from Arkansas, I was hoping for more on his development as a musician &amp; struggle with his Christian faith. His faith in God &amp; roots in gospel music carried him from childhood throughout his career. Johnny Cash made scores of records recalling scripture &amp; hymns he found solace in his darkest hours. If you want to understand the context of his conflicts, you simply cannot leave faith out of the equation. I was left in want for the texture of the South which I grew up in, where people are as in touch with their surroundings as they are with themselves. In the film, Undertow, there's a beautiful three minute monologue about chiggers as a child sits barefoot on a riverbank. Perhaps taking cues from Terence Malick, John Boorman or David Gordon Green might have helped capture the subtlety which could have made this film truly great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phoenix Painful in "Walk the Line"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comparing "Walk the Line" to "Ray", is comparing night to day. Both are biopics of famous singers with troubled pasts, but the similarities end there. Phoenix's singing is akin to fingernails going down a chalkboard. Witherspoon saves what little is good in the film. Phoenix's acting is palpable, but as an entertainer, Cash was a singer, not an actor. As a Johnny Cash fan, listening to the music in this movie is arduous. Phoenix couldn't carry a tune in a bucket and fails miserably to hit any of Cash's famous low, soul gripping notes. Why the studio didn't dub over Phoenix as did Universal in most of "Ray" is truly dumbfounding. Foxx sang a few songs but for the most part, gave way to the authentic Ray Charles. The irony is, Foxx can sing. Phoenix butchers the Man in Black's warmly cold, rumbling deep sounds that made Cash legendary. When Sam Phillips of Sun Records asks "Cash" in the movie "if (he) only had one song to sing, what would it be," Phoenix lumbers into a drolling off-key rendition of Folsom Prison as could only be worsened by American Idol's William Hung.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biggest Miscast of a Biopic in Movie History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although there were a few touching moments, this biopic would have been infinitely better if there were different actors in the lead roles. I don't know who, but definitely NOT Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who just tried too darn hard in this film. Although Joaquin Phoenix gave it his best shot, he just didn't have Johnny's look. As for Reese Witherspoon, she's been in too many perky blonde girl movies that this one just made her a perky brunette and she got to pout a little. If this is the best that Hollywood had to offer in recreating the legend that is Johnny Cash from an actors point of view, then the movie industry is in a whole lot of hurt. Oscar Contender? In this year of generally crappy movies, why not? Hollywood wonders why that they're having such a bad year at the box office. Walk the Line is a prime reason why. This is a serious picture, Oscar Worthy Picture? C'mon!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be hard to imagine a movie dealing with the life of Johnny Cash as being a disappointment to me, but this one was. First and foremost, I found it incredibly boring. The movie lacks the pace and interest of other movies of this kind, like Ray for instance. Secondly, the movie was "all over the place" and made it somewhat difficult to ascertain how much time had passed, etc. Finally, instead of being treated to dolby digital renditions of Johnny Cash, we get "treated" to the off-key tones of Joaquin Phoenix! Why the director decided to do this is a complete mystery to me. Maybe he wanted to demonstrate how his "genius" does not depend on a great soundtrack.- Jack</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good performances, unoriginal biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to a screening of this movie at "The Toronto Film Festival" in anticipation of seeing something wonderful based on all the early reviews of this film....particularly for the performance of Joaquin Phoenix. The film begins with Cash getting ready for his performance at Fulsom prison in the late 60's and we then proceed to the telling of his story with a formulaic flashback to his childhood ... proceeding thru his career, marriage and relationship with June Carter. The storytelling and direction is unoriginal. Within the confines of the story this movie was trying to tell...I felt that the director could have shown us some moments of brilliance or originality...but chose a very conventional style instead.As for the performances....Joaquin does some good acting here but for the most part a "one note" performance. He does an admirable job at singing the Cash songs but I felt the film should have kept the original recordings since Cash had such a signature style and I found it hard to accept Joaquin singing them. I think lip-syncing like Foxx did in Ray would have worked better. The best performance of this film belongs to Reese Witherspoon. Her performance as June Carter is charming and she shines in every scene she is in. I was pleasantly surprised. I am positive she will get a nomination for an Oscar for this role and she has enough screen time for the lead category. Reese and Joaquin as Carter and Cash have a wonderful chemistry. The interaction and dialogue between these two was very enjoyable. Overall good performances in an unoriginal formulaic biopic.</fullReview>
